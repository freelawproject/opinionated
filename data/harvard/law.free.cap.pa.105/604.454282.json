The defendant further claimed title in himself to the soil of the alleged alley, under a deed from one Luokenbaeh (an owner of the entire tract prior to Augustus Wolle\u2019s title), dated March 5, 1880 (not recorded), conveying to him a certain lot of ground, \u201c together with a certain sixteen feet wide alley, running from the Lehigh Valley Railroad along a lot of land originally granted by said Luokenbaeh to Levin Peisert, but now owned by said Reuben Transue, southwardly to Second street.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-7\">The defendant offered to show that the disputed alley had never appeared upon the borough maps and books of South Bethlehem.

Your duty will be limited to the simple \u2019 inquiry whether or not the alley which the plaintiff alleges he is entitled to is the alley which it seems to be admitted here was the place obstructed by the defendant. If you find that these obstructions were erected by the defendant, and there seems to be no dispute on that point, upon this alley, and if you find from the evidence that this alley belonged to the plaintiff in such a way as entitled him to pass and repass over it, and he was prevented from passing and repassing over it by reason of the obstructions, then, I say to you, it will be your duty to render a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for what are called nominal damages \u2014 six cents damages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-10\">The defendant presented, inter alia, the following point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-11\">1. \u201cThe easement of which the plaintiff says he was deprived is not an easement by grant, but by implication arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>out of a boundary in bis deed and a dedication to .public use, evidenced by the map referred to in plaintiff\u2019s deed, and an easement of which neither plaintiff nor his predecessors in title have ever been in possession. . In other words, if it exists at all it was never opened; was used in common with other lands of the defendant, and is a mere paper alley.\u201d Answer\u2014 Not affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-5\">The court charged' the jury, inter alia: \u201c Now I say to you that under these two deeds, the plaintiff is entitled to an alley on the eastern boundary of his lots. Whether it is a public or private alley is a matter of no concern. He is entitled by virtue of the covenants in these deeds to an alley on the eastern end.of his lots. The question for you to determine is whether this alley to the use of which he is entitled under these deeds is the alley which the defendant has obstructed, if you find such to be the fact then your verdict will be in favor of the plaintiff for six cents damages, and that will end the suit. In determining the question whether the alley referred to in these two deeds is the alleyupon which these obstructions exist, you will take into consideration the deeds themselves, as well as the other deeds that have been offered in evidence, together with this draft or plot that you see here rolled upon the table, if that will throw any light on the subject, as it may, provided you find that it is a genuine plot of the propert3r in dispute......You will have the draft before you, and if satisfied of its correctness you will take that draft in connection with these deeds, and locate this alley if you can, and if you locate it so as to bring these obstructions upon it, then, as I have already said, your verdict will be in favor of the plaintiff. .....That is all j-ou have to pass upon; you will leave out everything else in 3,,our consideration of the case and confine your deliberations simply to the inquiry I have indicated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-9\">Verdict for plaintiff for six cents damages, and judgment thereon.

It was error to allow plaintiff to go on with his case without producing the original, or accounting for its absence; still more to allow him to put in.evidence one which he admitted to be different: Birmingham <em>v. </em>Anderson, 12 Wright, 253; Noonan <em>v. </em>Lee, 2 Black, 504; Glover <em>v. </em>Shields, 32 Barb., 379; Parker v.

F. S., 17. We should have been allowed to show by the borough maps that this alley, which plaintiff in his declaration claimed to own \u201c in common with all the owners of other lots abutting on said alley,\u201d had never been recognized or known publicly as having any existence: Spackman <em>v. </em>Steidel, 7 Norris, 453.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b627-4\"><em>Robert L. </em>Cope, for defendant in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArQK\">The map sent to the jury was proved to be the one which Wolle used to sell lots from. It was never claimed to be the one called for in the deed, and was merely submitted as any other draft of the locality would have been. Only one of the deeds to plaintiff\u2019s three lots contained any reference to a plan. A right of way is implied in a grant of laud described as bounded on an alley or street. This right cannot be lost by disuse or non-user: Spackman <em>v. </em>Steidel, 7 Norris, 453 ; Crow <em>v. </em>Wolbert, 7 Phila., 178; Van Meter <em>v. </em>Hankinson, 6 Wharton, 307; Cope <em>v. </em>Grant, 7 Barr, 491; Erb <em>v. </em>Brown, 19 P. F. S., 216; Waite on Actions and Defences, vol. 6, p. 348. The rights of the parties as between themselves could not be affected by the borough maps.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b627-5\">Chief Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"AIx\">delivered the opinion of the court, March 24, 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">It is well settled law that on the sale of a lot bounded by a street, the title passes to the centre of the street, if the grantor had title to the land covered thereby, unless he reserved it either expressly or by clear implication. Paul <em>v. </em>Carver, 2 Casey, 223; Cox <em>v. </em>Freedley, 9 Casey, 124; Trutt <em>v. </em>Spotts, 6 Norris, 339; Spackman <em>v. </em>Steidel, 7 Norris, 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">When one, who is the proprietor of the portion of the town in which the lands lie, sells and conveys the lots according to a plan which shows them to be on a street or alley, it creates an implied covenant of the existence of the street or alley. Trutt <em>v. </em>Spotts, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">When Wolle laid out the plan of lots on the alley now in contention, he was the undoubted owner of the land covered thereby. When he sold and conveyed the lots according to the plan and bounded them on the alley, he not only conveyed the xrse of the alley as appurtenant to the lots bounded thereon, but he thereby dedicated it to public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">In this case the evidence is clear that the grantor made a plan, and by it sold lots. The omission to produce the draft on the trial under the other evidence was not error. ' The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>jury has found the true location of the <em>alley to </em>be as claimed by the defendant in error. It was actually opened and used for several years, as a public, alley. The fact that it was not entered on the books or maps of the borough of South Bethlehem, was unimportant to the rights of the parties in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">. The defendant in error showed title derived from Wolle, and was entitled to all the rights, privileges and appurtenances flowing from his deed of conveyance. Thus holding, the defendant in error had a right to the free and uninterrupted use of the alley. The plaintiff in error had acquired no right from any person by grant or conveyance to obstruct the alley, but sought to protect himself from liability by proving diflfer.ent and disconnected acts of trespass extending over parts of several years. All the evidence was clearly insufficient to establish any right to obstruct the alley under the statute of limitations, or to bar the public character which had been stamped thereon by the former owner of the land. The assignments are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
