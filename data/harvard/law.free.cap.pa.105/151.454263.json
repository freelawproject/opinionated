Burke.\u201d Defendant filed the following affidavit of defence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-14\">\u201c That she is now and was at the time of the issuing of the summons in this case, a married woman, tiie wife of Joseph E. Burke, to whom she was married on the 4th October, 1860, and that she has lived and cohabited with him as his wife ever since. That this deponent is not now and never has been declared a feme sole trader, and is not now and never was such.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-15\">Plaintiff took a rule to show cause why judgment should not be entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, which the court made absolute, whereupon the defendant took this writ of error, assigning for error the said judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-16\"><em>W.

It was in that capacity only that a recovery against her was sought.1 Her husband was not joined with her in the action. Her affidavit of defence avers, inter alia, that she was then, and at the time of the issuing of the summons a married woman, \u2019the wife of Joseph E. Burke, to whom she was married oh the 4th of October, 1860, and that she had lived and cohabited with him as his wife ever since. She further averred \u201cthat this deponent is not now and never has been declared a feme sole trader, and is not now and never was such.\u201d This certainly is a positive and distinct denial of the existence of the alleged fact, on which the right to recover against her was based. If there be any other it is not averred in the pleadings. Whether some other grounds may be shown on the trial to maintain the action, is a question not now before us. When an affidavit of defence distinctly and unequivocally denies the fact, without which a recovery cannot be had, the court should not hold it insufficient. This affidavit does so deny such a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">It follows the learned Judge erred in ordering a judgment to be entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Judgment reversed and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
