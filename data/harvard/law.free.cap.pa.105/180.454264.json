Sommers, Dr. H. Yale Smith and ten others were duly elected to serve until March 26th, T883. At the regular meeting of the vestry held June 13,1882, there was a vacancy caused by the death of Smith. The remaining eleven vestrymen were present, and Rev. Henry R. Percival, the rector, presided. William A. Chew and Robert H. Neil-son were nominated to fill.the vacancy. Six of the vestrymen voted for Chew, while the remaining five, with the rector, voted for Neilson. A tie thus resulting, the <em>rector </em>claimed the right to cast the deciding vote for Neilson, which he did, and declared him elected; Chew, however, took his seat as a member of the vestry and Neilson did not. The rector and four other' members of the vestry thereafter absented themselves from all meetings held by the remaining members.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-15\">Subsequently William J. Mullin, another member of the vestry died, and Benjamin Bickerton was elected by the acting members in his place. At a stated meeting held February 13, 1883, eight members of the acting vestry, including Chew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>and Bickerton, were present, and elected Brown, Tomlin and Bickerton, judges of the election for vestrymen to be held on Easter Monday, March 26th, 1883. Bickerton afterwards declined to act, and one C. P. Fowler was appointed in bis place. The election was accordingly held on March 26th, 1883, conducted by the above named judges. Twenty ballots were cast for the complainants. After the polls closed the judges announced that the complainants together with Joseph Hilferty and Joseph W. Tittermary, were duly elected vestrymen for the term of one year from March 26th, 1883.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-4\">Upon the same day, at the place of the above election, the rector\u2019s warden, \u2014 having given notice (under Art.

Baum\u2019s Rights and Duties of Rectors, etc., 76; Cripp\u2019s Law of the Church and Clergy, 804; Blunt\u2019s Book of Church Law, 296; Hoffman\u2019s Ecclesiastical Law in New York, 79. But the contention that the rector had no right to vote at all cannot be sustained. The right of the rector to vote at a vestry meeting is the law of the Episcopal church, without <em>any </em>exception, in the states or countries which recognize the law of the church as binding in such matters. Baum on the Rights of Rectors and Vestrymen, 75; Richey\u2019s Churchman\u2019s Handbook, section 61 and note; Hoffman\u2019s Law of Church in New York, 79, 80, 81. Nor can the charter and by-laws of this church he so construed as to change this law, on the ground that under them the rector is not a vestryman. Art. HI., of the charter, provides that the temporal affairs of the congregation shall be under the management of the rector, church wardens and vestrymen. Art. V., after referring to the qualifications for electors, provides that the vestrymen shall continue in office until others are chosen, aud shall have authority to fill vacancies in their own body. But this latter provision that the \u201cvestrymen\u201d shall have authority to fill vacancies in their own body does not take - away the rector's right to vote as a member of the body, for should this be the case the ehurch wardens, who are members of the vestry, would also be deprived of a vote, and this has never been alleged. The court below held that the rector, though an \u201c essential part of the vestry, is in no sense a vestryman; \u201d and \u201c the rector, though a member of the body termed the vestry, is in no sense a vestryman, nor is he entitled to perform the functions of a member of the vestry, which the charter restricts to the vestrymen alone.\u201d It may be that the rector does not become a member of the vestry from the fact of his being a member of the corporation; but it is incomprehensible that he should be a \u201c member of the vestry \u201d and yet not have the rights of a \u201c vestryman.\u201d The manner in which the corporation has interpreted this provision is shown in Article II., section 4, of the by-laws: \u201c The <em>vestry </em>shall have power to fill all vacancies that may occur in their own body.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABS\">The rector, then, having the right to one vote, the ballots east for Chew and Neilson were equally divided, and there was no election. There could, therefore, have been no quorum of the vestry at any meeting held after June 13, 1882, because the withdrawal of the rector and four members of the vestry left only six legally elected vestrymen, and seven were required by the by-laws to make a quorum. All proceedings at the so-called vestry meetings after that date were therefore void. The question here is not one within the juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>diction of a court of chancery. The proper procedure would have been quo warranto.

Henry Williams </em>(with whom was <em>Amos </em>Briggs), for the appellees. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABx\">The rector, although a member of the corporation, is not a \u201c vestryman,\u201d and Art. V., of the charter, restricts the right to vote, at least upon the filling of a vacancy in the vestry, to those who are elected by the voters of the corporation. Three judges of election were \u201cappointed\u201d by the vestry, and upon the withdrawal of one another was appointed in his place. Until the vestry failed to appoint, the warden had no right to do so. The poll held by the three judges having been legal, there was no necessity for a new election. The plaintiffs were, therefore, de facto vestrymen, were in possession, and as the defendants sought to interfere with the exercise of their rights as vestrymen, they were clearly entitled to the equitable jtirisdietion of the court. Tidewater Pipe Company <em>v. </em>Satterfield, 12 <em>W. </em>N. C., 457, affirmed by the Supreme Court, in Satterfield\u2019s appeal, decided May 21, 1883.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b202-5\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"A5q\">delivered the opinion of the court, February 4, 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">It was conceded by the learned Judge below that if this bill had presented the question of the legality of the election of vestrymen it could not be sustained. He held, however, that the plaintiffs below-having shown a prima facie right to the office which they claim, the case comes within the provisions of the Act of 13th June, 1836, which confers on the Courts of Common Pleas the supervision and control of corporations, as well as of unincorporated associations and societies, and that pending any contest growing out of said election, the plaintiffs have the right to invoke the equity powers of the court to restrain their adversaries from interfering with their right to act as de facto vestrymen.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Assuming, for the purposes of this case, the position above stated to be correct, we will consider how far the plaintiffs are \u201c apparently at least in the right,\u201d .and the defendants \u201c apparently in the wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The second and third assignments of error raise the only questions which, in our view of the case, require discussion. The second alleges that the court erred in holding that the rector lia.d no power to vote upon the question of filling the vacancy occasioned by the death of H. Yale Smith ; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>second, that the court erred in holding that William A. Chew was elected vestryman of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The second assignment is involved in the first. This will be understood when it is stated that the rector\u2019s vote, if received, creates a tie, and that its rejection as illegal by the court below gave to Mr. Chew a majority of one over Mr. Neilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The election to fill the vacancy created by the death of Mr. Smith was participated in by the eleven surviving vestrymen and the rector. Six of the vestrymen voted- for Mr. Chew ; the other five and the rector voted for Mr. Neilson. This made a tie, whereupon the rector claimed and exercised the right of giving an additional vote in favor of Mr. Neilson. This right, although claimed in good faith, and not without some color of authority in the Episcopal church, cannot be sustained. This was conceded upon the argument, and need not be discussed. It is manifest Mr. Neilson was not elected to fill the vacancy referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The learned court below was clearly right in bolding that the rector bad not the right to vote twice, but the denial of the rector\u2019s right to vote at all is not so apparent. The position of the learned court upon this point is tersely stated as follows: \u201c But the rector, though a member of the body termed the vestry, is in no sense a vestryman, nor is he entitled to perform the functions as a member of the body, which the charter restricts to the vestrymen alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">It is not necessary to consider the practice of the English church, nor even the general rule in the Episcopal chnreh of this country \u2014 though it is believed the latter at least is not in accord with the rule as laid down by the court below \u2014 for the reason that the question before us is one of power in the charter. The third article of said charter provides that \u201cThe temporal affairs of this corporation shall be under the management of a vestry, to he composed of the rector, church wardens and vestrymen chosen in the manner hereinafter provided, who shall have power,\u201d &amp;c. The fifth article provides how they shall be chosen. It says: \u201c The rector of this church shall be elected by the church wardens and vestrymen in such manner as the statutes and by-laws shall ordain. The vestry of said church shall consist of twelve persons who shall he</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">elected on Easter Monday, <em>.....Provided, </em>That in case</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">of the failure to elect vestrymen on that day, the corporation shall not on that account be dissolved, but the election shall be holden on some other day in such manner as the by-laws shall prescribe. The vestrymen continuing in office until others are chosen, and having authority to fill vacancies in their own body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>It will thus be seen that the' vestry is composed of the rector, church wardens and vestrymen. The vestrymen consist of twelve persons who are elected on Easter Monday; the two church wardens are selected from the vestrymen. The rector being therefore an essential part of the vestry, what is there in the charter of this church to prohibit his voting at any meeting of that body? Unless such prohibition can be found, such right cannot be denied. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"Abn\">It was contended that because the fifth article declares that \u201c the vestry of said church shall consist of twelve persons who shall be elected on Easter Monday,\u201d and that said vestrymen shall have \u201c authority to fill vacancies in their own body,\u201d the rector had no right to vote infilling any such vacancy. The fifth article was not intended to conflict with the third article, which declares who shall compose the vestry. The word \u201cvestry\u201d in the fifth article was plainly intended to designate the number of vestrymen and provide for their election on Easter Monday. The article prescribes the manner of their election, and the qualifications of voters. This view is strengthened by the fact that neither the rector nor church wardens are referred to in the fifth article as belonging to the vestry, while they are expressly designated as members of the vestry by the third article.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">But it is said the vestrymen, and not the vestry, are to fill all vacancies in their own body, and as this was the case of such vacancy the rector could not vote. The fifth article standing alone might seem to favor such a construction, but when we turn to the eighth article we find that \u201cThe vestry, or a majority of them, shall and may convene from time to time, and make such and so many rules, by-laws, ordinances and regulations as they may deem expedient for the good government and support of the church, and shall have power to fill all vacancies in their own body.\u201d When we examine the bylaws which the vestry have made in pursuance of this power, we find in article second, section 21, the following: \u201c The vestry shall have power to fill all vacancies that may occur in their own body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">. We therefore regard it as entirely clear that it is the vestry as a whole, and not the twelve vestrymen as a portion of the vestry, that'have the power under the charter and by-laws- of this church, to fill vacancies in that body, and as the right of the rector as a member thereof to vote is not denied by the charter or the law of the church, he was entitled at the election for vestryman occasioned by the death of Mr. Smith, to vote for Mr. Eeilson. This made a tie, and neither Mr. Neilson nor Mr. Chew was elected. As the election for twelve vestrymen on Easter Monday, 1883, depends for its validity to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>considerable extent upon whether Mr. Neilson or Mr. Chew was elected to fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Smith's death, it is evident the plaintiffs have no such apparent right to act as vestrymen as entitles them to the interference of a court of equity. The whole difficulty can and probably will be settled ou the ensuing Easter Monday, when it is hoped wise counsels will prevail and the just rights of all parties be respected.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The decree is reversed, and the hill dismissed at the costs of the appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
