Haworth et al. from a decree of the said court, overruling their exceptions to the report of a commissioner appointed in the matter of a petition of Lydia Dover, deciding that certain land in possession of the appellants was subject to a testamentary charge, under the will of David Ditlow, deceased, for the support of said Lydia Dover, and requiring the appellants to pay a certain sum to the representatives of said Lydia Dover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-13\">The petition of Lydia Dover set forth that her father, David Ditlow, deceased, by his will, devised, inter alia, as follows : .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u201cItem 7. It is my will, and I do hereby order, give and bequeath unto my granddaughter, Marion Dover, a child of my daughter Lydia, all the remainder of my real estate that may be left unsold or remains by my wife Mary after her decease forever, (except and reserve five acres of land will be mentioned in Item eight,) the said Marion' shall support and maintain her said mother during her natural life, if she should come into circumstances that she cannot support or provide for herself; and further, in case the said Marion shall die without lawful heirs, then the above mentioned real estate shall go to her lawful brothers and sisters, and he or they shall his or their mother on the above said support or maintenance provide for her.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\">That said Marion has since died, leaving a husband, William It.

Haworth et ah, and referred the matter to a commissioner (John Rupp, Esq.,) who filed his report, holding that the provision in the seventh item of David Ditlow\u2019s will for the support of Lydia Dover, was a charge on the lands thereby devised to Marion Dover, and recommending a decree that the respondents, being the present owners of the said premises, pay to the petitioner the sum of $1,375, for her support and maintenance up to the time of making the report, and the further sum of $4.50 per week for her future maintenance and the costs of the proceeding; or in default thereof that the said premises be sold for the purpose of paying the same,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">The petitioner died one month after the filing of the commissioner\u2019s report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">Exceptions filed to said report by William R.

There must be something more, \u2014 express words or necessary implication from the whole will that such was the intention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">There are no words in this will which amount to an express charge upon the land. There is a devise to Marion Dover and a direction that she shall provide a support for her mother if she shall need it. This is no stronger than the words of the will in Hamilton <em>v. </em>Porter, 13 P. F. S., 332: \u201cI will that S. H. H. is to take the land and pay $700 to each \u00f3f my within named heirs,\u201d or in Buchanan\u2019s Appeal, 22 P. F. S., 448, where the devise was to W., \u201che paying the legacies,\u201d in both of which cases this court held that there was no charge upon the land, in Cable\u2019s Appeal, supra, the testator devised his farm to his two sons, John and Edward, but they \u201care to pay \u201d added the* testator, certain specified legacies to his four daughters, and they \u201care to find a house for my wife Sarah and daughter Harriet and keep and clothe them, also, to provide for them everything that is necessary for their comfort as long as they shall live or remain unmarried.\u201d It was held by this court that this did not amount to a charge upon the land, but was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>mere personal charge upon the sons in case they accepted the devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">So far the case is free from difficulty. It was urged how-' ever that the last portion of the above recited paragraph of the will shows an intention on the part of the testator to create a charge running with the land. It is true the will provides that in case the said Marion shall die without lawful heirs, the real estate in question shall go to her lawful brothers and sisters \u201c and he or they shall his or their mother on the above said support or maintenance provided for her.\u201d The\u00ae language quoted is obscure, and its meaning can only be arrived at by supplying words not contained in the will.. But conceding the construction claimed for it by the appellees, does it amount to a charge upon the land? Does it impose any burden upon the land in the hands of the brothers and sisters in case of Marion's death without lawful heirs, that was not imposed upon it during Marion\u2019s lifetime ? It is clear from all the authorities that as to Marion it was a mere personal charge in case she accepted the devise. We regard it as equally clear that the testator intended by the devise to her brothers and sisters that the latter should take the land precisely as Marion held it, viz., subject to a personal charge for their mother\u2019s support. They would have been personally liable for such support had they taken the land under the devise. It was easy for the testatpr to have expressly charged this land for Lydia Dover\u2019s support if he had intended it. He did not do so, and we are of opinion that no such charge results by necessary implication from his will. To create a charge upon land, we must have something better than a guess or mere possibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Marion Dover having died leaving a husband and children surviving her, the brothers and sisters never took under the will. The charge being personal as to Marion, ceased at her death, and cannot be enforced against the land in the hands of her heirs. This renders a discussion of the remaining questions unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The decree is reversed and the petition dismissed at the costs of the appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
