These letters and the receipt are set forth at length in the. opinion of this court. It appeared that there was a tract in said township known as the Jacob Rush tract, which had been sold for taxes on June 10, 1872, to one Primer, the proper redemption money of which was $2.62 less than the amount required to redeem the Jacob Myer tract. There was no evidence as to who was the owner of the Jacob Rush tract at the time of the treasurer\u2019s sale. The treasurer retained the redemption money received from Hollinger until September 15, 1873, when he paid it to Pruner, and then marked the Jacob Rush tract redeemed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the redemption book.

The defendant took this writ of error, assigning for error the rejection of his offer of evidence, as above, and the action of the court in directing a verdict for the plaintiff, instead of submitting to the jury to find, as a question of fact, whether under all the circumstances of the case Hollinger had not actually, by payment of his money, redeemed the land in dispute from the tax sale made June 10,1872.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-8\"><em>Beaver (jGrephart </em>with him), for the plaintiff in error. \u2014 -</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aygz\">There can be no doubt that Hollinger intended to redeem the Jacob Meyer tract, and paid the exact redemption money required to do so. That his clerk made a mistake in the name, and that the treasurer applied the redemption money to another tract, does not affect his equity arising out of the fact of payment, and it is well settled that in ejectment, which in Pennsylvania is an equitable action, he .may set up his equity to defeat a legal title. Peebles <em>v. </em>Reading, 8 S. &amp; R., 484; Bubb <em>v. </em>Tompkins, 47 Pa. St., 359. The court erred in rejeeti g our offer to show that the plaintiff was not a bona fide purchaser without notice of the defendant\u2019s claim of title. In connection with our offer, the peculiar wording of the assignment from the purchaser at the tax sale to the plaintiff was sufficient to take the case to the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-9\"><em>J.

A purchaser, with or without notice, takes such title as his vendor had, which in this case was a perfect title, even though such vendor had knowledge of defendant\u2019s claim: Bracken <em>v. </em>Miller, 4 W. &amp; S., 102; Meehan <em>v. </em>Williams, 48 Pa. St., 238. Equity will relieve against mutual mistake, but here the mistake, if any, was that of Hollinger alone. He may have owned the Jacob Rush tract, \u2014 there is no evidence as to that, \u2014 and may have intended to redeem it. Whether or not, a secret intention to redeem one tract where another tract is in fact redeemed, cannot operate to defeat the legal title of the purchaser of the tract intended to be redeemed, after the limitation of the time for redemption has expired: Stephens <em>v. </em>Wells, 6 Watts, 325; Taylor <em>v. </em>Commissioners, 3 Pa. Rep., 112. There being no disputed facts, and the plaintiff having made out his case, the court was right in directing a verdict.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Axi\">Mr. Justice Green</author>\n<p id=\"AYs\">delivered the opinion of the court, October 6, 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We would gladly relieve the defendant in this case from his dilemma, if it were possible to do so. But we are quite unable to discover any method bj*- which this can be done, consistently with legal requirements which are so plain and so directly applicable to the undisputed facts of the case, that they can not be disregarded. The whole case is in a nutshell. The tract of land in question, known as the \u201cJacob Meyer\u201d tract, was sold for taxes on June 10, 1872. It was purchased at the tax sale by John Irwin, Jr., who afterwards sold it to the plaintiff.' The defendant, Hollinger, was the owner of the tract at the time of the sale. His defence now is that he redeemed it within the time appointed by law. Whatever acts were done in the way of redemption were done in writing. There were no verbal communications whatever. The whole of the writings which passed between the defendant and the treasurer in connection with the alleged redemption consist of four letters and a receipt. They are as follows:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Lancaster, Pa., June 18,1872.</p>\n<p id=\"Amgu\">Treasurer oe Centre County.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\"><em>Dear Sir: </em>\u2014 Are there any taxes assessed and unpaid on my tract of coal land situated in Rush township, near Philipsburg?

Weayeb.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">The foregoing papers constitute the entire evidence as to the fact of redemption. It was proved orally that there was a tract called the \u201c Jacob Rush \u201d tract in Rush township, Centre county, and that it was sold for taxes on June 10, 1872, and also that the amount necessary to redeem it was $&gt;41.21. It is beyond all question that the papers in evidence establish an actual redemption by Hollinger of the Jacob Rush tract. His own letter remitting the check for payment of the redemption money so declares, and the treasurer\u2019s receipt, returned to him the next day, expressly states that the money was received as the redemption money of that tract. On this testimony the court directed a verdict for the plaintiff, and it is this direction which constitutes the substance of the principal assignment of error. It is contended that the court below should have left to the jury the question <em>.whose </em>mistake it was that led to the misapplication of the redemption money to the Rush tract, instead of the Meyer tract. But the difficult}'- is that there was no - evidence to send to the jury on that question. In truth it was not proved that there was any mistake in the case. Both the defendant and his clerk who wrote the letter remitting the money, were examined* as witnesses and neither of them testified that there was any mistake in the letter. Neither of them said that it was intended to pay the redemption money on the Jacob Meyer tract, or that having such an intention the \u201cJacob Rush\u201d tract was named in the letter by mistake for the \u201cJacob Meyer.\u201d They did not even testify that the defendant did not own the Rush tract, or have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>any interest in it. How then could the court leave it to the jury to say there was a mistake, when the defendant himself did not say so ? Even if it be conceded that there was an intention to redeem the Meyer tract, it is absolutely certain that no such intention was expressed, and it surely would never do for us to declare as the law, that an unexpressed intention to redeem one tract, should be permitted to confer a title by redemption, against an actually expressed intention to redeem another tract by the same redemption payment. In this case the treasurer acting upon the explicit authority of the defendant, applied the redemption money precisely as he was directed to do, to the redemption of the Jacob Rush tract. He entered the redemption of that tract upon the Redemption Book kept for that purpose, and paid the redemption money to E. J. Pruner, who had purchased the Rush tract. Certainly lie had a right to do this. Indeed he was bound to do it, and he was so bound as the direct consequence of Hollinger\u2019s own act in remitting him the money as the redemption money of the Rush tract. This consideration is intensified by the circumstance that the redemption money remained in his hands until September following its receipt in February, 1873, thus affording Hollinger the amplest opportunity to correct the mistake before the money was paid over to Pruner, the purchaser of the Rush tract. It appears then that the redemption of the Rush tract was completed by the payment of the money in question, and the written authority of the defendant. After this result has been accomplished by means of the defendant\u2019s own act, we cannot think it proper that he should be heard to say, that this same act of redemption has operated to redeem another and distinct tract, simply because he had an unexpressed intention to that effect. Titles which depended upon such indefinite and uncertain eoirditions as these would have but little value.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The case is still more serious against the defendant than the foregoing' considerations indicate. He sent the money to the treasurer on February 26, 1873, and on the 27th, the treasurer sent him a receipt in which he expressly stated that the money was received as the redemption money on the Jacob Rush tract, which had been sold for taxes to E. J. Pruner. It was certainly the duty of the defendant to read the receipt, and take notice of its contents. He at least knew whether he intended to redeem the Rush or the Meyer tract, and when he was notified that he had redeemed the Rush, he should have corrected the mistake if there was any. He had time until June 10, 1874, in which to do this, but he never did it. In such circumstances, if there are unfortunate consequences arising, first out of his own express act of negligence in giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>a mistaken direction to the treasurer, and secondly, from his own protracted omission to correct the mistake when he was distinctly and promptly notified of it, he cannot complain if he must bear those consequences. They are of his own production. The theory that the mistake might have been made or caused by the treasurer is too far-fetched for practical use. There is not a particle of evidence to support it. There is not a word in either of his letters indicating that the money was du\u00e9 on the Jacob Rush tract. The letter probably written by him on June 20, 1872, ought to be in the possession of the defendant, as it was addressed to him, but it was not produced and is not in evidence. In order to justify an inference of mistake by the treasurer, we would be obliged to assume that he wrongly stated in that letter that the Rush and not the Meyer tract was the one upon which the redemption money was due. But of course no court could make such an assumption in the absence of the letter and of any evidence of its contents, and therefore no jury could be permitted to make such a finding. Hence we see no error in the court passing upon the whole case, and directing a verdict upon all the testimony in favor of the plaintiff. There was no dispute about the facts, and all the controlling facts were evidenced by writings. The testimony offered and rejected, could not be of any moment in the cause. The plaintiff\u2019s title was good or bad, altogether independently of the matters contained in the alleged notice. It depended only on the fact of redemption, and no amount of notice could affect that fact, or its legal consequences. There was no secret trust or equity in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
