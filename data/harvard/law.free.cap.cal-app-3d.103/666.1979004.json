J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acm\">Upon his arraignment in the superior court on a charge of murdering one Larry Rutherford, petitioner Patrick Kime Gallaher, pursuant to Penal Code section 995, moved to set aside the information. The stated ground was that he had been denied the right to cross-examine his principal accuser at the preliminary examination. Upon denial of the motion by the superior court, he sought relief from this court by the extraordinary writ of prohibition, a practice approved, in a proper case, by <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 660 [94 Cal.Rptr. 289, 483 P.2d 1241], and <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 867 [59 Cal.Rptr. 440, 428 P.2d 304].</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We issued an alternative writ for the purpose of inquiring into the validity of the superior court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The relevant proceedings of Gallaher\u2019s preliminary examination, before a municipal court judge sitting as a magistrate, will reasonably be condensed to the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">One Raymond Leader had become involved in the charged offense because of circumstances from which, at least arguably, he might have been deemed an accessory to it. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 32.) At the preliminary examination\u2019s commencement it was represented by the prosecutor that Leader would be his witness, but <em>only </em>as to facts \u201cleading up to the shooting\u201d and a statement immediately thereafter made by Gallaher, after which \u201che is going to take the Fifth,...\u201d The prosecutor continued, \u201cI intend to ask no further questions of Mr. Leader other than that and I don\u2019t think that anything beyond that would be relevant.\u201d (Such a procedure would, of course, deny to Gallaher cross-examination of Leader on such otherwise relevant and material acts, declarations, conversations and events as might have happened chronologically, to have <em>followed </em>\u201cthe shooting.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Gallaher through his attorney objected to the proposed procedure, saying that such a denial of cross-examination \u201cwould be offensive to <em>due process </em>and fair play,\u201d (italics added) and that \u201cWhat went on afterwards is probative,... circumstantial, relevant and material and, respectfully, I would urge that the Fifth Amendment could not be exercised in such a fashion.\u201d No express ruling on the objection was made at the time; the magistrate simply saying, \u201cAll right. Thank you, gentlemen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Thereafter Leader was called to the witness stand. He testified substantially as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Earlier on the evening of the homicide he had been the driver of an automobile in which Gallaher and another were passengers. All had been drinking heavily. Larry Rutherford (later the victim) was the driver of another motor vehicle with one passenger. There had been cursing and threats of violence between the two cars\u2019 occupants, and more particularly between Gallaher and Rutherford. When the proprietor of the premises where the two vehicles were parked asked the men to leave, Gallaher stated \u201csomething to the effect that \u2018we are going to go down to the parking lot at the SP depot.\u2019\u201d Leader then drove his automobile to that location where Rutherford\u2019s car \u201ccut in\u201d ahead of him as he parked. The cursing and threats were renewed, and during their course Gallaher walked to the driver\u2019s window of the other vehicle. At that point Leader heard \u201ca couple or three pops\u201d after which Gallaher returned saying (as Leader \u201cthought\u201d he said), \u201cI shot him.\u201d The direct examination thereupon ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Thereafter Leader was cross-examined by Gallaher\u2019s attorney on the above described events. But then the question, \u201cYou got the car in reverse and left the area?\u201d was met with a prosecutorial objection that \u201cthis is beyond the scope of direct examination. ... \u201d The magistrate commented, \u201cThe departure from the scene was not covered, to the court\u2019s recollection, on direct examination.\u201d And the witness stated: \u201c[M]y lawyer has advised me to take the Fifth Amendment on anything past the shooting.... He just told me anything past the incidents at the car, he said, \u2018You are to take the Fifth Amendment.\u2019 And so that\u2019s what I am doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The magistrate then ruled that the question improperly exceeded the scope of the direct examination, and he indicated further that the ruling would apply to all matters chronologically following the \u201cshooting.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Then, addressing Leader, he said: \u201cIf there is any doubt about that, Mr. Leader, if there are any questions that are asked of you at this time by either of the attorneys which you feel would tend to incriminate you in any violation of the law, you do have the right under the Fifth Amendment to refuse to answer those questions on the grounds that they might so tend to incriminate you and you can exercise that right by merely indicating that you refuse to answer on the grounds that it might tend to incriminate you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">During the course of the discussion the magistrate\u2019s question\u2014\u201c[A]re you finished with cross-examination? \u201d\u2014was responded to by Gallaher\u2019s attorney: \u201cYes I am. I am finished, Judge, only because of the court\u2019s ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u201cIt is well established that the defendant at a <em>preliminary examination </em>has the <em>right </em>to examine and <em>cross-examine </em>witnesses for the purpose of overcoming the prosecution\u2019s case or establishing an affirmative defense.\u201d (Italics added; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d 660, 667.) This right, at one\u2019s preliminary examination, is essential to the \u201cdue process of law\u201d guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>(Jennings </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 867, 875.) It is as critical as the right to cross-examine witnesses at one\u2019s trial, for at the preliminary examination also, it is the judicial responsibility \u201cto weigh the evidence, resolve conflicts and give or withhold credence to particular witnesses.\u201d <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>p. 667.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">\u201cIt is well established that the scope of proper cross-examination may extend to the <em>whole transaction </em>of which the witness has testified, or it may be employed to elicit <em>any matter which may tend to overcome, qualify or explain the testimony given by a witness on his direct examination.\u201d </em>(Italics added; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dotson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 891, 898 [299 P.2d 875]; <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 232, 255 [42 Cal.Rptr. 686]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Swayze </em>(1963) 220 Cal.App.2d 476, 497 [34 Cal.Rptr. 5].) \u201c\u2018He can be cross-examined with respect to facts or denials which are <em>necessarily implied from the testimony in chief, </em>as well as with respect to facts which he expressly states.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Zerillo </em>(1950) 36 Cal.2d 222, 229 [223 P.2d 223], italics added.) And a \u201cwitness may be cross-examined as to any facts stated in his direct examination or <em>connected therewith.\u201d (People </em>v. <em>Bigelow </em>(1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 380, 387 [231 P.2d 881], italics added.)  The cross-examination \u201cneed not be \u2018confined to a mere categorical review of the matters, dates or times mentioned in the direct examination.\u2019\u201d <em>(Jennings </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 867, 877.) The rule appears to have particular application in criminal cases, not only where the witness is the defendant, but also where the witness, as here, is <em>\u201chis accuser.\u201d (Jennings </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>p. 877.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The rule also has a statutory basis: \u201cWhere part of an act, declaration [or] conversation... is given in evidence by one party, the whole on the same subject may be inquired into by an adverse party;.. . and when a detached act, declaration [or] conversation. . .is given in evidence, any other act, declaration [or] conversation. .. <em>which is necessary to make it understood may also be given in evidence.\u201d </em>(Evid. Code, \u00a7 356; italics added.) Elaborating upon the statutory rule, the state\u2019s high court has said: \u201c\u2018\u201cIn the event a statement admitted in evidence constitutes part of a <em>conversation..., the opponent is entitled to have placed in evidence all that was said. . .by or to the declarant in the course of such conversation. . .provided the other statements have some bearing upon, or connection with, the admission or declaration in evidence...\u201d'\u201d (People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 559, 565 [119 Cal.Rptr. 210, 531 P.2d 778], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We construe the foregoing criteria as providing, at least ordinarily, that when a prosecution witness testifies to facts tending to establish the guilt of one criminally accused, that witness may be cross-examined on <em>all </em>relevant and material matters preceding, concurring with, or following the criminal event, within his knowledge and reasonably related to the issue of guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">One situated as was Gallaher is under no duty to point out to the magistrate, or even to know, what evidence his continued cross-examination would elicit. \u201cQuestions on cross-examination... are largely exploratory, and it is unreasonable to require an offer of proof since counsel often cannot know what pertinent facts may be elicited.\u201d <em>(Tossman </em>v. <em>Newman </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 522, 525 [233 P.2d 1]; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1911) 160 Cal. 358, 364 [117 P. 176]; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 239, 242 [109 Cal.Rptr. 782]; <em>MacGregor </em>v. <em>Kawaoka </em>(1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 407, 409-410 [282 P.2d 130].)  And, as here: \u201cWhere.. .an entire class of evidence has been declared inadmissible or the trial court has clearly intimated that it will receive no evidence of a particular type or class, or upon a p\u00e1rticular issue, an offer of proof is not a prerequisite to arguing on appeal the prejudicial nature of the exclusion of such evidence.\u201d <em>(Lawless </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>Calaway </em>(1924) 24 Cal.2d 81, 91 [147 P.2d 604]; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 722, 729 [87 Cal.Rptr. 554].)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Following the shooting of Rutherford, and Gallaher\u2019s statement as recalled by Leader, \u201cI shot him,\u201d there may have been and probably were<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> other circumstances, or \u201cacts,\u201d or \u201cdeclarations,\u201d or \u201cconversations\u201d of Gallaher, concerning the \u201cwhole transaction\u201d or \u201cconnected therewith,\u201d which had a tendency \u201cto overcome, qualify or explain\u201d (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Dotson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 891, 898) Leader\u2019s testimony, or \u201cto make it understood\u201d (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 356), or at least having \u201c\u2018\u201csome bearing upon, or connection with\u201d\u2019\u201d its subject matter (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 559, 565).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Such matters were patently a subject of cross-examinational inquiry by Gallaher. Denial of the right to such cross-examination was error of constitutional dimension.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We need not, and therefore do not, pass upon the parties\u2019 arguments whether Leader, by his voluntary, but partial, testimony concerning the murder charge against Gallaher had waived his claimed Fifth Amendment rights. Waiver, or no waiver, the magistrate\u2019s participation in, or acceptance of, the arrangement between Leader and the prosecution resulting in the loss of Gallaher\u2019s full right of cross-examination constituted prejudicial, and thus reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">We observe further that when, due to <em>any reason </em>for which he is not accountable, one criminally accused is denied his right of cross-examination, \u201c\u2018he is entitled to have the direct testimony stricken from the record.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Manchetti </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 452, 461 [175 P.2d 533]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Barthel </em>(1962) 231 Cal.App.2d 827, 834 [22 Cal.Rptr. 599]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Abner </em>(1962) 209 Cal.App.2d 484, 489-490 [25 Cal.Rptr. 882]; Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) Introduction of Evidence at Trial, \u00a7 1199, pp. 1107-1108.) Gallaher made such a timely motion, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>The magistrate erred, first in accepting the arrangement worked out by the prosecutor, Leader, and Leader\u2019s attorney, and secondly in denying Gallaher\u2019s motion to strike Leader\u2019s direct examination. The error was of constitutional import and was patently prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">We need not determine here whether Leader, having chosen to testify in part as to Gallaher\u2019s guilty participation in the criminal transaction should have been <em>ordered, </em>despite his desire \u201cto take the Fifth Amendment,\u201d to submit to cross-examination on \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201crelated\u201d matters bearing upon Gallaher\u2019s guilt or innocence. (But see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>356 U.S. 148, 155-156 [2 L.Ed.2d 589, 597, 78 S.Ct. 622, 72 A.L.R.2d 818]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Freshour </em>(1880) 55 Cal. 375, 377; <em>Zonver </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 613, 622, fn. 5 [76 Cal.Rptr. 10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">It follows that the superior court should have granted Gallaher\u2019s Penal Code section 995 motion to set aside the information, as provided by <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 660, and <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The peremptory writ will issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Newsom, J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Although unnecessary to our disposition of the case we note from the record that Leader, with his attorney present, had earlier made a carefully limited statement to the police referring in part to <em>some </em>of the shooting\u2019s <em>after-events. </em>The statement points up that there were further conversations between the two men in respect of the homicide, that Leader saw no firearm in Gallaher\u2019s possession before, during, or after the shooting, and that Gallaher had thrown something in a lake which Leader had reason to \u201cassume\u201d was a \u201cBulldog .44\u201d pistol. (The homicide weapon was concededly a .38 caliber firearm.) The reasons for, and soundness of, the above discussed rules are thus illustrated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
