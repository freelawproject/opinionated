The option was assignable, but the agreement provided that upon assignment respondent would become liable under a continuing guaranty, in favor of appellant, of the assignee\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Early in 1973 respondent, with appellant\u2019s consent, assigned its rights as optionee to Lamb-Weston, a division of AMFAC Corporation. Lamb-Weston was required by law to obtain a winegrower\u2019s license from the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control before it could operate the Kingsburg Winery; but another division of AMFAC already held a retail license, and at that time one entity could not lawfully hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>both a winegrowing and a retail license. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 25500 et seq.) Appellant, with knowledge of this disability, sold the winery to Lamb-Weston. Part of the purchase price was reflected by a $725,000 promissory note executed by Lamb-Weston. The note was secured by a general chattel mortgage and security agreement, and a deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Respondent executed a continuing guaranty, undertaking to be a surety of Lamb-Weston\u2019s promissory note. Respondent also agreed that if Lamb-Weston was unable to obtain a winegrower\u2019s license, respondent would acquire the winery from Lamb-Weston. Lamb-Weston was unable to obtain the license and exercised its right to have respondent purchase the winery. Respondent gave Lamb-Weston a promissory note for $160,000, and the transfer was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">It is disputed whether appellant\u2019s written consent was required before the winery could be transferred from Lamb-Weston to respondent, and the evidence is in conflict as to whether consent in any form was ever given. Robert Hillison, who was respondent\u2019s general counsel at that time, testified that he was \u201cacting on behalf of [respondent] in connection with the transaction\u201d; and that he did not consult with appellant about the sale prior to the sale. Margaret Shahenian, vice president of appellant, testified that appellant\u2019s consent was neither requested nor given. Respondent introduced evidence that eight days after the close of the transfer from Lamb-Weston to respondent appellant\u2019s books recognized respondent, and not Lamb-Weston, as the obligor on the Lamb-Weston $725,000 promissory note. The trial court did not make a finding of fact on this issue; however, in its conclusions of law, the court determined that appellant had \u201ccpnsented\u201d to the sale of the winery by Lamb-Weston to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">On October 31, 1973, respondent sold the winery property to Almad\u00e9n Vineyards for $1.3 million, including $575,000 cash. Again, there is dispute concerning appellant\u2019s consent to the sale. On September 20, Almad\u00e9n sent the following telegram to respondent offering to purchase the winery: \u201cOur Final Offer for the Kingsburg Winery Will Be 1,300,000 Dollars Subject to Board Approval. Other General Conditions as Follows 1. Cash to Existing Mortgage With Assumption of Sale 2. Immediate Possession and Closing Within 30 Days of Board Approval 3. Grape Purchase Agreement for Approximately 920 Acres. Almaden\u2019s Board Meets Friday September 21. If Offer Acceptable, Will Have Confirmation by Monday September 24.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>Hillison, respondent\u2019s attorney, testified that respondent orally accepted Almaden\u2019s offer prior to October 5. On October 5, Hillison made a \u201ccourtesy\u201d phone call to Stafford Keegin, one of appellant\u2019s attorneys, and advised him of the intended sale of the winery to Almad\u00e9n. Hillison further testified that he asked Keegin if he \u201csaw any problems\u201d with the sale, that Keegin told him about some unpaid insurance premiums, and that Keegin did not raise any objections to the sale. Hillison did not think that appellant\u2019s consent was required, did not inform appellant of the terms of the sale because he did not believe that it was entitled to that information, and never requested appellant\u2019s consent to the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">Escrow instructions for the sale of the winery were signed by Almad\u00e9n and respondent on October 10. About that time, the escrow holder mailed a request for a beneficiary statement to appellant\u2019s attorneys. This request was received before October 23, but was never responded to.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">By the time of trial Almad\u00e9n had made all scheduled payments on the Lamb-Weston $725,000 promissory note, so that the unpaid balance on the note stood at $507,500, claimed by appellant to be due.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The principal value of the winery property lies in redwood cooperage (wine storage casks) forming part of the collateral securing the promissory note. The vice president and treasurer of Almad\u00e9n testified that since acquiring the property Almad\u00e9n has invested $425,000 in improving the cooperage, and another $390,000 on the buildings in which it is housed. Another $424,000 was budgeted to be spent on the buildings and cooperage in 1976. According to this witness the cooperage was worth about $1.3 million at the time Almad\u00e9n bought it from respondent, and by the time it completes its improvement work the cooperage will be worth about $3 million. The net worth of Almad\u00e9n at the time of trial was about $53 million. Finally, appellant\u2019s vice president and secretary testified that to her personal knowledge the security interest of appellant had not been diminished by the transfer from Lamb-Weston to respondent, or from respondent to Almad\u00e9n.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Appellant first made known its demand for acceleration of the debt, and for the proceeds from the two sales of the winery, as additional security, in a letter dated October 23, 1973, from its attorneys to the attorneys of both Almad\u00e9n and respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>Appellant contends that there have been defaults under the general chattel mortgage and the security agreement, which were executed by Lamb-Weston in connection with its purchase of the winery, and that these constitute defaults on the Lamb-Weston promissory note, which have therefore caused respondent to become liable on its continuing guaranty. Under the terms of the introductory paragraph of the general chattel mortgage and security agreement, appellant was given \u201ca security interest in (a) all collateral [and] (b) the proceeds.. .of such collateral.. .and any property which [Lamb-Weston] may receive on account of such collateral which [Lamb-Weston] will immediately deliver to [appellant].\u201d Lamb-Weston specifically warranted, in paragraph 2 of the agreement, that, \u201cunless specifically otherwise agreed by [appellant] in writing,\u201d it would \u201c(e) Not sell... or transfer Collateral. .. until the Debt has been paid, even though [appellant] has a security interest in proceeds of such Collateral.\u201d Defaults are defined in paragraph 10 to include \u201c(a) [Lamb-Weston\u2019s] failure to pay or perform this or any agreement with [appellant] or breach of any warranty herein.\u201d Finally, the parties agreed in paragraph 9 that \u201cOn [Lamb-Weston\u2019s] default, at [appellant\u2019s] option, without demand or notice, all or any part of the Debt shall immediately become due.\u201d Thus under the agreement a default occurred when the collateral was transferred without appellant\u2019s written consent, and the proceeds from the sale of the collateral were not immediately delivered, to appellant. Lamb-Weston was in default on the note when it transferred the collateral to respondent without appellant\u2019s written consent and when it. failed to deliver the proceeds of the sale to appellant. Lamb-Weston came under additional liability, as a surety, when its assignee (respondent) subsequently transferred the collateral to Almad\u00e9n without having obtained appellant\u2019s consent and without remitting the proceeds of the sale to appellant to reduce the debt owed by appellant. (1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Contracts, \u00a7 746, p. 624.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Respondent\u2019s liability to appellant because of Lamb-Weston\u2019s defaults is based on its continuing guaranty executed in favor of appellant. The instrument provides a continuing guaranty of \u201cany and all indebtedness of Lamb-Weston.\u201d The contrary statement in the trial court\u2019s conclusion of law number 4 is unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The provisions of Civil Code sections 2845 and 2849, requiring a creditor to proceed against the principal debtor or pursue other remedies (e.g., exhausting mortgaged property) prior to claiming against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>guarantor, may be waived by a guarantor. <em>(Engelman </em>v. <em>Bookasta </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 915 [71 Cal.Rptr. 120].) The continuing guarantee waives those statutory requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-4\">\u201c3. The obligations hereunder are joint and several, and independent of the obligations of Borrower, and a separate action or.actions may be brought and prosecuted against Guarantor whether action is brought against Borrower or whether Borrower be joined in any such action or actions;...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pApZ\">\u201c5. Guarantor waives any right to require [appellant] to (a) proceed against Borrower; (b) proceed against or exhaust any security held from Borrower; or (c) pursue any other remedy in [appellant\u2019s] power whatsoever.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Respondent\u2019s liability for the default resulting from the transfer to Almad\u00e9n is also supported by section 9201, California Uniform Commercial Code: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by this code a security agreement is effective according to its terms between the parties, against purchasers of the collateral and against creditors.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the security agreement executed by Lamb-Weston is binding on respondent as a purchaser of the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Appellant\u2019s right to receive immediately the proceeds of a sale of the collateral, as set forth in the introductory paragraph of the security agreement <em>(ante), </em>is supported by California Uniform Commercial Code section 9306.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondent has not disputed, and documentary evidence demonstrates, that appellant\u2019s security interest in proceeds remained perfected by virtue of the financing statement which had been filed with the Secretary of State on March 23, 1973, and which expressly covered proceeds in accordance with section 9306, subdivision (3)(a). Since this security interest remained continuously perfected it binds all subsequent holders of the collateral, including respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>The trial court made the following finding of fact: \u201c24. The Chattel Mortgage and Security Agreement... contained a covenant against assignment without permission of [appellant]; however, none of the other documents entered into by and between [appellant] and Lamb-Weston, including the promissory note... and the Deed of Trust and Assignment of Rents...contained a \u2018due on sale,\u2019 \u2018acceleration,\u2019 or \u2018covenant against transfer or assignment\u2019 provision.\u201d But it is irrelevant that there is no acceleration or due-on-sale clause in the promissory note or deed of trust; these documents, along with the general chattel mortgage and security agreement, are parts of one integrated contract. The last sentences of the general chattel mortgage provide: \u201cThis agreement contains the entire security agreement between [appellant] and [Lamb-Weston]. [Lamb-Weston] will execute any additional agreements, assignments, or documents reasonably required by [appellant] to effectuate this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">No other \u201cdebt,\u201d besides that which is represented by the Lamb-Weston promissory note, has been suggested by respondent as the one which is referred to by the acceleration clause in the general chattel mortgage. Indeed, the note is entitled, \u201cNote Secured by Deed of Trust and General Chattel Mortgage and Security Agreement.\u201d Finally, the guaranty executed by respondent \u201cauthorizes\u201d appellant to \u201caccelerate\u201d the guaranteed debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The trial court made the following conclusion of law: \u201c1. The Court interprets the contract documents which are at issue in this case, to wit, promissory note, deed of trust, general chattel mortgage and security agreement and continuing guaranty, to mean that a separate sale of the cooperage at the Kingsburg Winery was forbidden without [appellant\u2019s] consent, but that a complete sale of the Kingsburg Winery, as in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>case, from Lamb-Weston to [respondent] and from [respondent] to Almad\u00e9n, was not forbidden and any such sale or sales would not activate the covenant against assignments as contained in the general chattel mortgage and security agreement, nor would such sale or sales cause any liability under any of the documents, including but not limited to the continuing guaranty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">There is no support in the documents comprising the contract for the conclusion that the agreement merely placed a due-on-sale restraint on the separate sale of the cooperage without a sale of the realty. If it has any significance at all, the absence of due-on-sale clauses in the deed of trust and note implies only that the realty could be sold separately, without actuating the acceleration clause, as long as the cooperage was retained. But in fact the cooperage was not retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">As an alternative ground of decision, the trial court recited in its conclusions of law that \u201cThe general chattel mortgage and security agreement, to the extent that it would preclude a transfer of the Kings-burg Winery to a qualified buyer without a diminution of the value of the collateral, constitutes an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\u201d (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 711.) The assets dealt with by the parties included both realty and personalty. But the primary value of the business entity was in the personalty (specifically, the cooperage). We have seen that the general chattel mortgage and security agreement includes a due-on-sale clause, while the deed of trust on the real property does not. Appellant claims that it is enforcing the due-on-sale clause with respect to the personal property. Applying California Uniform Commercial Code section 9501,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Supreme Court has held that a creditor who has both real and personal property security can elect to proceed solely as to the personal property, in which case personal property law will be applied. <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Community Bank </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 729, 735 [111 Cal.Rptr. 897, 518 P.2d 329].) While there was no evidence introduced at trial concerning the apportionment of the value of the winery between personalty and realty, the fact that the predominant value of the security interest is in the personalty must be accorded some weight in determining the validity of the operation in this case of the due-on-sale clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>In <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Lassen Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 629 [116 Cal.Rptr. 633, 526 P.2d 1169], the Supreme Court, applying Civil Code section 711, held: \u201c[A] \u2018due-on\u2019 clause contained in a promissory note or deed of trust is not to be enforced simply because the trustorobligor enters into an installment land contract for the sale of the security. Rather, in such a case the clause can be validly enforced only when the beneficiary-obligee can demonstrate a threat to one of his legitimate interests sufficient to justify the restraint on alienation inherent in its enforcement. Such legitimate interests include not only that of preserving the security from waste or depreciation but also that of guarding against what has been termed the \u2018moral risks\u2019 of having to resort to the security upon default.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>pp. 638-639.) <em>Tucker </em>adopted the following test in determining whether a restraint on alienation is unreasonable and therefore void: \u201cTo the degree that enforcement of the clause would result in an increased quantum of actual restraint on alienation in the particular case, a greater justification for such enforcement from the standpoint of the lender\u2019s legitimate interests will be required in order to' warrant enforcement.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 636; see Comment (1976) 64 Cal.L.Rev. 573.)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Elaborating on <em>Tucker </em>the California Supreme Court has held that \u201ca due-on clause contained in a promissory note or deed of trust cannot be enforced upon the occurrence of an outright sale unless the lender can demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably necessary to protect against impairment to its security or the risk of default.\u201d <em>(Wellenkamp </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 943, 953 [148 Cal.Rptr. 379, 582 P.2d 970].) The court limited its holding to cases involving institutional lenders, expressing \u201cno present opinion on the question whether a private lender... has interests which might inherently justify automatic enforcement of a due-on clause.. .upon resale.\u201d (21 Cal.3d at p. 952, fn. 9; see Comments (1979) 31 Hastings L.J. 275, 13 U.S.F. L.Rev. 639.) Because the affected property in <em>Wellenkamp </em>was realty, the court did not discuss possible extension of the new rule to chattels subjected to a security interest. Here no institutional lender is involved, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>the major asset securing the obligation is personal property. It would therefore be possible for this court to reach in the present appeal the question whether automatic enforcement of a due-on clause is to be withheld from a noninstitutional lender whose security interest attaches to chattels rather than to realty. But we do not consider it necessary or appropriate to reach that question. Here two circumstances establish that in fact there was no unreasonable restraint on alienation. First, by virtue of the outright sale to Almad\u00e9n, respondent received $575,000 in cash as against an accelerated debt of $725,000. There is no claim (cf. <em>Tucker, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 633) that respondent could not raise the $150,000 balance of the accelerated debt. Second, the wine cooperage which is the major asset securing the debt is in its nature subject to removal and to deterioration if it is misused or neglected. Where there is no evidence of an actual restraint on alienation and uncontradicted evidence of a reasonable interest in connecting acceleration of the debt to sale of the principal asset securing payment of the debt, extension of the <em>Wellenkamp </em>rule could not affect the result. We conclude that the evidence and the findings do not support the determination of the trial court that enforcement of the due-on clause is an unreasonable restraint on alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">Appellant contends that it did not consent to either of the two transfers of the collateral; that it did not waive its rights under the contract to require its written consent, or to demand the proceeds from the transfers or the acceleration of the debt; and that it is not estopped to deny that it gave its consent or waived any of its rights. The two transfers must be analyzed separately. The trial court\u2019s conclusions that appellant consented to the sale of the winery from Lamb-Weston to respondent, and that it waived its rights to require its written consent or to demand the proceeds from the sale, are supported by substantial evidence. \u201cWaiver is the intentional relinquishment of a <em>known right\u201d </em>(7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Equity, \u00a7 133, p. 5353.) It may be either express or implied. (1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Contracts, \u00a7 593, p. 507.) Appellant\u2019s consent to the transfer, and its waiver of its contractual rights to claim a default as a consequence of the transfer, are evidenced by the following facts: (1) At the time it sold the winery to Lamb-Weston, appellant knew that Lamb-Weston might not be able to obtain a license to operate the winery and would therefore have to sell it; (2) appellant demanded and accepted respondent as guarantor of Lamb-Weston\u2019s obligations; (3) appellant did not demand the delivery of the proceeds from that sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>until more than three months later when respondent transferred the winery to Almad\u00e9n; and (4) eight days after the transfer, appellant\u2019s books recognized respondent, and not Lamb-Weston, as the obligor on the Lamb-Weston promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Furthermore, there is substantial evidence supporting the court\u2019s determination that appellant is estopped to deny its consent or waiver. Evidence Code section 623 defines estoppel as follows: \u201cWhenever a party has, by his own statement or conduct, intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true and to act upon such belief, he is not, in any litigation arising out of such statement or conduct, permitted to contradict it.\u201d A necessary element of estoppel is that the party to whom the representation is made must reasonably rely on the representation. (7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Equity, \u00a7 132, pp. 5351-5352.) There was evidence that respondent relied on appellant\u2019s consent and waiver, in proceeding with the transfer from Lamb-Weston.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">But appellant is not estopped to claim that a default occurred as a result of the transfer from respondent to Almad\u00e9n. As to that transfer, the necessary element of reasonable reliance on the part of respondent is missing. There was uncontradicted evidence that respondent did not believe that appellant\u2019s consent to the transfer was required, that respondent did not inform appellant of the terms of the sale because it did not believe that it was entitled to that information, and that respondent never requested appellant\u2019s consent to the sale. Moreover, appellant never represented to respondent that it consented to the sale, or waived any of its rights under the contract. In a letter dated October 23, 1973, appellant informed respondent that it would only consent to the transfer if the proceeds from the sale were delivered to appellant. Appellant also acted without delay in filing suit to enforce its rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Appellant points out that, under the continuing guarantee signed by respondent, appellant is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in the event that it is successful in this action. Paragraph 8 of the continuing guaranty agreement provides that: \u201cGuarantor [Land Dynamics] agrees to pay a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and all other costs and expenses which may be incurred by Guild in the enforcement of this guaranty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>A provision in a contract for payment of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in the event of suit to enforce the contract is valid. <em>(Nevin </em>v. <em>Salk </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 331, 338 [119 Cal.Rptr. 370]; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Smyth </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 807, 832, 836 [101 Cal.Rptr. 4]; <em>Malibou Lake Mountain Club, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 31, 35 [95 Cal.Rptr. 553]; <em>Wiener </em>v. <em>Van Winkle </em>(1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 774, 784 [78 Cal.Rptr. 761]; <em>Heidt </em>v. <em>Miller Heating &amp; Air Conditioning Co. </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 135, 137, 138 [74 Cal.Rptr. 695]; see 4 Witkin, Cal.
