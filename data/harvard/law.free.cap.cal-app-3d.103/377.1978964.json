J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ9\">Section 27 of the Charter (Charter) of the City of Berkeley (City) has long provided for the office of city manager, \u201cwho shall be responsible for the efficient administration of all departments.\u201d He is appointed, and subject to removal, by the city council, and as relevant to the case before us, is given \u201cthe following powers and duties\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">\u201c(a) To see that all laws and ordinances are duly enforced,...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">\u201c(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, to appoint, discipline or remove all officers and employees of the City, subject to the Civil Service provisions of this Charter.... Except for the purpose of inquiry, the Council and its members shall deal- with the administrative service solely through the City Manager, and neither the Council nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>any member thereof shall give orders to any of the subordinates of the City Manager, either publicly or privately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">\u201c(c) To exercise control over all departments, divisions and bureaus of the City Government and over all the appointive officers and employees thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">\u201c(f) To make investigations into the affairs of the City, or any department or division thereof, or any contract, or the proper performance of any obligation running to the City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Recently, 1975, section 47 was added to the Charter by the City\u2019s electorate. It increased the City\u2019s officialdom by establishing the office of \u201cCitizens\u2019 Assistant.\u201d That official was to be appointed, and subject to removal, by the city council.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Section 47, as here relevant, provided: \u201cThe Citizens\u2019 Assistant shall... be responsible for processing citizen requests for information and assistance, and for investigating complaints on any governmental matter, regardless of jurisdiction. [If] In the performance of these duties, the Citizens\u2019 Assistant may inquire into any aspect of government, and any department, agency, officer or employee, and shall have the power to compel the production of all public records kept by a municipal agency and the testimony of witnesses by subpoena. [If] The Citizens\u2019 Assistant shall submit an annual report to the City Council and such interim reports as may be deemed appropriate, commenting upon the functioning of city government and recommending appropriate policies or changes in policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Ezra Lee Parrott was regularly appointed to the newly created office. Thereafter, in the course of investigating the complaint of a citizen concerning the City\u2019s employment practices, he sought production by a department of the City of certain records relating to the citizen\u2019s evaluation, by the department, on her application for employment. On advice of the city attorney and the city manager, the department refused to recognize the citizens\u2019 assistant\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction over this matter\u201d which \u201cconcerns Personnel matters,\u201d or to produce the records for inspection or otherwise, or \u201cto answer any questions regarding or relating to [the] Subpoena Duces Tecum since it is our opinion that he has no jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Thereupon Ezra Lee Parrott, as citizens\u2019 assistant, commenced the instant action for, among other things, \u201ca declaration of the rights and duties of the parties herein with respect to the controversy...The superior court entered judgment (termed Order) adjudicating that, <em>uin the performance of his duties\u201d </em>(italics added) Ezra Lee Parrott, as citizens\u2019 assistant, possessed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\u201c1. The power to compel the production of all public records kept by the municipal agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201c2. The power to compel the testimony of witnesses by subpena;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">\u201c3. The power to compel the production of all internal affairs bureau records;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">\u201c4. The power to compel the production of all personnel records;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">\u201c5. The power to compel the production of all records kept by the City of Berkeley regardless of jurisdiction, unless such records come within the specific privileges authorized by \u00a7 1040 of the <em>Evidence Code\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The judgment also allowed reasonable attorney fees to the citizens\u2019 assistant, under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, for services rendered in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">The defendants of plaintiff\u2019s action, the city manager and city attorney, have appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">We have considered the record and the arguments and briefs of the parties. Our conclusion is that, with certain modifications, the judgment must be affirmed. We state our reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">Defendants\u2019 principal contentions may reasonably be narrowed to an argument that the City of Berkeley\u2019s Charter does not confer upon the citizens\u2019 assistant the powers and duties claimed by him and as determined by the superior court\u2019s summary judgment. They insist that such a grant of power and duty as claimed, and found by the trial court, is fatally inconsistent with that reposed by the Charter in the city manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The City\u2019s Charter may be likened to a statute, subject generally to the same rules of statutory interpretation. We are, as was the trial court, accordingly to be guided by the rule of Code of Civil Procedure section 1858: \u201cIn the construction of a statute..., the office of the Judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted; and where there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d And: \u201c\u2018Courts have nothing to do with the wisdom of laws....\u2019\u201d <em>(Eye Dog Foundation </em>v. <em>State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 536, 544 [63 Cal.Rptr. 21, 432 P.2d 717].)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Applying these rules we discern that Charter section 27 confers upon the city manager the power and duty to <em>manage </em>the City without interference. The power and duty <em>includes </em>the management control, over all City departments, divisions, bureaus, appointive officers and employees, and includes the appointment, discipline, and removal of employees. In this we discern no substantial conflict with the citizens\u2019 assistant\u2019s responsibility for \u201cprocessing citizen requests for information and assistance, and for investigating complaints,\u201d or his Charter-declared right to inquire into any aspect of government, and any department, agency, officer or employee, by the production of public records or otherwise. Nor does administrative interference reasonably result from the citizens\u2019 assistant\u2019s duty to submit an \u201cannual report to the City Council and such interim reports as may be deemed appropriate,...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Indeed, we observe no grant of authority whatever to the citizens\u2019 assistant to engage in, or interfere with, any function of management or control reposed in the city manager by the Charter. Nor does he have power to rectify, or order rectification of, complaints made to him by citizens; he may do no more than report, \u201ccommenting upon the functioning of city government and recommending appropriate policies or changes in policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We do note a duality of duty to make <em>investigations </em>\u201cinto the affairs of the City\u201d but that duty reposed in the citizens\u2019 assistant may not reasonably be considered conflict, or interference, with the city manager\u2019s prerogative of <em>management </em>and <em>control.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">We advert now to the remaining contention of defendants: \u201cThe Public Records Act exempts from disclosure to the citizens\u2019 assistant the subpoenaed information and documentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Initially, we iterate that the citizens\u2019 assistant is a City official holding an office created by the City\u2019s Charter. The law clothes him with official dignity and prestige comparable with that of defendants and other of the City\u2019s officials. And since a city, like other corporations, may act only through its officials, agents, and employees, his official acts are those of the City itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We are advised of no law or other authority which precludes investigation or inquiry, into any aspect of the acts or records of a city\u2019s government, by a city official or employee otherwise authorized by law to do so for the purpose, as noted, of reporting or commenting to the city council or other department \u201cupon the functioning of city government and recommending appropriate policies or changes in policy.\u201d Such a disclosure by one official or department to another is not a \u201cpublic disclosure\u201d as contended by defendants. In the exercise of his functions the citizens\u2019 assistant, like all other of the City\u2019s officials and employees, is subject to the provisions of any law forbidding public, or private, disclosure of designated records or information to \u201ccitizens\u201d (under Charter \u00a7 47) or others. .</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The superior court will modify the judgment: by amending paragraph 5 to read, \u201cThe power to compel the production of all records kept by the City of Berkeley fegardless of jurisdiction\u201d; by adding paragraph 6 as follows, \u201cIn the exercise of such power he is bound by any law which forbids disclosure by him of information so obtained to persons, including \u2018citizens\u2019 as the term is used in the City of Berkeley\u2019s Charter section 47\u201d; and by fixing and awarding reasonable attorney fees to plaintiff for services rendered on this appeal (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.5). As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Newsom, J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
