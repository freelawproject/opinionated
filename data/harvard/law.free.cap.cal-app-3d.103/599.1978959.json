After two psychiatrists were appointed, the following took place between Mr. Johnson (Stanley\u2019s attorney) and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">\u201cThe Court: Let\u2019s put it down for the 24th of October. That will be the time the Court will decide as to whether he\u2019s a mentally disordered sex offender and if so, the Court will then commit him to the state hospital for treatment, and if the Court finds he is not a mentally disordered sex offender, the Court will then at that time sentence him. Is that satisfactory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">\u201cMr. Johnson: With respect to the positive statement if the Court. will commit him, whatever treatment would be necessary I think we\u2019ll be asking for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t follow you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">\u201cMr. Johnson: In other words, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s mandatory he be committed to the state hospital if there is some other treatment that is suggested by the physicians.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m not saying I agree with that. I\u2019ll have to take a long look at that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">\u201cMr. Johnson: I agree. That\u2019s the purpose of having the doctor\u2019s reports. Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\u201cThe Court: In other words, you mean treat him locally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">\u201cMr. Johnson: If possible. If there\u2019s some means of doing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019ll tell you right now. The Court wouldn\u2019t do it. Is that clear? If he\u2019s a mentally disordered sex offender, he\u2019s going to the state hospital for treatment. If he\u2019s not, the Court will take other steps not as you have stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">We are persuaded from the above quoted remarks, and in the light of the entire record, that the trial judge prejudged this matter necessitating that the case be reversed and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings before a different judge. At those new proceedings, if the trial court deems it appropriate, mentally disordered sex offender, proceedings can be reinstated <em>from the beginning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Stanley next contends that the trial court committed prejudicial error in failing to request an evaluation by the County Mental Health Director, Dr. Davis. Welfare and Institutions Code section 6316 provides in part: \u201cIf, after examination and hearing, the court finds that the person is a mentally disordered sex offender and that the person could benefit by treatment in a state hospital, or other mental health facility the court in its discretion has the alternative to return the person to the criminal court for further disposition, or may make an order committing the person to the department for placement in a state hospital, or may commit the person to the county mental health director for placement in an appropriate public or private mental health facility, approved by such director, and a copy of such commitment shall be personally served upon said person within five days after the making of such order. The court shall transmit a copy of its order to the county mental health director or his designee. Prior to making such order, the court shall order the county mental health director or his designee to evaluate the defendant and to submit to the court within 15 judicial days of such order his written recommendation as to whether the defendant should be committed to a state hospital or to another mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>health facility. No person shall be admitted to a state hospital or other facility without having been evaluated by the county mental health director or his or her designee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Dr. Davis did examine Stanley. Respondent argues that there is nothing in the record to indicate that Dr. Davis was not functioning in his official capacity during his examination and even if Dr. Davis was acting as a private doctor, it would be a total waste of time and resources to send Stanley back, with orders that the doctor \u201cchange hats\u201d and conduct a second evaluation in his official capacity. Thus, respondent argues that the statutorily required evaluation took place here and that to remand for a literal compliance with the statute as suggested by Stanley is \u201credundant, wasteful and entirely unintended.\u201d We disagree with respondent and conclude that Stanley\u2019s contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">First, the record is clear that Dr. Davis was appointed to make a report in his private capacity and not in his official capacity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, contrary to the argument of respondent it is not merely a matter of a doctor changing hats. Different purposes and functions are involved. The purpose of the report Dr. Davis made, as a private physician, was to assist in the determination of whether or not Stanley was a mentally disordered sex offender. Under Welfare and Institutions Code section 6316 the county mental health director is not concerned with determining whether a defendant is a mentally disordered sex offender and if so, whether he is amenable for treatment in the state hospital. Instead the county mental health director is concerned with the appropriate disposition of a defendant, i.e., commitment to a state hospital or to another facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">We agree with the view and unanimous holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Yarber </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 895, 906 [153 Cal.Rptr. 875],<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the \u201cLegislature intended that <em>before </em>a court decided to commit a defendant to a mental health facility, it would have the recommendation of the county mental health director as to whether the commitment should be to a state hospital or to some other mental health facility.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Procedural errors or omissions in mentally disordered sex offender commitment proceedings render the commitment void (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Yarber, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d 895, 906, and cases cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In view of the conclusion reached herein the other issues raised by Stanley need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">For the reasons set forth the commitment order is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein to be conducted before a different trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Brown (G. A.), P. J., and Zenovich, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-13\">We are informed that Stanley is now on parole from Atascadero State Hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\">As Dr. Davis stated in his report, written on his personal stationery, the purpose of this examination was to assist the court in determining whether or not Mr. Stanley is a \u201cmentally disordered sex offender.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b503-9\">The dissent in <em>Yarber </em>was directed toward a codefendant and another issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
