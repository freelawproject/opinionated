While our own policy preferences tempt us to an affirmative answer, we feel constrained by existing law to hold that a disclaimer is ineffective for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">Geneve Parsons executed her will on May 3, 1976. Three persons signed the will as attesting witnesses: Evelyn Nielson, respondent Marie Gower, and Bob Warda, a notary public. Two of the witnesses, Nielson and Gower, were named in the will as beneficiaries. Nielson was given $100; Gower was given certain real property. Mrs. Parsons died on De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>cember 13, 1976, and her will was admitted to probate on the petition of her executors, respondents Gower and Lenice Haymond. On September 12, 1977, Nielson filed a disclaimer of her $100 bequest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants then claimed an interest in the estate on the ground that the devise to Gower was invalid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court rejected their argument, which is now the sole contention on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Appellants base their claim on Probate Code section 51, which provides that a gift to a subscribing witness is void \u201cunless there are two other and disinterested subscribing witnesses to the will.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Nielson disclaimed her bequest after subscribing the will, appellants submit that \u201ca subsequent disclaimer is ineffective to transform an interested witness into a disinterested one.\u201d Appellants assert that because there was only one disinterested witness at the time of attestation, the devise to Gower is void by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Respondents contend that appellants\u2019 argument is \u201cpurely technical\u201d and \u201ccompletely disregards the obvious and ascertainable intent\u201d of the testatrix. They urge that the property should go to the person named as devisee rather than to distant relatives who, as the testatrix stated in her will, \u201chave not been overlooked, but have been intentionally omitted.\u201d They stress that there has been no suggestion of any fraud or undue influence in this case, and they characterize Nielson\u2019s interest as a \u201ctoken gift\u201d which she relinquished pursuant to the disclaimer statute. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 190 et seq.) Finally, respondents point to the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>language of Probate Code section 190.6: \u201cIn every case, the disclaimer shall relate back for all purposes to the date of the creation of the interest.\u201d On the basis of that language, respondents conclude that Nielson \u201ceffectively became disinterested\u201d by reason of her timely disclaimer. According to respondents, the conditions of Probate Code section 51 have therefore been satisfied, and the devise to Gower should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">This appears to be a case of first impression in California,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and our interpretation of Probate Code section 51 will determine its outcome.  We are required to construe the statute \u201cso as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d <em>(Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672].) To ascertain that purpose, we may consider its history. <em>(Estate of Ryan </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 498, 513 [133 P.2d 626].)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">At common law a party to an action, or one who had a direct interest in its outcome, was not competent to testify in court because it was thought that an interested witness would be tempted to perjure himself in favor of his interest. (See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1864) 26 Cal. 23, 35.) Centuries ago, this principle concerning the competence of witnesses in litigation was injected into the substantive law of wills. (See <em>Estate of Zeile </em>(1910) 5 Coffey's Prob. Dec. 292, 294.) The statute of frauds of 1676 required that devises of land be attested and subscribed \u201cby three or four credible witnesses, or else they shall be utterly void and of none effect.\u201d (29 Car. II, ch. 3, \u00a7 5.) The word \u201ccredible\u201d was construed to mean \u201ccompetent\u201d according to the common law principles then prevailing, and \u201ccompetent\u201d meant \u201cdisinterested\u201d\u2014so that persons having an interest under the will could not be \u201ccredible witnesses\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The entire will would therefore fail if any one of the requisite number of attesting witnesses was also a beneficiary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>(Holdfast </em>v. <em>Dowsing </em>(K.B. 1746) 2 Str. 1253 [93 Eng.Rep. 1164].) In 1752 Parliament enacted a statute which saved the will by providing that the interest of an attesting witness was void. (25 Geo. II, ch. 6, \u00a7 I.) Under such legislation, the competence of the witness is restored by invalidating his gift. <em>(Estate of Zeile, </em>supra, 5 Coffey's Prob. Dec. at p. 294.) The majority of American jurisdictions today have similar statutes; and California Probate Code section 51 falls into this category. (Rees, <em>American Wills Statutes </em>(1960) 46 Va.L.Rev. 613, 629-633. See generally 2 Bowe-Parker: Page on Wills (3d rev. ed. 1960) Formalities of Execution, \u00a7\u00a7 19.73-19.110, pp. 169-216; Evans, <em>The Competency of Testamentary Witnesses </em>(1927) 25 Mich.L.Rev. 238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The common law disabilities to testify on account of interest have long been abolished. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 700; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>26 Cal. at p. 35; 2 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) Testimonial Qualifications, \u00a7 488, p. 525, fn. 2.) Having become a part of the substantive law of wills, Probate Code section 51, on the other hand, survives. (See Evans, <em>supra, </em>25 Mich.L.Rev. at pp. 238-239; 2 Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 582, pp. 722-723.) OUr task is to ascertain and effectuate its present purpose.  When a court seeks to interpret legislation, \u201cthe various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.\u201d <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].) We therefore turn to the Probate Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In order to establish a will as genuine, it is not always necessary that each and every one of the subscribing witnesses testify in court. (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 329, 372.) Moreover, Probate Code section 51 does not by its terms preclude any witness from testifying; nor does the section void the interest of a subscribing witness when \u201ctwo other and disinterested\u201d witnesses have also subscribed the will. It is therefore entirely conceivable and perfectly consistent with the statutory scheme that a will might be proved on the sole testimony of a subscribing witness who is named in the will as a beneficiary; and if the will had been attested by \u201ctwo other and disinterested subscribing witnesses,\u201d the interested witness whose sole testimony established the will would also be permitted to take his gift, as provided in the instrument. (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 51, 329, 372.) If Probate Code section 51 serves any purpose under such circumstances, its purpose must necessarily have been accomplished before the will was offered for probate. Otherwise, in its statutory context, the provision would have no effect at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The quintessential function of a subscribing witness is performed when the will is executed. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 50; <em>Estate of LaMont </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 566, 569 [248 P.2d 1].) We believe that Probate Code section 51 looks in its operation solely to that time. (See 2 Bowe-Parker: Page on Wills, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 19.85, p. 185, and \u00a7 19.102, pp. 204-205; Evans, <em>supra, 25 </em>Mich.L.Rev. at p. 238.) The section operates to ensure that at least two of the subscribing witnesses are disinterested. Although disinterest may be a token of credibility, as at common law, it also connotes an absence of selfish motives. We conclude that the purpose of the statute is to protect the testator from fraud and undue influence at the very moment when he executes his will, by ensuring that at least two persons are present \u201cwho would not be financially motivated to join in a scheme to procure the execution of a spurious will by dishonest methods, and who therefore presumably might be led by human impulses of fairness to resist the efforts of others in that direction.\u201d (Gulliver &amp; Tilson, <em>Classification of Gratuitous Transfers </em>(1941) 51 Yale L.J. 1, 11. See also 2 Bowe-Parker: Page on Wills, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 19.74, p. 173.) No other possible construction which has been brought to our attention squares so closely with the statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Because we hold that Probate Code section 51 looks solely to the time of execution and attestation of the will, it follows that a subsequent disclaimer will be ineffective to transform an interested witness into a \u201cdisinterested\u201d one within the meaning of that section. If the execution of a release or the filing of a disclaimer after the will has been attested could effect such a transformation, the purpose of the statute as we have defined it would be undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Respondents\u2019 reliance on Probate Code section 190.6<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is misplaced.  That section serves to equalize the tax consequences of disclaimers as between heirs at law and testamentary beneficiaries. (See <em>Estate of Meyer </em>(1951) 107 Cal.App.2d 799, 810 [238 P.2d 587]; <em>Estate of Nash </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 560, 561 [64 Cal.Rptr. 298, 27 A.L.R.3d 1349].) Probate Code section 190, subdivision (a) defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u201cbeneficiary\u201d to mean \u201cany person entitled, <em>but for his disclaimer, </em>to take an interest\u201d by various means. (Italics added.) Even assuming that an \u201cinterest\u201d arises within the meaning of the disclaimer statute from the execution of a will (cf. Prob. Code, \u00a7 190, subd. (b)), Evelyn Nielson would <em>not </em>have been entitled to take under the will by reason of Probate Code section 51; and she was, therefore, not a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d within the meaning of the disclaimer statute. The disclaimer statute therefore has no application here,  In this case, when the will was executed and attested, only one of the subscribing witnesses was disinterested. The gifts to the other witnesses were therefore void, by operation of law. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 51.) Nielson\u2019s disclaimer was a nullity, because she had no interest to disclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Respondents\u2019 concern for the intentions of the testatrix is likewise misplaced. The construction of the will (Prob. Code, \u00a7 101) is not at issue here. We are faced instead with the operation of Probate Code section 51, which makes no reference to the intentions of the testatrix. Legislation voiding the interest of an attesting witness \u201coften upsets genuine expressions of the testator\u2019s intent.\u201d (Chaffin, <em>Execution, Revocation, and Revalidation of Wills: A Critique of Existing Statutory Formalities </em>(1977) 11 Ga.L.Rev. 297, 317.) But that legislation controls the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">It has been said that statutes such as this are illsuited to guard against fraud and undue influence. \u201cIf the potential malefactor does not know of the rules, he will not be deterred. If he does know of them, which is unlikely, he will realize the impossibility of the financial gain supposed to be the motive of the legatee witness, and so will probably escape the operation of the remedy against himself.\u201d (Gulliver &amp; Tilson, <em>supra, </em>51 Yale L.J. at pp. 12-13.) Lord Mansfield observed over 200 years ago, \u201cIn all my experience at the Court of Delegates, I never knew a fraudulent will, but what was legally attested; and I have heard the same from many learned civilians.\u201d <em>(Wyndham </em>v. <em>Chetwynd </em>(K.B. 1757) 1 Black. W. 95, 100 [96 Eng.Rep. 53].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Yet Probate Code section 51 remains the law in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">We are mindful that there has been no suggestion of any fraud or other misconduct in the case before us, and it may well be that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>vast majority of testators in modern society do not need the type of \u2018protection\u2019 that is afforded by our statute.\u201d (Chaffin, <em>Improving Georgia's Probate Code </em>(1970) 4 Ga.L.Rev. 505, 507.) \u201c[T]he reported decisions give the impression that the remedies are employed more frequently against innocent parties who have accidentally transgressed the requirement than against deliberate wrongdoers, and this further confirms the imaginary character of the difficulty sought to be prevented.\u201d (Gulliver &amp; Tilson, <em>supra, </em>51 Yale L.J. at p. 12.) But the Legislature has spoken here, and in matters such as this, \u201cthe legislature has a wide discretion in determining the conditions to be imposed.\u201d <em>(Estate of Mintaberry </em>(1920) 183 Cal. 566, 568 [191 P. 909].)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Respondents note that a growing number of states have enacted statutes similar to Uniform Probate Code section 2-505, which dispenses with the rule contained in the California statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Perhaps statutes like California Probate Code section 51 represent a \u201cmediaeval point of view\u201d concerning the proper function of an attesting witness; and perhaps \u201cthe question whether he has abused his position should be made one of fact, like any other question having to do with the motives and conduct of parties who take part in the testamentary transaction.\u201d (Mechem, <em>Why Not a Modern Wills Act? </em>(1948) 33 Iowa L.Rev. 501, 506-507.) We cannot ignore what the statute commands, however, \u201cmerely because we do not agree that the statute as written is wise or beneficial legislation.\u201d <em>(Estate of Carter </em>(1935) 9 Cal.App.2d 714, 718 [50 P.2d 1057].) Any remedial change must come from the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">That portion of the judgment from which this appeal is taken is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Racanelli, P.

No disclaimer was involved in that case. The holding in <em>Estate of King </em>(N.Y.Sur. 1972) 68 Misc.2d 716 [328 N.Y.S.2d 216], was compelled by the express language of the present New York statute, which provides that a gift to an attesting witness is void \u201cunless there are <em>at the time of execution and attestation, </em>at least two other attesting witnesses to the will who receive no beneficial disposition or appointment thereunder.\u201d (N.Y.
