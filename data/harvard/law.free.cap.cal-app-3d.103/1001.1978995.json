In its answer it claims that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the matter by mandate and that, upon reconsideration, the WCAB may consider any issue which could have been raised in the original proceeding. By return it claims further that Harris sought relief not only to reopen to set aside the compromise and release but by separate petition sought to reopen for consideration of new and further disability pursuant to Labor Code section 5410.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Harris responded by return to the order to show cause asking this court to order the WCAB to set aside the compromise and release agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">We shall issue a writ directing the WCAB not to proceed to reopen Harris\u2019 settlement except for good cause as required by Labor Code section 5803; to inform the parties of the ground of good cause upon which it seeks to take or consider additional evidence; and to afford the parties the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and present rebuttal evidence upon the noticed ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Harris received injuries on May 8, 1973, in the course of his employment as a truck driver by California Liquid Gas Corporation. Fidelity is the insurance carrier for California Liquid Gas Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Harris employed Norman J. Mulholland \u00e1s his attorney. He requested and received a rating from the permanent disability rating bureau of the WCAB; his permanent disability range was determined to be 8 1/2 percent to 8 3/4 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">Through his attorney Harris agreed to sign and on May 6, 1975, signed a compromise and release agreement with Fidelity on WCAB Form 15 (Rev. 1-72), by which Fidelity agreed to pay Harris $3,250 in release of all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>A WCAB judge reviewed the settlement and accompanying medical reports and questioned the adequacy of the settlement. Fidelity agreed to raise the amount to $4,500, which was approved by the judge. On August 15, 1975, the compromise and release agreement of May 6, 1975, as raised, was approved by the WCAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">On August 31, 1977, Harris, through new counsel, filed a motion with the WCAB entitled \u201cMotion to Set Aside Compromise and Release,\u201d thus seeking to invoke the continuing jurisdiction of the WCAB to rescind its orders for good cause. The motion, as considered by a WCAB judge on January 16, 1978, claimed that Harris\u2019 prior counsel purported to be an attorney admitted to practice in California at the time he represented him but was not so qualified, that Harris did not receive the money due him under the compromise and release agreement, that his prior attorney was not mentally competent to advise him concerning the agreement, and that the agreement lacked proper execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Following the hearing, on May 1, 1978, but before decision on the motion, Harris filed with the WCAB a petition denominated \u201cPetition to Maintain Jurisdiction of the WCAB,\u201d claiming inter alia that he had suffered a new and further disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">On June 28, 1978, the WCAB judge denied the motion to set aside the agreement on the ground that Harris had not shown good cause for rescinding it in that he had failed to show fraud, duress, undue influence, mutual mistake of fact or law, improper execution of the document, mental incompetency, or his minority at the time of signing.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">On July 24, 1978, Harris filed a petition for reconsideration before the WCAB under the provisions of Labor Code section 5900 et seq., contending that the WCAB judge acted in excess of jurisdiction, that the evidence did not justify the findings of fact, and that the judge\u2019s finding was illegal. Fidelity answered and the WCAB judge, on August 21, 1978, submitted a report and recommendation on the petition for reconsideration. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 10860.) He concluded inter alia that the WCAB review of the release raising the amount to $4,500 was a sufficient review and protection to Harris to constitute waiver of any formal defect in the original execution of the release and that a misunderstanding between an applicant and an applicant\u2019s attorney is not a ground to set aside a compromise and release. He recommended denial of the petition for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>On September 28, 1978, the WCAB issued an opinion and order granting reconsideration. It set forth the judge\u2019s findings and recommendation and said: \u201cUpon reviewing the entire record, the Board is of the opinion that further medical evidence is necessary for the Board to reach a just and reasoned decision on the issue raised herein. The Board may not leave undeveloped matters which it identifies as requiring further evidence. <em>Raymond Plastering </em>v. <em>WCAB </em>(1967), 252 Cal.App.2d 748, 32 CCC 287. This is, therefore, an appropriate case for the Board to exercise its discretion to direct an examination by an independent physician. <em>Lundberg v. WCAB </em>(1968), 69 Cal.2d 436, 33 CCC 656. Reconsideration will be granted for an examination by an independent physician and for such further proceedings as the Board may thereafter determine to be appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">On September 29, 1978, Fidelity wrote to the WCAB seeking clarification of the issues then pending before the board by virtue of its order granting reconsideration. The letter stated Fidelity\u2019s belief that no medical issues had been raised in the adjudication of Harris\u2019 motion to set aside the release, and asked for a supplemental opinion and order stating the issue to be resolved by the medical examination and its desire to be informed so that it could prepare a rebuttal. The board responded on November 2, 1978, that \u201c[t]he matter was referred to an independent physician... so that a determination of the adequacy of the Compromise and Release Agreement may be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The independent medical examiner, Dr. William C. Hickey, reviewed the complete medical and legal files to determine the physical disability prior to the award of August 15, 1975, as compared to after December 5, 1978, the date of his examination. Dr. Hickey indicated certain subjective and objective factors of disability, and concluded that Harris\u2019 complaints precluded him from heavy lifting, repeated bending and stooping.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The WCAB then requested from the permanent disability rating board a rating of the objective disability factors contained in Dr. Hickey\u2019s report. On February 16, 1979, the rating board recommended a disability rating of 27 1 /2 percent, amounting to a total payment of $7,560. The WCAB then admitted into evidence Dr. Hickey\u2019s report, the .disability rating of February 16, 1979, and the previously served medical report of Dr. Peal, relied upon by Dr. Hickey.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>Fidelity moved to strike Dr. Hickey\u2019s and Dr. Peal\u2019s reports from evidence and to quash the permanent disability rating of February 16, 1979. At a hearing on the medical examination counsel for Fidelity argued that the only issue before the board was whether there was good cause to set aside the compromise and release, and that if the WCAB intended to issue a rating based on Harris\u2019 current orthopedic disability, that Fidelity be allowed to present rebuttal evidence. Harris objected to the introduction into evidence of a medical report authored by a doctor who was subpoenaed to testify at the June 28 hearing, but who did not appear. The judge said that the WCAB must have denied the motions to strike and quash by implication, since it sent the case to the Sacramento office for a hearing. Dr. Hickey then testified at the hearing, and counsel for Fidelity and Harris cross-examined him.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Fidelity filed its petition for a writ of mandate in this court on July 24, 1979. The WCAB filed an answer to the petition on August 2, 1979. Fidelity filed a response to the answer on August 8, 1979. This court issued an order to show cause on August 23, 1979. The WCAB and Harris filed returns to the order to show cause on August 29, 1979. Fidelity filed its response to the returns on September 11, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The WCAB challenges the propriety of mandamus to review the issues tendered in the petition. It claims that the petitioner has a plain, speedy and adequate statutory remedy under the provisions of Labor Code sections 5950 to 5956.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">\u201cLabor Code section 5955 expressly provides that in a proper case a \u2018writ of mandate shall lie from the Supreme Court or a court of appeal\u2019 to compel the board to perform its duties.\u201d <em>(Betancourt </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 408, 412 [94 Cal.Rptr. 9].) Although \u201cmandamus has seldom, if ever, been used... [i]t is a remedy given statutory approval [and] [i]f it fits the facts of this proceeding rarity of its applicability will not be a reason for denial.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Mandamus will lie to compel the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085.) This case goes to the heart of the procedural duties by which the WCAB is statutorily and constitutionally enjoined to conduct its business and which confine the exercise of its discretion. The review of such duties cannot await a final result arrived at by violation of the procedural rights here at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>It is well settled that the writ of mandate will lie to control an abuse of discretionary powers by an administrative agency. <em>(Manjares </em>v. <em>Newton </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 365, 370 [49 Cal.Rptr. 805, 411 P.2d 901]; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 626, 639 [12 Cal.Rptr. 671, 361 P.2d 247].)  The importance of this principle is magnified by petitioner\u2019s allegation that the WCAB not only has violated its statutory powers, but has also deprived Fidelity of its constitutional rights to due process of law.  Where the constitutionality of official acts is called into question, mandamus is proper. <em>(Jolicoeur </em>v. <em>Mihaly </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 565, 570, fn. 2 [96 Cal.Rptr. 697, 488 P.2d 1]; <em>Metropolitan Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Marquardt </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 159, 170 [28 Cal.Rptr. 724, 379 P.2d 28]; see generally, <em>Zeilenga </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 716 [94 Cal.Rptr. 602, 484 P.2d 578]; <em>San Francisco Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 937 [92 Cal.Rptr. 309, 479 P.2d 669].)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Moreover, we have already resolved by implication the question of the adequacy of a legal remedy through our decision to issue an order to show cause on August 23, 1979. (See <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 392, 402 [128 Cal.Rptr. 183, 546 P.2d 687]; <em>County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Hickman </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 841, 845 [59 Cal.Rptr. 609, 428 P.2d 593]; <em>Erlich </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 551, 557 [47 Cal.Rptr. 473, 407 P.2d 649]; see also <em>Hagan </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 498, 502, fn. 1 [2 Cal.Rptr. 288, 348 P.2d 896].) Hence, we conclude that this is a \u201cproper case\u201d under Labor Code section 5955 and, therefore, that the writ shall lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">We examine Fidelity\u2019s claims that the WCAB exceeded its statutory and constitutional authority by: (1) taking and considering evidence unrelated to the issues raised by Harris\u2019 petition for reconsideration; (2) failing to provide Fidelity and Harris with adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard; and (3) failing both to adequately state the evidence relied upon and to specify in detail the reasons for granting reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">We consider these claims as tendering three related issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-9\">A. Whether the WCAB, following its order granting reconsideration of Harris\u2019 petition to set aside the compromise and release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>agreement, was required to comply with the jurisdictional criteria of good cause in Labor Code section 5803;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-4\">B. Whether the WCAB\u2019s purpose in obtaining further medical examination of Harris was consistent with the good cause limitation upon its continuing jurisdiction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-5\">C. Whether the notice and hearing given the parties concerning the medical evidence complied with statutory and procedural requirements of due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">\n<em>A. Reconsideration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The proceedings before the WCAB were initiated by Harris\u2019 petition to set aside an order approving a compromise and release agreement entered into some two years before.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">\u201cA petition to set aside an order approving a compromise is, in effect, a petition to reopen a closed case and therefore requires a showing of good cause,\u201d as required by Labor Code section 5803. (1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workmen's Compensation (2d ed. 1979) \u00a7 8.05[4], subd. [e], pp. 8-32 to 8-33; Cal. Workmen's Compensation Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1973) \u00a7 13.42, p. 469.) The petition is a. precondition to the WCAB\u2019s jurisdiction to act. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5804.)</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">A hearing on the petition was held before a WCAB judge, who rendered a decision holding that Harris had not shown good cause to rescind the order for failure to show that the settlement agreement was the product of fraud, duress, undue influence, mutual mistake of fact or law, improper execution of the document, mental incompetency, or minority at the time of signing.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Harris sought reconsideration before the WCAB of the judge\u2019s adverse determination. His petition, as required by Labor Code section 5903,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was based upon grounds specified therein, particularly subdivisions (a), (c) and (e). (See also Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7\u00a7 10840-10862.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>Whether reconsideration is granted upon petition or upon the WCAB\u2019s own motion (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5906), \u201cthe order granting reconsideration must be based upon one of the grounds specified in section 5903.\u201d <em>(Redner </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 83, 92 [95 Cal.Rptr. 447, 485 P.2d 799]; <em>Michon </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 917, 924-925 [93 Cal.Rptr. 476]; see also <em>Zozaya </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 464, 468 [103 Cal.Rptr. 793]; <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 282, 285 [100 Cal.Rptr. 899]; <em>Ascough </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 248, 259 [98 Cal.Rptr. 357].)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">On reconsideration, the WCAB may either affirm, alter or amend the decision of the WCAB judge \u201con the basis of the evidence previously submitted,\u201d or it \u201cmay grant reconsideration and direct the taking of additional evidence.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5906.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) In either event, the WCAB must \u201cspecify in detail the reasons for the decision.\u201d (Lab. Code \u00a7 5908.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Here, the WCAB granted reconsideration and ordered the taking of new evidence. But its action cannot transcend the matter to be reconsidered\u2014whether Harris\u2019 case should be reopened pursuant to the good cause requirements of section 5803. And it must state reasons for its action consistent with the matter to be reviewed. By granting reconsideration, the WCAB necessarily could do no more than consider Harris\u2019 claims under the provisions of Labor Code section 5803.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>The WCAB is therefore incorrect in its claim that the \u201ceffect of the Order Granting Reconsideration was to open the <em>entire record </em>for review and appropriate action after reconsideration including the issue of the adequacy of the compromise and release agreement.\u201d And its reliance upon cases involving a reconsideration of the <em>original </em>award is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Since the WCAB\u2019s order of reconsideration predicates a review of Harris\u2019 case pursuant to section 5803, the WCAB is bound to comply with its procedural and substantive strictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">\n<em>B. Good Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Labor Code section 5803<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> vests broad powers in the WCAB to \u201crescind, alter, or amend\u201d an order of the WCAB for \u201cgood cause\u201d pursuant to a petition filed by a real party in interest within five years of the date of injury. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5804.)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The requirement of good cause is central to the exercise of the continuing jurisdiction vested in the WCAB by Labor Code section 5803. \u201cDespite the fact, however, that this section has been liberally construed by the appellate courts in an effort to secure full justice to injured employees, the section itself contains a definite limitation upon the power of the commission. This is a requirement that good cause appear for rescinding, altering or amending the former award of the commission... .In the absence of any such circumstance justifying a reexamination of the controversy, the commission is powerless to act, and the former award or orders are final and invulnerable. In other words, the existence of some fact or circumstance which warrants the conclusion that the challenged award is <em>inequitable </em>is a necessary element to the exercise of the continuing jurisdiction of the commission under the authority of section 20(d) [now section 5803].\u201d <em>(Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. </em>v. <em>Indus.A.C. </em>(1936) 6 Cal.2d 314, 316-317 [57 P.2d 501].) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>The equitable measure of good cause has been applied to rescind an order approving a compromise and release agreement, by analogy to the equitable doctrines for rescission of a contract, where the release was secured by fraud, mistake, duress or undue influence. (See <em>Silva </em>v. <em>I.A.C. </em>(1924) 68 Cal.App. 510 [229 P. 870]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 964, 975 [88 Cal.Rptr. 202, 471 P.2d 1002]; 1 Hanna, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8.05[4]; Cal. Workmen's Compensation Practice, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 13.42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">We do not here survey the boundaries of the good cause requirement. Nor do we consider that the grounds set forth above or in the decision of the WCAB judge exhaust the equitable grounds of Labor Code section 5803 for rescission of an order approving a compromise and release agreement. We do examine whether the WCAB\u2019s purpose in reconsidering Harris\u2019 petition to set aside the order approving the compromise and release agreement and in seeking further medical evidence counts as good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The WCAB judge decided Harris had failed to show that the settlement agreement was the product of fraud, duress, undue influence, mutual mistake of fact or law, improper execution of the document, mental incompetency, or minority at the time of signing.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The WCAB, in its order granting reconsideration, said \u201cthat further medical evidence is necessary for the Board to reach a just and reasoned decision on the issue raised herein.\u201d It amplified this ground by letter to the parties, stating that \u201c[t]he matter was referred to an independent physician... so that a determination of the adequacy of the Compromise and Release Agreement may be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The WCAB\u2019s statements do not track the criteria applied by the trial judge nor do they fit any recognizable category of good cause. They more nearly resemble the grounds asserted by the WCAB in <em>Gillette </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 312 [97 Cal.Rptr. 542, 97 Cal.Rptr. 893]. There it granted a petition for reconsideration on the grounds that \u201c\u2018[w]e are not completely satisfied with the medical evidence in the record.... \u2019 No new medical evidence had been either claimed to exist or shown to be necessary or proper to complete the hearing. Actually, the board\u2019s statement was the declaration of an intent to retry the matter.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 321.) In like manner, the WCAB in this case seeks to readjudicate the adequacy of the compro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>mise and release agreement <em>ab initio. </em>In oral argument before this court, WCAB\u2019s counsel conceded that the WCAB sought to determine whether it would be <em>worthwhile </em>to set aside the compromise and release <em>before </em>determining that there were any <em>grounds </em>for setting it aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">The WCAB has got the cart before the horse, with predictable results. The WCAB may not proceed to the merits of Harris\u2019 settlement before compliance with the jurisdictional requirements of Labor Code section 5803.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">We hold that the WCAB has asserted an invalid ground under Labor Code section 5803 for the taking of further evidence incident to considering Harris\u2019 petition to reopen the original award and that the WCAB may not proceed upon such ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">We do not hold that the taking of medical evidence is never relevant to the good cause criteria of section 5803 or that it is impossible in the Harris case to link the appraisal of his medical condition to a ground of good cause. That is a task for the WCAB to undertake, if it can, subject to normal procedures for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Before proceeding with any consideration of Harris\u2019 petition to reopen, the WCAB must give the parties notice of a purpose for its action consistent with the good cause criteria of Labor Code section 5803 and with procedural due process. We turn to a consideration of the parties\u2019 due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">\n<em>C. Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Both Fidelity and Harris argue that the denial of their rights to challenge the introduction of the subsequent medical evidence, to introduce relevant rebuttal evidence, and to cross-examine certain witnesses violated their due process rights. They also claim not to understand the purpose for the new medical examination of Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">As we have shown, the WCAB, on reconsideration, directed the taking of additional evidence (Lab.

In no other way can a party maintain its rights or make its defense.\u2019\u201d <em>(Massachusetts etc. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc.

If this case is a measure, the board\u2014despite its sheaf of rules of practice and procedure (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7\u00a7 10300-10957; Lab. Code, \u00a7 5307)\u2014operates in an essentially structureless environment where the vigilance of the petitioning and responding parties provides the only insurance against the arbitrary and capricious denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The WCAB has asserted an invalid reason for the medical examination of Harris. It has failed to give notice to the parties of the relevance of Harris\u2019 examination to reopening his case measured by the good cause criteria of section 5803. It has failed to give the parties the right to introduce rebuttal evidence. Such failures violate the procedural requirements of section 5803 and of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The WCAB also asserts that its reconsideration action was justified as pursuant to Harris\u2019 May 1, 1978, petition to maintain jurisdiction for the purpose of examining the claim that Harris had suffered a new and further disability, a separate ground for reopening based upon Labor Code section 5410. We do not reach this issue for it is plain that the WCAB action was not taken pursuant to such petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the WCAB not to proceed to reopen Harris\u2019 settlement except for good cause as required by Labor Code section 5803; to inform the parties of the ground of good cause upon which it seeks to take or consider additional evidence; and to afford the parties the opportunity to cross-examine - witnesses and present rebuttal evidence upon the noticed ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Puglia, P.
