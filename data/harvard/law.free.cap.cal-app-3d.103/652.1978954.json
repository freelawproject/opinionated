Hawaii had enacted at that time a scheme of \u201cno fault\u201d insurance under which reparation for injuries and losses such as those which occurred here was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>made without regard to liability. The right to sue for damages for any person whose medical expenses did not exceed $1,500 was abolished. The Crocketts\u2014additional insureds under their lessors\u2019 policy\u2014fell into this category, and were thus precluded from filing a tort action and confined to receiving $2,462.14 in total compensation for their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Upon returning to California the Crocketts claimed uninsured motorist benefits under their own automobile policy, issued by respondent, State Farm Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Appellants\u2019 argument, concisely stated in their own words, is that, under California law the Hawaiian vehicle was underinsured, and \u201cunderinsurance is uninsurance. \u201d The alleged unfairness of the trial court\u2019s ruling is characterized as follows: \u201cThe court applied Hawaiian law to defeat the rights of California motorists with California uninsured motorist coverage with a California carrier. It is saying that if a motorist is \u2018insured\u2019 <em>within </em>the definition of said motorist\u2019s state of residence, that suffices to satisfy the definition of \u2018insured\u2019 under California law.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">At the outset, we note that the parties debate the question of <em>which </em>law\u2014Hawaiian or California\u2014ought to be the law of the case. The answer is, we think, both. Appellants\u2019 contract with State Farm was executed in California by California residents, and must be interpreted in accordance with the law of this state, while, necessarily, reference must be made to the Hawaiian statute to give meaning to the controversy. (Cf. <em>Ramirez </em>v. <em>Wilshire Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 622 [91 Cal.Rptr. 895]; <em>Wheeling </em>v. <em>Financial Indem. Co. </em>(1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 36, 42 [19 Cal.Rptr. 879].)  In interpreting the California statute, we are guided by the principle that, \u201c\u2018A liberal construction must be given to statutes providing compensation for those injured on the highway through no fault of their own... and the Uninsured Motorist Law is a statute of this class... to be interpreted liberally.\u2019\u201d <em>(Robles </em>v. <em>California State Auto. Assn. </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 602, 608-609 [145 Cal.Rptr. 115].)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">As authority supporting the argument that \u201cunderinsurance\u201d is \u201cuninsurance,\u201d our attention is directed by appellants to the case of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Preferred Risk Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 80 [37 Cal.Rptr. 63], in which the injured occupant of a California vehicle was permitted to sue under an insured motorist clause because the Texas vehicle causing the accident had inadequate liability insurance. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>11580.2 of the Insurance Code required of foreign vehicles\u2014then (1961) as now\u2014limits equal to those required of California vehicles under our Financial Responsibility Law. Since the Texas vehicle carried bodily injury liability insurance with maximum limits of $5,000 for injury to one person, the court permitted the suit, noting that its interpretation, \u201c. . . more nearly approaches the declared legislative intent. Legislative attention was directed to a gap in the financial responsibility law, which, although it provides minimum coverage requirements, in fact comes into operation only after the first accident caused by an irresponsible motorist.\u201d <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Preferred Risk Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>225 Cal.App.2d at p. 82.)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Appellant also cites <em>Kirkley </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 1078 [95 Cal.Rptr. 427], where, again, an out-of-state motorist carried liability insurance below the minimum requirement of California law for uninsured motorist coverage. There, the court held the following: that the out-of-state motorist was uninsured within section 11580.2; and, that the amount to which the insured was entitled under his uninsured motorist coverage was not limited by the amount carried by the out-of-state motorist, i.e., he could recover up to $15,000 under his uninsured motorist coverage, and was not limited to the <em>difference </em>between the single party liability limit of $10,000 carried by the out-of-state motorist and the $15,000 under his own uninsured provision. <em>(Kirkley </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>at p. 1082.)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">But, as respondent argues, the principles expressed in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Preferred Risk Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>225 Cal.App.2d 80 and <em>Kirkley </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d 1078 have not been extended \u201cto hold that an insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage is applicable in every situation in which he has not been <em>fully </em>compensated by a third party.\u201d And the case before us does not present the question of underinsurance at all, since the Hawaiian policy provides liability limits in excess of California requirements, but rather the issue of full compensation by California standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">An analogous California case involving the issue of \u201cfull compensation\u201d is <em>Traveler's Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bouzer </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 992 [114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 651], in which the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance limit, while far in excess of the legal minimum, had been exhausted in satisfaction of multiple claims, so that one of the victims of the accident was unable to satisfy the balance of his claim under his uninsured motorist provision. As the court there noted in denying appellant\u2019s right to relief, a contrary conclusion \u201c... would effectually convert uninsured motorist coverage into a policy of excess accident insurance, and not excess insurance with any fixed limits, but insurance \u2018open ended\u2019 at least to the limits of the uninsured motorist coverage. That is not the coverage for which the insured paid a premium, nor would it conform to any rational public policy. We hesitate to contemplate what premiums insured motorists would have to pay for uninsured motorist coverage should this court declare that to be the proper interpretation of the legislative intent.\u201d (39 Cal.App.3d at p. 995.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Respondent has also cited a closely analogous recent decision of the Nebraska Supreme Court in <em>Crossley </em>v. <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co. </em>(1977) 198 Neb. 26 [251 N.W.2d 383]. There, an insured resident of Nebraska, with uninsured motorist coverage on his vehicle, was injured in Colorado while riding as a passenger in his own car, which was then being driven with permission by his stepson. Colorado, like Hawaii, is a \u201cno fault\u201d jurisdiction, and the injured party\u2019s medical and related expenses fell far below the minimum required to file a tort claim in Colorado for general damages. Liability coverage on the Colorado vehicle, however, as in the case at bar, was not less than that required by Nebraska law for vehicles under its registration. The court consequently concluded that the Colorado automobile was <em>not </em>an uninsured motor vehicle, noting that: \u201cHad the accident occurred in the State of Nebraska, the Colorado car would clearly have been an insured rather than an uninsured motor vehicle. It was not the Colorado automobile insurance policy which restricted or limited the legal liability of the Colorado driver, or her insurance carrier. Instead, it was the law of Colorado which had that effect.\u201d <em>(Crossley </em>v. <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co., supra, </em>198 Neb. at p. 29 [251 N.W.2d at p. 385].)</p>\n<p id=\"AO3\">The rationale of <em>Crossley, supra, </em>is compelling. In the case at bar Hamblin did have public liability insurance at the time of the accident, and such insurance in fact exceeded the minimum California requirement by $10,000. Had the injuries suffered by appellants met, in monetary terms, the threshold requirement of Hawaiian law, a suit for general damages could have been maintained under circumstances con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>sonant with California\u2019s current notion of minimum financial responsibility and fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">We therefore conclude that appellants cannot recover under their uninsured motorist coverage both because the Hamblin vehicle was insured, and because Hamblin had no legal liability toward appellants\u2014 the no-fault system having abolished tort liability where, as here, the medical expenses of an injured party do not exceed $1,500. (Cf. Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.2, subd. (a)(2)): \u201cUninsured motorists coverage insures ... for all sums within the financial responsibility limits which such persons are <em>legally entitled t\u00f3 recover. </em>...\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">A claimant must establish the legal liability of the uninsured motorist before he can recover. It is beyond dispute that Hamblin bore no such liability to the Crocketts in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Racanelli, P. J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 28, 1980.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\">We note that, in the case at bar, since no action could be maintained against Hamblin in Hawaii, State Farm has available to it no such subrogation right as was considered a partial justification for the allowance of uninsured motorists coverage in both <em>Taylor, supra, </em>and <em>Kirkley </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 1078 [95 Cal.Rptr. 427].</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
