He argues that the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution of the United States require a transcript to be delivered to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-21\">This court has held that an indigent prisoner is entitled to relevant portions of a transcript upon, <em>inter alia, </em>appeal or in seeking post-conviction relief. <em>State, ex rel. Partee, </em>v. <em>McMahon </em>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 243, 24 O.O. 2d 386, 193 N.E. 2d 266. However, the right is subject to certain limits. One limit previously established is that, <em>inter alia, </em>appeal or post-conviction action must be pending at the time the transcript is sought. <em>State, ex rel. Partee, </em>v. <em>McMahon, supra; State, ex rel. Catlino, </em>v. <em>Clerk of Courts </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St. 2d 101, 38 O.O. 2d 255, 224 N.E. 2d 130; <em>State, ex rel. Clark, </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St. 2d 107, 17 O.O. 3d 65, 406 N.E. 2d 1128. Another limit is that only one copy of a transcript need be provided. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>State, ex rel. Vitoratos, </em>v. <em>Walsh </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 467, 20 O.O. 2d 84, 183 N.E. 2d 917, appeal dismissed (1962), 371 U.S. 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Here, the record does not indicate appellant has a petition for post-conviction relief pending, but does indicate he has already been provided with one transcript. Accordingly, he has no clear legal right to the relief requested, nor does appellee have a clear duty to provide such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The judgment of the court of appeals is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b70-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
