The judge ruled that as this paper had been introduced without objection, both sides could use it, and that it could not be limited by the defence to so much only as contained the testimony of Bond. On appeal, this ruling was held not to be erroneous. <em>State </em>v. Campbell, 1 <em>Rich., </em>124.</p>\n<p id=\"Afhy\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
