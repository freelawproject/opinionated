The Circuit Judge (Aldrich) held that there was no excusable negligence, and refused the motion. On appeal, <em>held, </em>that the motion was addressed to the discretion of the Circuit Court, and that there was no abuse of discretion in this case, as the summons and complaint were served upon the president of the defendant corporation, its duly accredited officer, and there was no evidence of any collusion between such officer and the plaintiff; and if such officer was guilty of negligence in. not making and prosecuting a defence, the plaintiff is not responsible; and, further, as the motion was not made by the defendant corporation, but by individual members thereof, without authority from the defendant as a corporation. If the judge erred in expressing his opinion as to the merits of the defence, that would not avail appellants, for it is the duty of this court \u201csimply to inquire whether there is any error in the <em>judgment </em>rendered, and not whether <em>the reasons </em>given to support it are sound.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
