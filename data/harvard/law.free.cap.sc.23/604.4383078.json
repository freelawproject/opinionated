This court saw no error in this charge. \u201cIt is well settled that a levy under an execution or other process is <em>prima facie </em>satisfaction <em>pro </em>tanto, and until the plaintiffs showed, as they failed to do, that this cotton was not applicable to their claim, they were bound to account for its value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AmQo\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In this case there was a petition for a rehearing, which was refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
