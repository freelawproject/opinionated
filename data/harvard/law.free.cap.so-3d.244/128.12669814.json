(\"the mother\") appeals a judgment of the Lee Juvenile Court (\"the juvenile court\") denying her request for a return of custody of her minor child from B.B. and A.B. (\"the custodians\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The record indicates the following pertinent procedural history and facts. The mother has lived in Colorado for the last 15 years. The child at issue was born in February 2014 in Colorado. The mother ended her relationship with R.L., who is the child's alleged father, in January 2015, when the child was almost 11 months old, and she moved with the child to a new apartment in the Denver, Colorado, area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On approximately January 10, 2015, the mother was arrested for driving under the influence after being stopped for a minor traffic violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following that arrest, the Colorado Department of Human Services (\"CDHS\") took the child into protective custody. Testimony from A.B. indicates that the child spent 19 days in foster care in Colorado. Thereafter, with the mother's permission, CDHS contacted the custodians, who live in Alabama, about serving as a relative placement for the child, and they agreed to take the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The child has lived in the custodians' home since January 29, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At some point shortly after the child came to live with them, the custodians filed a dependency petition in the juvenile court. The record on appeal in this action does not contain that dependency petition or indicate the date on which it was filed. On May 10, 2015, approximately three and a half months after the child was placed in the custodians' home, the juvenile court entered a pendente lite order based on the agreement of the parties. In that May 10, 2015, order, the juvenile court, among other things, found the child dependent and awarded pendente lite custody of the child to the custodians.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 30, 2016, the mother filed a petition in the juvenile court in which she sought a return of custody of the child. The juvenile-court clerk docketed that petition as an .02 action, but it is clear that the mother's request was for a return of custody in the original dependency action and that the juvenile court properly treated it as such.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The juvenile court conducted an ore tenus hearing. On February 14, 2017, the juvenile court entered a judgment in which it, among other things, found the child dependent, awarded custody of the child to the custodians, awarded the mother visitation, and ordered that the dependency action be closed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The mother filed a postjudgment motion on February 16, 2017. The mother filed a notice of appeal before the juvenile court ruled on that motion and before the motion could be denied by operation of law. The mother's appeal was held in abeyance until March 2, 2017, when the postjudgment motion was deemed denied by operation of law, and it became effective on that date. Rule 4(a)(5), Ala. R. App. P.;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M.G. v.

App. 2012). Thus, the mother's appeal was timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The mother's appeal focuses on her contention that the juvenile court's judgment finding the child dependent was not supported by the evidence. The mother has not addressed the issue of the juvenile court's subject-matter jurisdiction to consider the dependency action, and the custodians did not file a brief in this court. \"This court may not presume ... that a statutory court of limited jurisdiction, like the juvenile court, ... has the prerequisite subject-matter jurisdiction over a particular matter.\"\n   <em>\n    D.G. v.

Code 1975, governs a juvenile court's subject-matter jurisdiction over child-custody actions such as this one. According to the UCCJEA, a \"child custody proceeding\" is \"[a] proceeding in a court in which legal custody, physical custody, or visitation with respect to a child is an issue.\" \u00a7 30-3B-102(4), Ala.

A \"child custody determination\" is defined under the UCCJEA as \"[a] judgment, decree, or other order of a court providing for the legal custody, physical custody, or visitation with respect to a child.

The court then concluded that \"we resolve the apparent conflict between the two sections, in keeping with the purposes of the UCCJEA, by applying the construction that finds the existence of a home state, rather than the one that finds that the children had no home state.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6924050\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/144/319/#p324\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6924050\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/144/319/#p324\">\n    at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It does not appear that, at the time the dependency action was initiated, Alabama could be said to be the child's \"home state\" under \u00a7 30-3B-201(a)(1) or \u00a7 30-3B-102(7).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Siderius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6924050\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/144/319/#p324\">\n    supra\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the definitions of \"home state\" under the UCCJEA). The child had been in Alabama less than four months when the May 10, 2015, pendente lite dependency order was entered; again, the record does not indicate when the dependency action was initiated, but it was clearly initiated before the May 10, 2015, order was entered. Thus, it is not possible that the child was living in Alabama for the six months preceding the initiation of that action that might create \"home state\" jurisdiction in Alabama under the UCCJEA. Rather, the child had been living in Colorado for his entire life, i.e., 11 months, at the time he was removed from the mother's custody in Colorado in January 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although this court does not currently so decide, it appears that Colorado was the child's home state. The record currently before this court does not clearly indicate whether any action pertaining to the child had been filed by the custodians or by CDHS in Colorado, or if any such action had been transferred to the juvenile court pursuant to Colorado's version of the UCCJEA. We note that A.B. testified that the child had been in foster care in Colorado for 19 days before the child was moved to her home in late January 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is extremely doubtful that the State of Colorado would deprive the mother of her fundamental right to custody of her child by placing the child in foster care without first initiating a dependency action. However, the record before this court does not indicate whether such a Colorado dependency action was initiated and, if so, whether, after the child was moved to the custodians' home in Alabama, the Colorado courts declined to exercise jurisdiction over the child pursuant to provisions similar to \u00a7 30-3B-201(a)(2) or (3) in Colorado's version of the UCCJEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We acknowledge that, under certain circumstances, an Alabama court may take actions pertaining to a child under the emergency-jurisdiction provision of the UCCJEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-3B-204, Ala. Code 1975. However, \"a juvenile court exercising temporary emergency jurisdiction under \u00a7 30-3B-204 does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate dependency and award custody\n   by virtue of the limited jurisdiction provided to it.\"\n   <em>\n    J.D. v. Lauderdale Cty. Dep't of Human Res.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6998505\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/121/381/#p385\">\n    121 So.3d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 385 (Ala. Civ. App. 2013). Thus, the juvenile court, if acting under \u00a7 30-3B-204, would arguably have had jurisdiction to enter the May 10, 2015, pendente lite order. However, in order to properly exercise subject-matter jurisdiction after utilizing emergency jurisdiction under the UCCJEA, the juvenile court would have had to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 30-3B-204, including provisions specifying that it communicate with a Colorado court that might have exercised jurisdiction over the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record before this court contains no indication that the juvenile court has done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The record is not conclusive with regard to the question of jurisdiction.... We are simply not presented with sufficient evidence to enable us to determine whether jurisdiction was proper in the juvenile court in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    D.B. v. Coffee Cty.

Thus, given the lack of evidence in this case pertaining to whether the juvenile court properly exercised jurisdiction over the dependency action, we reverse the judgment of the juvenile court and remand the cause for a timely determination by the juvenile court, based, if necessary, on its receipt of additional evidence, on the issue of its jurisdiction under the UCCJEA.\n   <em>\n    D.B. v.
