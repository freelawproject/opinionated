However, we grant this writ for the limited purpose to remand this matter to the trial court for correction of the minute entry to comport with the plea as reflected in the transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 12, 2015, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney's office filed a bill of information in Second Parish Court for the Parish of Jefferson, charging defendant with one count of theft under $500.00 in violation of La. R.S. 14:67. The State alleged that defendant committed theft of under $500.00 cash money from Genuine Parts Company d/b/a National Automotive Parts Association (\"NAPA\"), defendant's former employer, between January 21, 2015, and February 6, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant filed numerous motions in both state and federal court. On December 11, 2015, in Second Parish Court, defendant filed a \"Pro Se Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint and/or Motion to Transfer Venue Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his motion, defendant alleged multiple due process violations, including a coerced confession, defective service of process, and a judge who could not be impartial.

On November 3, 2016, the district attorney filed a motion to strike\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleadings filed by the defendant in the state court proceeding, arguing that the court previously appointed counsel, Jesse Beasley, to represent defendant. That motion was granted on November 3, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 8, 2017, following defendant's Sanity Commission hearing during which defendant was represented by counsel, the court determined defendant was competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 14, 2017, defendant entered an unconditional guilty plea before an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   judge, pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. art. 894. According to the\n   <em>\n    Boykin v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   form, defendant waived his right to a trial, the State's obligation to prove defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, the right against self-incrimination, and the right to appellate review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant was represented by appointed counsel, and was sentenced to thirty days in parish prison, deferred, eleven months of probation, and thirty hours of community service. This timely writ, seeking review of defendant's conviction and sentence, follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because defendant pleaded guilty, the underlying facts were not fully developed at a trial. During the guilty plea colloquy, defendant admitted to the factual basis for his theft charge-that he committed theft of less than $750.00 in cash money from NAPA on February 9, 2015, in violation of La. R.S. 14:67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to the NAPA internal investigation, on February 9, 2015, after noticing a $40.00 shortage in cash register deposits, Darrell Yates, the store manager of the Marrero NAPA location, contacted Greg Galle, NAPA's District Manager for Loss Prevention, regarding a suspected theft. According to NAPA's internal investigation, Yates, on a closed circuit television, observed defendant, a NAPA delivery driver, approach the store's cash register while the clerk was away from the register, put a key in the register, take money,\n   look around to see if anyone noticed, and leave the store to make a delivery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to NAPA's report, defendant acknowledged in writing his responsibility for the missing funds from the cash register. Subsequently, Officer Adrian Brouillette of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office issued a misdemeanor summons to defendant for theft in violation of La. R.S. 14:67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In this\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   writ application, defendant seeks review of thirteen assignments of error-ranging from violations of his constitutional rights to multiple claims that defendant was prejudiced throughout the proceedings-and seeks a withdrawal of his guilty plea. Defendant additionally asserts an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, contending that his trial counsel was ineffective and forced him to plead guilty without his consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To the extent defendant argues that his guilty plea should be withdrawn, only pleas that are constitutionally infirm may be withdrawn by appeal or post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v.

A guilty plea is constitutionally infirm if it is not entered freely and voluntarily, if the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   colloquy is inadequate, or when a defendant is induced to enter a plea by a plea bargain or what he believes to be a plea bargain and the bargain is not kept.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12384494\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/224/1179/#p1185\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At a minimum, under\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   , the defendant must be notified of the waiver of three constitutional rights-the right to trial by jury,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination and defendant's right to confront his accuser.\n   <em>\n    State v.

If the defendant does not waive these rights, he has been denied due process of law as the plea was not given freely and knowingly.\n   <em>\n    Eiermann\n   </em>\n   , 224 So.3d at 1224 (citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

The guilty plea transcript reflects that defendant waived his right to trial, the State's requirement to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, his right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, his right against self-incrimination, and his right to appellate review. During his guilty plea colloquy with the Court, defendant acknowledged that he was in fact guilty of theft. Defendant stated that no threats or promises were made to him to encourage him to plead guilty and acknowledged that his guilty plea could be used to enhance any future conviction under the habitual offender law. Defendant stated that he understood the rights he was waiving, and he signed a waiver of rights form indicating that he understood the significance of his guilty plea. Defendant was further informed that he would be sentenced to thirty days deferred in parish prison, eleven\n   months of probation, and thirty hours of community service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We find that the plea colloquy along with the signed waiver of rights form constitute a sufficient affirmative showing on the record that defendant was advised of his rights, understood those rights, and that he made an intelligent and knowing waiver of his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In this case, defendant entered an unconditional guilty plea which, by its nature, admits factual guilt and waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings prior to the entering of the plea.\n   <em>\n    State v.

An unconditional guilty plea waives all non-jurisdictional defects and bars a defendant from later asserting any defects on appellate review. Because defendant pleaded guilty in this case, we do not consider defendant's assignments of error arising out of the trial court proceedings that have been waived by his unconditional guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However, defendant also raises an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim. The Louisiana Supreme Court has generally found that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is best addressed through an application for post-conviction relief, rather than on direct appeal, so a full evidentiary hearing may be held in the district court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209374\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/761/791/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant personally acknowledged that he understood the rights he was waiving. Further, the court asked defendant whether he \"acknowledge[d] that no promises or threats have been made to encourage you to enter a plea of guilty,\" to which defendant responded, \"Yes.\" The record reflects defendant was sentenced to thirty days deferred in parish prison, eleven months of probation, and thirty hours of community service, well below the maximum sentence provided for in La.
