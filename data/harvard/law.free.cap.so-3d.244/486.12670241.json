Defendant pled not guilty and requested a jury trial. The charges against Defendant and Jones were severed, and Defendant was tried by himself. Defendant never contested the fact that he committed a simple robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A jury convicted Defendant of the lesser charge of simple robbery, a violation of La.R.S. 14:65. The trial court sentenced Defendant to the maximum sentence of seven years at hard labor, to run consecutively to any other time being served. That sentence has since been vacated, and Defendant has been adjudicated a third felony offender. The appeal of that adjudication is before this court in docket number 17-944.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v.

This motion will not be acted on until this court performs a thorough independent review of the record after providing the appellant an opportunity to file a brief in his or her own behalf. This court's review of the record will consist of (1) a review of the bill of information or indictment to insure the defendant was properly charged; (2) a review of all minute entries to insure the defendant was present at all crucial stages of the proceedings, the jury composition and verdict were correct and the sentence is legal; (3) a review of all pleadings in the record; (4) a review of the jury sheets; and (5) a review of all transcripts to determine if any ruling provides an arguable basis for appeal.

Thus, counsel's\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief must review the procedural history and the evidence presented at trial and provide \"a detailed and reviewable assessment for both the defendant and the appellate court of whether the appeal is worth pursuing in the first place.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Counsel notes the State proved all the elements of the crime of simple robbery. Indeed, Defendant\n   never contested his guilt and offered to plead guilty to that offense prior to trial. Counsel further notes the alleged impropriety of the Sulphur Police Department and the involvement of Sergeant Robbins, the victim's husband, in the investigation. Counsel concludes that any potential error resulting from this alleged impropriety would be harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant filed a motion to suppress the statement he gave to the victim's husband. Defendant withdrew the motion after he learned the statement could not be located. Likewise, Defendant filed a motion to produce the clothes he was wearing at the time of his arrest. The clothing was apparently lost after the arrest. The trial court allowed Defendant to wear clothing at trial that testimony established was similar to what he wore at the time of the offense. Counsel concludes any potential issue concerning the lost clothing was harmless. Finally, counsel addresses Defendant's request to tell the jury the penalty range for first degree robbery and simple robbery. The trial court allowed counsel to provide only the mandatory sentences. Counsel concluded the law did not require the trial court to provide the penalty range and found no appealable error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant made several objections in pre-trial motions and at trial that were overruled. However, Defendant admitted he committed simple robbery. He went to trial solely to defeat the allegation that he led the victim to believe he was armed with a dangerous weapon, the element that distinguishes simple robbery from first degree robbery. The overruled pre-trial and trial objections concerned that element of the charged offense. Thus, once the jury convicted Defendant of simple robbery, those pre-trial and trial issues were of no moment for Defendant and would not present any non-frivolous issues for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant's sentence was ultimately vacated by the later multiple offender proceeding, and he was resentenced under the multiple offender guidelines. Thus, any appeal concerning the underlying sentence for simple robbery would be frivolous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In short, our review of the record reveals no non-frivolous issues Defendant could raise on appeal. Accordingly, the motion to withdraw filed by counsel is granted, and Defendant's conviction is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Appellate counsel's motion to withdraw is granted and Defendant's conviction is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    MOTION TO WITHDRAW GRANTED; CONVICTION AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The above and foregoing Motion considered,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that PAULA C.
