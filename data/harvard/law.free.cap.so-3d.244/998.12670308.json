In April of that year, Lee filed an amended Rule 32 petition. In August of 2007, the circuit court issued an order summarily dismissing Lee's Rule 32 petition.

In his petition, Lee argued that Alabama's capital-sentencing scheme is unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   . On June 16, 2016, the State filed a motion to dismiss Lee's petition. In its motion, the State argued that Lee's petition was procedurally barred under Rule 32.2(b), Ala. R. Crim. P., because it was successive, and under Rule 32.2(a)(4), Ala. Crim. App., because Lee's claim was raised and addressed on direct appeal. The State also argued that\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   did not apply retroactively to a collateral challenge to a death sentence. Finally, the State argued that Lee's\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   claim was facially without merit. On July 29, 2016, Lee filed an opposition to the State's motion to dismiss. On August 5, 2016, the circuit court granted the State's motion and dismissed Lee's petition. Lee appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, Lee first argues that the circuit court's order dismissing his Rule 32 petition did not reflect that court's independent judgment; therefore, the order must be reversed. Specifically, Lee argues that the circuit court adopted as its order a proposed order filed by the State. According to Lee, the order prepared by the State did not address all the arguments he had raised in his brief opposing dismissal. He also argues that the court's order incorrectly characterizes one of his arguments. Thus, Lee concludes the circuit court's order was not the product of the circuit court's independent judgment and must be reversed. This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Recently, this Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \" 'Alabama courts have consistently held that even when a trial court adopts verbatim a party's proposed order, the findings of fact and conclusions of law are those of the trial court and they may be reversed only if they are clearly erroneous.'\n   <em>\n    McGahee v.
