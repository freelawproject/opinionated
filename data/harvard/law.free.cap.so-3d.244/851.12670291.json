R.S. 14:402. Defendant pled not guilty to the charge at his arraignment on September 8, 2017. On September 28, 2017, defendant withdrew his not guilty pleas and pled guilty as charged. Defendant was sentenced by the trial court to 30 days at hard labor with credit for time served, pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. art. 880, with the sentence to run consecutively to any other sentence he was then serving. Various fines and fees were also imposed. On October 13, 2017, defendant sent a letter to the trial court requesting an appeal, which the trial court considered as a motion for appeal and granted on October 24, 2017. This timely appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because the instant conviction was a result of a guilty pleas, the underlying facts of the matter were not fully developed at trial.

The supreme court explained that an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief must demonstrate by full discussion and analysis that appellate counsel \"has cast an advocate's eye over the trial record and considered whether any ruling made by the trial court, subject to the contemporaneous objection rule, had a significant, adverse impact on shaping the evidence presented to the jury for its consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11870799\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/241/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When conducting a review for compliance with\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   , an appellate court must conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the appeal is wholly frivolous.\n   <em>\n    Bradford\n   </em>\n   , 95-929 at 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n    676 So.2d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If, after an independent review, the reviewing court determines there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal,\n   it may grant counsel's motion to withdraw and affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence. However, if the court finds any legal point arguable on the merits, it may either deny the motion and order the court-appointed attorney to file a brief arguing the legal point(s) identified by the court, or grant the motion and appoint substitute appellant counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant's appellate counsel asserts that after a detailed review of the record, he could find no non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal. Counsel indicates that defendant pled guilty pursuant to a counseled plea agreement, and that the trial court's colloquy was thorough and complete. Appellate counsel has filed a motion to withdraw as attorney of record and has mailed defendant a copy of his brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The State asserts that the record shows that prior to defendant's guilty plea, the district court fully explained to him the rights he was waiving, and defendant affirmed his understanding. The State agrees with counsel that defendant made a knowing and voluntary act of pleading guilty. Further, defendant was informed of his right to appeal. The State concludes, therefore, that defendant's convictions and sentences should be affirmed and that appellate counsel should be allowed to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   An independent review of the record supports appellate counsel's assertion that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The record shows that defendant was present at the sentencing and was represented by counsel. Prior to sentencing, the trial court entered into a colloquy with defendant wherein the court advised defendant of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights and asked defendant if he understood that he was waiving those rights by pleading guilty. Defendant was advised of the sentence he would receive if he pled guilty. Defendant's sentence was in the statutory range for a violation of La. R.S. 14:402. Furthermore, La. C.Cr.P. art. 881.2(A)(2) provides that a defendant cannot appeal or seek review of a sentence imposed in conformity with a plea agreement which was set forth in the record at the time of the plea. Defendant was also properly advised of the time limitations for filing post-conviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because appellant counsel's brief adequately demonstrates by full discussion and analysis that he has reviewed the trial court proceedings and cannot identify any basis for a non-frivolous appeal and an independent review of the record supports counsel's assertion, we affirm defendant's sentence and conviction and grant appellate counsel's motion to withdraw as attorney of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERROR PATENT DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant requests an error patent review.
