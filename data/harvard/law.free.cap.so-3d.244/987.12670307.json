(\"the stepfather\") filed in the St. Clair Probate Court (\"the probate court\") a petition under the Alabama Adoption Code (\"the AAC\"), \u00a7 26-10A-1 et seq., Ala. Code 1975. In that petition, the stepfather sought to adopt a child born in April 2015 to his wife, A.L.D. (\"the mother\"), and, in support of that petition, he submitted, among other things, a consent to the adoption executed by the mother that expressed her desire that the stepfather adopt the child. Also in that petition, the stepfather identified R.W.S. as the putative father of the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26-10A-2(12), Ala. Code 1975 (defining the term \"putative father\" as \"[t]he alleged or reputed father\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 15, 2016, the probate court entered an interlocutory order granting custody of the child to the stepfather, ordering that he provide for the child's support, and scheduling the adoption action for a final hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26-10A-18, Ala. Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 12, 2016, R.W.S., appearing pro se, filed an objection to the proposed adoption; R.W.S. asserted in that filing that he wanted to \"establish his rights\" as the father of the child. An attorney appeared on behalf of R.W.S. on December 1, 2016. The probate court received ore tenus evidence at a January 13, 2017, hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 23, 2017, the probate court entered a judgment granting the stepfather's petition to adopt the child and noting that it had denied R.W.S.'s opposition to the proposed adoption. R.W.S., represented by new counsel, filed a postjudgment motion on February 3, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of that postjudgment motion, R.W.S. submitted copies of text messages and e-mails between the mother and him, as well as a January 27, 2017, affidavit executed by R.W.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 14, 2017, R.W.S. filed an amended motion in which, among other things, he sought relief pursuant to Rule 59(e), Ala. R. Civ. P., and Rule 60(b), Ala. R. Civ. P. R.W.S. submitted another affidavit, dated February 14, 2017, in support of that amended motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 17, 2017, the probate court entered an order concluding that R.W.S.'s February 3, 2017, postjudgment motion had been denied by operation of law and denying the February 14, 2017, amended motion. R.W.S. had appealed on February 16, 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and this court assigned that appeal number 2160344. Later, on March 31, 2017, R.W.S. filed another notice of appeal, which was assigned appeal number 2160518. In his notice of appeal in appeal number 2160518, R.W.S. indicated that he was appealing the denial of that part of his February 14, 2016, amended motion in which he had sought relief pursuant to Rule 60(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   R.W.S. moved to consolidate the two appeals, and this court originally denied that motion on May 31, 2017. Upon reconsideration, this court has granted the motion to consolidate the two appeals and has considered the two appeals together. We note that the briefs R.W.S. submitted in each of the two appeals are virtually identical. The difference in the two appellate briefs arises in appeal number 2150518, in which R.W.S. added a paragraph pertaining\n   to the standard for reviewing a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   R.W.S. argues in his appellate brief that the probate court erred in determining that his February 3, 2017, postjudgment motion was denied by operation of law in appeal number 2060344. The period for timely appealing an adoption judgment of a probate court is 14 days from the entry of the adoption judgment, unless that time is extended by the filing of a timely postjudgment motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00a7 26-10A-26(a), Ala.

In that order, the probate court did not specifically rule on the February 3, 2017, postjudgment motion by denying it or granting it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, by failing to rule on the February 3, 2017, postjudgment motion by February 17, 2017, the probate court did allow the motion to be denied by operation of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 59.1, Ala.

Thus, the probate court's incorrect conclusion in its February 17, 2017, order that the February 3, 2017, postjudgment motion had already been denied by operation of law was of no effect. In appeal number 2160344, R.W.S. timely appealed the adoption judgment and the denial of his February 3, 2017, postjudgment motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although neither party raises the issue, this court must also examine the timeliness of R.W.S.'s February 14, 2017, \"amended\" motion that purported, in its title, to seek relief pursuant to Rule 59(e), Ala. R. Civ. P., and Rule 60(b), Ala. R. Civ. P.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C &amp; D Logging v.

In purporting to seek relief pursuant to Rule 60(b) in the February 14, 2017, amended motion, R.W.S. stated only that \"[i]f this amended motion is deemed untimely pursuant to Rule 59, [R.W.S.] moves for relief under Rule 60(b).\" R.W.S. made no argument in the February 14, 2017, amended motion pertaining to the various forms of relief from a judgment that are available under Rule 60(b). After examining the substance of the February 14, 2017, amended motion, we conclude that R.W.S. sought only relief available under Rule 59(e). Accordingly, we cannot conclude that any part of the February 14, 2017, amended motion could be argued to be a Rule 60(b) motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burgess v.

R.W.S. has failed to adequately address his apparent contention that the probate court erred in denying that part of his February 14, 2017, amended motion that he contended was made pursuant to Rule 60(b).

R.W.S.'s February 14, 2017, amended postjudgment motion, to the extent that it sought relief pursuant to Rule 59, was not filed within 14 days of the entry of the January 23, 2017, adoption judgment; therefore, under different facts, that motion might have been determined to be untimely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte A.M.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8191915\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/997/1008/\">\n    997 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1013 n. 3 (noting that a Rule 59 postjudgment motion taken from an adoption judgment must be filed within 14 days of the entry of that judgment).

However, the probate court did explicitly deny that motion in its February 17, 2017, order. Therefore, it appears that the probate court exercised its discretion and did consider the February 14, 2017, amended postjudgment motion, and, out of an abundance of caution, we address the issues raised in R.W.S.'s briefs on appeal accordingly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kulakowski v.

The AAC requires that a child's mother, a child's \"presumed father,\" or, under certain circumstances, a child's putative father provide express or implied consent to a proposed adoption of the child. \u00a7 26-10A-7(a), Ala. Code 1975;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26-10A-2(11) and (12), Ala.

Code 1975 (explaining the circumstances under which a court may determine that a parent has given implied consent to an adoption of his or her child). Such consent, whether express or implied, must be established by clear and convincing evidence. \u00a7 26-10A-7(a), Ala. Code 1975;\n   <em>\n    J.D.S. v.

App. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is undisputed that R.W.S. did not expressly consent to the adoption. The prevailing argument in R.W.S.'s defense of the adoption action below and in his appellate briefs filed in this court is his contention that his actions do not indicate that he impliedly consented to the adoption. In the February 14, 2017, amended postjudgment motion, R.W.S., in addition to reiterating some of his earlier arguments, set forth different grounds for seeking to set aside the adoption judgment than those he had argued in his original, February 3, 2017, postjudgment motion. In his original, February 3, 2017, postjudgment motion, R.W.S. maintained that he was the child's \"putative father\" and that his consent to the adoption was required under the AAC. In his February 14, 2017, amended postjudgment motion, R.W.S. argued, among other things, that his consent to the adoption was required because, he said, he is the child's \"presumed father\" under the AAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The probate court, in its January 23, 2017, judgment, found that R.W.S. was a \"putative father.\" A putative father's consent to an adoption is needed only if he is known to the court and \"he complies with Section 26-10C-1\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   he responds within 30 days to the notice he receives under Section 26-10A-17(a)(10) [of the AAC].\" \u00a7 26-10A-7(a)(5) (emphasis added). R.W.S. was served with notice of the action by publication, and the record indicates that he responded to the adoption petition within 30 days of that notice; accordingly, it is not disputed that he \"respond[ed] to the notice\" required under the AAC. \u00a7 26-10A-7(a)(5). Section 26-10C-1, Ala. Code 1975, the other statute with which a putative father must comply in order for his consent to an adoption to be necessary under \u00a7 26-10A-7(a)(5), requires that a putative father file on the putative-father registry a notice of his intent to claim paternity of a child so that he can, among other things, preserve his ability to contest a proposed adoption of the\n   child. That section further provides, among other things, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[a]ny person who claims to be the natural father of a child and fails to file his notice of intent to claim paternity pursuant to [ \u00a7 26-10C-1 ](a) prior to or within 30 days of the birth of a child born out of wedlock, shall be deemed to have given an irrevocable consent in any adoption proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"This subsection shall be the exclusive procedure available for any person who claims to be the natural father of a child born out of wedlock ... to entitle that person to notice of and the opportunity to contest any adoption proceeding ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00a7 26-10C-1(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As is discussed in more detail, infra, the record before this court contains no indication that R.W.S. properly filed a notice of intent to claim paternity of the child on the putative-father registry. In fact, R.W.S. alleged in his February 3, 2017, postjudgment motion that he had not filed a notice of intent to claim paternity on the putative-father registry. In his arguments asserted in his briefs on appeal, R.W.S. concedes that did not \"timely\" register as required by \u00a7 26-10C-1 and \u00a7 26-10A-7(a)(5) in order to be able to contest the adoption of the child as a putative father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   R.W.S. contends on appeal that the probate court was required to find in its January 23, 2017, adoption judgment that he had impliedly consented to the adoption through his conduct. However, as is explained above, the consent of a putative father to an adoption is not required if he does not respond to notice of the adoption action within 30 days\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   if he has not registered on the putative-father registry. The probate court, in its judgment, stated that it had considered R.W.S.'s contest to the adoption but had denied that contest. Thus, that judgment can be interpreted, by applying the foregoing law, as rejecting R.W.S.'s contest to the adoption on the basis that, given the finding that he was a putative father as well as the lack of evidence that he had registered on the putative-father registry and his concession that he did not register, his consent to the adoption was not necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26-10A-7(a)(5). We conclude that, under the facts of this case, R.W.S. has failed to demonstrate that, in his status as a putative father, his consent to the adoption of the child was necessary, and, therefore, he has failed to demonstrate that the probate court erred by not including in its January 23, 2017, judgment a specific finding on the issue of his consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   R.W.S. argues, citing the comment to \u00a7 26-10A-24, Ala. Code 1975, governing contested adoption hearings, that his \"right to notice ... [under] \u00a7 26-10A-17 is meaningless if [he was] not provided with an opportunity to be heard.\" R.W.S. does not contend, and the record would not support an argument, that R.W.S., who was properly afforded notice of the adoption hearing, was not provided an opportunity to be heard at the January 23, 2017, hearing on the merits of his adoption contest. Accordingly, we cannot agree that the notice of the adoption action afforded R.W.S. was \"meaningless,\" as discussed in the comment to \u00a7 26-10A-24. In making his argument on this issue, however, R.W.S. also appears to contend that the right to notice and to be heard in a contest to the adoption created for him a right to be considered a person whose consent is required for an adoption.

As discussed above, however, R.W.S.'s consent to the adoption was not necessary because the probate court found that he was a putative father and that he had not registered on the putative-father registry. R.W.S. does not explicitly argue that the evidence does not support a determination that he was the child's putative father. He does assert that he should be treated as a presumed father, but he bases that argument on evidence he submitted after the probate court had entered its adoption judgment. This court can construe R.W.S.'s argument as one asserting that the probate court erred in finding that he was a putative father and, therefore, that the probate court also erred in concluding that his consent to the adoption was not necessary. Out of an abundance of caution, we so construe that argument. In doing so, we note that the resolution of this issue also disposes of R.W.S.'s argument that, assuming that he should be considered a presumed father of the child, the evidence did not support a determination that he had consented to the adoption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The probate court conducted a January 13, 2017, ore tenus evidentiary hearing on the stepfather's petition seeking to adopt the child. Representations in the parties' appellate briefs indicate that R.W.S. and the stepfather each testified and presented evidence at that ore tenus hearing. However, that hearing was not transcribed, and, therefore, there is no transcript of that hearing available for review by this court on appeal.

Our supreme court recently considered whether the holding in\n   <em>\n    Green Tree\n   </em>\n   had imposed a requirement that, in order for a trial court to consider an issue first raised in a postjudgment motion, the moving party had to explain why that argument had not been asserted before the trier of fact reached its decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alfa Mut.

The trial court is in the best position to determine whether the argument should be considered, and, in this case, the trial court specifically stated that it was 'in the interest of justice' that Culverhouse's belated argument be considered.

Rather, R.W.S. also wants this court to hold the probate court in error for, he says, failing to consider evidence he submitted in support of his February 3, 2017, postjudgment motion. Thus, in this case, R.W.S. is seeking to\n   <em>\n    present new evidence and make new legal arguments based on that additional evidence\n   </em>\n   . R.W.S. is not seeking to have the probate court reconsider a legal issue based on the evidence already presented to it. Rather, R.W.S. is, in essence, arguing that the probate court should allow him, and require the stepfather, to relitigate the adoption action by allowing him to present new evidence and to argue a new legal theory in defending the adoption action. R.W.S. does not contend that he was not afforded the opportunity to present that evidence and those arguments during the original adoption hearing, and he does not contend he was in any way prevented from asserting that he was the presumed father of the child. Thus, R.W.S. is actually seeking more than the mere reconsideration of the action under a new legal theory, as did the appellants in\n   <em>\n    Green Tree\n   </em>\n   , supra, and\n   <em>\n    Culverhouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917454\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/149/1072/#p1075\">\n    supra.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The probate court did not state a reason for its denial of the February 14, 2017, amended postjudgment motion.

R.W.S. admits that the probate court afforded him an opportunity to present evidence at the January 23, 2017, ore tenus hearing in opposition to the proposed adoption, and that he did so.

If no report of the evidence or proceedings at a hearing or trial was made, or if a transcript is unavailable, the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means, including the appellant's recollection. If the appellant prepares such a statement, the appellant shall serve it on the appellee within 28 days (4 weeks) after filing the notice of appeal; the appellee, within 14 days (2 weeks) after service, may serve on the appellant objections or proposed amendments to the statement.

R.W.S. makes no contention that he had raised that issue before the probate court entered the adoption judgment, or that the probate court erred in failing to consider the evidence presented at the adoption hearing as it related to an argument that he was the child's presumed father. In his original, February 3, 2017, postjudgment motion, R.W.S. made arguments that he was a putative father of the child, and he made allegations concerning the evidence presented at the adoption hearing; that purported evidence was relevant to whether R.W.S. should be considered a putative father. Even assuming, however, that it could be said that R.W.S. had raised at the adoption hearing the issue whether he was the child's presumed father, the probate court received evidence at that hearing that is not contained in the record before this court. Accordingly, even if the issue of whether R.W.S. was a presumed father had been raised during the adoption hearing, we would affirm because we are constrained to presume that the evidence received by the probate court but not before this court was sufficient to support the probate court's judgment.\n    <em>\n     Quick v.
