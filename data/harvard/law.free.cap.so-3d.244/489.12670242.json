The parties selected a jury on November 14, 2016; said jury began hearing evidence on November 15. On November 16, the jury returned a responsive verdict of negligent homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 15, the district court sentenced Defendant to five years, however, the transcript fails to show whether this time is to be served at hard labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant appeals, assigning four errors.

On March 22, 2016, Carlile went to a hospital with a broken nose and eye sockets, apparently the result of a beating from the victim. At about the same time that day, the victim was out fishing. Carlile returned to the trailer after her hospital visit; later Trahan arrived at the trailer and an argument ensued. Defendant came out of his room wearing a holstered handgun and ordered the victim to leave. The victim refused, and the argument escalated between the two men. At some point, the victim pulled off his hoodie; several witnesses interpreted this gesture as the beginning of a fight. Some witnesses said the victim advanced toward Defendant; there is no dispute the latter fired a lethal shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed for errors patent on the face of the record.

More specifically, he contends the State failed to prove he did not shoot the victim in self-defense. There is no dispute regarding whether Defendant shot the victim; the issue is simply whether the shooting was justified.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, an appellate court in Louisiana is controlled by the standard enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

No finder of fact shall be permitted to consider the possibility of retreat as a factor in determining whether or not the person who used deadly force had a reasonable belief that deadly force was reasonable and apparently necessary to prevent a violent or forcible felony involving life or great bodily harm or to prevent the unlawful entry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Generally, the witnesses appear to agree that the victim was arguing with his girlfriend in Defendant's trailer. Defendant came out of his room wearing a gun in a holster and told the victim that he needed to leave; the victim refused and the argument escalated. The victim took off or started to take off his hoodie in a manner that some witnesses interpreted as signifying he wanted to fight. Some witnesses also stated that the victim moved toward Defendant. There is no allegation that the victim was armed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We find the core issue in this case is the proportionality of the use of force. Regardless of any possibility of whether the victim was dangerous or aggressive, it is undisputed that Defendant used armed, deadly force against an unarmed individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Rather, he argues that the State failed to disprove that he acted in self-defense. Killing in self-defense is governed by La.R.S. 14:20(A), which states, in pertinent part, \"[a] homicide is justifiable: (1) When committed in self-defense by one who reasonably believes that he is in imminent danger of losing his life or receiving great bodily harm and that the killing is necessary to save himself from that danger.\" (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant contends that the killing was justifiable because he had his back against the wall, and was surrounded by the victim and the victim's two friends, Doucet and Jones. Further, he contends that shooting the victim was the only way he could escape.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The essence of his defense is that he was justified in responding to an attempted\n   punch by shooting his opponent in the chest at close range. We recognize that Dejean had two friends with him. Thus, Defendant may have genuinely felt endangered; further, some level of fear was objectively reasonable. However, the level of force he used to defend himself was far beyond what was necessary under the circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In the context of self-defense in a manslaughter prosecution, our court has observed in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   , the jury in the present case could rationally have concluded that Defendant did not act in self-defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   This analysis applies even if the jury believed the testimony of Defendant's most favorable witness, Ms. Bryant, the Defendant's mother. Of course, the State presented evidence that was less favorable to Defendant. Jones testified that Defendant walked to the bar's bathroom, and bumped into the victim, then bumped into the victim again on his way back. The victim then told him to watch where he was going, \"[a]nd the dude got\n   crazy.\" According to Jones, Defendant indicated that he wanted to resolve the issue outside, so Jones and Doucet followed him out of the bar. When they arrived outside, Defendant got near a wall and put his hand under his shirt. Jones testified that he saw Defendant had a gun, so then he and Doucet began backing up. The victim then came out and got in front of Defendant. When the victim touched his hat, Defendant shot him. Jones opined that the victim did not see the gun in Defendant's waistband. Doucet's testimony was similar, although he acknowledged that he did not see the initial jostling that apparently triggered the incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant did not deny shooting and killing the victim. His defense was justification. However, as mentioned earlier, responding to an oncoming punch by shooting the other person in the chest is an excessive response. Thus, the jury's determinations in the present case were not unreasonable. Therefore, the Defendant's reliance on self-defense is meritless.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Mincey\n   </em>\n   and the jurisprudence cited therein, we find Defendant used disproportionate force against the unarmed victim. This assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER TWO\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In his second assignment of error, Defendant complains the district court erred in not granting a mistrial due to improper remarks by the prosecutor during closing arguments. Specifically, he refers to the following passage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Everyone has a right to own a weapon. That is a right that we have. And in this situation, what you need to understand is that you, as a jury, if you were to come back not guilty, you would be allowing somebody to shoot-\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The court sustained Defendant's objection. Both parties also note an earlier portion of the prosecutor's argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Now that I've listed those two important parts, there was some other information that was provided to you, the jury. I'm sure you remember Mr. Casanave's opening statement, I do, where it was a dramatic leap across the room yelling and slamming his hand down right in front of you. I remember that, as if he was a linebacker attacking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   I told you what I was going to prove and show you in my opening. I don't believe that Mr. Casanave has proven his.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court overruled Defendant's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Further, he cites La.Code Crim.P. art. 774, which states, in part: \"The argument shall be confined to evidence admitted, to the lack of evidence, to conclusions of fact that the state or defendant may draw therefrom, and to the law applicable to the case. The argument shall not appeal to prejudice.\" Trial counsel lodged an objection which the court sustained. After the prosecutor had finished, Defendant's trial counsel moved for a mistrial at the bench; the court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant cites La.Code Crim.P. art. 771, which states, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   In the following cases, upon the request of the defendant or the state, the court shall promptly admonish the jury to disregard a remark or comment made during the trial, or in argument within the hearing of the jury, when the remark is irrelevant or immaterial and of such a nature that it might create prejudice against the defendant, or the state, in the mind of the jury:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (1) When the remark or comment is made by the judge, the district attorney,\n   or a court official, and the remark is not within the scope of Article 770[.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   While Defendant acknowledges the court did not allow the prosecutor to finish her statement, he argues she said enough to unduly prejudice his case. Defendant cites some general jurisprudence on this issue but no analogous cases. He observes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A prosecutor's predictions as to the consequences of a not guilty verdict, or the societal costs of such a result, are clearly improper and should be avoided.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant is not required to testify. No presumption of guilt may be raised and no inference of any kind may be drawn from the fact that the defendant did not testify.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Now that you have heard the relevant law of the offenses charged, I must explain to you your duties. Jurors should not be influenced by sympathy, passion, prejudice, bias, or public opinion. You are expected to reach a just verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant has not pointed to any analogous case that demonstrates the current situation gives rise to undue prejudice. Also, the first statement by the prosecutor\n   appears to be more of an argument that the evidence did not support claims made by defense counsel in his opening statement, rather than an attempt to shift or comment on the ultimate burden of proof. In light of the cases cited by both parties and the district court's instructions to the jury, this assignment lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER THREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In his third assignment of error, Defendant argues that his sentence is indeterminate, and the State agrees. A determinate sentence is required by La.Code Crim.P. art. 879 which states, \"If a defendant who has been convicted of an offense is sentenced to imprisonment, the court shall impose a determinate sentence.\" The parties agree that the transcript does not show whether the court sentenced Defendant to hard labor. Pursuant to La.R.S. 14:32(C)(1), a sentence for negligent homicide may be either with or without hard labor. Since the district court did not specify, the sentence is indeterminate and should be vacated. Further, the case should be remanded for the district court to impose a determinate sentence.\n   <em>\n    State v.
