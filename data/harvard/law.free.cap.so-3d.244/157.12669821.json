We have jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   art. V, \u00a7 2(a), Fla. Const.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Committee proposes that the Court amend standard jury instructions 3.12 (Verdict), 3.12(a) (Single Defendant, Multiple Counts or Informations), 3.12(c) (Multiple Counts or Informations, Multiple Defendants), and 3.12(d) (Legally Interlocking Counts), and adopt new instruction 3.12(f) (Crime Legally Interlocking with a Special Finding Within that Same Count). Following publication in\n   <em>\n    The Florida Bar News\n   </em>\n   , the Committee received comments from the Florida Public Defender Association (FPDA) and the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (FACDL), both pertaining to the proposal to amend instruction 3.12. The Court also published the Committee's proposals, and one comment was received from James Altman, Assistant State Attorney for the Ninth Judicial Circuit; the Committee responded to Mr. Altman's comment. The more significant amendments to the instructions are discussed below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Criminal jury instruction 3.12 (Verdict) is amended to include a directive to the trial court to include a provision if the\n   State is proceeding on both theories of first degree murder,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , premeditated and felony murder, on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Mansfield v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924123\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/911/1160/\">\n    911 So.2d 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2005). That specific provision is added as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   If you return a verdict of guilty to the charge of First Degree Murder, it is not necessary that all of you agree the State proved First Degree Premeditated Murder and it is not necessary that all of you agree the State proved First Degree Felony Murder. Instead, what is required is that all of you agree the State proved either First Degree Premeditated Murder or First Degree Felony Murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Instruction 3.12 also includes \"a sample of possible verdict forms for typical variables in combinations of defendants and charges.\" As amended, two special finding forms pertaining to felony reclassification under section 775.087, Florida Statutes (2017), are added, one under subsection (1) and the other under subsection (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   New standard criminal jury instruction 3.12(f) (Crime Legally Interlocking with a Special Finding Within that Same Count) is adopted to avoid the occurrence of \"true inconsistent verdicts,\" where the elements of a crime may legally interlock with a special finding within that same crime under the facts of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Proctor v.

The instructions as set forth in the appendix shall become effective when this opinion becomes final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   It is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   LABARGA, C.J., and LEWIS, QUINCE, CANADY, POLSTON, and LAWSON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   PARIENTE, J., concurs in result with an opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   PARIENTE, J., concurring in result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I concur in result for two reasons. First, although not inaccurate under our 2005 decision in\n   <em>\n    Mansfield v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924123\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/911/1160/\">\n    911 So.2d 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2005), there is no reason that instruction 3.12 is now necessary. Second, even with and especially in light of instruction 3.12, I urge, once again, for the use of special verdict forms as to the alternate theories of first-degree murder, unless the defense objects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Instruction 3.12\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As the Committee recognizes, this Court\n   has not addressed whether\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   affects the validity of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Mansfield\n   </em>\n   , holding that the jury is not required to reach a unanimous decision on the theory of first-degree murder.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924123\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/911/1160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924123\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/911/1160/\">\n    at 1178-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Mansfield\n   </em>\n   remains good law, and instruction 3.12 is accurate under the current law. That being said, it is unclear why this instruction is being adopted now, thirteen years after\n   <em>\n    Mansfield\n   </em>\n   . Nevertheless, as a result of the inclusion of instruction 3.12 in the standard jury instructions, as well as the implications the jury's findings in the guilt phase have on the penalty phase, it is more important than ever to use a special verdict form in the guilt phase to determine the jury's vote as to each theory of first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Guilt Phase Special Verdict Forms\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I join the Florida Public Defender Association in urging the trial courts to use a special verdict form in the guilt phase of capital prosecutions, especially when requested by the defendant. A special verdict form indicating each juror's determination as to whether the defendant is guilty of premeditated or felony first-degree murder would promote informed decision-making by the trial court in the guilt phase and, more importantly, by the jury in the penalty phase, especially after\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For example, if the jury did not unanimously conclude that the murder was premeditated, it should be clear that the CCP (cold, calculated, and premeditated) aggravating factor, requiring heightened premeditation, was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Likewise, when this Court previously rejected the Criminal Court Steering Committee's recommendation to mandate the use of guilt phase special verdict forms, in an opinion joined by Chief Justice Labarga and former Justice Perry, I explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The use of special verdict forms to specify felony murder and premeditated murder has numerous advantages as identified by the Steering Committee and those in favor of the forms. I would also defer to the expertise of our Steering Committee members, including the trial judges who have been utilizing the special verdict forms in first-degree murder cases and advocate their mandated use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The Committee's proposal should be adopted because the new verdict form would assist both the trial court in making decisions as to what penalty to impose and this Court in reviewing the sentence in the following ways. First, a special verdict form indicating that a defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder based on a premeditated murder theory would obviate the need for the trial court to perform the requisite felony murder analysis under\n   <em>\n    Enmund v. Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636586\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/782/\">\n    458 U.S. 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636586\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/782/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636586\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/782/\">\n    73 L.Ed.2d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982), and\n   <em>\n    Tison v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211931\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/137/\">\n    481 U.S. 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211931\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/137/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211931\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/137/\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987).... Second, if the State sought to establish either the cold, calculated, and premeditated or felony murder aggravators in the penalty phase, it would be helpful for the trial court to know how the jury viewed the evidence when discussing these aggravating circumstances in the sentencing order. Third, the use of a special verdict form in the guilt phase would guide the trial court in determining the applicable instructions in the penalty phase. Finally, the special verdict form would aid this Court in our review of evidentiary issues, as well as the sufficiency of the\n   evidence as to either premeditated or felony murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    In re Std.
