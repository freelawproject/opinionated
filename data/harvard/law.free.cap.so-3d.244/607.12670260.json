the findings from that exam were consistent with the victim's report of being raped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    Robert Demps\n   </strong>\n   testified that he saw Mays at Alpine in the early morning hours of June 4, 2012. Mays was looking for his cousin, Vanessa Mays, with whom Demps lived. Demps saw someone covered with a blanket in the passenger seat of a white Mustang, and heard Mays say: \"I wonder if she's thinking about me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    Markeva Daye\n   </strong>\n   lived with Robert Demps and Vanessa Mays at Alpine Villa Apartments, where she saw Mays later in the day. She overheard a conversation between Mays and Vanessa, in which Mays said about the victim: \"she was thinking about him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    Vanessa Mays\n   </strong>\n   testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \u2022 she received several phone calls from Mays in the early morning hours of June 4, 2012, but she did not answer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \u2022 when she saw Mays at the complex that day, he was talking about S.K. as a girlfriend, wondering if she was thinking about him;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 the key chain with the pink skulls belonged to Mays, and the key on the chain opened the padlock on Mays' trailer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \u2022 a man named Kevin, who had been mentioned in connection with the rape, was a friend of Mays'; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \u2022 she heard Mays say that he had sex with S.K.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    Dr. Jessica Esparza\n   </strong>\n   , the DNA Technical Leader for the Northwest Louisiana Crime Lab, was qualified as an expert in DNA testing. She testified that the chance of DNA found on the cigarette butt being from someone other than Mays was approximately 1 in 14.9 sextillion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    Richard Beighley\n   </strong>\n   , a criminalist with the crime lab, testified that he matched Mays' known fingerprints with prints on the condom wrapper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    Sherree McCain\n   </strong>\n   , deputy clerk with the Lincoln Parish Clerk's Office, identified a certified bill of information and minutes showing that Mays pled guilty to simple burglary on December 11, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    Mike Soileau\n   </strong>\n   , a deputy for the Lincoln Parish Sheriff, testified that Mays' fingerprints were on the bill of information relative to that burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The jury convicted Mays as charged. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    Insufficiency of Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   There is no dispute that S.K. was raped and kidnapped by one of the intruders. The defendant, through counsel, challenges the sufficiency of the evidence regarding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \u2022 his identity as the individual who actually raped and kidnapped S.K.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \u2022 his alleged possession of a firearm; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \u2022 the fact that the victim never saw either intruder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In his similar\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   argument, the defendant maintains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \u2022 he merely drove S.K. home after \"Kevin\" raped and kidnapped her;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \u2022 this constitutes a reasonable hypothesis of his innocence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   \u2022 the trial court failed to consider that Kevin participated in the crime;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \u2022 Kevin could have been the rapist/kidnapper; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   \u2022 there is no proof that he ever had the gun in his possession.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Our law on appellate review of insufficiency claims is well settled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   At the time of these events, the crimes were clearly defined.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The evidence in this horrific case is overwhelming. Each of the three convictions is amply supported by this record, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   \u2022 the victim's testimony;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   \u2022 the defendant's fingerprints found on the condom wrapper;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   \u2022 the DNA evidence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \u2022 his admission to his cousin that he had sex with the victim; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   \u2022 his inculpatory words overheard by Ms. Daye.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   While the record indicates that a second intruder was present, S.K. testified that only one man raped her, drove with her, and twice held a gun to her head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   There is no evidence to even remotely suggest that the second intruder, whether it was \"Kevin\" or someone else, was the man who raped and kidnapped S.K., or who was the only person who was armed. This evidence excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    ADDITIONAL\n    <em>\n     PRO SE\n    </em>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Prosecutorial misconduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Mays claims that the prosecution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   \u2022 \"completely ignored\" that there was another suspect in the house;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   \u2022 refused to allow him to say the name of \"Kevin,\" who the defendant claims was the second intruder and the actual rapist/kidnapper; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   \u2022 submitted false evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Mays cites his direct testimony when he is asked about \"Kevin.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   At this point, the district attorney's objection of hearsay was sustained. Mays now argues, based on the sustaining of this objection, that he was not allowed to mention \"Kevin's\" participation in the crime. Mays' arguments are simply not borne out by this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   It is clear that all parties, including the jury, heard references to the second intruder and all evidence that was not presented identifying Mays as the rapist, kidnapper, and gunman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Introduction of the audiotape\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Immediately prior to trial, the district attorney stated his intention to introduce into evidence a redacted audiotaped telephone conversation between Mays and his sister while Mays was incarcerated at Ouachita Correctional Center. This recording came to the attention of the district attorney shortly before trial. In the 10-minute conversation, Mays states, \"I'm not talking about the murder. I'm talking about the kidnapping.\" There are other portions of the conversation in which Mays references other criminal activity, including drug activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The district attorney indicated that the recording would be heavily redacted to eliminate references to any other criminal activity, but would be offered solely for the kidnapping remark. Ruling on the admissibility of the recording was delayed in order for defense counsel to review the recording. The following morning, the matter was again raised, at which time defense counsel informed the trial court that Mays \"would like the full version\" of the recording to be played. Defense counsel advised the trial court that he had cautioned Mays that the recording would contain inculpatory and prejudicial statements, but Mays insisted. Despite Mays' request, the court ordered references to murder and drugs be redacted. Mays objected and stated that he wanted the references to drugs left in the conversation that would be introduced and played for the jury. The court relented and ultimately agreed that only the reference to murder be redacted, which was against the advice of Mays' counsel. The state did not introduce the recording in its case-in-chief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Once Mays indicated that he was going to take the stand, his counsel offered the recording into evidence and the district attorney objected on the basis of hearsay. The state argued that because the recording was introduced by the defense, it was being offered for the truth of the matter asserted and was inadmissible hearsay. The trial court sustained the objection. Mays now argues that the recording should have been admitted and the entirety of the conversation played for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   La. C.E. art. 801(D)(2) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   D. Statements which are not hearsay. A statement is not hearsay if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   ***\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   (2) Personal, adoptive, and authorized admissions.

Such statement is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule when it is an admission against interest.

Then, the defense attempted to offer the conversation in its entirety. Presumably, Mays believed that the conversation contained exculpatory information. Since he intended to offer his own statement in his defense, in no way could the statement be construed as evidence \"offered against him\" for purposes of La. C.E. art. 801(D)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   A statement is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule when it is a statement against interest under La. C.E. art. 804(B)(3). The audio evidence certainly could be construed as inculpatory. Thus, the court was presented with the unusual circumstance of a defendant, contrary to advice from counsel, seeking to introduce evidence that would actually help the prosecution. Nevertheless, the hearsay exceptions in art. 804 are operative only when the declarant is unavailable. Ordinarily, a criminal defendant would be considered unavailable as he has a privilege not to testify at trial. However, the defendant was considered available as he elected to testify at trial. As such, the statement was plainly hearsay and, thus, inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    State v.
