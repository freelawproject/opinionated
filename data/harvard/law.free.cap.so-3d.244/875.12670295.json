Hicks (Mr. Hicks), dismissing the plaintiff Christopher Blanchard's claim for damages allegedly sustained after the patrol car he was driving was struck by Mr. Hicks's vehicle. An unknown thief had stolen the Hicks's vehicle and had abandoned the vehicle just before the collision while the Hicks's vehicle was in gear and still running. Mr. Blanchard appeals. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Blanchard filed suit against Mr. Hicks and his insurer, GoAuto, claiming that he was rear ended by a truck owned by Mr. Hicks and insured by GoAuto. Mr. Hicks and GoAuto denied liability and claimed in its motion for summary judgment that Mr. Hicks's truck had been stolen by an unknown thief. It claimed the unknown thief abandoned the truck while it was in gear and still moving, thus causing Mr. Hicks's truck to collide into the rear of Mr. Blanchard's vehicle, and causing the alleged damages to Mr. Blanchard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are undisputed. On August 5, 2016, Mr. Hicks, who is a carpenter and subcontractor, parked his truck in front of a home he was inspecting. Mr. Hicks and his helper exited the truck, leaving the keys in his vehicle with the engine and air conditioning running and the door unlocked. Mr. Hicks testified in both his deposition and affidavit submitted in support of his motion for summary judgment that no longer than four or five minutes had elapsed when the helper noticed a man sitting in the driver's seat of Mr. Hicks's truck. He alerted Mr. Hicks, who quickly walked to the driver's side door. Before Mr. Hicks could grab the handle of the truck door, the unknown thief looked at Mr. Hicks and drove off. Mr. Hicks began chasing the truck. Mr. Blanchard stopped his police unit at a red light and was waiting for the light to change. He was not aware of the stolen truck behind his police vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Hicks saw his truck stop about six feet behind the police car. The passenger door opened, and the unknown thief jumped out and took off running. Mr. Hicks saw his truck begin to slowly roll forward and strike the back of the police car occupied by Mr. Blanchard. The unknown thief has never been apprehended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After being hit by Mr. Hicks's truck, Mr. Blanchard called the police station, which can be seen from the intersection, and reported the traffic accident. At the same time, Mr. Hicks was knocking on the passenger window and waving his arms to alert Mr. Blanchard to the fact that his truck was stolen, and the thief was getting away. After learning that the truck had been stolen Mr. Blanchard then made a second radio call for backup. None of the officers pursued the unknown thief because he had already fled the scene. Mr. Hicks subsequently filed a formal report with the Alexandria City Police stating that his truck was stolen before the accident by an unknown thief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Blanchard admitted in his deposition that he had no facts to contradict Mr. Hicks's claim that his truck was stolen. Both Mr. Hicks's statement of uncontested facts and the deposition filed in support of the motion of the summary judgment stated that the door to his truck was closed, the windows were up, and the air conditioner was on when he and his helper left\n   the truck unattended for approximately four to five minutes. The trial court mentioned in its oral reasons for ruling that common sense would dictate that during daylight hours on August 5, 2016 in Alexandria, La., Mr. Hicks would have closed his truck door to allow his air conditioner to keep the truck cool while he made his inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The only evidence submitted into the record filed in support of the motion for summary judgment was filed on behalf of Mr. Hicks and GoAuto. The supporting documentation included the March 17, 2017 affidavit of Mr. Hicks and transcripts of the May 23, 2017 deposition testimonies of Mr. Hicks and Mr. Blanchard. In his opposition to the motion for summary judgment, Mr. Blanchard did not submit any documentation to dispute the facts stated in Mr. Hicks's affidavit and deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment for oral reasons assigned and dismissed Mr. Blanchard's claims with prejudice. A judgment was signed by the trial court on September 26, 2017, granting the motion for summary judgment on behalf of Mr. Hicks and GoAuto, dismissing Mr. Blanchard's claims with prejudice, and designating the judgment as final pursuant to La.Code Civ.P. art. 1915(B)(1). Mr. Blanchard now timely appeals the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Blanchard asserts one assignment of error on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Trial Court erred in granting defendants Motion for Summary Judgment in light of the defendant-driver's testimony that he violated Louisiana Revised Statute 32:145 by leaving his vehicle unattended with the keys in the ignition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellate courts review motions for summary judgment de novo, using the identical criteria that govern the trial court's consideration of whether summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Samaha v.

If the mover meets this initial burden, the burden of proof then shifts to the nonmoving party that has the burden of proof on this particular issue at trial. This nonmoving party then must put forth evidence that shows he or she will be able to meet that burden at trial.

You leave your car running because it's hot as heck in August and you go walk someplace for five minutes and then a thief comes and it's clear, nobody is in dispute about it, it was a thief, an uninvited guest, he did not know them[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   You know, that's what's unexpected for the owner of the car. I am going to go ahead and grant summary judgment because it just-it seems of some common sense, however, I understand the arguments you're giving, Ms. Meche, it [sic] that an open invitation, you have your car running with your keys in it-not a car open, keys are in it but now it's even running so did it jump yet another step. However, what Mr. Hicks did is what so many of us do, is like where is that line for us to-as car owners or anything else, where does it go. But I'm going to grant the summary judgment because it seems to me like\n   <em>\n    Racine\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

Because it sounds like in this case Mr. Hicks even tried to run the man down, even waving to the police officer that the darn car ended up running into in order to try to do some steps. So seems to me as an owner of the vehicle Mr. Hicks actually did more things versus just watching the thief drive off, he chased him down to try to stop the vehicle and save it from doing the very thing it did which is\n   cause an accident. So for that [sic] reasons I'm going to grant summary judgment because I think the owner in this part, yes, stepped out for five minutes but then he went chasing down the car to try to prevent an accident from happening. So let's see what the Third Circuit does with me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mr. Blanchard failed to submit any affidavits, deposition testimony or interrogatory answers that create any genuine issue of material fact which would require a trial on the merits.

In\n   <em>\n    Racine v.

The majority faults the panel for failing to follow\n   <em>\n    Racine\n   </em>\n   or at least mention it in their decision. In that case the panel denied a writ challenging the trial court's denial of a motion for summary judgment in a case involving a plaintiff injured when he was struck by a stolen car. The pool guy left his keys in his car,\n   <em>\n    parked on the street\n   </em>\n   , while servicing a customer's pool. The panel reasoned that summary judgment was rightly denied because the Plaintiff made compelling arguments in favor of finding that a duty to plaintiff is imposed by La.R.S. 32:145, Louisiana's unattended vehicle statute: \"In the instant case, we find that the fact finder could reasonably conclude that Mr. Rogers' leaving the keys in the vehicle\n   <em>\n    contributed\n   </em>\n   to Plaintiff's accident\n   <em>\n    to some extent\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added). The majority finds this holding is at odds with the \"settled jurisprudence\" of this state and is at odds with the last pronouncement from our State Supreme Court in 2002 in\n   <em>\n    Racine.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   First, the jurisprudence applicable in\n   <em>\n    Blanchard v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   and in this case is far from \"settled.\" Second, and importantly, the Supreme Court denied writs in\n   <em>\n    Blanchard v. Mitchell.\n   </em>\n   Two justices, Crichton and Clark, dissented, saying they would grant the writ to address the important question presented which \"has not recently [been] addressed,\" adding that they \"do not find the statute was intended to create a duty to protect third persons from the negligence of unauthorized users of a vehicle.\" But the supreme court majority's denial of the writ is indicative to me that the remainder of our supreme court justices do not agree with Justice Clark and Justice Crichton's \"finding.\" Third, and of significance, I note\n   <em>\n    the supreme court\n    <strong>\n     did not cite Racine\n    </strong>\n    as a reason to grant the writ\n   </em>\n   and overrule the panel in\n   <em>\n    Blanchard v. Mitchell.\n   </em>\n   This indicates to me they do not think the panel was wrong. I do not agree with the majority's finding that the panel in\n   <em>\n    Blanchard v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ignored prior jurisprudence because I believe the existing jurisprudence does not answer the question raised in that case or in this one. I can find no decision by the state supreme court, post comparative fault, that sets the matter straight, ergo the two justices' motivation to grant the writ in\n   <em>\n    Blanchard v. Mitchell.\n   </em>\n   I reiterate, a majority of the supreme court denied writs in\n   <em>\n    Blanchard v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   leaving in place the panel of this court's decision to deny writs based on the trial court's reasonable conclusion that\n   <em>\n    there is the possibility of comparative negligence in the matter.\n   </em>\n   Apparently, the panel in\n   <em>\n    Blanchard v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   perceives the possibility of a duty under the statute, applying the duty-risk analysis under comparative fault, the possibility of a breach of that duty with resulting injury, and at least some percent of comparative fault for breach of that duty. I maintain this case too, cannot be disposed of on summary judgment for the simple reason that the law on the question at hand is completely unknown because the supreme court has not yet ruled on the matter.\n   <em>\n    Racine\n   </em>\n   does not resolve this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The supreme court has previously held that: \"Duty is a question of law.

Perhaps Hicks had nowhere but the street to park his vehicle (the duty analysis being much easier if he had parked his truck on his own property instead of the public roadway). But when weighing all of the factors articulated in\n   <em>\n    Meany\n   </em>\n   , it seems to me there is a strong argument in favor of assessing some degree of fault to Hicks as it was within his power and control to avoid harm to the Plaintiff by removing his keys from his vehicle parked on the public road as the statute requires him to do. While our courts have never extended liability for unauthorized use of a vehicle\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     kept on private property\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   there is no reason a jury could not find that under the present circumstances Hicks bears some measure of comparative fault for his negligent behavior. I believe this is true not only because he violated the statutory prohibition against leaving his keys in the ignition and his vehicle running while parked on the pubic roadway, thus enabling and even enticing a thief, but also because under a duty risk analysis he breached a duty owed to the public not to make it easy for a thief to steal his vehicle and cause damage to others. At the very\n   least the application of the statute under the instant facts presents a policy question not yet directly answered by our supreme court and it begs to be addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Plaintiff here, and the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Blanchard v.

Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , the violation of the statute may well be a legal cause of damage to Officer Blanchard, at least to some degree. The legal cause of damage to officer Blanchard may well be said to be due in part to Hicks' negligent and unlawful behavior in leaving his keys in the car and the motor running while parked on the public roadway.
