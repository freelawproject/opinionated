After a four-day trial, a twelve-person jury found the Defendant guilty as charged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court denied the Defendant's motion for new trial and granted an appeal. Subsequently, the Defendant was sentenced to life in prison\n   with the possibility of parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the same day, a notice of appeal was issued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The charges against the Defendant stem from a gang-related homicide that occurred on January 12, 2008, at the Chat Room, a teenage nightclub located on Tulane Avenue and South Lopez Street. On the night of the incident, the Chat Room was hosting a sixteenth birthday party, during which multiple fights erupted. As the security guards began removing the participants, several fights continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Outside, the victim, Gervais Nicholas,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   was being held on the ground, near the median, by multiple individuals. Two males, later identified as the Defendant, Morgan, and Tavion Aples, were observed running across Tulane Avenue. They returned to the scene with guns. At that time, Morgan and Aples shot the victim multiple times, fatally injuring him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, they fled the scene in different directions. After an investigation involving state and federal authorities, Morgan was arrested pursuant to an arrest warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The record shows that defense counsel was not present with the Defendant at the sentencing hearing. The trial court specifically noted counsel's absence. Additionally, both the docket master and the minute entries provided that the Defendant \"appeared without counsel for sentencing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Having already addressed the sentencing error in our errors patent, we turn to the two remaining assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his first assignment of error, the Defendant contends that the trial court erred in excusing for cause prospective juror, Timothy Charles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 797 provides that the state or the defendant may challenge a juror for cause if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (2) The juror is not impartial, whatever the cause of his partiality. An opinion or impression as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant shall not of itself be sufficient grounds for challenge to a juror, if he declares, and the court is satisfied, that he can render an impartial verdict according to the law and the evidence; [or]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ***\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (4) The juror will not accept the law as given to him by the court[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 798(1) also provides good cause for the state to challenge a juror where \"[t]he juror is biased against the enforcement of the statute charged to have been violated, or is of the fixed opinion that the statute is invalid or unconstitutional.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   During\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Charles initially stated at the outset that he could not apply the law knowing the Defendant, if convicted, could be sentenced to life imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon further questioning by the State, Mr. Charles appeared confused concerning\n   the prosecution's burden of proof based on earlier instructions provided to the panel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the State explained it had to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt, not beyond all possible doubt, for Mr. Charles to convict the Defendant, Mr. Charles responded \"okay.\" However, defense counsel subsequently asked Mr. Charles whether he could find the Defendant guilty if he was \"one hundred percent positive\" that the State proved its case \"without a doubt\" and Mr. Charles replied: \"I possibly can.\" Mr. Charles also testified he would render a verdict irrespective of the sentence if there was a \"smoking gun.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, after defense counsel clarified the State's burden was beyond a reasonable doubt, Mr. Charles stated that he would be able to follow the law and fairly render verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thereafter, the State moved to strike Mr. Charles for cause arguing that he would not be able to render a verdict of guilty. The State claimed that Mr. Charles only answered that he would be able to find the Defendant guilty after defense counsel misrepresented the burden of proof required to convict. After hearing arguments from both the prosecution and the defense, the trial court granted the State's challenge for cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Defendant argues that there was no basis for the trial court to grant the State's challenge for cause because once defense counsel explained the law, Mr. Charles indicated that he would follow the law and render a verdict regardless of the sentence imposed. However, it is well established that when assessing whether a challenge for cause should be granted, the trial judge must look at the juror's responses during his or her entire testimony, not just \"correct\" isolated answers or, for that matter, \"incorrect,\" isolated answers.\n   <em>\n    State v. Washington\n   </em>\n   , 15-0819, pp. 4-5 (La.

Thus, despite Mr. Charles eventually indicating he would to be able to render a verdict based on the law as instructed, his responses as a whole displayed confusion as to the applicable burden of proof and reluctance to find the Defendant guilty given the mandatory life sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Simmons, who \"grew up with\" the Defendant, testified in the State's case-in-chief that the Defendant (also known as \"Joey Cracker\") and the Defendant's brothers, Josh and Jermaine Morgan (also known as \"Pookie\"), were upstairs inside the Chat Room with him at the time of the shooting. Simmons denied making a statement to an FBI agent that Josh was worried when the shooting occurred because he could not find his brother, Joey Cracker. Later during trial, Agent McNelis testified that when he spoke with Simmons the day after the incident, Simmons said only Pookie and Josh were with him inside the club when the fight began outside and that Josh was concerned because he could not find Joey Cracker. Agent McNelis also stated that Josh used Simmons' cell phone and again conveyed that he was concerned about \"his brother, Joey Cracker, because he was outside the club.\" Agent McNelis further indicated that Simmons permitted him to look at his cell phone to confirm the telephone calls were placed. Defense counsel objected to Agent McNelis testimony as hearsay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the State argued that it was entitled to impeach Simmons' former testimony. The trial court overruled the objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On appeal, the Defendant does not specifically challenge Agent McNelis' testimony based on hearsay. In fact, he concedes Simmons' prior statement is non-hearsay under La. C.E. art. 801(D)(1)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the Defendant claims that the State called Simmons as subterfuge in order to introduce his prior statement into evidence in violation of\n   <em>\n    Whitehurst v. Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"53018\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/592/834/#p839\">\n    592 F.2d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 839 (5th Cir. 1979) (where the Fifth Circuit held \"impeachment by prior inconsistent\n   statement may not be permitted where employed as a mere subterfuge to get before the jury evidence not otherwise admissible.\") (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   First, the Defendant did not specifically state these grounds during his objection in the trial court. La. C.Cr.P. art. 841(A) requires that a defendant present the grounds upon which an objection is made, and a defendant is limited on appeal to those grounds made at the time of the objection.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v. Jackson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7627507\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/450/621/#p634\">\n    450 So.2d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 634 (La. 1984) (citation omitted) (a defendant must state the basis for his objection to provide the trial judge with an opportunity to make the proper ruling and prevent or cure an error.) Since the Defendant failed to object on this basis in the trial court, the issue is not preserved for appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Nevertheless, a review of the trial transcript does not suggest that the State's primary intention of calling Simmons to testify was to introduce otherwise inadmissible testimony into the record. Although the record establishes that Simmons was incarcerated at the time of trial on a material witness bond because he did not want to cooperate with the prosecution, it also reveals that the State was under the impression that Simmons was going to provide testimony consistent with the statement he provided Agent McNelis,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   that the Defendant was not on the second floor of the Chat Room at the time of the shooting. The State further maintained in its closing arguments that Simmons' testimony on the stand was a surprise. In particular, the State indicated that had it known that Simmons would provide the Defendant with an alibi, it would not have called Simmons as a witness for the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that the record suggests that the State was unaware that Simmons' testimony was going to be inconsistent with his earlier statement, we do not find that the State merely called Simmons as subterfuge to introduce the contents of his statement to Agent McNelis into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, other witnesses placed the Defendant outside the Chat Room around the time of the shooting, which corroborates Simmons' previous statement. In particular, Kendrell Martin, who was close to the victim during the incident, identified the Defendant as the person who killed the victim. Sandy Ruffin, a security guard at the Chat Room, also testified at trial that the Defendant was one of the shooters outside the club. Charles Harris, who knew both the victim and the Defendant from his prior employment as a camp counselor, identified the Defendant as the\n   first to shoot and testified that the Defendant killed the victim. Thus, the prior inconsistent statement was admissible as substantive evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. C.E. art. 801(D)(1)(a) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Duncan,\n   </em>\n   11-0563, p. 25 (La.
