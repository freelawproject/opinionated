Plaintiff/Appellant, Mariah Benoit (\"Ms. Benoit\"), appeals the district court's judgment which granted the exception of prescription filed on behalf of Defendants/Appellees, Leslie K. Greco, M.D. (\"Dr. Greco\") and Nikki Clary, PA (\"PA Clary). For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 13, 2014, Ms. Benoit filed a formal complaint, pursuant to La. R.S. 40:1231.8\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to convene a Medical Review Panel (\"MRP\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Benoit named Iberia Medical Center, Pediatric Group of Acadiana, Women's &amp; Children's Hospital in Lafayette and Children's Hospital in New Orleans as defendants (the \"Original Defendants\"). Ms. Benoit alleged she sustained a \"compression injury that developed\n   into an open sore\" when the Original Defendants placed splints/cast over her broken foot too tightly. The alleged malpractice occurred from November 27, 2013 through December 10, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 21, 2015, Children's Hospital filed a petition to institute discovery in Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Almost a year later, on January 15, 2016, Children's Hospital filed an unopposed motion to extend the life of the MRP. The parties noted in the motion that the MRP was set to expire on February 25, 2016, panel members had not met, and discovery was still on-going. The district court granted the motion, extending the life of the MRP until February 25, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before the life of the MRP expired, on February 9, 2017, Ms. Benoit amended her MRP complaint to add Dr. Greco and PA Clary (collectively, \"Defendants\"), amongst others, as additional defendants to the pending complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amended complaint asserted that on November 27, 2013, Dr. Greco was the treating physician and PA Clary placed the cast on Plaintiff's leg too tightly, causing the injuries complained of.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 4, 2017, Defendants filed an exception of prescription, arguing that on the face of the amended complaint, Ms. Benoit failed to timely convene a MRP against them within the three year prescriptive period pursuant to La. R.S. 9:5628(A). Defendants maintained that Ms. Benoit's amended complaint, which was filed against Defendants more than three years after the date of the alleged malpractice, had prescribed and should be dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Benoit, relying on\n   <em>\n    Borel v. Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   countered that the three-year time period for filing a medical malpractice action was prescriptive, rather than preemptive. Ms. Benoit maintained that her amended complaint against Defendants had not prescribed because Defendants were jointly and solidarily liable with Original Defendants who were named in the original, timely filed MRP complaint. Ms. Benoit further argued that, pursuant to La. R.S. 40:1231.8 (A)(2)(a), because the MRP had not rendered a decision on the merits at the time the amended MRP was filed, the prescriptive period had tolled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the argument of counsel, on August 4, 2017, the district court sustained\n   Defendants' exception of prescription, reasoning that: \"I think the law is clear. You've got to file [a request for a MRP], at the absolute latest, in three years.\" The written judgment of the district court dismissed Ms. Benoit's claims against Defendants with prejudice, and ordered the Louisiana Patient's Compensation Fund to dismiss Defendants from the pending medical review panel proceeding captioned\n   <em>\n    Mariah Benoit, et al. v. Iberia Medical Center, et al\n   </em>\n   ., bearing file number 2014-01224.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thereafter, Ms. Benoit filed a timely motion for a suspensive appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before we review the merits of Ms. Benoit's appeal, we must first address whether this case is properly before this Court.

The judgment also creates ambiguity in identifying the defendants in whose favor the judgment was rendered as the underlying MRP complaint involves other defendants who were not parties to this exception.

R.S. 9:5628(A) is prescriptive, rather than preemptive; (2) that pursuant to La. R.S. 40:1231.8 (A)(2)(a), the prescriptive period was tolled because the MRP had not rendered a decision at the time the amended complaint was filed; (3) that the original MRP complaint, timely filed on November 13, 2014, interrupted prescription as to the joint and solidary Defendants added to the complaint by amendment on February 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In opposition, Defendants contend that the applicable statute in determining prescription in a medical malpractice action is governed by La. R.S. 9:5628(A), which imposes a strict deadline of three years in which to bring a medical malpractice claim, and no statutory or jurisprudential authority exists to suspend or interrupt prescription beyond the three-year period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   La. R.S. 9:5628(A) provides in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   No action for damages for injury or death against any physician ... whether based upon tort, or breach of contract, or otherwise, arising out of patient care shall be brought unless filed within one year from the date of the alleged act, omission or neglect, or within one year from the date of discovery of the alleged act, omission or neglect, however, even as to claims filed within one year from the date of such discovery, in all events such claims shall be filed at the latest within a period of three years from the date of the alleged act, omission or neglect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Pertinent provisions of the Louisiana Medical Malpractice Act (\"LMMA\") applicable to consideration of claims before the MRP include the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   La.

In\n   <em>\n    LeBreton\n   </em>\n   , the decedent's daughter simultaneously filed a wrongful death claim against his physicians in Civil District Court and a complaint before the MRP. The physicians filed an exception of prematurity, alleging that the only viable action was before the MRP. The district court denied the physicians' prematurity exception and the appellate court denied writs, allowing the daughter's district court action to continue. In granting the physicians' writ application, the Supreme Court noted that the filing of a medical malpractice claim with a medical review panel triggers the suspension of prescription as provided by the LMMA, rather than the interruption of the liberative prescriptive period provided in the Civil Code.\n   <em>\n    LeBreton\n   </em>\n   , 1997-2221 at p. 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723739\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/714/1226/#p1230\">\n    714 So.2d at 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [I]t is evident that the Louisiana Medical Malpractice Act took cognizance of the need to suspend prescription and fully protects plaintiffs who would otherwise suffer the detrimental effect of liberative prescription. Because the Medical Malpractice Act prohibits the filing of a medical malpractice claim against a qualified health care provider prior to panel review, the act specifies that the filing of a request for review before a panel suspends prescription. La. R.S. 40:[1231.8](A)(2)(a). Moreover, as provided by statute, the filing of the complaint prevents prescription from lapsing during the pendency of the review process and further suspends prescription from the time of filing until ninety-days following notification to the claimant or his attorney of the panel opinion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723739\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/714/1226/#p1230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After reviewing these special provisions, it is clear that the legislature has equitably provided for suspension to aid the plaintiff in the medical malpractice arena who is prevented by law from the outset from filing suit against the qualified health care provider.... Thus, considering the doctrinal underpinnings for the existence of the rules of suspension, it is\n   evident that there is no need for the general rules of interruption of prescription to combine with suspension to synergistically benefit the plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    LeBreton\n   </em>\n   , 1997-2221, p. 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723739\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/714/1226/#p1230\">\n    714 So.2d at 1230-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Borel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court was faced with a similar issue when it considered whether a timely filed malpractice complaint against a hospital interrupted the three-year prescriptive period against an alleged joint tortfeasor/physician, where the plaintiffs filed suit more than three years after the acts of medical malpractice. The\n   <em>\n    Borel\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs filed a MRP complaint on August 14, 2000, against the hospital and the physician in connection with their decedent's death on May 23, 2000. They were notified of the MRP's decision on January 22, 2002. Within ninety days, on March 28, 2002, the\n   <em>\n    Borel\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs filed suit against the hospital; however, they did not file suit against the physician. They waited until May 15, 2005 to file a separate lawsuit against the physician, contending that he was jointly, severally, and\n   <em>\n    in solido\n   </em>\n   liable with the hospital for the negligent care that resulted in the decedent's death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The physician and his insurer filed an exception of prescription, which was sustained by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In applying the provisions of La. R.S. 40:1231.8(A)(2)(a) to the facts of\n   <em>\n    Borel\n   </em>\n   , the Court acknowledged that medical malpractice actions are governed by special legislation as codified in the LMMA; as such, the specific provisions of the LMMA regarding suspension of prescription apply to the exclusion of the general code articles on interruption of prescription. 2007-0419, p. 25, 989 So.2d at 67. Moreover, the Court recognized that the time period for filing a medical malpractice action is prescriptive, rather than preemptive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 2007-0419, pp. 28-29, 989 So.2d at 69. The\n   <em>\n    Borel\n   </em>\n   Court explained that during the pendency of the panel proceedings, prescription was suspended as to all joint and solidary obligors. Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Borel\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs had until ninety days after notice of the panel decision, plus the remainder of the one-year prescriptive period that was unused at the time the request for the MRP was filed, in which to timely file suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the\n   <em>\n    Borel\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs failed to file suit against the physician until after the expiration of these time periods, the Court found that the district court properly sustained the peremptory exception of prescription.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 2007-0419, p. 28, 989 So.2d at 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, the facts of the present matter are distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Borel\n   </em>\n   . Here, the medical review panel has not rendered a decision. Therefore, prescription is suspended, at a minimum, for a ninety-day period following notice, via certified mail, of the MRP decision pursuant to La. R.S. 40:1231.8(A)(2)(a), provided the newly added defendants-Dr. Greco and PA Clary-are considered joint and solidary obligors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants contend if this Court interprets La. R.S. 40:1231.8(A)(2)(a) to mean prescription is interrupted while a MRP decision is pending, allowing for an amendment of joint tortfeasors, which we do, Ms. Benoit failed to present any evidence at the hearing on the exception to\n   prove that they were joint and solidary obligors with Original Defendants named in the original MRP complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Younger v.

The majority interprets this to mean that prescription is suspended as to joint and solidary obligors, as to the MRP claims and lawsuits, until at least 90 days after notice of the MRP decision. Thus, because there is not yet an MRP decision in the present matter, unlike\n   <em>\n    Borel\n   </em>\n   , the majority finds that the prescriptive period has not tolled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   However, I interpret La.

The Louisiana Legislature utilized the different terms for a reason. The \"claim\" refers to the complaint that goes before a MRP. A \"suit\" refers to the petition filed in the trial court after the MRP renders a decision. A medical malpractice plaintiff is required to file the MRP claim prior to filing a lawsuit in a trial court. If prescription was not suspended by the filing of the claim, then prescription would likely be tolled once the MRP issues a decision, precluding the plaintiff from filing a lawsuit. The Legislature included this phrase to protect the rights of the medical malpractice plaintiffs who are prevented from exercising their rights to file a lawsuit in the trial court. If the Legislature wanted to allow for the extended filing of claims, especially past the three-year limit contained in \u00a7 5628(A), then \u00a7 1231.8(A)(2)(a), the statute could provide that prescription was suspended for filing a suit or other claims. This interpretation does not detract from protecting the plaintiff because the plaintiff could file a MRP complaint against all interested parties within the confines of the three-year requirement contained in \u00a7 5628(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Secondly, \u00a7 1231.8(A)(2)(a) provides that prescription is suspended as to joint and solidary obligors \"to the same extent that prescription is suspended against the party or parties that are the subject to the request for review.\" The Legislature carefully worded this phrase to protect the plaintiff's rights against joint and solidary obligors, but limited the protection to the same as the parties already included in the MRP claims. \"To the same extent\" connotes that prescription is suspended as to joint and solidary obligors as to the period \"within which suit must be instituted.\" Meaning, prescription is suspended as to joint and solidary obligors in regards to the filing of a lawsuit following the MRP decision. To find otherwise nullifies the need for the phrase \"within which suit must be instituted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Thirdly, interpreting \u00a7 1231.8(A)(2)(a) for the premise that a MRP claim can be indefinitely amended pending the final MRP decision invalidates the three-year time period for the filing of medical malpractice claims contained in \u00a7 5628(A). The alleged medical malpractice in this matter occurred from the end of November 2013, through the first part of December 2013. The formal MRP complaint was filed on November 13, 2014. The amended MRP complaint was filed on February 9, 2017, which was over three years past the dates of the alleged malpractice. Interpreting \u00a7 1231.8(A)(2)(a) as the majority does eviscerates \u00a7 5628(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Also, the Louisiana Supreme Court previously held that La. C.C.P. art. 1153 could not be applied to Louisiana medical malpractice actions because the \"relation back\" theory would permit adding parties \"subsequent to the expiration of the three-year period provided for in La. R.S. 9:5628, and would read out of the statute the prescription and suspension period provisions by La. R.S. 9:5628 and La. R.S. 40:1299.47.\"\n   <em>\n    Warren v. Louisiana Med. Mut. Ins.
