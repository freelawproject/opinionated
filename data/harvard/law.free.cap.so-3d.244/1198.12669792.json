In his motion for rehearing or appeal and in this court, Jenkins alleged grounds that do not establish reversible error but may provide for relief from judgment under Florida Family Law Rule of Procedure 12.540(b). Rather than relinquish jurisdiction for the trial court to consider those grounds, we affirm without prejudice to Jenkins filing a motion for relief from judgment under rule 12.540(b) within thirty days of mandate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armbruster v.
