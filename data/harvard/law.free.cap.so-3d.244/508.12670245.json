Fenstermaker &amp; Associates, L.L.C. (Fenstermaker), provided engineering services for the construction of a roadway in the City of Youngsville. Youngsville sued Fenstermaker for deterioration of the roadway. Fenstermaker filed a third-party demand against the construction company, Glenn Lege Construction, Inc. (GLC). GLC filed an exception of peremption, which was granted by the trial court. Fenstermaker appeals the trial court's judgment in favor of GLC. Finding no error or manifest error in the trial court's judgment, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We must decide whether the trial court erred in interpreting La.R.S. 9:2772\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   in granting GLC's exception of peremption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The City of Youngsville (City) contracted with Fenstermaker for engineering services in the design, planning, and supervision of a 6.5-mile roadway in Lafayette Parish. The City entered into a separate contract with GLC for construction of the roadway as designed. Upon the recommendation of Fenstermaker, the City opened the road to the public in 2009, but only months later, in 2009, the roadway began to fail. The City still held funds on both Fenstermaker's and GLC's open contracts. GLC did repair work, and Fenstermaker oversaw the work. The last change order on the construction contract was dated January 21, 2010. The City accepted the work and recorded its public notice of acceptance on August 27, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Failures began again over the next few years. It was determined that the failures were due to the soil in the base and the asphalt. The City's mayor hired a new engineer in 2015 and filed suit against Fenstermaker on August 19, 2015, within five years of the recorded acceptance. Fenstermaker filed an exception of peremption, asserting a 2009 acceptance of substantial completion. The trial court denied Fenstermaker's exception of peremption. This court denied Fenstermaker's writ application, No. 16-431,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on Fenstermaker's exception of peremption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Fenstermaker filed a third-party demand against GLC on December 23, 2015, asserting fault and seeking indemnification in the amount of any judgment issued against Fenstermaker in the main demand. GLC asserted that it had followed the design specifications and used the materials required by Fenstermaker and that Fenstermaker's third-party demand against GLC was untimely. The trial court granted GLC's exception of peremption. Fenstermaker appeals the judgment of the trial court, asserting that the trial court misinterpreted the statute at issue, La.R.S. 9:2772.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Questions of law, such as the proper interpretation of a statute, are reviewed by the appellate court under the de novo standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Land v.

More specifically, La.R.S. 9:2772 provides that a suit arising from the design and construction of an immovable must be brought not more than \"five years\n   after the date of registry in the mortgage office of acceptance of the work by owner.\" La.R.S. 9:2772(A)(1)(a). If no acceptance is recorded within six months of occupancy or possession of the property, the date of occupancy is the date that begins the five-year period for filing suit. La.R.S. 9:2772(A)(1)(b). If the main demand is brought within ninety days of the expiration of the five-year peremptive period, that defendant will have ninety days from the date of service of the main demand to file a third-party claim. La.R.S. 9:2772(A)(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, the City filed the main demand against Fenstermaker on August 19, 2015, within ninety days of the expiration of the five-year period which began on August 27, 2010, and which ended on August 27, 2015. Thus, GLC argues that Fenstermaker had ninety days from the date of service of the main demand on Fenstermaker within which to file a third-party demand against GLC. The record reveals that service of the main demand was made on Fenstermaker on August 21, 2015. Thus, GLC asserts that La.R.S. 9:2772(A)(1)(c) applies, and Fenstermaker had to file its third-party demand against GLC in November 2015. Fenstermaker did not file its third-party demand against GLC until December 23, 2015. Thus, GLC argues that Fenstermaker's third party demand is perempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Fenstermaker contends that the damage to the roadway was discovered by the new City Engineer, Pamela Gonzales-Granger, in March and June 2015, and that La.R.S. 9:2772(C) gives Fenstermaker an additional year from those dates in 2015 to file its third-party demand. Louisiana Revised Statutes 9:2772(C) (emphasis added) provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   If such\n   <strong>\n    an injury\n   </strong>\n   to the property or to the person or if such a wrongful death occurs during the fifth year after the date set forth in Subsection A, an action to recover the damages thereby suffered may be brought within one year after the date of\n   <strong>\n    the injury\n   </strong>\n   , but in no event more than six years after the date set forth in Subsection A, even if the wrongful death results thereafter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court interpreted \"an injury\" and \"the injury\" as the initial deterioration and failure of the roadway that had begun in previous years and was ongoing. In its reasons for judgment the trial court cited the testimony of the City's engineer, Pamela Gonzales-Granger:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   After considering the briefs filed and testimony and evidence presented by the parties, the Court sustained the exception of peremption filed by Glenn Lege Construction, Inc. The Court rejected the argument made by C. H. Fenstermaker &amp; Associates, LLC that its third party demand filed on December 23, 2015 was timely pursuant to the provisions of La. R. S. 9:2772 (C) which extends the period for filing a third party demand if the \"injury\" to the property occurs during the fifth year after the filing of the Notice of Acceptance. After hearing the testimony of City engineer, Pamela Gonzales-Granger, the Court found the deterioration of the roadway that was noted in March and June of 2015 was not a new \"injury\" to the property but was a reoccurrence of an ongoing issue which existed in the base of the Chemin Metairie Parkway prior to March and June of 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This indicates that the trial court would have applied Paragraph (C) to the third-party demand but believed that it was inapplicable because \"the injury\" at issue did not occur in the fifth year. As discussed below, we believe that Paragraph (C) does not and did not apply to third-party demands at the pertinent times\n   for other reasons as well. However, we will first discuss the trial court's reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As previously stated, Ms. Granger began her tenure as city engineer in January 2015 with the new mayor's administration. The record reveals that the roadway was already failing at that time. Ms. Granger testified that a repair project was underway that Fenstermaker had begun in December 2014 and that she had stopped that project in February 2015, as she found more and more areas of deterioration in an amount that required rebidding the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Three letters from Granger to the mayor recommended cost approvals for \"Chemin Metairie Parkway Phase 1 Emergency Roadway Patching and Reconstruction.\" The first letter, dated February 27, 2015, recommended awarding GLC the construction bid of $456,161 on a repair project that clearly had been studied for some time, as there were alternative proposals at differing costs to \"fix failing areas\" of the roadway, which was to have had a ten-year life-expectancy when it was accepted by the City in 2010. The second letter from Ms. Granger was dated March 30, 2015. It recommended a change order increasing the amount for reconstruction by $202,477 due to \"additional deterioration\" and \"potholes\" identified in a March 18 walk-through that had not appeared in February 3 and 6. A third letter from Ms. Granger dated June 3, 2015, recommended another increase of $553,163 after a June 1 walk through identified \"additional deterioration\" along the route that on February 3 and 6 had not shown deterioration or potholes \"as well as an increase in the areas that showed deterioration previously.\" At the trial of GLC's exception, Ms. Granger was asked about the March and June letters:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q. Now, during the course of that inspection in which you reported to Mayor Ritter was there anything new that was happening with the roadway as compared to the prior experiences.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A. No. Both letters in which you are referring to were times along the construction of the project where we identified that there were just additional areas of the same problem and that we needed to address those while we were out there doing the construction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On direct examination, Ms. Granger reiterated four more times that those inspection letters identified reoccurrences of the same problem. On cross-examination, Ms. Granger testified approximately one dozen times that her inspections in 2015 revealed additional areas of the same type of deterioration in the roadway that were the subject of the repairs and reconstruction already underway in December 2014. If repairs were underway in December 2014, the damage occurred well before that time. Ms. Granger testified that they were patching and reconstructing the road by fixing the worst areas first because money was limited. If areas of the road just had \"dips\" in them, they moved on to fix the roadway where it was unusable. Then, as the project went forward, the areas that were not as bad also became deteriorated. She rebid the project in February and recommended increases in March and June 2015. While neither the trial court nor the parties discussed any particular dates in 2014 when these preexisting repairs were begun, it appears that the trial court, having just heard and denied Fenstermaker's second exception of peremption, believed that the ongoing problems with the road were in the base of the road as it was originally built. The record as a whole supports that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Fenstermaker wishes to isolate the last deteriorations found in March and June 2015 as if Fenstermaker had not planned, designed, and overseen the entire length of\n   the road and required the same materials for the whole length of the road. The new road began to fail shortly after it was accepted by the City, and it continued to deteriorate as the five-year deadline for recovery approached, as evidenced by the letters from the City's new engineer, Ms. Granger. The entire road was flawed, and the same design that caused it to crumble in one place was causing it to crumble in other places. To say that only the most recent deterioration in the fifth year constituted \"such an injury\" would mean that Fenstermaker was only responsible for the failure of the spots that crumbled in March and June of 2015, but not for the ones found in the previous years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The City had five years from acceptance of the design to bring suit, and it did so timely under 9:2772(A). Fenstermaker had ninety days from the day it was served by the City to bring its third-party claim against GLC under 9:2772(A)(1)(c). It did not do so. No case on the subject indicates that \"the injury\" referred to in 9:2772(C) was intended to apply to only the last injuries in a situation such as this. In fact, Fenstermaker accuses GLC of inserting \"first\" before the word \"injury,\" but Fenstermaker wishes us to insert \"last\" before the word \"injury.\" The two or three cases cited by Fenstermaker, discussed more fully below, involve a single injury and provide no authority for Fenstermaker's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Moreover, regardless of the date of the injury, we find that Paragraph (C) does not now apply to third-party demands, and it is questionable whether it ever did. More specifically, the words to La.R.S. 9:2772(C) indicate that it covers \"an injury\" or \"the injury\" \"to the property or to the person\" giving rise to the lawsuit; and when considering the statute as a whole, it is clear that (C) is written to benefit the injured party in the main demand. This paragraph does not in any way discuss third party demands or indicate that it is written to benefit the\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   in the main demand. If the injured plaintiff in the main demand takes advantage of the extra year in Paragraph (C), then the defendant has ninety days from service of\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   filing to file its-third party demand, pursuant to La.R.S. 9:2772(A)(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This becomes clearer when analyzing La.R.S. 9:2772(B), which provides that the peremptive periods of Paragraph (A) apply to actions for a deficiency in planning, design, inspection, or construction of improvements to immovable property\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    damage to property\n   </em>\n   \" or \"\n   <em>\n    injury to person\n   </em>\n   \" \"\n   <em>\n    arising out of any such deficiency.\n   </em>\n   \" La.R.S. 9:2772(B)(1)(a) through (c). Louisiana Revised Statutes 9:2772(B)(3) (emphasis added) states: \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Except as otherwise provided in Subsection A\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of this Section, this peremptive period\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     shall extend to every demand\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     whether brought by direct action or for contribution or indemnity or by third-party practice\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and whether brought by the owner or by any other person.\" Paragraph (B)(3) does not provide for any other extension of the five-year peremptive period for a third-party demand, except for the ninety-day extension in Paragraph (A), specifically Subparagraph (A)(1)(c). If the legislature had intended for the extra year in paragraph (C) to apply to third-party demands, it would have included (C) as an \"otherwise provided\" extension in the text of (B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Subparagraph (A)(1)(c) is the only paragraph in La.R.S. 9:2772 that extends the five-year peremptive period for third-party demands. Louisiana Revised Statutes 9:2772 was amended in 2012, and Subparagraph (A)(1)(c) was enacted/added at that time. Thus, it is clearly the applicable subpart in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Moreover, the additional year in Paragraph (C) does not help Fenstermaker\n   in this case because Fenstermaker has not yet suffered damages. More specifically, again, La.R.S. 9:2772(C) (emphasis added) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    If such an injury\n   </strong>\n   to the property or to the person or if such a wrongful death occurs during the fifth year after the date set forth in Subsection A,\n   <strong>\n    an action to recover the damages thereby suffered\n   </strong>\n   may be brought\n   <strong>\n    within one year after the date of the injury\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    but in no event more than six years after the date set forth in Subsection A\n   </strong>\n   , even if the wrongful death results thereafter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Fenstermaker cannot recover damages that it has\n   <strong>\n    not suffered\n   </strong>\n   , and it is not an injured entity who has suffered damages until it is cast in judgment.\n   <em>\n    Even if\n   </em>\n   the last date of injury, June 1, 2015, were considered the defining date of injury, and\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   Fenstermaker were cast in judgment today, the date of acceptance was August 27, 2010, almost eight years ago, which is clearly outside the six-year limit of La.R.S.9:2772(C). In this case, Fenstermaker's claim was perempted under Paragraph (C) before its cause of action arose. It is only Subparagraph (A)(1)(c) that extends the peremptive period for Fenstermaker's filing of a third-party demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We are particularly instructed by the Louisiana Supreme Court's analysis in a case which pre-dated the 2012 amendment to La.R.S. 9:2772 which added Subparagraph (A)(1)(c) and the ninety-day extension therein. We note that Paragraph (C) was in existence in 2011,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the supreme court did not apply it, or even address it, because, in 2011, no part of La.R.S. 9:2772 created an extension for a cause of action that had not accrued. In\n   <em>\n    Ebinger v. Venus Construction Corporation\n   </em>\n   , 10-2516 (La. 7/1/11),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037342\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/65/1279/\">\n    65 So.3d 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Louisiana Supreme Court discussed Paragraph (B) and thoroughly and comprehensively addressed whether the 2003 amendment to La.R.S. 9:2772, reducing the seven-year peremptive period to a five-year peremptive period, was\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   applicable because it disturbed a vested right of the defendant/third-party plaintiff. The court found that the 2003 amendment\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   applicable because it did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   disturb a vested right. The court stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [W]e are mindful of the difference between the commencement of peremption and the accrual of a cause of action. These key moments in time apparently have been confused in this case. Although the peremptive period in this matter began on April 22, 1997, nothing in La.

Although cracks in the [plaintiffs'] brick veneer may have established a cause of action for the homeowners, it did not create a cause of action for [defendant's] third-party claim because that action depends on the [plaintiffs] seeking judicial enforcement of their claim. Until [the defendant] has been cast in judgment, it has not suffered damages that can be recovered from [the third-party defendant] through indemnity because liability has not been established.

Sess. (La.2012), enacted La.R.S. 9:2772(A)(1)(c)\"to authorize the filing of certain contribution, indemnity or third-party claims.\" The Resume Digest for Senate Bill 258 actually quoted from Paragraph (B) when it stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Prior law provided that a five-year peremptive period extends to every demand arising under the prior law, whether brought by direct action or for contribution or indemnity or by third party practice, and whether brought by the owner or by any other person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   New law adds an exception that if, within 90 days of the five-year peremptive period, a claim is brought against any person or entity included in the prior law, then that person or entity has 90 days from date of service of the main demand or, in the case of a third-party defendant, 90 days from service of process of the third-party demand, to file a claim for contribution, indemnity or a third-party claim against any other party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Accordingly, prior to the 2012 enactment of Subparagraph (A)(1)(c), there was no exception to the five-year peremptive period for third-party demands, even though Paragraph (C) had been in existence since 1964. Act 2012 also added at the beginning of Subparagraph (B)(3) of La.R.S. 9:2772, \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Except as otherwise provided in Subsection A of this Section, this\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   which had previously stated, \"This peremptive period shall extend to every demand, whether brought by direct action or for contribution or indemnity or by third-party practice, and whether brought by the owner or by any other person.\" The added language clarifies that no other exception, except the newly enacted (A)(1)(c) would apply to third-party demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The cases cited by Fenstermaker appear to be the only cases addressing Paragraph (C), and those cases are wholly distinguishable. Contrary to Fenstermaker's assertion, there have not been \"consistent\" applications by the courts of Paragraph (C). There have been three cases in thirty-three years, beginning in 1985, and all of the decisions occurred before\n   <em>\n    Ebinger\n   </em>\n   in 2011 and before the 2012 amendments enacting Subparagraph (A)(1)(c). As stated by GLC, the incident at issue in\n   <em>\n    Klein v.

There, the plaintiff filed suit about one month after peremption, but the court applied Paragraph (C) to find the plaintiff's action timely. The fourth circuit also found the bank's third-party demand against the contractor timely where the bank's filing date was exactly one year after the plaintiff's injury date. That finding would be impermissible under the current statute. Further, the fourth circuit court applied La.Code Civ.P. art. 1067 to find the remaining third party demands timely, which we believe to have been an impermissible extension of the peremption period of La.R.S. 9:2772, even in 1985.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Also cited by Fenstermaker is\n   <em>\n    Sinnett v.

The court stated, \"When a statute is clearly peremptive such as the one at issue, a cause of action is extinguished if the injury has not yet occurred.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Accordingly, we find no manifest error or legal error in the trial court's interpretation of \"the injury\" as the ongoing deterioration that began before the fifth year after the City recorded its acceptance of the work. We further clarify that Paragraph (C) does not apply to Fenstermaker because Fenstermaker has not yet suffered damages for which it can recover under (C); and it did not file its third-party demand timely under the only Subparagraph authorizing such filing, La.R.S. 9:2772(A)(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, the trial court's judgment granting GLC's exception of peremption is affirmed.
