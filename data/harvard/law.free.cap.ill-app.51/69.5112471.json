It was held, that there was an implied promise by the payee to indemnify appellant against the consequences of that guaranty, but until the appellant had been damnified, that implied promise could not be the basis of any defense to the note sued upon, whether it remained in the hands of the payee or was indorsed by him after maturity.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-10\" pgmap=\"65\">Memorandum.-\u2014Assumpsit.
