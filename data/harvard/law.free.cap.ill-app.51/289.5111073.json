Whatever our conclusion might be upon a review of the evidence, as to its sufficiency to sustain the verdict and judgment, we are not at liberty to examine.</p> <p id=\"b286-9\" pgmap=\"286\">By a stipulation between the counsel for the parties, entitled in the cause in the Circuit Court, it was agreed \u201c that the original bill of exceptions may be included and incorporated in the record of this case, without being copied therein.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b286-10\" pgmap=\"286\">It required no stipulation to make the bill of exceptions a part of the record in the Circuit Court; it became such as soon as signed by the judge and filed. There was no stipulation that the original bill of exceptions, instead of a copy, might be incorporated into the transcript of the record for this court. The statute upon the subject does not permit us to regard what is shown, alone, by a paper so attempted to be stipulated into the record of this court. Schwartz v.
