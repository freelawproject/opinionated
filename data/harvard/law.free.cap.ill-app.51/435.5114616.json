The appellee apparently has no faith in its justice, for she does not appear in this court in its defense.</p> <p id=\"b431-12\" pgmap=\"431\">The dispute was a mere matter of accounting, and from the record as presented to us, which we have, although unaided by appellee, diligently examined, we can not see how the judgment can be upheld. It looks very much as if the judgment ought to have been considerably in favor of the appellant.</p> <p id=\"b431-13\" pgmap=\"431\">We will therefore reverse and remand the cause.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
