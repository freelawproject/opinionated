Justice Gary</author> <p id=\"A7q\" pgmap=\"346\">delivered the opinion op the Court.</p> <p id=\"b346-7\" pgmap=\"346\">The appellee is assignee in insolvency of Abraham G. Becker, surviving partner of the firm of Herman Schaffner &amp; Co., private bankers in Chicago. The appellant kept an ordinary banking account with Schaffner &amp; Co.</p> <p id=\"b346-8\" pgmap=\"346\">On the second day of June, 1893, Schaffner &amp; Co. received in a letter, from the appellant, at Milwaukee, a check, payable to the order of the appellant upon a bank in Kansas, and indorsed by the appellant \u201c For deposit with Herman Schaffner &amp; Co. to the credit of Gender &amp; Paescheke Mfg. Co.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b346-9\" pgmap=\"346\">The next day, the firm of Herman Schaffner &amp; Co. being insolvent, Becker made the assignment to the appellee.</p> <p id=\"b346-10\" pgmap=\"346\">The payment of the check was stopped, the check returned to the appellee, and this is a petition by the appellant that the County Court should direct that it be surrendered to the appellant.</p> <p id=\"b346-11\" pgmap=\"346\">The County Court refused. Had the money on the check been paid and mingled with the funds of Schaffner &amp; Co., in any of the ways by which commercial business is conducted, so that the identity was gone, the appellant would have no case.
