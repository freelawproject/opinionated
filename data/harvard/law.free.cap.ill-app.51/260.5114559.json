As agent for others he had also had occasion about two years before, to become acquainted with the forms used by appellants.</p> <p id=\"b257-9\" pgmap=\"257\">The use of notes and mortgages containing a gold clause did not begin in appellant\u2019s business until about nine months previous to the making of the application for the loan in question, and no mention was made to appellee at the time he made the application, and he had no knowledge, that appellants had made a change in the form of their notes and mortgages so as to embody a gold clause in them, or that he would be required to repay the loan in any money other than that constituting legal tender under the United States laws.</p> <p id=\"b258-5\" pgmap=\"258\">The application for the loan, referring, as it does, to other papers, to wit, the \u201c usual form \u201d of notes and mortgages employed in the business of appellants, and it being undisputed that the forms had been changed from those used by the parties in their previous transactions of a similar kind, without the knowledge of appellee, the question of fact arose as to what forms were intended by the parties; and parol evidence was admissible to determine that fact. When the identity of a thing referred to in a written contract is left uncertain it is proper to hear parol evidence to determine which of two things answering the description was meant by the parties.</p> <p id=\"b258-6\" pgmap=\"258\">By the 16th proposition, misnamed one of law, submitted to and held by the court, it was found and held that the forms presented to appellee for his execution were in the usual form employed by the appellants at the date of the contract; and by the 10th, 14th and 15th propositions, the court refused to hold, as a matter of law, that \u201c your usual form,\u201d as employed in the contract, referred to the form then in use by the appellants.</p> <p id=\"b258-7\" pgmap=\"258\">It would seem, therefore, that the court must have found from the evidence that the parties\u2019 minds did not meet at all, the appellants meaning the form in use by them at that time, and the appellee meaning the form used between them in previous transactions, and hence there was no binding contract between them; or else that what was meant by the \u201c usual form \u201d was the form that had been used by the parties in their former transactions of a similar kind.</p> <p id=\"b258-8\" pgmap=\"258\">There was evidence that tended to support either finding, and we are not at liberty, where there was conflicting evidence, to set aside the conclusion that the court reached.</p> <p id=\"b258-9\" pgmap=\"258\">Under well settled rules of law the application, or contract, was open to parol explanation, and the question of the effect of the contract, as one of law merely, does not arise upon its face.</p> <p id=\"b258-10\" pgmap=\"258\">The facts having been found against the appellants, upon conflicting evidence, the judgment of the Circuit Court must be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
