After the failure, these stockholders, defendants in error, individually bought up, in the aggregate, $4,575 worth of certificates of deposit of various persons, who were creditors of the bank at the time of its failure, paying for most of it from fifteen to thirty per cent of its face value, seventy-five cents on the dollar having been paid for one certificate of deposit of $200. Assignments of these certificates of indebtedness of the bank were made to the respective parties purchasing the same, and such evidences of indebtedness were filed with the assignee within three months after such assignment, as provided by law. Thereafter, on the 11th day of September, 1878, these stockholders, with the purpose of extinguishing their individual liability, which, under the law, was the face value of the stock in the bank held by each respectively, confessed judgment in the Circuit Court of St. Clair County in favor of each other on a part of said indebtedness so purchased by them, which judgments were entered' satisfied on the record by the parties within a day or two thereafter, although in fact none of the judgments were paid, nor any part thereof. On the 19th day of September, 1891, some thirteen years after the judgments were taken and satisfied, the parties, all by consent, notice being served on each other of the motion, obtained an order of court, setting aside the entry of satisfaction, the order of judgment in each case, and permission to dismiss the same from the docket. It also appears that certain other of these certificates of deposit so purchased, were, on the 8th day of April, 1879, surrendered by a Mr. Harrison to the assignee for cancellation for the purpose of releasing himself and a Mrs. Harrison from their liability as stockholders to the creditors of the bank. It appears that such certificates of indebtedness were placed in Harrison\u2019s hands for that purpose by Amos Thompson, his father-in-law, one of these defendants.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-5\" pgmap=\"30\">It further appears that the assignee of the bank had declared and paid a dividend to the creditors of the bank, other than these stockholders, of twenty per cent. On the 26th day of June, 1891, while said judgments were of record as such, these defendants appeared in the County Court and moved that the assignee of the bank be ordered to pay them a dividend of twenty per cent on their certificates of indebtedness, which motion the court, on the 21st day of July, 1891, denied, and rendered judgment against appellees for costs, who thereupon took an appeal to the Circuit Court, where the cause was heard and decided in favor of these defendants at the January term, 1892, of said court. The court ordered the assignee to pay these defendants a dividend of twenty per cent upon the face value of each of said certificates, and that thereafter their certificates should share pro rata with the other creditors, out of the remaining assets, on their face value. From this order of the court the assignee of the insolvent bank prosecutes this writ of error.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-3\" pgmap=\"31\">Brief of Plaintiff in Error, Marshall W\u201e Weir and Charles P.

The exception preserved to the order of the court, overruling the motion for a new trial and entering judgment on the finding, with the assignment of error thereon, raises that question. There is no real dispute as to the facts, which summarized are, first, the defendants in error were stockholders of the bank at the time of its failure; second, the bank was indebted at that time, as evidenced by its certificates of deposit; third, the defendants in error, after such failure, purchased at a large discount, over $5,0\"00 of such certificates; fourth, such certificates so purchased were filed with the assignee of the bank in due time; fifth, that a part of said certificates were thereafter on the part of a stockholder and by the consent of one of these defendants in error, presented to the assignee for cancellation in favor of the creditors of the said bank; sixth, that the other certificates of deposit so purchased by these defendants in error were put in judgment and these judgments satisfied of record, for the purpose of relieving such stockholders from their individual liability; seventh, which judgments and entries of satisfaction were, after the lapse of some thirteen years, set aside on the order of the court by the consent of these defendants in error\u2014the parties thereto.</p> <p id=\"b32-5\" pgmap=\"32\">The solution of this question depends upon, first, the rights acquired by these stockholders by their purchase of these certificates of the bank\u2019s indebtedness, after the failure of the bank; second, the effect of these judgments on such certificates as were put in judgment, and the effect of the surrender of the other certificates to the assignee for cancellation, for the benefit of the creditors of the bank.</p> <p id=\"b32-6\" pgmap=\"32\">That stockholders may become the creditors of their own corporation has been decided. Merrick v. Peru Coal Co., 61 Ill. 472; Harts v. Brown, 77 Ill. 226.</p> <p id=\"b32-7\" pgmap=\"32\">The director stockholders may, as to other stockholders, who have had an opportunity to contribute to relieve an insolvent corporation from its debts, purchase the property of the corporation at a foreclosure sale, and the other stockholders will have no right to complain. Hart\u2019s case, supra.</p> <p id=\"b32-8\" pgmap=\"32\">It will be observed, however, that the decisions holding that a stockholder may become a creditor of his own corporation, relate to an existing and not a defunct corporation, and that the decision as to the right of one or more stockholders to purchase the property of the corporation at a foreclosure sale, relates to the rights of the stockholders as between themselves.</p> <p id=\"b33-3\" pgmap=\"33\">If such stockholders become creditors in good faith during the existence of the corporation, and while operating as such, then doubtless such creditor stockholders \"would share pro rata in the distribution of the assets of the corporation, the same as a non-stockholder creditor.</p> <p id=\"b33-4\" pgmap=\"33\">These stockholders, however, purchased these bank certificates of deposit at a large discount, after the corporation, of which they were stockholders, had made an assigmnent for the express purpose of relieving themselves from their individual liability, as such stockholders, to the creditors of their corporation. While it is true such certificates were filed with the assignee, yet these stockholders withdrew them as claims against the assets, by surrendering some of them to the assignee for cancellation and by putting the others in judgment in the Circuit Court. The effect of such use of the certificates was equivalent to their withdrawal. Suppose the original owners of these certificates had, after filing them with the assignee, withdrawn and brought suit on them in the Circuit Court against these stockholders and obtained judgments on them, and then without fraud or mistake entered satisfaction of such judgments; certainly they could not have come in after a period of thirteen years, refile them and ask to share in the assets of the bank. How are these .parties placed in any better position by being assignees of such certificates and stockholders in the bank %</p> <p id=\"b33-5\" pgmap=\"33(132) 34(56)\">The fact that they did not succeed, in law, by such proceedings, in relieving themselves from the individual liability to the full amount of the face value of such certificates, does not, it seems to us, determine the effect of such proceedings upon the certificates themselves, either as to withdrawal from before the assignee or merger in the judgments. We see no escape from the conclusion, as to these certificates of indebtedness that were in fact surrendered to the assignee for cancellation, and those certificates, that were in fact put in judgments and those judgments receipted, that they were withdrawn as claims against the estate of the insolvent bank, and ceased to be of any validity whatever except for the purpose of use in enforcing contribution among the stockholders. Such certificates could not be in fact surrendered for cancellation or put in judgments and those judgments satisfied, and at the same time, be pending as claims against the estate. We do not wish, however, to rest our decision upon this view alone, of the withdrawal of the claims from before the assignee.</p> <p id=\"b34-5\" pgmap=\"34\">We understand that under the law of liability of these stockholders, the amount for which they were liable to the creditors of the bank was as much a fund for the security of the creditors, as the assets of the bank (Eames v. Doris, 102 Ill. 350; Tunesma v. Schuttler, 114 Ill. 156; Queenan v. Palmer, 117 Ill. 619-628); and that a voluntary payment by a stockholder to a creditor, after such stockholder\u2019s personal\" liability attaches, does not enable such stockholder to take an assignment of such corporation debt and put it in as a claim against the funds of the corporation, to shareyw rata, either to the amount he paid or to the amount of the face of the debt he so took up, with other corporation creditors. By such payment, such stockholder extinguishes the debt of the corporation to the amount of the debt so taken up, and extinguishes the amount of his own liability to the extent of the sum so paid by him. Ganch v. Harrison, 12 Brad. 457; Thompson v. Meisser, 108 Ill. 359.</p> <p id=\"b34-6\" pgmap=\"34\">A debtor may pay his debt, but he can not purchase it, so as to present it as a living chose in action against himself, to share in the assets with other creditors. Edison Electric &amp; I. Co. v. DeMott, N. J. case, Chicago Legal News, June 3, 1893, p. 341.</p> <p id=\"b34-7\" pgmap=\"34\">If the stockholder is permitted to take a part of such fund, viz., his liability, and with it purchase at a discount from the creditors of the Insolvent bank, the bank\u2019s liabilities, and turn the same in at their face value for such stockholder\u2019s benefit, then it seems to us that the object of the statute would be defeated.</p> <p id=\"b34-8\" pgmap=\"34(48) 35(38)\">As is said in the case of Thompson v. Meisser, 108 Ill., at p. 368, \u201c What advantage would the statute be to the outside creditors ? \u201d We do not understand that these stockholders, after the failure of the bank to pay its debts, stood iii the relation of sureties or guarantors of the bank, in the sense that they could utilize the debt of the bank so paid by them, as claims against the bank, the same as other and outside creditors.</p> <p id=\"b35-4\" pgmap=\"35\">\"We understand the payment of such a debt by a stockholder is the payment by him of an original liability, and therefore as completely an extinguishment of it, as if paid by the bank itself.</p> <p id=\"b35-5\" pgmap=\"35\">While it is true, the stockholder does not become liable until the bank has failed to pay its debt, yet when that condition arises, then the protection of the corporation, to the extent of the face value of his stock, is withdrawn by the law, and his liability as to such debt, by operation of law, becomes that of a partner. Therefore, such debt, as between the stockholders and such creditor, is in law, as if directly contracted, originally, between such creditor on the one hand and such stockholders, as partners, on the other, regardless of the fact that there ever was a corporation.</p> <p id=\"b35-6\" pgmap=\"35\">We understand the case of Fuller v. Ledden, 87 Ill. 310, which has since been several times approved, expressly so holds. See Buchanan v. Meisser, 105 Ill. 638, 643.</p> <p id=\"b35-7\" pgmap=\"35\">If this view of ours of the law, is correct, then it certainly follows that partners can not purchase their own debts; they can only pay them. It also follows, that the legal effect of the acts of these defendants in error, in taking up these certificates of the bank\u2019s indebtedness, was to pay and extinguish them, so far as the other creditors were concerned.</p> <p id=\"b35-8\" pgmap=\"35\">These views are expressed as to these certificates on the hypothesis of the facts in this case, that the money actually paid by these stockholders did not in any case exceed the amount of their individual liability, as evidenced by the shares of stock held by them respectively.</p> <p id=\"A7Q\" pgmap=\"35\">We are constrained to reverse this case, with directions to dismiss the proceedings of the defendants in error in the court below.</p> <p id=\"b35-10\" pgmap=\"35\">Reversed with directions.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
