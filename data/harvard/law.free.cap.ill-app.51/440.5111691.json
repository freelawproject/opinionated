There was no other evidence as to the age or health of the appellee. Before he was hurt he worked at a lathe for manufacturing jewelry and received either fifteen or sixteen per week.</p> <p id=\"b437-4\" pgmap=\"437\">The verdict and judgment are for $12,500. The only question in the case is whether the amount is excessive. We do not feel justified so to decide. Chicago City Ry. v. Wilcox, 33 Ill. App. 450; Chicago v. Leseth, 43 Ill. App. 480.
