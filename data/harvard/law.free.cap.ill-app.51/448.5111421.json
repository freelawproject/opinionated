Jackson hereby agrees to sell, and George I Hicks agrees to purchase, at the price of $262,080, the following described real estate, situated in Cook County, Illinois: Blocks 1 to 6, both inclusive, and 8 to 25, both inclusive, in Stony Island Heights Subdivision, being a subdivision made by the Calumet and Chicago Canal and Dock Company of part of the southwest quarter of section one (1), township 37 north, range 14 east of the third principal meridian.

Jacksoh,</p> <p id=\"Afj\" pgmap=\"449\">George I. Hicks.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b449-9\" pgmap=\"449\">On the twenty-second of September following, the appellees gave to the appellants this paper:</p> <p id=\"b449-10\" pgmap=\"449\">\u201c Chicago, III.', Sept. 22, 1890.</p> <p id=\"b449-11\" pgmap=\"449(19) 450(146)\">In consideration that Snow &amp; Dickenson have brought about and are now about to consummate the sale of blocks 1 to 6, both inclusive, and blocks 8 to 25, both inclusive, in Stony Island Heights Subdivision, being a subdivision made by the Calumet and Chicago Canal and Dock Company of a part of the southwest quarter of section 1, township 37 north, range 14 east of 3d principal meridian, for the sum of $288,288, of which $50,000 is cash, and the balance to be secured by deed of trust or mortgage on said property, ive, and each of us, hereby agree to pay and deliver to said Snow &amp; Dickenson for making said sale, of the notes representing the deferred payments of said purchase money, the following notes: One to be made by Sherburn Bryant for $16,570, due on or before \u00a1November 1, 1890, with interest, and one note made by said Bryant for $10,000, Avith interest due on or before \u00a1November 1, 1890.</p> <p id=\"b450-6\" pgmap=\"450\">' The foregoing notes are to be delivered to Snow &amp; Dickinson Avhen said sale is. closed, and as soon as the same are executed and delivered by said Bryant, and shall be in full for all compensation of said Snow &amp; Dickinson, in respect to said transaction, and shall be their absolute property.</p> <p id=\"AP4r\" pgmap=\"450\">SAmuel W. Jackson,</p> <p id=\"ArC\" pgmap=\"450\">Samuel B. Postee, .</p> <p id=\"b450-8\" pgmap=\"450\">IT. J. \u00a1Reynolds,</p> <p id=\"b450-9\" pgmap=\"450\">W. IT. Pbidmoee,</p> <p id=\"b450-10\" pgmap=\"450\">W. A. Pbidmoee, .</p> <p id=\"b450-11\" pgmap=\"450\">J. W. McFaelane.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b450-12\" pgmap=\"450\">On the next day a deed was executed and delivered by Samuel W. Jackson to Sherburn Bryant, on the terms of the contract with Bryant, except that the times of payment were changed. The terms of the paper last copied were carried out; the appellants collected the money on the notes, and thereby received $25,411.36 more than three per cent commission on $288,288, the price on the sale to Bryant.</p> <p id=\"b450-13\" pgmap=\"450(44) 451(83)\">The object of this suit is to compel the appellants to pay that excess to the appellees, and the decree is for-that sum, Avith interest in favor of the appellees. In general terms it may be said that the testimony is conflicting upon everything not in writing. Upon that testimony on one side, it is argued that the paper first copied herein, was an option to the appellants, to themselves buy the property, and that on the sale to Bryant they were entitled to the difference in prices as their profit. To that it is sufficient to answer that the legal effect of a writing\u2014what it means by express words or by implication\u2014can not be varied by parol. Schultz v. Plankinton Bank, 40 Ill. App. 462.</p> <p id=\"b451-4\" pgmap=\"451\">Had the giving up to the appellants of the notes, mentioned in the paper of September 22d, been a gift by the appellees, it would have been irrevocable (8 Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law, 1339), unless the relations of the parties prevented that consequence. But it does not purport to be a gift, but payment for services already substantially rendered, under a retainer for a much smaller consideration. The appellants could not demand more than the price they had agreed upon. 1 Chi tty on Cont., 60.</p> <p id=\"b451-5\" pgmap=\"451\">They were in a fiduciary relation and had no right to speculate upon the interests committed to their care, or to put themselves in a position adverse to the interests of the appellants. Hughes v. Washington, 12 Ill. 84.</p> <p id=\"b451-6\" pgmap=\"451\">\u201c In any contract of purchase and sale with the principal, or other transaction by which the agent obtains a benefit, a presumption arises against its validity which the agent must overcome.\u201d 2 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity, 486.</p> <p id=\"b451-7\" pgmap=\"451\">On the case as thus far stated, there is no good reason why the agents should have the money of their principals.</p> <p id=\"b451-8\" pgmap=\"451\">It further appears that Bryant professed, at the time that the sale was to be closed up, that he was unable to perform on his part, and that to close the sale the appellants took one-fifth interest in the property with Bryant, but on the whole evidence it is by no means certain that the appellees were informed, before the deed from Jackson to Bryant was delivered, of this action of the appellants.</p> <p id=\"b451-9\" pgmap=\"451\">It is therefore irrelevant to discuss what the effect would have been if the appellees had been informed.</p> <p id=\"b451-10\" pgmap=\"451(21) 452(18)\">The paper of September 22, 1890, under which the appellants took the notes, makes no allusion to any new consideration. The appellants can not claim any rights under what might have been, but never was, a consideration.</p> <p id=\"b452-5\" pgmap=\"452\">That the appellees availed themselves of all the benefits of the sale by receiving money upon the deferred payments, after they knew that the appellants had taken the fifth interest in the property, is true; if their interest in the property were a thing to be avoided or confirmed, rescinded or ratified, it is too late to undo what was done. But as the case is presented, the matter of who were interested in the purchase is unimportant; the sale, so far as the appellees knew, was to Bryant; they do not seek to rescind any part of the transaction with him; they have the right to stand now upon what they then had notice of.</p> <p id=\"b452-6\" pgmap=\"452\">Thus regarded, the case is that the agents have the money of their principals with no right to retain it.</p> <p id=\"b452-7\" pgmap=\"452\">The decree is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
