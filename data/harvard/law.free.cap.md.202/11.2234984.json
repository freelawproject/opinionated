J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AW\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-14\">The correct method of computing the tax on an executor\u2019s commissions is the question to which our attention is directed by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-15\">The appellant, as executor of the estate of the late John J. Raskob, having filed his first administration account showing a total personal estate of $11,643,791.64 and a tax of $23,447.58 on his commissions, and having paid the same, later filed an <em>ex parte </em>petition in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Queen Anne\u2019s County, praying\u2019 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>be allowed to correct his account by reducing the tax to $17,244.22. The difference of $6,203.36 is the amount of the tax computed at the rate of one-fifth of one per cent on the indebtedness of $3,100,000 plus interest which the decedent owed to a family holding company, known as Radelco Corporation. At the time of his death the decedent owned 83.5%, and his family the rest of the stock, in Radelco. Another way of stating the matter is that the executor now contends that in calculating the estate (which is the basis of the tax on the executor\u2019s commissions) the Radelco stock should not have been included at its full market value, but that this sum should have been reduced by offsetting the amount of Mr. Raskob\u2019s debt to the corporation. From a denial of the prayer of the petition the executor has taken this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The pertinent statute is <em>Art. 81, Sec.. US, </em>of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1951 Edition), which reads as follows: \u201cAll commissions allowed to executors by the Orphans\u2019 Courts of this State shall, except as provided in Section 172 of this Article [not here involved], be subject to a tax, for the benefit of the State, of an amount equal to one per-cent on the first Twenty Thousand ($20,000) Dollars of the estate, and one-fifth of one per cent on the balance of the estate, and said tax shall be due and payable whether the executor waives his commissions or not, it being hereby intended that no commissions less than this tax shall be allowed by the Orphans\u2019 Courts of this State, and that no waiver of commissions or devise or legacy as compensation or in lieu of commissions shall defeat the payment of this tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Soon after Mr. Raskob\u2019s death, the executors turned in the estate\u2019s stock holdings in Radelco to the corporation and received from it a <em>pro rata </em>share of the securities owned by it. The estate\u2019s <em>pro rata </em>share of the corporation\u2019s net cash and receivables amounted to $2,743,993.98. Against this, in the settlement between the corporation and the executor, the estate\u2019s indebtedness of $3,100,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>was off-set, resulting in a net payment by the executor to the corporation of the balance of $356,006.02 plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Before the passage of the Act of 1884, Chapter 470, now codified as <em>Section 5 of Article 93 </em>(Code of 1951), commissions were allowed oh the \u201cinventory or inventories\u201d, excluding what was lost or perished. By the Act of 1884 it was provided that commissions should be computed on the \u201cestate\u201d. The tax on commissions was formerly calculated on the amount of the commissions, but since 1916 the statute above quoted requires the tax to be computed on the estate regardless of the amount actually allowed or paid as commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The appellant attaches a special significance to this change in formula. He points to it as lending support to his contention that only the net amount (i.e., the value of the stock less decedent\u2019s indebtedness) should have been included in the estate, and that only the net amount is the proper basis for computing the allowable commissions and the tax thereon. While the appellant acknowledges that the calculation of commissions and of the tax thereon is based on the gross value of the estate and not on the net value after deduction of debts and expenses, he nevertheless maintains that the question here is the proper method of valuing one of those assets, namely, decedent\u2019s stock interest in Radelco Corporation. The executor insists that the true value of this asset is not the fair value of the stock itself, but such value diminished by the $3,100,000 debt the decedent owed the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">To achieve the desired result the appellant urges this Court, as he urged the Orphans\u2019 Court, to be \u201crealistic\u201d, and to treat Mr. Raskob\u2019s indebtedness to Radelco Corporation as essentially an indebtedness to himself. This would require us to disregard the corporate form and to treat Radelco Corporation as Mr. Raskob\u2019s <em>alter ego. </em>The precise point has not been decided in this State, but we turn first to somewhat analogous cases to learn the general trend of the Maryland decisions and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>discover what if any answer they indicate to the question raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In the case of <em>York v. Md. Trust Co., </em>150 Md. 354, 133 A. 128, 46 A. L. R. 231, the decedent owned property most of which consisted of large blocks of stock worth about $1,700,000, but he had delivered this property to bankers as collateral for a loan of approximately $1,000,000. The executor arranged for the sale of the stock in small lots and at different times at prices yielding more than the original inventory value, and liquidated the bankers\u2019 loans. The controversy was between the widow of the testator and the executor over the allowance of commissions. The executor claimed commissions on the estate computed at the full market value of the pledged securities, while the widow contended that commissions should have been based on the testator\u2019s equity in these securities. The Orphans\u2019 Court, having regard for the extent and the nature of his services, upheld the executor\u2019s claim and was affirmed on appeal. This Court noted that the availability of an asset to an executor gives him such qualified possession, though physically held by a creditor as pledgee, as to justify inclusion of the gross asset in the estate for the purpose of calculating commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Judge Walsh\u2019s opinion in that case is interesting here chiefly because it carefully reviewed the earlier cases, particularly <em>Handy v. Collins, </em>60 Md. 229, and <em>Hardt v. Birely, </em>72 Md. 134, 19 A. 606, tracing the statutory changes made from time to time in respect to the calculation of commissions. In <em>Hardt v. Birely, </em>thip Court said it could see no reason why a value may not be ascertained for private securities in the same or some other more desirable manner as is now in use to fix the value of public securities. This was decided after the Act of 1884 had shifted the basis for computing commissions from \u201cinventory\u201d to \u201cestate\u201d, and the Court distinguished <em>Handy v. Collins, </em>decided under the earlier statute, which as interpreted excluded from \u201cinventory\u201d certain private bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Appellant correctly, points out that <em>York v. Md. Trust Co., </em>involved, as we have seen, no question of tax on commissions.' It is obviously true, however, that if securities, whether listed on the market and freely traded in or closely held, are includable in \u201cestate\u201d, .in calculating. commissions, they are certainly includable in \u201cestate\u201d in computing the tax' on commissions. The present statute^ <em>Sec. H3 of Article 81, </em>contemplates a tax on full maximum allowable' commissions, measured by the entire estate even though .the commission actually allowed and paid may be less; but no possibility is left open under the statute for a tax on commissions measured by less than everything properly includable in computing \u201cestate\u201d \\ for the purpose of fixing the \u25a0 commissions themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The appellant says that his case is distinguishable from the <em>York </em>case,, because in the latter the estate\u2019s .indebtedness was- to a third party (the .bank) while here \u201cthe decedent\u2019s indebtedness, being to the corporation issuing the stock, the debt had a direct bearing upon the value of the decedent\u2019s stock.\u201d He relies heavily on three New York cases not decided in the Court of Appeals of that State. Two of these involve situations quite similar to the one at bar. It must be borne in mind that the New York Statute treating of executor\u2019s commissions fixes them with reference to \u201creceiving and paying out all sums . . <em>Surrogate\u2019s Court Act, See. 285, </em>in contradistinction to the amount of the \u201cestate\u201d, the basis under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">. In the two New York cases involving corporations in which the decedents held stock and to which they were indebted, the courts refused to allow executor\u2019s commissions on the gross , amount without regard to the. debt, on the ground that there was no \u201creceiving .and paying out\u201d within the meaning of the' statute. <em>Matter of Dunigan\u2019s Will, </em>177 Misc. 212, 30 N. Y. S. 2d 38, and <em>Matter of Schmoll\u2019s Estate, </em>193 Misc. 203, 83 N. Y. S. 2d 743. In the former the court \u25a0 disregarded the corporate entity of a one man wholly owned , corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>tion,. for the purposes of deciding executor\u2019s commissions where decedent owed a debt to his corporation. In that case it is significant that the decedent held 100% of the stock, while in the instant case decedent held but 83.5%, consequently the precise question of the Dunigan case is not before us, since the interests of third persons in Radelco distinguish the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><em>Carozza v. Federal Finance and Credit Co., </em>149 Md. 223, 238, 131 A. 332, 43 A. L. R. 1, generally limits disregard of the corporate entity where the corporation is wholly owned by one individual, to cases where this is necessary to prevent frauds and impositions, or to enforce superior equities. See also, <em>1 Fletcher Cyc. Corp. </em>(Perm. Ed.) 134-176; <em>Dollar Cleansers v. McGregor, </em>163 Md. 105, 108, 161 A. 159; <em>Hammond v. Lyon Realty Co., </em>163 Md. 442, 451, 470, 163 A. 480; <em>Hock and Co. v. Strohm, </em>166 Md. 253, 256, 170 A. 738; <em>Waller v. Waller, </em>187 Md. 185, 191, 49 A. 2d 449. Decedent created Radelco in order to enjoy the advantages that the corporate device offers. With its benefits must come its burdens. We do not accept appellant\u2019s argument that the corporate veil should be lifted for the purpose of computing the state tax on the executor\u2019s commission. Disregard of the corporate entity to effectuate a diminution in state taxes would be a novel extention of the recognized grounds, to which this court is not inclined.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">If we are to be realistic, as we are bidden by the appellant, we cannot overlook the fact that the executor, though not holding all the stock in Radelco, nevertheless dominated that corporation. His was the decision as to how he would liquidate his holdings in that corporation and how he would discharge the estate\u2019s debt to it. It was in his power to effect a virtual liquidation of Radelco and to apply his share of its assets toward the payment of the estate\u2019s debt to it. This is the course he preferred. He could, if he chose, have sold the stock for cash to a third person, using the cash to reduce the debt to Radelco; or he could have, wound up the Company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>received his share of its assets and used it to pay off this debt or used it elsewhere. The method adopted is not important for, as we view it, the tax would have been precisely the same. The significant fact is that in the circumstances of this case the executor had it in his power to obtain possession either of (a) the sale price of the Radelco stock, or (b) his share of its underlying assets and to satisfy the estate\u2019s liability, or part of it, by surrender of the stock; or (c) he could, as he did, effect a liquidation of the stock and the debt in a single step. This degree of mastery over the gross assets, viewed realistically, under the rule recognized in the <em>York </em>case, <em>supra, </em>justifies inclusion of the undiminished value of the Radelco stock in the \u201cestate\u201d in measuring the tax on commissions. In the <em>York </em>case, where the securities were pledged to secure the debt, there was a stronger basis than in the case at bar for arguing that only the net sum realized should be included in the \u201cestate\u201d. Here we have no pledge of the stock, and it could have been sold at the executor\u2019s option free of the debt. If the total securities were includable without diminution for the debt in the <em>York </em>case, <em>a fortiori </em>the same result is required here.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The third case relied on by the appellant, <em>Matter of Lilienthal\u2019s Estate, </em>83 N. Y. S. 2d 742, is one where the Surrogate rejected an executor\u2019s claim for commissions on an amount from which no deduction had been made of the decedent\u2019s indebtedness to a partnership of which he was a member, on the ground that the debt constituted a set-off against the decedent\u2019s partnership interest. There, clearly, neither the New York rule of \u201creceiving and paying out\u201d, nor the Maryland rule, could operate in the ordinary case where the partnership is wound up by the survivor and the net amount is turned over to the personal representative to entitle the latter to a commission undiminished by the decedent\u2019s debt to the partnership. See <em>Article 73A, Sec. 37, </em>Annotated Code of Maryland (1951 Edition).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">As <em>amicus curiae, </em>the Attorney General, in his brief, cites <em>Doherty v. Stoner, </em>83 U. S. App. D. C. 365, 169 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>2d 965, a District of Columbia case in which the question arose as to computation of executor\u2019s commissions with regard to a decedent\u2019s bank account. At decedent\u2019s death, the account consisted of $44,000, but thirteen days later a $25,000 note of decedent held by the bank matured, against which account the note was charged. Refusing to apply the \u201cpaying and receiving\u201d test under a statute providing for computation of an executor\u2019s commission as a percentage of the inventory, the court held commissions were to be calculated on the basis of $44,000 rather than $19,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">So also, where a decedent\u2019s personal property had been made the subject of a bill of sale, intended to operate as a chattel mortgage, this court has held that the inventory should include the full value of the chattels, not merely decedent\u2019s equity. <em>State, use of Horsey v. Md. Cas.. Co., </em>164 Md. 69, 75, 163 A. 856. While this case did not deal with the immediate question of executor\u2019s commissions or the tax due thereon, it sheds light on our problem for it illustrates the theory uniformly followed in this State in determining the \u201cestate\u201d of a decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">We conclude that the tax was correctly computed in the original account.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">It remains but to notice the way in which the question has been raised in this case. The petition for leave to revise the administration account and to retrieve a portion of the tax paid on the executor\u2019s commissions was filed <em>ex parte, </em>although the matter is one of direct concern to the State Treasury. The Attorney General, representing the State\u2019s interest, entered the case only as <em>amicus curiae. </em>While we have passed over this circumstance because counsel who argued the matter have requested us to do so, we nevertheless do not wish to give approval to this procedure and it should not be regarded as a precedent to be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs to amicus curiae.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
