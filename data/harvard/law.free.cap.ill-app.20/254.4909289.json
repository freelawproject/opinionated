Lehn, it is true, said that he owed a little debt, and Kasch and Van Deursen gave him in cash some $233 to pay such debt; Kasch and Tan Deursen appear to have acted in good faith, with the honest intention of securing their claim, and so managing the real estate that Lehn might realize something out of it after the payment of the debts which were liens upon it, and with no intention to aid him to hinder or delay complainant or any other creditor.
