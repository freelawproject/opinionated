An allegation that the note in suit \u201cwas duly protested for nonpayment\u201d sufficiently alleges, therefore, due notice to the indorsers of its nonpayment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b260-16\">The law of the State where a note is payable governs as to the notice of nonpayment required to be given to indorsers.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b260-17\">Under \u00a7 697 of the General Statutes, our courts take judicial notice of a statute appearing in the printed statute book of another State.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b260-18\">A bank holding an indorsed note for collection may give notice of its dishonor tp all parties liable thereon, or only to its principal from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>whom it received the note, leaving the latter to notify in turn its principal or antecedent indorser, and so on down the line.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b261-6\">In the present case the collecting bank, through its notary, mailed two notices of protest to the forwarding bank, on the day of the note\u2019s presentment and dishonor, and on the following day the latter bank received and remailed them to the defendant\u2019s post-office, where they were received in due course, but were not taken from the mail by the defendant until several days later. <em>Held </em>that both banks had used due diligence, and that the defendant had received all the notice of dishonor he was entitled to, either under the Negotiable Instruments Act, or the common law of New York, which, in this particular, did not differ from the common law of Connecticut.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b261-7\">Argued April 30th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ajm\">\u2014decided July 25th, 1913.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-8\">Action against the payee and accommodation indorser of a negotiable promissory note, brought to and tried by the Superior Court in New London County, <em>Ralph Wheeler, J.; </em>facts found and judgment rendered for the plaintiff for $1,540, and appeal by the defendant. <em>No error.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-9\">One Hendrick made at Norwich, Connecticut, to the defendant, as payee, the promissory note in suit, payable at the Columbia Trust Company in New York City, and the defendant indorsed the note for the accommodation of Hendrick; subsequently the plaintiff became and still is its owner for value, and, before it became due, deposited the same with the National Whaling1 Bank of New London for collection. The bank indorsed the note, guaranteed the indorsements, and transmitted it to the National Park Bank of New York, for presentment to the Columbia Trust Company, and for collection. The National Park Bank duly presented the note for payment, and, the same being refused, it caused, by a notary, due protest of the note to be made on August 7th, 1911, and on August 8th, 1911, the notary mailed a written notice of the presentation, nonpayment, and dishonor of the note in an envelope addressed to the defendant at New London, Connect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>icut, postage prepaid; this letter was at some time readdressed to the defendant at his residence in Norwich, Connecticut, and in due course of mail reached him on August 11th, 1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\">The notary, also on August 8th, 1911, enclosed in an envelope addressed to the National Whaling Bank two similar notices addressed to the defendant, and the bank received them August 9th, 1911, and on the same day mailed them in an envelope, postage prepaid, addressed to the defendant'at Norwich, Connecticut, where they were received in due course of mail, but were not taken from the post-office by the defendant until August 14th, 1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-7\">No part of this note has been paid.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-8\"><em>Donald G.

The finding that they were holders is a necessary inference from the facts proven, and their agency for the owner is a necessary conclusion of law, and whether it is in the finding or not is immaterial. . \u201cSuch agents are recognized in the law as \u2018holders for collection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Isbell, </em>31 Conn. 296, 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">The fact that the indorsement of the WTialing Bank now appears to be erased on the note is unimportant, and furnishes no ground for adding this fact to the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">Another assignment of error is the rendition of judgment against the defendant indorser, based upon the giving of the notice of dishonor, when no such allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>is found in the complaint. The defendant is mistaken in his assumption that the giving of notice of dishonor is not alleged in the complaint. It is alleged that the note \u201cwas duly protested for the nonpayment thereof.\u201d Presentment for payment, protest, and notice of dishonor are terms of the law, each having a different meaning and comprising independent acts. In its popular significance \u201cprotest\u201d includes all the steps necessary to establish the liability of an indorser upon a dishonored note. Therefore, when it is alleged that due protest was made, it will ordinarily be understood that presentment, protest, and notice have been had, since the contract of the indorser under the law merchant depends upon presentment and refusal to pay and due notice to the indorser. The law merchant and the banking business have adopted in ordinary use the popular sense of this term. <em>City Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Hopson, 53 </em>Conn. 453, 455, 5 Atl. 601; <em>Coddington </em>v. Davis, 3 Denio (N. Y.) 16, 25; <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Lorain Bank, </em>2 Ohio St. 345, 353; <em>Wolford </em>v. <em>Andrews, 29 </em>Minn. 250, 251, 13 N. W. 167; <em>Wood River Bank </em>v. <em>First Nat. Bank, </em>36 Neb. 744, 747, 55 N. W. 239; 2 Daniels on Negotiable Instruments (5th Ed.) \u00a7 929; Norton on Bills &amp; Notes (3d Ed.) \u00a7 144, p. 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The defendant\u2019s second defense was that no notice of dishonor as required by law was given him. The trial court\u2019s conclusion upon the facts that the notice was adequate is assigned as error. Since the place of payment was New York, the law of that jurisdiction governs as to the giving of the notice. <em>Guernsey </em>v. <em>Imperial Bank, </em>188 Fed. Rep. 300, 110 C. C. A. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The Negotiable Instruments Act is a part of the law of New York, of which we take judicial notice. General Statutes, \u00a7 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The National Park Bank might have given notice to the parties liable upon the note, or to its own prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>cipal. 3 Consolidated Laws of New York, p. 3675, \u00a7 165 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. It, through the notary, on the day of presentment, gave notice to the Whaling Bank, from whom it received the note, by mailing two notices of protest to it. On the next day, upon receipt of the notices, the Whaling Bank forwarded them to the defendant at his proper address by mail, thus complying with the Negotiable Instruments Law. 3 Consolidated Laws of New York, p. 3678, \u00a7 178. So that the requirements of this law were fully met. This law in these particulars reaffirms the law merchant, and conforms to the universal custom of banks, from which custom the law grew.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">A bank holding an indorsed note for collection is only required to give notice of dishonor to its principal from whom it received the note, and its principal in turn notifies its principal or antecedent indorser, and so down the fine. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Engs, </em>5 Cow. (N. Y.) 303; <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>18 Johns. Rep. (N. Y.) 327; <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Ballou, </em>18 N. Y. 327; <em>Phipps </em>v. <em>Millbury Bank, </em>49 Mass. (8 Met.) 79; <em>United States Bank </em>v. <em>Goddard, </em>5 Mason (U. S. C. C.) 366; Norton on Bills &amp; Notes (3d Ed.) pp. 381, 382; 1 Morse on Banks &amp; Banking (4th Ed.) \u00a7 232; <em>East Haddam Bank </em>v. <em>Scovil, </em>12 Conn. 303, 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Both the Park Bank and the Whaling Bank used due diligence, and the defendant received all the notice of dishonor he was entitled to, either under the Negotiable Instruments Act, or under the common law of New York, which, so far as the giving of notice of dishonor is concerned, does not differ from our own common law. \u25a0 As this notice was sufficient, we need not inquire as to the sufficiency of the notice directed to the defendant at New London.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
