J., Thayer, Rorabace:, Wheeler and Beach, Js.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b418-7\">A savings-bank book, whose authenticity is not challenged, is competent evidence that the amounts credited were in fact deposited; and is \u2019 admissible in corroboration of the testimony of the depositor to that effect which had already come in without any objection.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b418-8\">In an unsuccessful action for alienating the affections of the plaintiff\u2019s wife, the plaintiff contended that the charge of the court had imposed upon him the burden of proving a total, as distinguished from a partial, loss or deprivation of his wife\u2019s affection, as a condition precedent to his recovery. <em>Held </em>that inasmuch as the parties were agreed that there had been a total loss of affection, and were practically at issue only as to who was responsible for it, the charge in this respect, even if incorrect, could not have been harmful to the appellant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b418-9\">The main controversy in the present case was whether the defendant, who had employed the plaintiff\u2019s wife as a housekeeper, had wrongfully alienated her affections, or whether such condition had been caused by the husband\u2019s own conduct, either alone or in connection with his wife\u2019s own volition. Under these circumstances the trial</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b418-10\">' court instructed the jury, in substance, that the plaintiff must prove that the defendant \u201cknowingly and intentionally\u201d was the \u201ccontrolling and effective\u201d cause of the admitted loss of his wife's society and affections. <em>Held </em>that this instruction was not open to objection; that while the defendant\u2019s conduct need not be the sole cause of the alienation, it must be shown to be the controlling cause.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b418-11\">The plaintiff also complained that the trial court had not instructed the jury that the burden of proving \u201cmatters of justification\u201d rested upon the defendant. <em>Held </em>that there was no occasion for such a charge, since the defense rested upon and was confined to a general denial of the plaintiff\u2019s charge, under which all his evidence was introduced.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b418-12\">From an extract from the charge the appellant inferred that the jury had been told that the plaintiff must prove not only alienation, but also a transfer of his wife\u2019s affections to the defendant. <em>Held </em>that this inference was unfounded as shown by other portions of the charge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b418-13\">The jury were instructed that the defendant had a legal right to employ the plaintiff\u2019s wife as his housekeeper, and that unless he counseled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>aided or advised her, in bad faith, to remain away from the plaintiff, or prevented reconciliation, and by his acts and conduct unlawfully enticed and alienated her affections, the plaintiff could not recover. The appellant contended that this required him to prove both enticement of his wife and alienation of her affections. <em>Held </em>that this criticism was not well founded and that of the charge as a whole the appellant had no cause of complaint.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-6\">Assignments of error for failure to charge touching matters in respect <em>to </em>which no requests to charge were made, are not well taken, if the charge as a whole is sufficient.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b419-7\">Argued June 5th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ABk\">\u2014decided July 30th, 1913.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-8\">Action to recover damages for wrongfully depriving the plaintiff of the comfort, society and services of his wife and the loss of her love and affection, brought to the Superior Court in New Haven County and tried to the jury before <em>Bennett, J.; </em>verdict and judgment for the defendant, and appeal by the plaintiff. <em>No error.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-9\"><em>Ulysses G.

Mrs. Miller, before the book was offered in evidence, had testified that she was employed by the defendant as housekeeper, and regularly paid $12 a week, a large part of which she had deposited in the Waterbury Savings Bank; and she was allowed, without objection, to identify the book, and to testify that the money deposited in that account was earned at the defendant\u2019s home. The evidence having gone thus far without objection, the book itself was logically corroborative of Mrs. Miller\u2019s testimony, and the failure to offer it in evidence might have been unfavorably commented on. The objection was, not that the entries were not properly proved, but that the book was a self-serving declaration and remote, and, being thus limited, the objection was properly overruled; for entries in a savings-bank book, whose authenticity is not challenged, are competent evidence that moneys were deposited as credited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The second, third, and fourth assignments of error are as follows:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">2. The court erred in charging: \u201cIt is not necessary for him [the plaintiff] to show that there was full affection, if he can show that defendant deprived him of what remains of that affection\u2014deprived him entirely of what remained of that affection between himself and his wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">3. The court erred in charging: \u201cPlaintiff here claims to have shown that whatever the state of their affections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>may have been when the wife went away into the employment of Mr. Pierpont, the defendant, that later her affection became entirely alienated from him. Of course, that fact must be proved, and the plaintiff claims to have shown it by proof of the history of the case leading up to the time when the wife brought a [suit for] divorce against him, and her declarations which he says are proven, that she refused altogether to come back and live with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">4. \u201cThe court erred in failing to charge that the plaintiff was entitled to recover in the action under his complaint if he prove that the defendant had wrongfully alienated the affections of his wife, and that it was not necessary for the plaintiff to show that his wife\u2019s affections had been entirely alienated, but if he prove that there had been a partial alienation of affections by the defendant from which the plaintiff had suffered damage, he could recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The plaintiff complains that by these instructions and omissions the burden was put upon him of proving a total, as distinguished from a partial, deprivation of the wife\u2019s affections, as a condition precedent to any recovery. Assuming the charge of the court upon this point was erroneous (a question which we have no occasion to determine), it could not have injured the plaintiff in this case; for the findings show that a total loss, not only of consortium, but of affection also, was claimed by the plaintiff and admitted by the defendant. The plaintiff pointed to the divorce suit and the refusal of the wife to return, and the defendant admitted that the wife\u2019s affection was entirely gone, claiming, as appears from the findings, that her affection had been \u201ccompletely destroyed,\u201d and \u201ccompletely alienated,\u201d by the husband\u2019s own conduct. The plaintiff cannot have been injured by being required to prove a fact which he asserted and the defendant admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>The fourth, seventh, thirteenth, fourteenth, sixteenth, eighteenth, twenty-first, twenty-second, and twenty-third assignments of error are all founded upon the alleged failure of the court to charge in respect of the special matters set forth therein; but, as the plaintiff made no request to charge, and as the charge as a whole is sufficient, these assignments are not well taken. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>71 Conn. 61, 62, 40 Atl. 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The fifth to the thirteenth assignments of error, inclusive, \u25a0 relate to the several portions of the charge in which the jury were told in various forms that the plaintiff must make it appear that the defendant \u201cknowingly and intentionally\u201d was \u201cthe controlling and effective\u201d cause of the admitted loss of the wife\u2019s society and affection. The principal controversy in the case was whether the defendant had wrongfully brought about this condition, or whether it was caused by the husband\u2019s own conduct, either alone or in connection with the wife\u2019s own volition. No objection is made to the word \u201ceffective\u201d in this connection, but it is said that the additional word \u201ccontrolling\u201d was erroneous, in that the jury must have understood that they were to determine whether the plaintiff or the defendant was the \u201ccontrolling cause of the alienation.\u201d We see no objection to this part of the charge, either upon the question of knowledge and intent, or upon the question of controlling cause. The defendant\u2019s conduct need not be the sole cause of the alienation, but it must appear to be the controlling cause; and if the plaintiff\u2019s own conduct was the controlling cause he certainly cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The other assignments of error relate to those parts of the charge dealing with what the plaintiff calls matters of justification; the general objection being that the jury were not instructed that the burden of proof, as to these matters, was on the defendant. The defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>however, did not admit that he caused the loss of consortium and affection, but denied his responsibility for it altogether, and explained the wife\u2019s continued residence in his house by her employment as housekeeper at her own request, and from proper motives on his part. The defendant\u2019s evidence was all admitted under a general denial, and so long as the defendant confined his defense to the proof of matters admissible under a general denial, and inconsistent with the allegations of the complaint, he assumed no burden which required him to establish any fact by a preponderance of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The nineteenth assignment of error is founded on an extract from the charge which, as printed in the record, is grammatically incomplete, and from which the appellant infers that the jury were instructed that the plaintiff must prove not only alienation, but a transfer of his wife\u2019s affections to the defendant. But we think that plaintiff\u2019s inference from this incomplete fragment of the charge is unfounded, because the jury had already been instructed that \u201cit is not necessary that the plaintiff should have shown to you that defendant has debauched the wife, nor is it necessary that the plaintiff should show that the affection which he claims to have lost has been gained by the defendant.\u201d And in connection with the language excepted to in the nineteenth assignment, the court referred back to the above language, saying: \u201cAnd that, as I have already charged you in other words, is the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The twentieth assignment of error is that the court erred in charging that \u201cthe defendant had a legal right to employ the wife of the plaintiff as his housekeeper, and unless he counselled, aided, or advised the plaintiff\u2019s wife to remain away from the plaintiff in bad faith, or prevented reconciliation, and by his acts and conduct unlawfully enticed and alienated the affections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>of the plaintiff\u2019s wife, your verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The objection is that the plaintiff was required to show both enticement of the wife to remain away, and alienation of affections. We think this criticism is largely a matter of punctuation or emphasis, and that if a proper significance be given to the disjunctive preposition, the language in question charges that the plaintiff must prove either a wrongful harboring of the wife\u2019s person, or a wrongful interference with and alienation of her affection for her husband. Taking the charge of the court as a whole, the plaintiff has no ground for complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
