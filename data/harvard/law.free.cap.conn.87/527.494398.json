The court did not err in so holding, and in refusing to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">The defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment notwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>standing the verdict was entirely inappropriate to the situation before the court. Such a judgment is not rendered upon the evidence, but upon the admissions of the pleadings. The judgment is in its essence one by confession. The defendant\u2019s pleadings consisted solely of denials of the allegations of the complaint. Of necessity, therefore, there are no uncontroverted allegations entitling him to a judgment, even if it be assumed that such a judgment may be rendered in favor of a defendant upon the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, as at common law it could not be. 1 Swift\u2019s Digest, s. p. 779; Stephen on Pleading, s. p. 98; <em>Schermerhorn </em>v. <em>Schermerhorn, 5 Wend. </em>(N.
