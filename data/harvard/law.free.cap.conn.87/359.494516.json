Banks, deceased, was the owner, of a remainder interest in a portion of the latter\u2019s estate, consisting of both real and personal property, subject to the fife use of her husband, Edwin Banks, who died in April, 1912, and survived Beach some nineteen years. Beach,'in his will, disposed of this remainder interest by providing in its seventh paragraph that, after the property should come into the possession of his executor or other person authorized to receive it, $5,000 of it should be used for the purpose of founding a free bed in the Bridgeport Hospital, and, by further providing, in the eighth paragraph, that all the residue of this remainder interest, when paid over to the executor or other person authorized to receive it, should \u201cbe paid over to and divided equally among my then living, lawful heirs, to them and their heirs forever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-9\">After Beach\u2019s death and during Banks\u2019 life, the real estate was sold by order of the Court of Probate, and thus converted into cash. Beach\u2019s estate has been settled, except as to his interest in Mrs. Banks\u2019 estate. The sum of $12,976.16, representing this interest, is now in the hands of the plaintiff as administrator c. t. a. of said estate, ready for distribution to the persons entitled to receive it. Of this sum $1,952.09 was derived from the sale of Mrs. Banks\u2019 real estate. Beach left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>surviving Mm a widow to whom he was married in 1842. She died in 1897, leaving a will under which she disposed of all of her estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-6\">Advice is sought in answer to two questions. The first is whether the remainder created, or attempted to be created, in the eighth clause of the will in the \u201cthen living, lawful heirs\u201d of the testator, is inoperative and void, as being in contravention of the statute against perpetuities in force at the time of his death, or whether a valid disposition of such remainder was thereby made. The second relates to the manner in which that portion of the fund in the hands of the plaintiff, which represents the proceeds of real estate, should be distributed by him in the event that the testamentary provision should be held invalid and intestacy thereby result.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-7\"><em>Morris B. Beardsley </em>and <em>Samuel F. Beardsley, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-8\">No counsel appeared for any of the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b373-9\">Prentice, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANT\">The words \u201cmy then living, lawful heirs,\u201d used in the eighth clause of the testator\u2019s will to describe the persons to whom the subject of the gift in that clause should be paid over upon the termination of the life interest of Edwin Banks, are to be interpreted as meaning the lawful heirs of the testator, ascertained as of the time of his death, who should be living at the time of the life tenant\u2019s decease. Such interpretation is more in accordance with the natural meaning of the language used than would be the alternative one which would make the testator\u2019s lawful heirs, ascertained as of the date of the life tenant\u2019s death, the persons designated as the beneficiaries of the gift. The word \u201cheirs\u201d prima facie means those who, in the absence of a will, would be entitled to inherit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>from a deceased. <em>Nicoll </em>v. <em>Irby, </em>83 Conn. 530, 534, 77 Atl. 957. Again, it is more reasonable to believe that the testator used the qualifying words \u201cthen living\u201d as limiting and defining the members of a class liable to be diminished in its numbers by death as time passed, rather than as descriptive of a class, all of whose members must, by the necessity of the situation, be living when the class is formed. This construction also has it in its favor that it gives to the testator\u2019s provision validity and operative efficiency, and avoids unintended intestacy. <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Hatheway, </em>81 Conn. 181, 185, 70 Atl; 645; <em>Pease v. Cornell, </em>84 Conn. 391, 396, 80 Atl. 86. As thus interpreted, the provision in question is not void as being in contravention of the statute against perpetuities. This being our conclusion, the conditions involved in the remaining question are not present in the case. That question, therefore, requires no attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The request for a reservation in this case contains a stipulation signed by counsel conformably to the requirements of \u00a7 71 of the rules of this court. Practice Book (1908) p. 286. Such stipulation is not required where the action in the trial court is ready for .final judgment as this necessarily was. Rule 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The Superior Court is advised to render its judgment that the remainder attempted to be created in the eighth clause of the will in the \u201cthen living, lawful heirs\u201d of the testator is not inoperative and void, but that a valid disposition was thereby made of such remainder to the heirs of the testator, ascertained as of the time of his death, who should be living at the date of the decease of Edwin Banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">No costs in this court will be taxed in favor of any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
