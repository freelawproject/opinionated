The following facts appear in the plaintiff\u2019s case in chief: Plaintiff, who was engaged in the jobbing and repairing business of cutting and welding metals by the so-called Oxy-Acetylene or Oxy-Carbide process, adopted and used as a form of advertisement the catch-phrase \u201cSend it to Oxy.\u201d He registered the phrase under the statute (\u00a7 4899) before bringing this action. As the result of using this phrase for more than five years, on stationery and in other forms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>advertising, he was generally known in the trade and among his customers as \u201cOxy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The defendant, trading under the name of the New Haven Welding Company, was engaged in the same business in competition with the plaintiff, and occupied a shop on a continuation of the same street. In December, 1912, the defendant displayed a new sign on the front window of his shop, in the following form:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">OXY</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Acetylene Welding &amp;</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Cutting.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Coincidently with the appearance of this sign, the plaintiff\u2019s business fell off, as shown by his books, and did not recover to its former proportions until after the sign was taken down. Some of his customers asked him whether he had moved his place of business down on to Broadway; others complained of work not done by him; and in one instance a customer asked him to replace a piece of work which he mistakenly supposed the plaintiff had done. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the trial court granted a motion for judgment as of nonsuit, on the ground that the plaintiff had shown no violation upon the part of the defendant of any right which the plaintiff might have to the use of the word \u201cOXY,\u201d and also on the ground that the plaintiff had proved no damages resulting from such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">We think the trial court erred in .granting the motion and in refusing to set aside the nonsuit. The catchphrase \u201cSend it to Oxy,\u201d though not a technical trade-mark, is a distinctive form of advertisement which had come to be associated with the plaintiff, and he is entitled, as well in equity as under the statute, to be protected against any unfair appropriation of it by a competitor. The only practical test of infringe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>ment or unfair appropriation in these cases is to look at the actual or probable result of the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Here the plaintiff\u2019s distinctive form of advertisement takes the shape of an invitation to send it to \u201cOxy,\u201d and the defendant puts up in his window a sign of which the most prominent word is \u201cOxy\u201d standing by itself, and in larger letters than the rest of the sign. This is certainly liable to induce persons looking for \u201cOxy\u201d to believe that they had found him; and the evidence indicates that it did have that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">As to the damages, the evidence is that the plaintiff\u2019s credit business fell off about fifty per cent, during the time the defendant\u2019s sign was displayed, and began to recover as soon as it was taken down. Perhaps the defendant might have been able to show some other efficient cause for this loss of business, or that he got none of it; but, standing without contradiction or other explanation, the plaintiff\u2019s testimony made out a prima facie case of actionable wrong and resultant damage. Whether the-evidence offered any reasonable basis for fixing the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s damages is a question which need not be considered. It is sufficient in law to support a judgment for nominal damages, and the plaintiff was therefore entitled to go to a hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">There is error and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
