The trial judge gave priority to the lien held by First Commercial Corporation (First Commercial) which had financed the second sale. Based upon our interpretation of the pertinent provisions of <em>Title </em>12A, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-306(2) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-307(1), we are compelled to reverse, giving priority to the first secured creditor, notwithstanding the hardship to the innocent purchasers in the second sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">On October 30, 1978 respondent Charles Palmer (Palmer) purchased a 22-foot Penn Yan boat from Normandy Beach Marina (Normandy Beach) for $13,400. Palmer made a down-payment of $1,900 and financed the balance with Normandy Beach, which took a security interest in the boat. Normandy Beach then assigned all of its rights to the Ocean County National Bank (Ocean County Bank), which timely filed a UCC financing statement with the Monmouth County Clerk\u2019s Office and the Secretary of State. The financing statement listed Ocean County Bank as the secured party and was signed by Palmer as the debtor. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9- 105(l)(m); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-402(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Sometime thereafter, Palmer returned the boat to Normandy Beach with the understanding that it would be sold on his behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>and the Ocean County Bank lien satisfied. On April 30, 1979 respondents Guy and Mary Hess (Hess) purchased the boat from Normandy Beach, apparently out of inventory, for $11,500. Hess made a $4,500 downpayment and financed the balance with Normandy Beach, which took a security interest in the boat. The retail installment contract named Normandy Beach as the seller. Normandy Beach thereafter assigned its rights to First Commercial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Normandy Beach did not satisfy Palmer\u2019s debt to Ocean County Bank and did not obtain a discharge of that bank\u2019s lien. When Palmer later discovered that the boat had been sold, he stopped making payments on his loan. Ocean County Bank \u2022 declared the loan in default and, after locating the boat at the Hess home, repossessed it on May 2,1980. Following a textbook scenario, Normandy Beach filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Ocean County Bank brought this action to determine the priority of the two outstanding liens. Each of the parties also sought damages and various other remedies. The trial judge fixed the order of priorities in a partial summary judgment, subordinating Ocean County Bank\u2019s lien to that of First Commercial. Because some damage claims were not addressed, no final judgment was entered as to all parties. We have determined, however, that the interlocutory nature of this appeal ought not preclude disposition of the merits of the controversy. Therefore, we now grant leave to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>on our own motion. <em>See Butler v. Bonner &amp; Barnewall, Inc., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>567, 573, n. 2, n. 3 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The problem here is that neither Hess nor First Commercial knew that the boat bought by Hess was owned by Palmer. They had no reason to search for a financing statement signed by Palmer as debtor and had no notice that the boat being sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>by Normandy Beach was encumbered by a lien previously created by Palmer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, all parties agree that Mr. and Mrs. Hess were buyers in the ordinary course of business, having purchased the boat in good faith and without knowledge of Ocean County Bank\u2019s security interest. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:1-201(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Nevertheless, the general rule governing the sale of encumbered collateral is found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-306(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">Except where this Chapter otherwise provides, a security interest continues in collateral notwithstanding sale, exchange or other disposition thereof unless the disposition was authorized by the secured party in the security agreement or otherwise, and also continues in any identifiable proceeds including collections received by the debtor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The resale of the boat by Palmer or Normandy Beach was not authorized by the secured party, Ocean County Bank. Therefore, by reason of \u00a7 9-306(2), Ocean County Bank\u2019s perfected security interest in the boat continued unless another provision of chapter 9 permitted Hess to take free of that interest or gave First Commercial priority for its lien. <em>See Chemical Bank v. Miller Yacht Sales, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 101, n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Hess and First Commercial rely on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-307(1) as a basis for their claimed exception from the general rule established by \u00a7 9-306(2). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-307(1) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">A buyer in the ordinary course of business ... takes free of a security interest created by his seller even though the security interest is perfected and even though the buyer knows of its existence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Hess and First Commercial contend that the security interest held by Ocean County Bank was created to some extent by Normandy Beach. Therefore, they argue that \u00a7 9-307(1) allowed Hess to purchase the boat free of that security interest. The issue, then, is whether the security interest held by Ocean County Bank was created by Normandy Beach within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-307(1). The trial judge held that it was. In his oral opinion he said that Normandy Beach \u201cparticipated and [was] instrumental\u201d in creating the encumbrance and therefore, as between the second innocent consumer, Hess, and the innocent lienholder, Ocean County Bank, he would interpret \u00a7 9-307(1) to protect the second innocent consumer. In his ruling the trial judge relied on <em>Adams v. City Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>565 P.2d 26 (Okl.Sup.Ct.1977). Respondents seek to support this interpretation of \u00a7 9-307(1). They point out that Normandy Beach was a signatory to the retail installment contract and was a named payee of the promissory note signed by Palmer. They contend that the creation of a security interest in collateral requires the participation of at least two persons and that Normandy Beach was one of those persons. On the other hand, Ocean County Bank argues that a security interest is created by the buyer alone. It contends that the only way for Normandy Beach to have created a security interest in this instance within the meaning of \u00a7 9-307(1) would be if it had obtained a loan and pledged its inventory as collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The purpose of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-307(1) is to protect a bonafide purchaser who buys goods in the ordinary course of business from a dealer against the claim of a secured party who has financed the dealer\u2019s floor inventory. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-307(1), New Jersey Study Comment 12, which states that the concept follows that expressed in <em>R.S. </em>46:32-12 (\u00a7 9 of the Uniform Conditional Sales Act), namely, that the security interest is lost when the holder leaves the goods with a dealer in those goods with the expectation that they will be sold by the dealer in the ordinary course of business. <em>See Cunningham v. Camelot Motors, </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>489, 495-496 (Ch.Div.1975). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>Muir v. Jefferson Credit Corp., </em>108 <em>N.J.Super. </em>586 (Law Div. 1970), Justice Handler, then-Judge Handler explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\"><em>Section </em>9-307(1) is for the exclusive protection of those who buy from merchants in the ordinary course of business and out of inventory. Nevertheless, 9-307(1) limits its protection of such buyers against only a security interest which was \u201ccreated by [the buyer\u2019s] seller.\u201d [at 593]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Addressing the same issue presented in the case at hand, the court in <em>Commercial Credit Equip. Corp. v. Bates, </em>154 <em>Ga.App. </em>71, 74, 267 S.E.2d 469, 472 (Ct.App.1980), said that \u00a7 9-307(1) \u201cis intended to protect buyers in the ordinary course from the lien claims of creditors who have financed \u2018floor-plan\u2019 (inventory) arrangements for the dealer.\u201d Therefore, the court held that the security interest in the goods was not created by the dealer within the meaning of \u00a7 9-307(1) but was created by the original purchaser (in our case, Palmer). See, also Dugan, \u201cBuyer-Secured Party Conflicts Under Section 9-307(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code,\u201d 46 <em>U.Colo.Rev. </em>333, 345 (1975); Sexton, \u201cSection 9-307(1) of the U.C.C.: The Scope of the Protection Given a Buyer in Ordinary Course of Business,\u201d 9 <em>B.C.Indus. &amp; Com.L.Rev. </em>985-993 (1968). Thus, the \u201csecurity interest created by his seller\u201d as used in \u00a7 9-307(1), refers only to a security interest given by the seller as debtor and does not include any other security interest even though it was created in an agreement to which the seller was a non-debtor party. <em>First Am. Bank v. Hunning, </em>218 <em>Va. </em>530, 238 S.E.2d 799 (Sup.Ct.1977). A contrary conclusion would create an anomalous impact upon the alienability of collateral, depending upon whether the retail buyer finances the purchase through the seller (who then assigns the security interest) or directly with the institutional lender. While innocent purchasers are at risk if goods subject to a lien are entrusted to a dealer for resale,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Georgia court noted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the <em>Commercial Credit </em>case, <em>supra, </em>on subsequent appeal after remand, 159 <em>Ga.App. </em>910, 911, 285 S.E.2d 560, 561 (Ct.App.1981), that lenders must have protection for their liens despite subsequent resale of the collateral in order to induce them to finance consumer purchases. Allowing the resale through a dealer to overcome a lien held by a third party, other than one financing a floor plan, would make it too easy to defeat such liens. Some other solution must be found.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We reject the expedient solution of the <em>Adams </em>case, <em>supra. </em>There the court was influenced by the fact that the dealer conspired with his own salesman to obtain a loan with a car as security with the intention of reselling the car. To protect the innocent consumer the court found that the salesman was the dealer\u2019s agent in obtaining the loan and that, therefore, the security interest was \u201ccreated by\u201d the dealer within the meaning of \u00a7 9-307(1). In the case at hand, however, Palmer was not acting in fraudulent collusion with Normandy Beach when the first financing was obtained. In any case, we find the reasoning in <em>Adams </em>faulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">We also find unavailing respondents\u2019 alternative argument that Normandy Beach was Palmer\u2019s agent in reselling the boat and that Hess bought the boat from Palmer who had created the security interest. But this cannot impair Ocean County\u2019s Bank lien because Palmer was not in the boat-selling business. <em>See Security Pacific Nat\u2019l Bank v. Goodman, </em>24 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>131, 135-137, 100 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>763, 766-767 (D.Ct.App. 1972). Although the, boat was consumer goods in Palmer\u2019s hands, a buyer' from him_ could not take free of a security interest perfected prior to that sale. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-307(2). Thus, Ocean County Bank\u2019s lien was protected against the resale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>to Hess whether sold by Palmer or Normandy Beach. To the extent that Palmer may have had any equity in the boat, however, it was transferred to Hess by operation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-403(2), Palmer having entrusted the boat to Normandy Beach, a merchant who dealt in boats. <em>Adams v. City Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">We conclude, therefore, that as between Ocean County Bank and First Commercial, Ocean County Bank\u2019s lien has priority under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-312(5) based upon the order of filing. <em>See, also, Chemical Bank </em>v. <em>Miller Yacht Sales, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 100-101. The judgment below is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\">First Commercial subsequently assigned its rights to First National State Bank. However, First National later assigned the contract back to First Commercial. First National had been a party defendant but the action against it was dismissed by stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-11\">We assume that the federal Ship Mortgage Act of 1920, 46 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 921 <em>et seq., </em>does not apply since the parties have not relied upon nor asserted that the boat in question was federally documented. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-302(3) and (4); <em>Chemical Bank v. Miller Yacht Sales, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>90, 99 (App.Div. 1980). The problem may be alleviated if Assembly Bill A-1511 is enacted. The bill would require the owners of certain pleasure boats to obtain titles for their vessels and outboard motors from the Division of Motor Vehicles. The purpose of the bill, ostensibly, is to assist the authorities in investigating boat thefts. Additionally, it may have the same salutary effects in tracing security interests in boats as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:10-11 in relation to motor vehicles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Section 9-307(1) in the 1952 Official Draft of the Uniform Commercial Code did not contain the phrase \u201ccreated by his seller.\u201d However, the 1952 Official Draft Comment 2 to \u00a7 9-307(1) stated that a buyer in the ordinary course of business takes free of a perfected security interest in goods which are part of the inventory <em>of the debtor. </em>Sexton, <em>supra </em>at 988, n. 17. Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>mentators have suggested that the phrase \u201ccreated by his seller\u201d should again be eliminated from \u00a7 9-307(1) to insure complete protection of the buyer in the ordinary course; however, they recognized that, in its present form, \u00a7 9-307(1) refers exclusively to inventory floor plan financing.
