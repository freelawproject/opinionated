Defendant received a life sentence to State Prison for murder. Additionally, the trial judge imposed sentences of 15 to 20 years for rape, to run consecutively to the sentence imposed for murder, and five to ten years for robbery, to run concurrently with the sentence imposed for murder. For the armed feature of the crimes of murder, rape and robbery, sentences to three separate terms of two to three years, to run concurrently with the sentences imposed for the murder, rape and robbery, respectively, were imposed. The judgment of conviction provided that \u201cAll remaining counts have been vacated as surplusage or merged into the remaining four counts.\u201d In so doing the trial judge rejected defendant\u2019s contention that a proper application of the doctrine of merger precluded separate sentences for the rape and robbery which were the underlying felonies upon which the vacated felony murders were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Defendant contends as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">POINT I \u2014THE COURT ERRED IN ITS DECISION REGARDING MURDER.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">POINT II \u2014THE COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING INTO EVIDENCE THE STATEMENTS OF THE DEFENDANT.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>POINT III\u2014THE COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE VERDICT WAS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE. (Not Raised Below)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">After a careful review of the record and the arguments advanced by counsel we conclude that these contentions are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">With respect to the contention urging error as regards the trial judge\u2019s refusal to merge all counts into one conviction for premeditated murder, we affirm substantially for the reasons expressed in Judge Bilder\u2019s opinion reported in <em>State v. Stenson, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>402 (Law Div.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
