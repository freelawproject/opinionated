This appeal and two other appeals pending in this court involving the same issues were heard together.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The essential facts may be briefly summarized. Plaintiff publishes, in ten editions and under the name <em>Pennysaver, </em>printed shoppers guides which it distributes to the public without charge. The editions are designed to serve designated geographical areas in Burlington and Camden Counties. They contain mainly advertisements from local businesses, some classified advertisements and some news of local events and services. Plaintiff\u2019s revenues are derived from the advertising fees charged to advertisers.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">From 1972 through the assessment period, <em>i.e., </em>July 1, 1974 to June 30, 1976, plaintiff used Custom Printing, Inc. (Custom Printing) then an independent printing firm, to do all of the printing involved in producing the <em>Pennysavers. </em>That firm supplied the printing and materials. Defendant Director determined that the printer\u2019s sales to plaintiff were subject to the tax imposed by the State\u2019s Sales and Use Tax Act <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B1 <em>et seq.), </em>particularly <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B -3(a) which imposed a tax of 5% on \u201c[t]he receipts from every retail sale of tangible personal property, except as otherwise provided in [the] act.\u201d A total of $15,819.65 in taxes, interest and penalty, was assessed against plaintiff<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and paid under protest. Plaintiff sought a refund and appealed from the Director\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The appeal was heard in the Tax Court with but one witness, the president of plaintiff corporation, testifying. The parties stipulated that the subject of the sale from Custom Printing to plaintiff constitutes tangible personal property within the meaning of the statute. The Tax Court judge who heard the matter found, in an opinion reported at 3 <em>N.J.Tax </em>164 (Tax Ct.1981), that \u201cthe event claimed to be taxable by defendant is a sale of tangible personal property for the purpose of resale and exempt from sales tax under the New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Act.\u201d A judgment was thereupon entered in the Tax Court holding that \u201cthe transactions in dispute were sales for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>resale and exempt from sales- tax,\u201d and this appeal followed. We disagree with this holding of the Tax Court. We reverse the judgment under review and reinstate the determinations and assessments made by the Director in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The Tax Court judge examined and commented on three of plaintiff\u2019s contentions. Its claim to exemption from the sales tax by reason of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8(e) (repealed,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> now <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8.5<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>) which exempted receipts from sales of \u201cnewspapers, magazines and periodicals,\u201d was properly rejected since that exemption was intended to apply to receipts from the ultimate sales of these items to the general public, not to the receipts from transactions between printer and publisher. Also properly rejected by the Tax Court judge was plaintiff\u2019s claim that the subject transactions constituted sales \u201cof advertising to be published in a newspaper\u201d and thus were exempt pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8(ee) (repealed<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, now <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8.30<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>). He pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">... the amounts paid to Del Val by advertisers are not the subject of this assessment. It is the amounts paid by Del Val to Custom Printing that have been taxed.... The printer provides his skill and labor, the paper on which the material is printed, and ultimately the finished product. He does not sell advertising. [3 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 172]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">It is the Tax Court judge\u2019s analysis and determination of plaintiff\u2019s claim that \u201cfree distribution of <em>th\u00e9'Pennysaver </em>to its readers constitutes a resale and thus the transaction between Custom Printing and Del Val is a sale for resale and not subject to tax,\u201d that defies logic, flies in the face of both the statute and our determination in <em>Princeton Phone Book v. Taxation Div. Director, </em>145 <em>N.J.Super. </em>589 (App.Div.1976), certif. den. 73 <em>N.J. </em>66 (1977), and mandates a reversal of the Tax Court judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>under review. Despite the fact that plaintiff distributed the shoppers guides to the public free of charge, the Tax Court judge reasoned that since the cost of circulation is one of the factors involved in plaintiff\u2019s determination of the charges to be paid by its advertisers, these advertisers pay for the ultimate distribution of the <em>Pennysavers </em>to the reading public. From this he concluded that the subject transactions between Custom Printing and plaintiff were sales of tangible personal property for the purpose of resale and therefore exempt from the Sales Tax pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-2(e), \u201cthe consideration for the resale [coming] from someone other than the consumer.\u201d In so concluding, he failed to take into account that plaintiff was performing an advertising service and that the transfer of the printed matter to the public was part of that service and not a \u201cresale\u201d of the materials themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">The Sales and Use Tax Act provides, among other things, for a sales tax on \u201c[t]he receipts from every retail sale of tangible personal property, except as otherwise provided in [the] act\u201d and on \u201c[t]he receipts from every sale, except for resale,\u201d of certain services. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-3. A \u201cretail sale\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">(1) A sale of tangible personal property to any person for any purpose, other than (A) for resale either as such or as converted into or as a component part of a product produced for sale by the purchaser, or (B) for use by that person in performing the services subject to tax under subsection (b) of section 3 where the property so sold becomes a physical component part of the property upon which the services are performed or where the property so sold is later actually transferred to the purchaser of the service in conjunction with the performance of the service subject to tax. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-2(e)(l) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The Director argues that since the printed materials necessary to produce the shoppers guides were sold to plaintiff, a tax is required to be imposed on the sales. Here he maintains, as he did in <em>Princeton Phone Book v. Taxation Div. Director, supra, </em>that the printing and materials were neither purchased for resale as such nor \u201cconverted into ... a component part of a product produced for sale by the purchaser.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-2(e)(1)(A). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\"><em>Princeton Phone Book </em>is directly in point. There a local telephone directory was distributed to residents of the Princeton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>area annually free of charge. More than 99% of the gross revenue derived from the publication and distribution of the book was produced from the sale of advertising space in it. Besides the advertising, the book also contained a directory of the telephone numbers of Princeton area residents and certain community service listings. 145 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 590-591. The Division of Taxation determined that the petitioners, publishers of the phone book, were required to pay sales tax on paper and the printing and binding services it purchased in order to produce the phone book. <em>Id. </em>at 591. A judge in the Division of Tax Appeals held that no such tax was required because these sales were exempt. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, this court reversed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMq\">... we cannot agree with the judge\u2019s finding that the paper sold to petitioners is converted into or made a component part of the only product produced for sale by petitioners\u2014advertising space. While we recognize that such space is the only product sold by petitioners, it defies logic to hold that a tangible personal product purchased by petitioners (paper) is converted only into an intangible product (advertising space) which is then resold, thereby avoiding the sales tax. We cannot ignore the fact that the paper is also converted into a book upon which is printed not only the advertising which is sold to petitioners\u2019 customers but also the telephone numbers and public service listings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\">Whatever the nature of the product sold by petitioners to their customers, the fact is that the paper which petitioners purchase is converted into and made a component part of a book called the Princeton Community Phone Book. That book is not produced for resale and therefore is not exempt from the tax under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-2(e)(l)(A). [at 592]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Here, it is obvious that what plaintiff\u2019s advertisers were buying was advertising space and not the finished shoppers guides <em>per se. </em>These publications were distributed by plaintiff to the public free of charge. It is equally apparent that what the printer sold to plaintiff was neither purchased by plaintiff for resale as such nor converted into a component part of a product produced for sale by plaintiff. The subject transactions were not exempt from the tax under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-2(e)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">We note that the Tax Court judge found it unnecessary to address \u201calternative arguments\u201d advanced by plaintiff before him, <em>viz., </em>its contentions that \u201capplication of the sales tax to it constitutes a denial of equal protection due process and freedom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>of the press, in violation of the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Art. 1, par. 2, of the Constitution of the State of New Jersey,\u201d and that \u201cthe sales tax assessment, if proper, should have a prospective application only.\u201d Plaintiff does not advance any of these \u201calternative arguments\u201d in the appeal now before us. Nonetheless, from our examination of the statute and the record before us we find no merit in any of plaintiff\u2019s suggestions. We discern no legal infirmity, constitutional or otherwise, in either the statute or its application to plaintiff or the transactions subject to the tax in this case. These transactions, sales of printed materials from printer to publisher, do not involve any receipts from sales of newspapers which are exempt from the tax imposed under the Sales and Use Tax Act. Beyond this, plaintiff must accept the tax consequences of its choice of business operation, i.e., its decision regarding distribution of its publications. The State is not obligated to adjust its tax laws to suit plaintiff\u2019s business decisions. <em>See In re Vondermuhll Estate, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>531, 539-540 (App.Div.1978). <em>Cf.
