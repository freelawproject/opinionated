McKay\u2019s Estate, </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>217 (Law Div.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Additionally, we note that in the brief filed on her behalf appellant contends that since decedent was a resident of Camden County at the time of his death, the time limit of six months from the appointment of a personal representative under <em>N.J. S.A. </em>3A:38A-5 a is inapplicable because probate and appointment of an executor in Atlantic County were \u201cimproper and void.\u201d The brief of the executor insists that decedent was domiciled in Atlantic County at the time of his death. At any rate, because we have been advised by a footnote in appellant\u2019s brief that a complaint in the Law Division \u201chas now been instituted to attack the probate,\u201d it would not be appropriate for us to deal with this issue at this juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-11\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3A:38A-5 was repealed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:29-1, but was substantially reenacted by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-12 as to time limitations for filing a complaint for an elective share.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
