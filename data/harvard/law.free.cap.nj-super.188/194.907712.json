The chief issues presented by this appeal are (1) whether \u201cmaternity leave\u201d as used in the statute encompasses a leave for child care after the pregnancy-related disability has passed, and (2) if so, whether fathers as well as mothers can qualify for such a child care leave. The Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund Board (TPAF) answered the first question in the negative and did not reach the second one. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The facts are not disputed. Petitioner, a teacher employed by the Englewood Public Schools, was granted a child care leave of absence from October 9,1978 until September 1,1979. Petitioner\u2019s son had been born in February 1977, after which petitioner\u2019s wife cared for the child at home. Petitioner had requested the leave because his wife was going to return to work and petitioner was going to assume child care and household duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">In July 1979 petitioner communicated with the Division of Pensions and stated he wished to purchase pension credits for the time he was not working. His request was rejected for the reason that \u201c[tjhere is no provision in the statute to purchase a leave of absence for child care reasons.\u201d He appealed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>TPAF Board of Trustees which upheld the denial of his application. Petitioner was granted a formal hearing and the administrative law judge ruled in petitioner\u2019s favor, concluding that \u201cmaternity\u201d should be broadly construed to include child care by both female and male members of the pension fund. The Board of Trustees rejected the recommendation of the administrative law judge, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">. .. [T]he Board holds that for the purpose of N.J.S.A. 18A:66-8 the word \u201cmaternity\u201d refers solely to the state of being pregnant. Therefore a TPAF member may purchase pension credit for leaves of absence occasioned by pregnancy and any resultant disability. A leave of absence in excess of three months granted so that a member may care for a child can not be considered to be a maternity leave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">On this appeal petitioner contends the Board erred in excluding child care leaves from the category of \u201cmaternity leaves\u201d for which pension credits may be purchased under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-8, and commences his argument by reminding us that since <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66 -8 is a pension statute it is to be liberally construed, citing, among other cases, <em>Geller v. Treasury Dep\u2019t of New Jersey, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>591 (1969); <em>Zigmont v. Teachers\u2019 Pension, etc., Fund Trustees, </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>50 (App.Div.1981), rev\u2019d 91 <em>N.J. </em>580 (1983); <em>Lyons v. State, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>396 (App.Div. 1977). However, the desirability of a \u201cliberal construction\u201d in favor of intended pension beneficiaries should not obscure or override considerations of (1) a potential adverse impact on the financial integrity of the Fund, <em>Zigmont, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 54; <em>see, abo Fair Lawn Ed. Ass\u2019n v. Fair Lawn Bd. of Ed., </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>574, 582-583 (1979), and (2) the requirement that \u201cin the absence of an explicit indication of a special meaning, words will be given their ordinary and well understood meaning.\u201d <em>Service Armament Co. v. Hyland, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>550, 556 (1976); <em>Fahey v. Jersey City, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>103, 107 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In essence, petitioner\u2019s contention is that the term maternity should be given a broad meaning to include \u201cchild care\u201d. He argues such a meaning was ascribed to the word maternity in <em>Farley v. Ocean Tp. Bd. of Ed., </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449 (App.Div. 1980), certif. den. 85 <em>N.J. </em>140 (1980), and found acceptance in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>1976 unpublished opinion of the Board, <em>In re Fralinger, </em>where a female teacher was permitted to purchase two years of pension credit after a child care leave following an adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The word \u201cmaternity\u201d is a common and well used word in the general vocabulary. It is defined in <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">a. the quality or state of being a mother: motherhood; 2. the quality or state of being pregnant (successive maternities)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\"><em>Roget\u2019s Thesaurus </em>suggests the following synonyms: motherhood, mothership, motherliness and maternalness.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Common words such as \u201cmaternity ward\u201d and \u201cmaternity clothes\u201d have inseparably linked the word to pregnancy, a condition belonging exclusively to the female sex. We decline to read \u201cmaternity leave\u201d as \u201cchild care leave,\u201d which the Board concedes would necessarily be available to both men and women. We are informed that to construe \u201cmaternity\u201d in the context of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-8 to embrace periods of \u201cchild care\u201d will place an added substantial financial burden upon both the State and the pension fund. If a member purchases pension credits, his payment covers only a portion of the cost of the value of each year\u2019s service credit. The State must assume the balance of the cost involved. Further, the pension fund has been actuarially funded without consideration of this added burden. The extension sought by petitioner may threaten the fiscal soundness of the fund. Such an extension should be undertaken by the Legislature and not by the courts under the guise of liberal construction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>MacMillan </em>v. <em>Taxation Div. Director, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 177 (App.Div.1981), aff\u2019d <em>o.b. </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>216 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">We find the <em>Farley </em>case inapposite. That case involved the interplay between the statute prohibiting discrimination, <em>N.J. S.A. </em>10:5-12(a), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-4, and a teacher\u2019s entitlement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>apply her accumulated sick leave pay for the period of disability between the birth of her child and the commencement of her maternity leave under a collective bargaining agreement. Different public policy considerations were involved there. The case has no application to the pension field. <em>Cf. Hackensack Bd. of Ed. v. Hackensack Ed. Ass\u2019n., </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>311 (App.Div. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Petitioner\u2019s argument founders on still another well accepted canon of statutory construction. In seeking for the meaning of a statute, courts place great weight on the interpretation of legislation by the administrative agency to whom its enforcement is entrusted. <em>Peper v. Princeton Univ. Trustees, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>55, 69-70 (1978); <em>New Jersey Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>544, 575 (1978); <em>Castellucci v. Board of Review, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 309 (App.Div.1979); 3 <em>Sutherland, Statutory Construction </em>(4 ed. 1974), \u00a7 65.05 at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The testimony produced before the administrative law judge disclosed that the Board\u2019s practice was to construe the word \u201cmaternity,\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-8, to mean pregnancy and any resulting disability. Leave which established eligibility for purchase of retirement credits was limited by the Board to pregnancy-related disabilities or personal illness. It was explained that approximately 15,000 applications for leave due to personal illness are received each year by the Board. If the applicant certifies that the leave is for reason of personal illness, that certification is accepted as sufficient and the leave granted. Personnel presently available to the Board makes it impossible for the Board to check or verify the statements appearing on the applications. It was further explained to us that an application to purchase pension credits based on a leave for purposes of \u201cchild care\u201d would be rejected as not authorized under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The Deputy Attorney General appearing at argument conceded that maternity leaves may have on occasion been extended and in effect became child care leaves, but it was never the intention of the Board that such incidents should occur, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>was certainly not the intention of the Board to authorize or condone such a practice. It occurred, if at all, simply because the Board was unable to verify and police the many applications received with the personnel presently available to the Board at the time the applications are received.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The Deputy Attorney General also conceded that an isolated formal opinion may have been released over the years which would appear to sanction child care leaves, but assured us that such an opinion would represent an aberration or exception rather than a considered determination of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We accept this statement of the Board\u2019s interpretation and implementation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-8 and hold that it is a reasonable one. As applied, any person who is not incapacitated from the performance of his job is barred from purchasing credit for unpaid leaves under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-8 except for official leaves of less than three months. Extending purchase rights to child care leaves would mark a sharp departure from the practice of limiting such rights to physically disabled fund members and result in an irrational discrimination among types of nondisability leaves eligible for purchase.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The limitation of purchase rights for maternity leaves to women who are or who have been disabled by pregnancy under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-8, as implemented by the Board herein, does not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States or the New Jersey Constitutions. Classifications on the basis of gender offend these Equal Protection Clauses only if they fail to have a substantial relationship to an important and legitimate governmental interest. <em>Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number><em>Cty., </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>464, 467, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1200, 1203, 67 L.Ed.2d 437 (1981); <em>Tomarchio v. Greenwich Tp., </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>62, 67 (1977); <em>Craig v. Boren, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>190, 197, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>451, 456, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976). The limitation of purchase rights for maternity leaves to women who are disabled by reason of pregnancy substantially advances the State\u2019s interest in providing the most comprehensive pension coverage at the lowest cost and thus passes the test. <em>Geduldig v. Aiello, </em>417 <em>U.S. </em>484, 495-496, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>2485, 2491, 41 L.Ed.2d 256 (1974). <em>See, also, Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma Cty., supra, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>at 473, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1206; <em>Parham v. Hughes, </em>441 <em>U.S. </em>347, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1742, 60 L.Ed.2d 269 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Moreover, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-8 embraces all illnesses regardless of whether they are contracted by men or women. There is no gender-based classification in the statute which could be considered violative of the Equal Protection Clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">As the statute is interpreted and applied, the maternity leave may not be used for child care purposes. Therefore, petitioner\u2019s contention that the interpretation of maternity leave limited to the state of pregnancy violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>2000e et seq., is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The Legislature, recognizing the limitations of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-8, as written and applied, has before it Senate Bill 746 which, if enacted, would authorize the purchase of pension credits for absence of up to two years if the leave was \u201cfor the purpose of providing child care following birth of a child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Although we accept the fact that it does not have sufficient resources to independently verify that women claiming \u201cmaternity leave\u201d are in fact pregnant or physically disabled, the Board nevertheless has the obligation to require that persons seeking purchase of pension credits establish their entitlement to do so. A mere certification of \u201cmaternity leave\u201d by a TPAF member and her employer, without setting forth the facts of pregnancy or resultant disability, is not sufficient to permit the Board to grant the purchase request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
