We hold that in the small claims division the total recovery under the act for compensatory damages, punitive damages and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees may not exceed $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Plaintiff obtained judgment in the small claims division in the amount of $3,000 \u201cplus $500 attorney\u2019s fees, plus costs of Court ($9.00).\u201d The complaint demands \u201cjudgment ... for $1,000.00 upon the following claim: Failure to complete contract for delivery and installation of carpeting.\u201d Plaintiff had paid defendant the $1,000 as a deposit under a written contract for the purchase, delivery and installation of carpeting in plaintiff\u2019s home. At trial plaintiff was represented by counsel. Defendant appeared in the person of its vice-president and general sales manager William Liberman.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The dispute arose when defendant\u2019s installers arrived at plaintiff\u2019s home with the carpet but refused to install it. The refusal followed plaintiff\u2019s statement that he would have his check for the balance certified by the bank while the work was being done and would not turn it over until completion of the work. The contract provided in part: \u201cOn delivery only cash or certified check will be accepted.\u201d The installers took back the carpet.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Immediately before the trial, plaintiff\u2019s attorney without objection invoked the Consumer Fraud Act (the act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 <em>et seq. </em>A regulation promulgated thereunder, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2(a)(6)(v), provides that in these circumstances it shall be unlawful for a seller to \u201crequest the buyer to ... make final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>payment on the contract before the home improvement is completed in accordance with the terms of the contract.\u201d At the conclusion of the trial the judge found that defendant had made an unlawful demand for payment before installation and awarded plaintiff treble damages, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and court costs pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Defendant argues preliminarily that the installers did not demand payment in advance of completion, but only wanted assurance that plaintiff had the certified check in hand before they began installation. The judge\u2019s finding that defendant insisted on payment in advance of installation is based on sufficient credible evidence in the record and therefore will not be disturbed. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Defendant\u2019s main point is that the judgment exceeds the $1,000 statutory jurisdictional limit of the small claims division. Defendant is correct; the judgment must be reduced. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:6\u201443 establishes jurisdiction where the amount in dispute \u201cdoes not exceed, exclusive of costs, the sum of $1,000.00.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:6-44 provides that although \u201cthe amount really due or recoverable\u201d exceeds this limit, a party may recover \u201ca sum not exceeding $1,000.00 and costs\u201d in the small claims division and this recovery will then bar recovery of the excess in any court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>No case has dealt with the question of whether \u201ccosts\u201d in the small claims division may include treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees. However, <em>Nieves v. Baran, </em>164 <em>N.J.Super. </em>86 (App.Div. 1978), involved a Consumer Fraud Act judgment of treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees recovered in the county district court. The court disallowed the treble damages insofar as they exceeded the statutory jurisdictional dollar limit of the district court but permitted the judgment to exceed that limit to cover attorney\u2019s fees under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The operative language of the statutes establishing the jurisdictional dollar limit of the county district court and the small claims division is virtually the same except for the amounts. Compare <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:6-34(a), 35(a) with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:6-43, 44. We therefore apply to the small claims division the <em>Nieves </em>reasoning that the treble damages recovered under the act are encompassed in the phrase \u201cthe amount really due or recoverable\u201d describing the jurisdictional limit of both courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">However, we disagree with <em>Nieves </em>as to attorney\u2019s fees. We see no reason, at least in the small claims division, why attorney\u2019s fees recoverable under the act should be exempt from the limit. The only category of recovery not capped by the jurisdictional limit is \u201ccosts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The term \u201ccosts\u201d used in the small claims division jurisdiction statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> refers to costs authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A-.18-69 and 70 which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-69. <em>Costs</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">The actual cash disbursements of the prevailing party for any fees paid to the clerk and witness and officers\u2019 fees shall be allowed as costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-70. <em>Additional costs when frivolous or vexatious claim or defense made; collection.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>No costs, other than those mentioned in section 2A:18-69 of this title, shall be allowed either party, except by special order of the court. The court may, in its discretion, award costs, not exceeding $10, exclusive of or in addition to the cash disbursements, against a party, whether the prevailing party or not, who has set up a frivolous or vexatious claim or defense, and enter judgment and issue execution therefor, or set off the same against the amount recovered, as justice may require.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We read these statutes as limiting costs in the small claims division to statutory fees paid to the clerk, witnesses, and court officers, and by special order to a penalty not exceeding $10 against a party who has set up \u201ca frivolous or vexatious claim or defense.\u201d Attorney\u2019s fees are not included in small claims division costs. This doubtless reflects the legislative expectation that in most cases parties in the small claims division will appear without counsel. The Supreme Court has accommodated that expectation by permitting corporations to appear in the small claims division without counsel. <em>R. </em>6:11.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">We do not mean to inhibit the legislative policy of awarding reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under the Consumer Fraud Act. That provision has the salutary purpose of promoting representation and therefore court access for consumer claims involving a minor loss to the individual plaintiff but a major gain to the community through ridding the marketplace of fraudulent and deceitful conduct. Thus, appropriate attorney\u2019s fees under the Act may be allowed without regard to the amount involved in the underlying dispute. Where recovery of a substantial counsel fee is in prospect, it is in keeping with legislative intent to require the action to be brought in a court where ample discovery opportunities are available and all parties are on notice that more is at stake than would be expected in the small claims division. <em>See Andriola v. Galloping Hill Shopping Center, Inc., </em>93 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 200-203 (App.Div. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The judgment is modified and entered in favor of plaintiff and against defendant in the amount of $1,000 together with costs in the amount of $9.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:6-43 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">The division of small claims of the county district court shall have jurisdiction of actions .. . where the debt, balance, penalty or other contractual or negligence matter in dispute does not exceed, exclusive of costs, the sum of $1,000.00.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:6-44 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">Where the debt, balance or other matter in dispute, or the amount really due or recoverable exceeds, exclusive of costs, the sum or value of $1,000.00, either plaintiff or defendant may recover in the division of small claims of the county district court a sum not exceeding $1,000.00 and costs, which recovery shall bar the recovery of the residue of such debt, balance or other matter in dispute in any court whatsoever.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\">The term \u201ccosts\u201d used by the county district court jurisdiction statute refers to costs authorized by <em>Title 22A </em>of the <em>New Jersey Statutes Annotated. See University Court v. Mahasin, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>551, 554 (App.Div. 1979). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>22A:2-42 limits attorney\u2019s fees includable as costs to 5% of the first $500 of the judgment and 2% of any excess. That statute makes no reference to costs in the small claims division.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
