In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Milton argued that he was actually innocent of the murder for which he was convicted, alleging that the victim\u2019s mother had lied at his trial, that the trial court erred by giving a misleading jury instruction, that various forms of prosecutorial misconduct had occurred during his trial, and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Milton eventually submitted 18 documents \u2014 including various unnotarized affidavits and letters \u2014 in support of his actual-innocence claim. The district court denied Milton\u2019s petition, finding that, assuming an actual-innocence exception to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s statute of limitations existed under the Suspension Clause, Milton failed to offer new, reliable evidence of his innocence that was sufficient to undermine the district court\u2019s confidence in Milton\u2019s conviction. We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-12\">\u2018Whether the district court erred in finding that Milton failed to present sufficient evidence supporting his claim of actual innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">On appeal, Milton argues that the district court failed to analyze his newly presented evidence under the appropriate legal standard and further that his newly presented evidence supported his trial testimony, contradicted the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother, and implicated the victim\u2019s mother in the murder, thus raising substantial doubt as to his guilt. He also makes various arguments related to prosecutorial misconduct and the jury instructions at his trial, the district court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing, and the district court\u2019s failure to address the merits of all of his claims. He has also submitted a \u201cmotion for relief,\u201d asking us to vacate his conviction and sentence, remand to the district court, grant a new trial, or order an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">As an initial matter, we will not address the merits of Milton\u2019s claims beyond the sufficiency of his actual-innocence claim as a way to overcome the \u00a7 2244(d) time-bar because our scope of review is limited to the issue specified in the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998) (addressing a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-15\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s grant or denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>review the decision <em>de novo. McNair v. Campbell, </em>416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir. 2005). Legal questions and mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>while a district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Arthur v. Allen, </em>452 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006), <em>modified on reh\u2019g, </em>459 F.3d 1310 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The Suspension Clause provides: \u201cThe Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. Despite this constitutional restriction, the \u201cjudgments about the proper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to make.\u201d <em>Felker v. Turpin, </em>518 U.S. 651, 664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) imposes a one-year statute of limitations for federal habeas petitions filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">The limitation period shall run from the latest of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such State action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-11\">(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-12\">(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-15\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). We have not decided whether a showing of actual innocence creates an exception to the AED-PA\u2019s statute of limitations in order to prevent a possible violation of the Suspension Clause. <em>Wyzykowski v. Dept. of Corr., </em>226 F.3d 1213, 1218-19 (11th Cir. 2000); <em>see also Melson v. Allen, </em>548 F.3d 993, 1002-03 (11th Cir.2008), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. July 16, 2009) (No. 09-5373) (noting that we have not decided whether the Constitution requires an actual-innocence exception to AEDPA\u2019s limitations period). To avoid answering that difficult constitutional question until necessary, we have held that before addressing whether the AEDPA\u2019s limitations period constitutes a violation of the Suspension Clause in the case of a claim of actual innocence, we should first consider whether the petitioner can show actual innocence. <em>Wyzykowski, 226 F.3d </em>at 1218-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-16\">In a related context, the Supreme Court has held that in order to avoid a procedural bar based on successive habeas petitions and have his petition heard on the merits, a habeas petitioner asserting actual innocence must show that his conviction \u201cprobably resulted\u201d from \u201ca constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 327, 115 S.Ct. 851, 867, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995). The petitioner can meet this standard by presenting new evidence that shows \u201cthat it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard should be based on the district court\u2019s \u201cprobabilistic determination about what reasonable, properly instructed jurors would do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329, 115 S.Ct. at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-17\">An actual-innocence claim must be supported \u201cwith new reliable evidence\u2014 whether it be exculpatory scientific evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>dence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence \u2014 that was not presented at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 824,115 S.Ct. at 865. To meet the \u201cthreshold showing of innocence\u201d justifying \u201ca review of the merits of the constitutional claims,\u201d the new evidence must raise \u201csufficient doubt about [the petitioner\u2019s] guilt to undermine confidence in the result of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317, 115 S.Ct. at 862. \u201c\u2018[A]etual innocence\u2019 means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.\u201d <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">After reviewing Milton\u2019s newly submitted evidence and the evidence presented at trial, the district found that Milton had not made a sufficient showing of actual innocence. The district court detailed the contents of the submissions in its order dismissing Milton\u2019s petition. The district court found that the affidavits submitted by Milton were neither new nor reliable evidence of his innocence based on the relationships between Milton and the various affiants and because many of the affiants were aware of the alleged facts to which they attested before Milton\u2019s trial. The district court further found that none of the affidavits explained or nullified Milton\u2019s confession or his taped conversation with the victim\u2019s mother wherein he implicated another individual. Based on those findings, the district court found that Milton had not presented \u201csufficient evidence to undermine the court\u2019s confidence in the outcome of his criminal proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Upon review of the record, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we hold that the district court did not err when it dismissed Milton\u2019s petition. Before addressing the affidavits more specifically, we note that the reliability of the affidavits is called into question because all of these affidavits were presented more than ten years after the murder and roughly eight years after Milton\u2019s trial and that in most cases, as the district court noted, the affiants were aware of the alleged facts to which they now attest before Milton\u2019s trial. A reasonable explanation for this delay has not been presented. At most, some affiants noted that they did not wish to \u201cget involved.\u201d <em>See Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 332, 115 S.Ct. at 869 (noting in context of request for an evidentiary hearing on an actual-innocence claim that \u201cthe court may consider how the timing of the submission and the likely credibility of the affiants bear on the probable reliability of that evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Considering the submissions more closely, we conclude that the affidavits are not sufficient to satisfy the threshold showing of actual innocence. The reliability of the affidavits from Capers, Allen, and Walker are all called into question because they are all incarcerated with Milton. The reliability of the affidavits of Roberts, Murphy, and Brown are all called into question because Roberts and Brown are either friends with Milton or his family and Murphy is Roberts\u2019s cousin. The affidavit of Jenkins suffers a similar problem because she is the cousin of an inmate incarcerated with Milton. Milton\u2019s own affidavit is not new, reliable evidence of his innocence because it primarily repeats his testimony at trial and he presents no explanation for any factual differences from his trial testimony. The alleged \u201cOath Statement\u201d of the victim\u2019s mother is not new, reliable evidence because it is not sworn to or signed by the purported author. The reliability of the hand-written letter from the victim\u2019s mother is called into question first because it is not in the form of an affidavit and also because it functions primarily as a recantation of her prior testimony. <em>See Melson, </em>548 F.3d at 1003 (noting that statements not in the form of an affidavit are less reliable); <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>837 F.2d 1545, 1550 (11th Cir.1988) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>(noting that \u201crecantations are viewed with extreme suspicion by the courts\u201d). The affidavit of Capers is not new, reliable evidence of innocence because Capers claims that, although he did not personally know Milton, he remembers seeing him out on the street one night more than ten years ago and further because Capers can not remember whether this occurred on the night of the murder or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Even if any of the affidavits presented new, reliable evidence of actual innocence, the evidence presented in the affidavits is not sufficient to show that \u201cmore likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted\u201d Milton in light of the evidence. <em>Schlup, </em>518 U.S. at 327, 115 S.Ct. at 867. The evidence is insufficient because, despite the fact that several of the affidavits corroborate a portion of Milton\u2019s version of events and others implicate the victim\u2019s mother in the crime or undermine her trial testimony, none of the evidence negates Milton\u2019s confession or his taped conversation with the victim\u2019s mother wherein he implicates another individual in the murder. Finally, we note that the jury instructions and verdict form submitted by Milton, the letter from Milton to Whitson, and the Florida state court orders denying post-conviction relief have no bearing on Milton\u2019s actual-innocence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Because Milton has not presented new, reliable evidence in light of which it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him, Milton has not made the threshold showing of actual innocence. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition. Because we are affirming the court\u2019s dismissal, we also deny as moot Milton\u2019s motion for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
