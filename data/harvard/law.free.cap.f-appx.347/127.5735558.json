We dismiss the petition in part for lack of jurisdiction and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-19\">We generally review only the BIA\u2019s decision except to the extent that the decision of the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) influenced the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, 493 F.3d </em>588, 598 (5th Cir.2007). We may review the IJ\u2019s decision in the instant case, because the BIA adopted it. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-20\">Under the plain language of the REAL-ID Act, this court does not have jurisdiction to review \u201cany judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1255.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) (2) (B) (i). Therefore, we are statutorily barred from reviewing the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s purely discretionary denial of Muhammad\u2019s application for adjustment of status. <em>Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 800 (5th Cir.2006). We reject Muhammad\u2019s attempt to classify his disagree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>ment with the weighing and consideration of the relevant factors by the IJ as an issue of either constitutional dimension or pure law. <em>See id. </em>at 801. To the extent that Muhammad challenges the discretionary denial of his request for adjustment of status, we dismiss the petition for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Muhammad\u2019s claim that his due process rights were violated because the IJ exhibited bias against him based on a prior conviction is unavailing. Our review of the record does not show that the IJ held a \u201cpersonal bias\u201d against Muhammad that arose from an \u201cextrajudicial source\u201d or that the IJ\u2019s conduct demonstrated \u201cpervasive bias and prejudice.\u201d <em>See Matter of Exame, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 303, 306 (BIA 1982). Muhammad\u2019s bias claim lacks merit, and we deny his petition for review on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Muhammad\u2019s contention \u2014 that the BIA committed legal error in not elaborating on the reasons for its decision and in not granting his request for review by a three-member panel \u2014 is equally unavailing. The BIA\u2019s express assertion that it was affirming and adopting the IJ\u2019s opinion was sufficient to convey its reasoning behind the denial of Muhammad\u2019s requested relief. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 908 (5th Cir.2002). Moreover, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e), \u201c[ujnless a case meets the standards for assignment to a three-member panel under paragraph (e)(6) ..., all cases shall be assigned to a single Board member for disposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Muhammad fails to provide pertinent facts or relevant case law to establish that his appeal falls within one of categories enumerated in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6). His claims regarding the BIA\u2019s written opinion and its denial of his request for a three-member panel are without merit, and we deny the petition for review on those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The petition for review is DISMISSED in part for want of jurisdiction and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b152-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
