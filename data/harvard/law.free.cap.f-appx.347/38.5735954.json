Sanchez argues that the district court erred in denying his request for a safety valve adjustment as set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). He contends that he truthfully debriefed and provided all relevant information to the Government. He further contends that his sentence was six and one-half years longer than the statutory minimum sentence because of the denial of a safety valve adjustment. Sanchez argues that the district court had no basis for finding that he did not truthfully debrief.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-21\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s decision to apply the safety valve provision. <em>United States v. McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 457 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cUnder the clearly erroneous standard, [i]f the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84 (5th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), a defendant who provides information to the Government may escape the imposition of a statutory minimum sentence if the district court finds that he meets five criteria. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>264 F.3d 527, 529-30 (5th Cir.2001). The fifth criterion, the only one at issue here, requires that by the time of sentencing \u201cthe defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense.\u201d \u00a7 501.2(a)(5); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 3553(f)(5). The defendant has the burden of showing eligibility for the safety valve reduction, including the burden of showing that she truthfully provided the Government with all relevant information. <em>United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146\u201447 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Sanchez made statements at sentencing that contradicted statements made at the time of his arrest and also contradicted information obtained by the Government. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>65 F.3d 430, 433 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, Sanchez has not shown clear error with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a safety valve reduction. <em>See id.; McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d at 457-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Sanchez also argues that the district court failed to provide reasons for denying a reduction under the safety valve provision. However, because Sanchez failed to object in the district court, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Sanchez cannot show plain error because there is no indication that his sentence would have been different if the district court had provided reasons for the denial of a safety valve reduction. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 364-65 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 24, 2009) (No. 08-11099).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b63-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
