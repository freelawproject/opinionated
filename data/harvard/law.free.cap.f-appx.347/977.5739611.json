He appeals the denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-26\">Although the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence ordinarily is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, a court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). Because the district court\u2019s denial of the motion was based on its determination that it could not reduce Lewis\u2019 sentence due to his career offender status under the Guidelines, review is de novo. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-27\">\u201cSection 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>mission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582 are thus governed by the policy statements of the Guidelines. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Section \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not, per se, prevent a career offender from seeking relief under that subsection. However, in order for a career offender to be eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the applicable sentencing range must be lowered as a result of an amendment to the sentencing guidelines. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Because the career offender guidelines require the district court to apply the offense level specified by the career offender table if that level is greater than the otherwise applicable base offense level, the lowest possible base offense level that Lewis could have received as a career offender facing a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years was 32. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(c). Following, a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Lewis\u2019 total offense level would be at least 29, the same total offense level originally determined by the district court. Because Lewis\u2019 total offense level has not changed, his sentencing range has not changed, and the district court was correct in concluding that a reduction was not permitted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Lewis\u2019 argument that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582 in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is unavailing because \u201cthe concerns at issue in <em>Booker </em>do not apply in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. Although the Guidelines must be treated as advisory in an original sentencing proceeding, <em>Booker </em>does not prevent Congress from incorporating a Guideline provision \u201cas a means of defining and limiting a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1001-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
