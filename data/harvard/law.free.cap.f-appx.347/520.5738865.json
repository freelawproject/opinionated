Brito requests that we uphold the district court\u2019s sentence in its entirety, allowing him to serve 121 months\u2019 imprisonment and 5 years\u2019 supervised release. Brito claims that the district court could have provided that he would be deported as a condition of his supervised release, but that such a condition should have been put in place at the time of sentencing, which it was not. Accordingly, Brito also claims that ICE lacked jurisdiction to violate the district court\u2019s order and that the government\u2019s denying him supervised release violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(e), the statute outlining supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The filing of a detainer, standing alone, does not cause an alien to be in the custody of immigration officials such that he or she would be entitled to pursue habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Orozco v. U.S. I.N.S., </em>911 F.2d 539, 541 &amp; n. 2 (11th Cir.1990). However, the All Writs Act provides that district courts may \u201cissue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). \u201cThe [All Writs] Act does not create any substantive federal jurisdiction\u201d but instead it is only \u201ca codification of the federal courts\u2019 traditional, inherent power to protect the jurisdiction they already have, derived from some other source.\u201d <em>Klay v. United Healthgroup, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1092, 1099 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[T]he All-Writs Act also empowers federal courts to issue injunctions to protect or effectuate their judgments,\u201d at their discretion. <em>Burr &amp; Forman v. Blair, </em>470 F.3d 1019, 1026 (11th Cir.2006). An \u201cAll Writs Act injunction ... must simply point to some ongoing proceeding, or some past order or judgment, the integrity of which is being threatened by someone else\u2019s action or behavior.\u201d <em>Klay, </em>376 F.3d at 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Under immigration law, the Attorney General shall take aliens who have committed felonies into custody \u201cwhen the alien is released, without regard to whether the alien is released on parole, supervised release, or probation.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c)(1). \u201c[T]he Attorney General may not remove an alien who is sentenced to imprisonment until the alien is released from imprisonment.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(4)(A). However, \u201c[p]arole, supervised release, probation, or possibility of arrest or further imprisonment is not a reason to defer removal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The district court did not err in declining to issue an extraordinary writ because Brito properly was placed under a detainer by ICE pursuant to statute, and ICE\u2019s action did not keep the district court from effectuating its judgment. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
