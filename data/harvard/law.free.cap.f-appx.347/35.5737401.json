The IJ denied Formusoh\u2019s application after finding that he was not credible. The BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision ordering Formusoh\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-20\">Formusoh maintains that, contrary to the IJ\u2019s findings, he presented credible testimony in support of his claim for asylum. He contends that the inconsistencies identified by the IJ were the result of the IJ\u2019s \u201cnit-picking and over-analyzing testimony.\u201d Formusoh suggests further that the IJ\u2019s perceived inconsistencies in his testimony resulted, not from his dishonesty, but because the IJ \u201cshuffled and mixed up the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-21\">The REAL ID Act (the Act) amended the standards for assessing credibility determinations in cases involving ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>plications for asylum, withholding of removal, and other relief from removal filed after the Act\u2019s May 11, 2005, effective date. <em>See </em>REAL ID Act \u00a7\u00a7 101(a)(3), (c), (h)(2), Pub.L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302. As Formusoh filed his application for immigration relief after the Act\u2019s effective date, the new credibility standards apply in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Under the Act, an applicant\u2019s testimony, alone, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proving eligibility for asylum, \u201cbut only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that his testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). \u201c[A]n IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination.\u201d <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 538 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). On review, we defer \u201cto an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Formusoh\u2019s bold assertion that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was based on incorrect and irrational assumptions and speculation, and on conjecture about human behavior is insufficient to establish that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence. From the totality of the circumstances, it is not obvious that no reasonable factfinder could make such an adverse credibility ruling. <em>See id. </em>We shall not disturb the IJ\u2019s credibility determination here. <em>Id. </em>Without credible evidence, there was no basis on which to grant asylum. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). Formusoh has not addressed, and has therefore waived, the IJ\u2019s finding that he is not entitled to withholding of removal or relief under the CAT. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Formusoh contends that the IJ erred as a matter of law and committed reversible error in finding that he was removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii) for making a false claim of United States citizenship, given that the charge had been \u201cdropped\u201d during an earlier master calendar hearing. Contrary to Formusoh\u2019s assertion, the record shows that the charge was set aside on venue grounds, but not withdrawn. Formusoh\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b60-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
