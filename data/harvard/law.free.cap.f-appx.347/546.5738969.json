Gaines\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. On appeal, Gaines argues that, because the district court originally sentenced him to the low end of the guideline range, it abused its discretion by refusing to impose a low-end sentence at his \u00a7 3582 hearing. He also contends that the district court did not adequately explain its reasons for imposing his particular sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">I. Determination of Amended Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 926 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the sentence of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. \u201cFirst, the district court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s guideline sentencing range based upon the relevant amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines; none of the other guideline determinations made during the original sentencing may be reconsidered or altered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSecond, the district court must decide whether, in its discretion, to retain the original sentence or re-sentence the defendant under the amended guideline range after it has considered the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as public safety considerations, and the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). \u201cWhile the district court must undertake this two-step analysis, its decision whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, and to what extent, remains discretionary.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">Here, the district court recalculated Gaines\u2019s guideline range using the amended crack cocaine guidelines. Next, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the court considered the \u00a7 8553(a) factors \u2014 including the seriousness of Gaines\u2019s offense \u2014 and, after doing so, concluded that a sentence in the middle of the amended guideline range would be appropriate. Therefore, we conclude that the district court correctly applied the two-part analysis for determining whether to reduce Gaines\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">II. Explanation of Reasons</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\u201cWhile the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it commits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the [\u00a7 ] 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 927 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIndeed, the only time [we have] vacated a district court\u2019s order granting a defendant\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduced sentence for a failure to properly consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors occurred when the record contained no evidence that the district court had considered, or the defendant had even raised, the applicability of any of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 928 (discussing <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256-57).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In Gaines\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and amended motion, he discussed the court\u2019s duty to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and he argued that various sentencing factors weighed in favor of a reduction. The district court stated that it had reviewed the file, heard counsel\u2019s arguments, and considered the sentencing factors. It also explicitly stated that its decision to impose a mid-range sentence was based on the seriousness of Gaines\u2019s offense. Accordingly, the record demonstrates that, when determining the extent to which Gaines\u2019s sentence should be reduced, the court took the pertinent factors into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting Gaines\u2019s motion for reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
