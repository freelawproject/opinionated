Barrera appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for relief from judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1), and his motion to amend judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), which were filed almost one year after the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-17\">We previously held that Barrera\u2019s appeal of the dismissal of his \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. In appealing the denial of his post-judgment motions, Barrera argues that he was prevented from timely appealing the dismissal of his \u00a7 2255 motion by extraordinary circumstances, and he essentially seeks to reinstate appellate jurisdiction over the original denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-18\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Dunn v. Cockrell, </em>302 F.3d 491, 493 (5th Cir.2002). Under this standard, \u201c[i]t is not enough that the granting of relief might have been permissible, or even warranted \u2014 denial must have been so <em>unwarranted </em>as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-19\">A timely notice of appeal in a civil case is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 213, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). A Rule 60(b) motion is not a substitute for a timely appeal and cannot be used simply to vacate a judgment and then re-enter it to allow a timely appeal. <em>Dunn, </em>302 F.3d at 493 (\u201cAs the sole purpose of [the] 60(b) motion is to achieve an extension of the time in which to file a notice of appeal, it must fail.\u201d). Moreover, although Barrera seeks to avail himself of some equitable exception so that his untimely appeal may be considered, there are no \u201cequitable exceptions to jurisdictional requirement[ ]\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>filing a timely notice of appeal. <em>Bowles, </em>551 U.S. at 213, 127 S.Ct. 2360.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Because Barrera\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion was filed in excess of 10 days after the November 2, 2007 entry of judgment dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion and raised the same grounds for relief as his Rule 60(b) motion, we construe his Rule 59(e) motion as a second, or successive, Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Benson v. St. Joseph Regional Health Care, </em>575 F.3d 542, 546-47 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Harcon Barge Co. v. D &amp; G Boat Rentals, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 665, 667 (5th Cir.1986) (en banc). Accordingly, we will not review it. <em>Willis v. City of Ft. Worth, </em>41 F.3d 661, No. 94-10377, 1994 WL 684564 at *1 (5th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Charles L.M. v. Northeast Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>884 F.2d 869, 870 (5th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b76-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
