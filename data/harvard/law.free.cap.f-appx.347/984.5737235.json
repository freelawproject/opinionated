Zacear\u00eda was indicted for one count of conspiracy to distribute anabolic steroids unlawfully. At a detention hearing, a magistrate judge found that Zacear\u00eda was not a flight risk. However, based on a finding that Zacear\u00eda was a danger to the community, the magistrate judge ordered that he be detained. Zacear\u00eda moved to revoke the order in the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(b), but the district court denied the motion. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-17\">Under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141 et seq., pretrial detention \u201ccan be ordered only \u2018in a case that involves\u2019 \u201d one of the circumstances listed in \u00a7 3142(f) and \u201cin which the judicial officer finds, after a hearing, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and community.\u201d <em>United States v. Byrd, </em>969 F.2d 106, 109 (5th Cir.1992); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 3142(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-18\">Zaccaria\u2019s detention was apparently predicated on the belief that his case involved an offense punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., by at least 10 years of imprisonment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3142(f)(1)(C). Under current law, Zaccaria\u2019s conspiring to distribute anabolic steroids would qualify as such an offense because it would be punishable under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(E)\u00ae, which provides a 10-year maximum term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812(c), 841(b)(l)(D)-(E)(i), 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>However, \u201cthe proper penalty statute is the one in effect when the offense is committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>869 F.2d 835, 836-37 (5th Cir.1989). The superseding indictment alleged that the conspiracy to distribute anabolic steroids existed from 2001 through at least 2007, and the Government\u2019s witness testified that Zacear\u00eda participated in the conspiracy from 2005 to 2007. If Zacear\u00eda committed the offense, he did so before the enactment of the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, Pub.L. 110-425, \u00a7 3(e)(l)(A)-(B), 122 Stat. 4820, 4828 (effective Apr. 15, 2009) (codified in relevant part at \u00a7 841(b)(l)(D)-(E)). The version of the CSA in effect when Zaccaria\u2019s charged offense was allegedly committed would punish Zacear\u00eda under former \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) with \u201ca term of imprisonment for not more than 5 years.\u201d Accordingly, Zaecaria\u2019s charged offense falls outside the scope of \u00a7 3142(f)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">This court has held that the Government need not show that the \u201ccharged offense\u201d itself presents one of the circumstances in \u00a7 3142(f) so long as the defendant\u2019s case involved any offense or other \u00a7 3142(f) factor that could serve as the statutory basis for detention. <em>Byrd, </em>969 F.2d at 110. The Government\u2019s witness testified that Zacear\u00eda not only participated in the drug conspiracy but also personally distributed some of the anabolic steroids, but other possible offenses he may have committed under the CSA involving anabolic steroids, such as distribution or possession with intent to distribute, would also be punishable by only a five-year maximum term of imprisonment under former \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D). Likewise, the record does not suggest that Zaccaria\u2019s case involved an offense punishable under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 859, 860 or 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">In addition, while the superseding indictment charging Zacear\u00eda included a total of 46 counts against 22 individuals, including allegations of smuggling human growth hormone into the United States, money laundering, and the unlawful distribution of ecstasy and hydrocodone, the Government did not present any evidence suggesting that Zacear\u00eda was even aware of the other criminal activities alleged in the indictment. This court has held that \u201cthe proof of a nexus\u201d between the charged offense \u201cand one or more of the ... \u00a7 3142(f) factors is crucial.\u201d <em>Byrd, </em>969 F.2d at 110. Because the Government did not show any nexus between Zaccaria\u2019s charged offense involving anabolic steroids and any other offense in the superseding indictment apart from the coinciding role of a single co-conspirator, his pretrial detention cannot be predicated on those other offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">Because Zaccaria\u2019s case does not involve one of the seven circumstances listed in \u00a7 3142(f), we reverse the district court\u2019s decision to deny Zaccaria\u2019s motion for revocation of the detention order. On remand, the district court should promptly enter an appropriate order of release under \u00a7 3142(b) or(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3142(a)(l)-(2), (b), and (h). However, we note that \u201cthe provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142 do not contemplate finality or <em>res judicata </em>on the issue of pre-trial detention.\u201d <em>Byrd, </em>969 F.2d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1009-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
