Ren challenges the determination that he was not eligible for asylum. He has failed to brief and thus has abandoned any challenge to the denial of withholding of removal or relief under the CAT. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">We review the decision of the BIA and consider the decision of the IJ only to the extent that it impacts the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir.2002). Ren asserts that the BIA and IJ erred in denying his asylum application on the \u201c \u2018corroboration ground.\u2019 \u201d Because the BIA did not adopt them, we will not review the IJ\u2019s credibility or corroboration determinations. <em>Cf. Chun v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir. 1994) (concluding that this court could review the credibility findings of the IJ specifically adopted by the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">An alien seeking asylum has the burden of proving that he is unable or unwilling to return to his country because he suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution \u201con account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion[.]\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b). Under the Real ID Act, applicable to asylum applications such as Ren\u2019s filed on or after the May 11, 2005, effective date, the alien has the burden of proving that at least one of the statutorily protected grounds \u201cwas or will be one central reason\u201d for persecuting him. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). We will uphold the factual finding that an alien is not eligible for asylum unless the alien meets his burden of showing that the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir. 2006); <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-16\">The BIA agreed with the IJ that Ren failed to meet the \u201cat least one central reason\u201d requirement. The BIA found that the two protests in which Ren was involved supported an inference that the authorities sought to prosecute Ren for his involvement in illegal activity during the second protest, not for his political opinion. Ren\u2019s assertion that China does not allow any gatherings for political protest is belied by his own experience during the first protest. He has not pointed to any evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>dence in the record that compels the conclusion that his political opinion (or any other protected ground), rather than his actions during the second protest, was at least one central reason for the government beating him during that protest and later seeking to arrest him. Ren has not met his burden of showing that the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Ren asserts that by failing to consider his evidence of the police summons that showed that the police were after him, the BIA\u2019s decision was contrary to <em>Matter of Dass, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 120 (BIA 1989), and <em>Matter of </em>S-M-J-, 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722 (BIA 1997). Ren has not shown how the IJ\u2019s or BIA\u2019s failure to mention or consider this evidence was contrary to these cases. To the extent the BIA credited Ren\u2019s testimony, the BIA implicitly determined that evidence corroborating his testimony was unnecessary. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). Ren has not shown that the BIA erred by failing to consider his corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">He also asserts that the denial of his asylum was a violation of <em>Matter of Mogharrabi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439, 446 (BIA 1987). Although he recites the <em>Mogharrabi </em>four-prong test for establishing a well-founded fear of persecution, Ren makes no argument that he met this test or that the BIA or IJ erred in applying this test. Moreover, the BIA did not deny Ren\u2019s asylum claim because he failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. The BIA denied the asylum application because Ren failed to establish that a protected ground was or will be one central reason for persecuting him, as required by \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Ren\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b58-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that tills opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
