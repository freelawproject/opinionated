After the court imposed sentence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Delibro appealed his conviction. The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress inculpatory statements he made during a conversation with his mother in an interview room at the police station following his arrest. The room was monitored, and, according to Delibro\u2019s motion to suppress, the statements were recorded in violation of his Fourth Amendment right to the expectation of privacy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>A magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing on Delibro\u2019s motion to suppress, and in the Report and Recommendation he submitted to the district court, found no merit in the motion. The district court agreed, adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation in full, and added this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">[T]he Magistrate Judge correctly determined, under the undisputed facts of this case, that the Defendant could not have had a reasonable expectation of privacy concerning his conversations with his mother which took place within the conf\u00ednes of an actively monitored interview room at the Eustis Police Department following his arrest. The videotape of the Defendant\u2019s conversation with his mother, as well as the testimony of his mother at the evidentiary hearing both clearly establish that the Defendant was well aware that law enforcement could be monitoring his conversations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">We have considered the record before the magistrate judge and the district court and find no error in the court\u2019s denial of Delibro\u2019s motion to suppress. The judgment of the district court is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-15\">. The district court sentenced Delibro to a term of imprisonment of 57 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-16\">. In his brief to us, Delibro presents an argument he did not present to the district court\u2014 that his inculpatory statements were recorded in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amend-merits, as applied by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) and <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981). He therefore asks us to notice plain error in the court's denial of his motion to suppress. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>argument is meritless. The court did not err, much less commit plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
