Susan Keith again appeals the district court\u2019s decision ruling in favor of the defendant Prudential Insurance Company of America (\u201cPrudential\u201d) in Keith\u2019s action for long-term disability benefits. The background facts are detailed in our first opinion remanding this case. <em>See Keith v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>256 Fed.Appx. 347 (11th Cir.2007) <em>(\u2018Keith </em>I\u201d). On October 23, 2008, we remanded Keith\u2019s case a second time for the district court to consider her claim as to steps three and six with the benefit of our decisions in <em>Oliver v. Coca Cola Co., </em>497 F.3d 1181, <em>vacated in part on petition for reh\u2019g, </em>506 F.3d 1316 (11th Cir.2007), and <em>Doyle v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </em>542 F.3d 1352 (11th Cir.2008). <em>See Keith v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>297 Fed.Appx. 879 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) <em>(\u201cKeith II </em>\u201d). Having thoroughly considered the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-18\">A. <em>Step 3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-19\">We have required courts to employ a six-step analysis \u201cfor use in judicially reviewing virtually <em>all </em>ERISA-plan benefit denials.\u201d <em>Williams v. BellSouth Telecomms., </em>373 F.3d 1132, 1137-38 (11th Cir.2004). We have described step 3 of the six-step analysis as follows: \u201cIf the administrator\u2019s decision is <em>\u2018de novo </em>wrong<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and he <em>was </em>vested with discretion in reviewing claims, then determine whether \u2018reasonable\u2019 grounds supported it (hence, review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>No question exists that Prudential had discretionary authority to determine eligibility or to construe the terms of the Plan. The Plan expressly and unambiguously states that Prudential \u201chas the sole discretion to interpret the terms of the Group Contract, to make factual findings, and to determine eligibility for benefits.\u201d In addition, the policy expressly state that Prudential\u2019s decision \u201cshall not be overturned unless arbitrary and capricious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">In <em>Oliver, </em>we held that \u201c[u]nder the arbitrary and capricious standard of review, the plan administrator\u2019s decision to deny benefits must be upheld so long as there is a \u2018reasonable basis\u2019 for the decision.\u201d 497 F.3d at 1195 (citation omitted). \u201cThe district court\u2019s review of the plan administrator\u2019s denial of benefits should be limited to consideration of the material available to the administrator at the <em>time it </em>made its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations, citation, and alteration omitted). We held that \u201cwe begin with the language of the Plan itself\u2019 in determining whether a plan administrator\u2019s denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious. <em>Id. </em>(citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D)).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Prudential\u2019s policy defines \u201cdisabled\u201d as \u201cwhen Prudential determines that: you are unable to perform the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to your sickness or injury; and you have a 20% or more loss in your indexed monthly earnings due to that sickness or injury.\u201d The policy also requires that a claimant may have to submit \u201cproof\u2019 of continuing disability \u201csatisfactory to Prudential,\u201d including: (1) that the claimant is under the regular care of a doctor; (2) the appropriate documentation of the claimant\u2019s monthly earnings; (3) the date the disability began; (4) appropriate documentation of the disabling disorder; (5) the extent of the disability, including restrictions and limitations that prevent the claimant from performing his or her regular occupation; (6) the name and address of any hospital or institution where the claimant received treatment, including all attending doctors; and (7) the name and address of any doctor the claimant has seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Applying <em>Oliver </em>in light of our remand order, the district court found that unlike the plan administrator in <em>Oliver, </em>Prudential never refused to consider subjective evidence of Keith\u2019s disability. Instead, Prudential determined that Keith\u2019s complaints were no different than they had been during the time that Keith was able to successfully perform her job duties with reasonable accommodations from her employer. After a thorough review of the policy and the medical evidence, the district court concluded that Prudential\u2019s decision was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Contrary to Keith\u2019s contention, the <em>Oliver </em>policy and the policy here differ significantly in terms of their requirements for disability. In <em>Oliver, </em>the plan merely required a disabled participant to submit \u201ca written application on a form provided by his employer\u201d as well as a \u201cmedical certification\u201d of his disability for the claimant to receive benefits. <em>Oliver, </em>497 F.3d at 1196. We specifically noted that no provision of the <em>Oliver </em>plan required \u201cobjective evidence\u201d of disability. <em>Id. </em>Here, however, the plan requires a claimant to present \u201cproof\u201d of her claim, including the \u201cappropriate documentation of the disabling disorder\u201d as well as the \u201cextent of [the claimant\u2019s] disability, including restrictions and limitations preventing [the claimant] from performing [her] regular occupation or gainful occupation.\u201d The plan further provides that such proof must be \u201csatisfactory to Prudential.\u201d These requirements are not <em>per se </em>unreasonable. <em>See Wangenstein v. Equifax, Inc., </em>191 Fed.Appx. 905, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>913-14 (11th Cir.2006) (it is not unreasonable for the plan administrator to demand objective evidence where the plan administrator has discretion to determine what it considers adequate \u201cproof\u2019 of disability).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Further, unlike in <em>Oliver, </em>Prudential did not \u201cignore\u201d or \u201cdisregard\u201d certain evidence. Prudential has never disputed any of Keith\u2019s conditions. Rather, Prudential recognized that Keith had the conditions for many years and had managed to perform her job despite the conditions. Indeed, Keith herself stated that her condition had not deteriorated since she stopped working and she did not expect it to. The opinions of Keith\u2019s six medical examiners and two chiropractors included a wide-range of medial diagnoses \u2014 from a \u201cnormal\u201d physical examination to noting that Keith \u201clooked great\u201d to extremely tender trigger points. As the district court noted in its thorough recount of the medical evidence, Prudential had this evidence reviewed by a registered nursed, a board-certified medical consultant, and an independent medical professional, all of whom reached the same conclusion \u2014 that the evidence did not support a claim of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In any event, the record does not indicate that Prudential denied benefits based on Keith\u2019s failure to offer objective medical evidence. To the contrary, Prudential considered Keith\u2019s subjective complaints. Relying on the opinions of three medical professionals, Prudential denied benefits because all of the record evidence, including Keith\u2019s subjective complaints of pain, did not support a finding that she could not perform sedentary work. Like the district court, we cannot conclude that Prudential\u2019s decision was arbitrary or unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">B. <em>Step 6</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">In <em>Doyle, </em>we held that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 2350, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008), abrogated the burden-shifting, heightened arbitrary and capricious standard of review that we had previously applied in ERISA benefits cases. <em>Doyle, </em>542 F.3d at 1359. We held \u201cthat the existence of a conflict of interest should merely be a factor for the district court to take into account when determining whether an administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1360. We further held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-14\">while the reviewing court must take into account an administrative conflict when determining whether an administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious, the burden remains on the plaintiff to show the decision was arbitrary; it is not the defendant\u2019s burden to prove its decision was not tainted by self-interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asz\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">The district court, following our direction in the remand order, specifically considered Keith\u2019s claim as to step 6 in light of <em>Glenn </em>and <em>Doyle. </em>The district court found that Prudential was vested with discretion, that Prudential\u2019s decision was reasonable, and that Prudential operated under a conflict of interest. Because the court found that Prudential\u2019s denial of benefits was not arbitrary or unreasonable, the only remaining question was whether Prudential\u2019s conflict of interest tainted its decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">Keith submits that <em>Doyle </em>is inapposite here because the <em>Doyle </em>policy required objective proof of disability while the policy at issue here did not. This argument is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>misplaced. Nonetheless, Keith maintains that Prudential\u2019s independent reviewers failed to consider all of the relevant evidence by specifically ignoring Keith\u2019s subjective evidence of pain. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The district court found, for a third time, that no evidence existed to show that Prudential was influenced by the conflict. We agree. At each level of review, Prudential considered Keith\u2019s evidence. It obtained the opinions of three different medical professionals regarding Keith\u2019s disability. When Keith asked for reconsideration of Prudential\u2019s denial, Prudential again considered the evidence and sought further evidence, including investigating the previous accommodations made for Keith by her supervisor. The evidence shows that Prudential thoroughly investigated Keith\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Like the plaintiff in <em>Doyle, </em>Keith had substantial medical problems \u2014 no party disputes that. However, because Prudential was vested with discretion to determine eligibility, the courts owe deference to Prudential\u2019s determination. And as in <em>Doyle, </em>we cannot say that Prudential abused its discretion in denying Keith benefits. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Prudential.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">. As the district court also noted, whether we agree with Prudential is irrelevant. The issue before us is only whether the plan administrator reached its decision in a reasonable and non-arbitrary manner. If so, we must affirm the decision. <em>Williams, </em>373 F.3d at 1138.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
