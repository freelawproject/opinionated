The court dismissed Dinkins\u2019s claim for breach of the implied warranty of fitness on the grounds that the claim was not properly pleaded. Then, over three months later, the court dismissed the rest of Dinkins\u2019s claims because she had failed to comply with its discovery orders. Dinkins appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">At the outset, we discuss two jurisdictional issues raised by ConAgra. First, ConAgra argues that there may be no final judgment, and therefore no appellate jurisdiction, in this case. It also argues that, even if there is appellate jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s October 9, 2008 dismissal of the claims remaining in Dinkins\u2019s lawsuit as of that date, Dinkins has not properly appealed the earlier dismissal of her claim for breach of the implied warranty of fitness or the court\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">The orders that Dinkins identified in her notice of appeal dismissed her entire complaint, leaving no claim to be litigated. As of October 9, 2008, all of Dinkins\u2019s claims had been decided, ending her ease against ConAgra on the merits. <em>See Virgo v. Riviera Beach Assocs., Ltd., </em>30 F.3d 1350, 1356 (11th Cir.1994) <em>(citing FirsTier Mortgage Co. v. Investors Mortgage Ins. Co., </em>498 U.S. 269, 273-74, 111 S.Ct. 648, 651-52, 112 L.Ed.2d 743 (1991)). Thus, the October 9, 2009 order presents a final decision that we have jurisdiction to review. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. And, while Dinkins\u2019s notice of appeal specifically identifies two orders, it also states that she appeals from the final judgment in the ease. \u201cWhen a district court enters a final judgment, \u2018all prior non-final orders and rulings which produced the judgment\u2019 are merged into the judgment and subject to review on appeal.\u201d <em>Akin v. PAFEC Ltd., </em>991 F.2d 1550, 1563 (11th Cir.1993) <em>(quoting Barfield v. Brierton, </em>883 F.2d 923, 930 (11th Cir.1989)). Therefore, we will consider Dinkins\u2019s arguments regarding dismissal of her claim for breach of the implied warranty of fitness and denial of her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">The parties agree that we review the court\u2019s decisions for abuse of discretion. Applying that standard, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">In mid-March 2008, Dinkins\u2019 lawyer received by mail an order by the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation conditionally transferring Din-kins\u2019s case (originally filed in the Western District of New York) to the Northern District of Georgia. (R.l-10; R.l-12 at 4 \u00b6 4.) By its own terms, objections to the order were due by March 27, 2008. (R.l-10.) Dinkins did not file a timely objection to the transfer, and the case was officially transferred on April 22, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">The Northern District of Georgia\u2019s Local Rule 5.0 required all documents filed with the court to be filed by electronic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>means through the Case Management/Eleetronic Case Filing (CM/ECF) system. The court\u2019s website gave instructions on how to accomplish those filings and a standing order available on that website states that, once a party\u2019s lawyer is registered for CM/ECF access, service on that party will be through electronic notification that documents have been filed in the case. <em>See </em>Northern District of Georgia Standing Order # 04-01 In Re: Procedural Rules for Electronic Case Filing in Civil and Criminal Cases. The judge in the consolidated cases against ConAgra also issued a Case Management Order that states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">In lieu of service of documents pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 5, service of all papers shall be made on liaison counsel for plaintiffs ... [plaintiffs\u2019 liaison counsel shall be responsible for the receipt and dissemination of each served document to all known plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">(R.2-37 at 3.) Plaintiffs\u2019 liaison counsel was a registered user of the Northern District of Georgia\u2019s CM/ECF system.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">On May 6, 2008, Dinkins filed a motion in the Northern District of Georgia requesting an extension of time to object and a return of the case to the Western District of New York. (R.l-12.) The court denied those motions on the bases that they should have been made to the Multidistrict Litigation Panel and that the court did not have authority to grant the requested relief. (R.l-17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">On May 9, 2008, before the court acted upon Dinkins\u2019s motions, ConAgra filed a motion to dismiss Dinkins\u2019s claim for breach of the implied warranty of fitness pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Pursuant to the Local Rule, ConAgra filed that motion on CM/ECF. Dinkins did not respond to ConAgra\u2019s motion to dismiss, either by opposing the motion or moving to amend her complaint. On June 4, 2008, the court granted the motion. The order was filed on CM/ECF.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">The court\u2019s order requiring each plaintiff to produce a six-page form titled Plaintiffs Fact Sheet was also posted on CM/ ECF. Dinkins\u2019s fact sheet was due on May 12, 2008; but she did not produce it. In a motion filed on CM/ECF, ConAgra moved to compel production. Dinkins did not respond. On June 30, 2008, in an order posted on CM/ECF, the court granted ConAgra\u2019s motion to compel. Dinkins did not respond in any way to the order to compel production.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">On appeal, Dinkins does not argue that the district court erred in granting ConAgra\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion because her complaint adequately pleaded a claim for breach of the implied warranty of fitness. Therefore, we do not consider the adequacy of the pleading. And, we hold that Din-kins suffered no prejudice by the district court\u2019s grant of the 12(b)(6) motion because the October 9, 2008 dismissal of Dinkins\u2019s entire case was warranted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2). Even if the claim for breach of warranty had remained in the case up to October 9, 2008, it would have been properly dismissed, along with the rest of the complaint. Dinkins never made any effort to comply with the court\u2019s order that she produce the fact sheet, providing facts necessary to sustain her personal injury claim. Neither did Dinkins make any effort to comply with the court\u2019s subsequent order compelling her production of the discovery, despite the fact that she had three months to do so before the court dismissed her lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">Dinkins\u2019s only argument on appeal is that her failure to respond to pleadings and orders in the case should have been excused because she was not served with those documents. But, her pleas for mercy on the basis of her ignorance are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>well-founded. There is no dispute that plaintiffs liaison counsel was properly served with all pleadings and orders in the case. And, under the court\u2019s case management order, that service constituted service on Dinkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Dinkins\u2019s professed lack of knowledge that orders were issued, discovery was required, and motions were pending resulted from her own attorney\u2019s failure to keep abreast of the action through any of the many avenues available to him \u2014 including direct access to the CM/ECF system,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contact with plaintiffs\u2019 liaison counsel, and participation (personally or telephonically) in the court proceedings. We will not reward his failure to prosecute his client\u2019s lawsuit with another opportunity to pursue her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when, finding that Dinkins had failed to comply with the court\u2019s orders and less severe sanctions had proven ineffective in remedying the situation, it dismissed Dinkins\u2019s lawsuit with prejudice and denied her motion for reconsideration of the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\">. On July 23, 2008, Dinkins\u2019s lawyer made an unsuccessful attempt to register himself for CM/ECF access. On August 1, 2008, he wrote to the clerk of the court requesting assistance in applying for that access.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Dinkins's lawyer received CM/ECF access (including the ability to access the pleadings and orders already filed in the case and electronic notification of document filings as they were made) on September 17, 2008, thirteen days before the district court issued its first order regarding the dismissal of Dinkins\u2019s complaint. Despite having that access, he filed no response to ConAgra's pending motion to dismiss his client's case for failure to comply with the court\u2019s order to compel production of discovery. Neither did he take any action in response to the court\u2019s order of September 30, 2008, acting on that motion. Only after the court entered its October 9, 2008 order dismissing Dinkins's lawsuit did her lawyer react-by filing a motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
