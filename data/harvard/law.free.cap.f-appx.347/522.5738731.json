Edgardo Francisco Martinez-Castillo appeals his 168-month sentences for the same offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">On appeal, Telles-Milton argues that he was entitled to a minor-role reduction, contending that: (1) the district court\u2019s consideration of relevant conduct was flawed; (2) the court erroneously believed that the large amount of drugs involved in the offense precluded a reduction; (3) the court erroneously believed it was not authorized to deviate from a 135-month sentence; and (4) the court frustrated the intent of Congress and the Sentencing Commission expressed in Amendments 640 and 668 by denying him the reduction. He also argues that his sentences are unreasonable, because as a \u201cdeportable alien\u201d he will not qualify for certain preferential conditions of confinement and also because the court procedurally erred by taking a \u201clock-step\u201d approach to his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Martinez-Castillo contends that his sentences are unreasonable because the court did not consider his mitigating arguments, including his argument that he should re-' ceive the same sentence as Telles-Milton. He also contends that the court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) by failing to provide an adequate explanation for his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">I. Minor-Role Reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">A district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense constitutes a factual finding to be reviewed only for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir. 1999) <em>(en </em>banc). The defendant bears the burden of proving, beyond a preponderance of the evidence, that he is entitled to a role reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level reduction for a minor participant, which is a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 and comment, (n. 5). The district court applies a two-part analysis to determine whether to award a downward adjustment. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940-41. \u201cFirst, and most importantly, the district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which []he was held accountable at sentencing; we recognize that in many cases this method of analysis will be dis-positive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. Although a co-conspirator who was only a minor participant in the conspiracy may be eligible for a role reduction, he would not be entitled to a reduction \u201cwhere the relevant conduct attributed to [him] is identical to h[is] actual conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. Therefore, a co-conspirator does not establish eligibility for a role reduction merely \u201cby pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [ ]he was a minor participant but for which [ ]he was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSecond, the district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s role against the other participants, to the extent that they are discernable, in that relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">Amendment 640 to the Sentencing Guidelines modified \u00a7 2D1.1 to provide a maximum base offense level of 30 for defendants who receive a mitigating role reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Amend. 640. The purpose of this change was to limit the sentencing impact of a high drug quantity on a defendant with a lower degree of individual culpability. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>id., </em>Reason for Amendment. Amendment 668 further modified \u00a7 2D1.1 regarding the calculation of base offense levels for defendants who receive a mitigating role reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Amend. 668. The purpose of this change was to \u201caddress proportionality concerns arising from the \u2018mitigating role cap,\u2019\u201d by providing for graduated reductions depending on the drug quantity involved. <em>See id., </em>Reason for Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">First, because Telles-Milton was held accountable only for his actual conduct, the district court did not clearly err by denying him a minor-role reduction. Here, Telles-Milton was convicted of charges related to possession of 587 kilograms of cocaine, and this was identical to his actual conduct. Second, because the court did not deny the reduction based on its belief that a large amount of drugs would preclude a minor-role reduction, we decline to address the propriety of that assertion. Third, the record does not support TellesMilton\u2019s claim that the court believed it was not authorized to deviate from the 135-month guidelines sentence. See Sentencing Hearing at 13 (indicating that court had considered the relevant factors, including the applicable guidelines range, and concluded that a 135-month sentence would be appropriate given those factors). Finally, because Telles-Milton was not entitled to a minor-role reduction, the policies set forth in Amendments 640 and 668 to the Sentencing Guidelines are not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">II. Reasonableness of the Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that sentences are to be reviewed for \u201cunreasonable[ness].\u201d In doing so, we \u201cmerely ask[ ] whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation removed). The burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), appellate review for reasonableness is a two-step process. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we \u201cmust ... ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Second, we must consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Section 3553(a) provides that district courts must consider: (1) the applicable Guidelines range; (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (4) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (5) the need for adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (6) protection of the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (7) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(6). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">\u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). This Court has recognized that \u201cthe use of the Guidelines remains central to the sentencing process\u201d and stated that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d Mat 787-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Under our precedent, \u201cthe fact a defendant\u2019s status as an alien renders him ineligible to serve any part of his sentence in a halfway house [or minimum security prison] does not justify a downward departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Maung, </em>320 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>United States v. Veloza, </em>83 F.3d 380, 382 (11th Cir.1996), <em>overruled on other grounds by De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930). We have noted that we are not aware of any case in which we have \u201cupheld a downward departure based upon collateral consequences related directly or indirectly to the defendant\u2019s status as an alien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In imposing Telles-Milton\u2019s sentences, the court stated that it had considered the guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and it explicitly discussed the seriousness of the offense, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to protect the public. In addition, the court expressly considered and rejected Telles-Milton\u2019s argument that his status as a deportable alien merited a downward variance, and, in light of our precedent, the district court\u2019s conclusion was not an abuse of discretion. Therefore, Telles-Milton\u2019s sentences are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Martinez-Castillo\u2019s sentences are also reasonable. In imposing Martinez-Castillo\u2019s sentences, the court stated that it had considered the facts of this individual case, the purposes of sentencing, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the sentences imposed for similarly-situated defendants. Given Martinez-Castillo\u2019s role as the boat\u2019s captain, the disparity between his sentences and Telles-Milton\u2019s is not unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">III. Explanation of Reasons</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">\u201cThe question of whether a district court complied with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1) is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>even if the defendant did not object below.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(c), the district court must \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d If the sentence is within the guideline range, and that range exceeds 24 months, the court must describe \u201cthe reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">A sentencing court is not required to \u201cincant the specific language used in the guidelines\u201d or \u201carticulate its consideration of each individual \u00a7 3553(a) factor,\u201d so long as the record reflects the court\u2019s consideration of many of those factors. <em>Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d at 1182. When determining whether a sentencing court\u2019s statement of reasons satisfies \u00a7 3553(c)(1), we are not limited to reviewing the court\u2019s closing remarks. <em>United States v. Parrado, </em>911 F.2d 1567, 1573 (11th Cir.1990). Rather, we have reviewed the entire sentencing hearing transcript and have based our determination on \u201cwhat transpired, taken together with the court\u2019s closing remarks. ...\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">In <em>Bonilla, </em>the district court allowed the parties to make arguments regarding the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, heard the defendant\u2019s statement of remorse, and, in imposing a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range, stated its belief that the sentence complied with the Guidelines and accounted for the \u00a7 3553 factors. 463 F.3d at 1181. We concluded that the district court had complied with \u00a7 3553(c)(1) because it was obvious that the court had considered many of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">Here, the district court invited the parties to discuss the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, provided the defendant with an opportunity to speak on his own behalf, noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>that the offense involved a large amount of high-quality cocaine, indicated that it had considered the case \u201con its own facts\u201d and Martinez-Castillo \u201con his ... own merits,\u201d and discussed the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. Thus, it is clear from the record that the court considered many of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing the sentences, and it therefore complied with \u00a7 3553(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the defendants\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-17\">.
