Antone was punished with 45 days of cell and recreation restrictions, a reduction in classification status from \u201cS3\u201d to \u201cLine I,\u201d and the loss of 30 days of good time credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The district court dismissed Antone\u2019s complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b). A complaint is \u201cfrivolous\u201d if it lacks \u201can arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cA complaint lacks an arguable basis in law if it is based on an indisputably meritless legal theory, such as if the complaint alleges the violation of a legal interest which clearly does not exist.\u201d <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). A plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted when the complaint does not contain \u201c\u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u201cTo plead a constitutional claim for relief under \u00a7 1983, [a plaintiff must] allege a violation of a right secured ... by the Constitution or laws of the United States and violation of that right by one or more state actors.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>38 F.3d 198, 200 (5th Cir.1994). Because Antone\u2019s murder conviction disqualifies him from release on mandatory supervision, <em>see </em>Tex. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 508.149(a)(2), the district court did not err in finding that Antone failed to state a due process claim with respect to the loss of his good time credits. <em>See Arnold v. Cockrell, </em>306 F.3d 277, 278-79 (5th Cir.2002). Likewise, Antone failed to state a claim with respect to his punishment of 45 days of cell and recreation restrictions and a reduction in classification status from \u201cS3\u201d to \u201cLine I\u201d because this punishment did not constitute \u201catypical and significant hardship\u201d relative to ordinary prison life. <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>see also Moody v. Baker, </em>857 F.2d 256, 257-58 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Antone\u2019s \u00a7 1983 lawsuit as frivolous pursuant to \u00a7 1915A(b) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Antone also accumulated strikes when two other cases were dismissed as frivolous. <em>Antone v. Neil, </em>No. 9:07-CV-283 (E.D.Tex. Feb. 27, 2008); <em>Antone v. Alford, </em>No. 9:07-CV-285 (E.D.Tex. Feb. 27, 2008); <em>see Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 385-87. As Antone has now accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b69-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
