On appeal, Hartley argues that the district court erred by dismissing his petition as a sanction for misrepresentation because he did not answer Question 14 of his petition falsely and because dismissal was an inappropriately harsh sanction. We granted a certificate of appealability on one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-13\">Whether the district court erred in dismissing, without prejudice, appellant\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as a sanction for a misrepresentation in light of the fact that any subsequent petitions may now be time-barred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">Although we review a denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition <em>de novo, McNair v. Campbell, </em>416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005), we review a Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 sanction for an abuse of discretion, <em>Kaplan v. DaimlerChrysler, A.G., </em>331 F.3d 1251, 1255 (11th Cir.2003). Because the district court dismissed Hartley\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as a sanction, we review for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">Under Rule 2(c)(5) of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts, a petitioner must sign his petition \u201cunder penalty of perjury.\u201d Rule 11 of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases provides that a district court may apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to \u00a7 2254 cases \u201cto the extent that they are not inconsistent with any statutory provisions\u201d or the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 permits a district court to impose sanctions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">In this case, the district court held that Hartley falsely answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 14 which asked whether he had \u201cpreviously filed any type of petition, application, or motion in a federal court regarding the conviction that [he] challenge[s] in this petition.\u201d We need not decide in this case whether the district court was incorrect in construing Hartley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>answer to Question 14 as a false answer. We do conclude, as the Government concedes, that Hartley \u201cdid not specifically challenge his original conviction.\u201d Government Brief at 9. Thus, it is clear that Hartley\u2019s answer, at the least, was technically correct. Moreover, the Government also concedes that \u201cthe prior proceedings identified by the ... [court below] would have no adverse impact on whether he could proceed on his \u00a7 2254 petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. Thus, it is also clear that there was no material misrepresentation. We also note that the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice operates as a dismissal with prejudice because of the statute of limitations. Under the circumstances here, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Hartley\u2019s petition. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions that the district court address the merits of Hartley\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">This opinion takes no stance on extraneous issues raised by both parties\u2019 briefs. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998) (holding \u201cappellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA\u201d). We further note that this opinion in no way comments on the merits of Hartley\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\">. We note the Government's concession that the sanction was not the least severe that would serve the purpose of the rule, and its concession that a remand is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
