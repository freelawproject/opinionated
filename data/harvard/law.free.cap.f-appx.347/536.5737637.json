United States, </em>556 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009). Roger Joseph appealed his convictions for, inter alia, transferring and possessing a means of identification of another person, i.e., aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) (Counts 5-7). In his appeal, Joseph argued that the Government should have been required to prove that he knew that the means of identification at issue in Counts 5-7 belonged to actual people. He acknowledged that our precedent in <em>United States v. Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d 603, 609-10 (11th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>128 S.Ct. 2903, 171 L.Ed.2d 843 (2008), foreclosed this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The aggravated identity theft provision requires an enhanced sentence of two years of imprisonment if a person \u201cduring and in relation to any felony violation enumerated in subsection (c), knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). In <em>Flores-Figueroa, </em>the Supreme Court overruled <em>Hurtado </em>and stated that as a matter of English grammar and criminal statutory interpretation, \u201c \u2018knowingly\u2019 is naturally read as applying to all the subsequently listed elements of the crime.\u201d 129 S.Ct. at 1890-91. Therefore, the Court held that to be sentenced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), which applies to a person who (while committing other enumerated crimes <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) \u201cknowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person,\u201d a person must have known that the \u201cmeans of identification\u201d they possessed belonged to \u201canother person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1888.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Here, the Government did not show that Joseph had the requisite knowledge. Therefore, we reverse his conviction for violating \u00a7 1028A, vacate his sentence for violating \u00a7 1028A, and remand to the district court for resentencing, consistent with <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">REVERSED in part, VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\">. Those other predicate crimes are listed in \u00a7 1028A(c). In other counts, Joseph was convicted of violating predicate crimes referenced in \u00a7 1028A. In his appeal in this case, Joseph mounted only one challenge to his convictions of these predicate crimes, a challenge that we rejected in our now vacated previous opinion. For the reasons stated in our previous opinion, we again reject that challenge, and reinstate that portion of our prior opinion. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court with respect to these predicate crimes is affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
