After learning she needs a liver transplant, Fig-ueroa filed a petition for compassionate release. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court denied Figueroa\u2019s petition. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-20\">During the week of August 25, 2008, Figueroa\u2019s physician informed her that she was in need of a liver transplant and had only two months to live. On September 10, 2008, Figueroa filed a Section 2241 petition contending she has a compatible donor ready and willing to undergo the transplant, but the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) does not allow such procedures for inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-21\">Before filing a Section 2241 petition, Figueroa was required to exhaust her administrative remedies. <em>Rourke v. Thompson, </em>11 F.3d 47, 49 (5th Cir.1993). The BOP has a formal grievance proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>dure for federal inmates, like Figueroa, to seek \u201cformal review of an issue relating to any aspect of his/her own confinement.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10(a). Both in her petition and here on appeal, Figueroa claimed the short notice regarding her medical condition made it \u201cimpossible to utilize the Federal Bureau of Prison\u2019s grievance procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Figueroa\u2019s argument that she should not be required to pursue administrative remedies assumes that the remedies would have been futile and the delay fatal. There is nothing in the record suggesting that the BOP would not have properly evaluated her request and given due consideration to a properly supported plea. The district court did not err by requiring exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Additionally, the district court found it could not grant her relief pursuant to Section 2241 because her application was \u201cnot in reference to the imposed sentence \u2014 but for medical needs.\u201d We agree. A Section 2241 petition may be granted if the inmate \u201cis in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(8). Figueroa does not allege that such violation is present. She instead alleges that this application is for compassionate release due to her medical needs. A compassionate release request is not a matter of illegal or unconstitutional restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Figueroa\u2019s application.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b73-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
