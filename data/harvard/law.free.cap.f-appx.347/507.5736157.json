After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b532-17\">A. Fletcher\u2019s Prior Drug Conspiracy Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b532-18\">In 2007, a federal grand jury indicted Fletcher and codefendants, Hector Mateo and Wayne Trought, on drug conspiracy charges. In a plea agreement, Fletcher agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and to cooperate with the government in exchange for the dismissal of the two remaining counts against him. In 2008, the district court accepted Fletcher\u2019s guilty plea and sentenced him to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-19\">B. Trial of Co-defendant Trought</p>\n<p id=\"b532-20\">On January 5, 2009, Trought, Fletcher\u2019s codefendant, proceeded to trial. On the morning of January 7, 2009, the government provided Fletcher\u2019s attorney with a copy of a motion, brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6001 <em>et seq., </em>to compel Fletcher to testify at Trought\u2019s trial. The government\u2019s motion explained that Fletcher\u2019s counsel had indicated that Fletcher would assert his Fifth Amendment rights and would refuse to answer any questions at Trought\u2019s trial. Attached to the government\u2019s motion was: (1) a letter, dated January 6, 2009, from an Assistant Attorney General authorizing a request for an immunity order; and (2) a proposed order requiring Fletcher to testify and stating that no testimony compelled under the order may be used against him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The prosecutor advised the district court that he expected Fletcher, who was in federal custody, would not testify and stated, \u201cI do have a motion to compel [Fletcher\u2019s] testimony as well as a proposed order based upon an immunity letter that I received this morning from the Department of Justice.\u201d The district court asked to see the letter, stated it would sign the order and had Fletcher brought into the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Once on the witness stand, Fletcher invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, the court signed the proposed order and Fletcher\u2019s counsel advised he had explained the consequences to Fletcher and agreed no further inquiry was needed, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">THE COURT: Okay, are you Kenneth Fletcher?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Fletcher, I have the authority to order you to testify in this proceeding, and I am so ordering you now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">THE WITNESS: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">THE COURT: Okay. Now the question then becomes is he going to invoke his Fifth Amendment right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-11\">MR. DAVID RABEN: Yes, he is going to invoke his Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-12\">THE COURT: Okay. In which case then I\u2019m going to sign the order that the Government has asked me to sign. Now, have you explained to Mr. Fletcher what the consequences will be in the event he fails to comply with the order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-13\">MR. DAVID RABEN: I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-16\">THE COURT: Okay. So you\u2019ve told him he could be held in criminal contempt, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-17\">MR. DAVID RABEN: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-18\">THE COURT: Okay. And does he understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-19\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-20\">MR. DAVID RABEN: I believe he does. I\u2019ve explained that to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-21\">THE COURT: And what are your intentions, Mr. Fletcher?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-22\">THE WITNESS: I wish not to testify, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-23\">THE COURT: Regardless of what the consequence is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-24\">THE WITNESS: Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-25\">THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Cronin [the prosecutor], what do you propose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-26\">MR CRONIN: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that the Court hold him in criminal contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-27\">THE COURT: Okay. The Court will so hold him in criminal contempt. He has made it clear that he is not going to comply with the Court\u2019s order, and I don\u2019t believe any further inquiry is necessary. Do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-28\">MR. DAVID RABEN: Other than the objection I\u2019ve already noted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-29\">After Fletcher refused to testify, the prosecutor indicated that he would prepare a motion to begin contempt proceedings. The district court asked Fletcher whether he understood that his refusal to testify would likely result in his serving additional prison time, and Fletcher responded that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>C. Fletcher\u2019s Contempt Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The district court set the criminal contempt trial for February 2, 2009. Fletcher, now represented by a federal public defender, moved to vacate the district court\u2019s order setting a trial date. Fletcher argued that he refused to testify at Trought\u2019s trial on advice of counsel and that the district court personally had not communicated the grant of immunity to Fletcher and that thus he was not in contempt of court when he refused to testify. The district court denied the motion to vacate. Fletcher waived his right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">At the bench trial, the evidence consisted of: (1) the transcript of Fletcher\u2019s January 7, 2009 appearance at Trought\u2019s trial; (2) the government\u2019s motion to compel Fletcher\u2019s testimony; (3) the January 6, 2009 letter from the Assistant Attorney General authorizing the request for an immunity order; and (4) the district court\u2019s January 7, 2009 order compelling Fletcher\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The district court found that it could \u201creasonably infer from the totality of the transcript\u201d that defense counsel had told Fletcher about the grant of immunity. The district court stated that it was \u201cclear from Mr. Raben\u2019s responses to my questions that he had gone over the entire situation with Mr. Fletcher,\u201d including \u201cthe fact that the Government was going to compel him to testify under an order of immunity.\u201d Fletcher then deliberately violated the court\u2019s order. The district court concluded that the government had met its burden of proving that Fletcher was in contempt of court when he refused to testify at Trought\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The district court later issued written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The district court noted that it had informed Fletcher that the order was being signed and then defense counsel had confirmed in Fletcher\u2019s presence that he had explained to Fletcher the consequences of the order. Defense counsel also confirmed that no further inquiry of Fletcher was required. Fletcher himself acknowledged that he understood the consequences of refusing to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The district court found that, \u201c[bjased on the totality of the evidence submitted at the bench trial,\u201d the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Fletcher had been informed of the court\u2019s order compelling his testimony and granting him immunity. Therefore, the district court adjudicated Fletcher guilty of criminal contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">D. Sentencing on Contempt Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">The Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 contempt guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.1, does not provide a specific base offense level. Instead, it cross-references \u00a7 2X5.1, which directs the district court to apply the most analogous offense guideline. Fletcher\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) stated that the most analogous guideline was the obstruction-of-justice guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2, and used \u00a7 2J1.2 to calculate his offense level of 22. With a criminal history category of III, the PSI recommended an advisory guidelines range of 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment. Fletcher objected to the PSI\u2019s offense level calculation, arguing that the appropriate guideline was U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.5 for failure of a material witness to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court found that Fletcher\u2019s refusal to testify was most similar to the offense of being an accessory after the fact and that Fletcher\u2019s offense level was 22. The district court stated its belief, \u201cbased on what transpired in the trial, that [Fletcher] was trying to protect Mr. Trought in order to protect himself for some reason.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>district court queried whether Fletcher or his family were threatened by Trought.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Fletcher then testified to his motives for refusing to testify. According to Fletcher, agents informed him during his debriefing that they did not believe what he was saying. The agents warned him that he would be charged with a crime if he repeated those statements at Trought\u2019s trial. As a result, Fletcher\u2019s attorney advised him not to testify. Fletcher also claimed that he did not learn about the grant of immunity until after he refused to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The district court asked Fletcher if he had any other reason for deciding not to testify. Fletcher answered that he feared what would happen to himself or his family if he were responsible for Trought\u2019s conviction. The district court asked, \u201cSo you wanted to protect Mr. Trought and you wanted to protect yourself.\u201d Fletcher responded, \u201cYes.\u201d On redirect examination, Fletcher again stated that he decided not to testify on advice of counsel and because he was worried for himself and his family if Trought were convicted based on his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The district court stated that, although it did not condone the violation of court orders, it understood why Fletcher would be reluctant to testify against a codefendant who could probably harm Fletcher or his family. Although Fletcher\u2019s refusal to testify \u201cmay have been intended to impede\u201d the government\u2019s prosecution of Trought, the district court noted that Trought was convicted on one count and would probably receive a substantial sentence. Therefore, the court stated that it had no intention of sentencing Fletcher above the low end of his guideline range. The district court sentenced Fletcher to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment, \u201cof which TWELVE (12) MONTHS shall run CONCURRENT to the defendant\u2019s original sentence imposed in [the drug conspiracy case]. Total additional time THIRTY-NINE (39) MONTHS.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fletcher appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ac3\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">In order to convict a defendant of criminal contempt, the government must establish that: (1) the district court entered a lawful order of reasonable specificity, and (2) the defendant willfully violated that order. <em>United States v. Straub, </em>508 F.3d 1003, 1010 (11th Cir.2007). A violation of an order is willful if it is \u201c \u2018a deliberate or intended violation, as distinguished from an accidental, inadvertent, or negligent violation of an order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1012 (quoting <em>United States v. Baldwin, </em>770 F.2d 1550, 1558 (11th Cir.1985)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">Generally, a witness may not be convicted of criminal contempt for invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refusing to testify. <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 448-49, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 1658-59, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). However, when the testimony of a witness \u201cmay be necessary to the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>interest\u201d and that witness in a proceeding in a court of the United States refuses to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds, the United States attorney, with the approval of the Attorney General, may ask the district court to issue an order compelling the witness to testify under a grant of immunity. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6003<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Acl\">When the prosecutor properly makes such a request, the district court is required to issue the order to testify. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6003(a). An \u201cimmunity order which is issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6003 is not a matter of judicial process or judicial discretion. The immunity power originates in the legislature; its exercise is delegated solely to the executive.\u201d <em>In re Corrugated Container Anti-Trust Litigation, </em>620 F.2d 1086, 1094 (5th Cir.1980) (quotation marks and citation omitted);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>see also Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>995 F.2d 1013, 1017-18 (11th Cir.1993). Thus, the \u201ccourts have only a limited role in applying immunity statutes\u201d; their duty \u201cis only to ascertain whether the statutory requirements are complied with by the grand jury, the United States Attorney, and the Attorney General.... \u201d <em>Corrugated Container, </em>620 F.2d at 1094; <em>see also United States v. Leyva, </em>513 F.2d 774, 776 (5th Cir.1975) (\u201c[Sjince the court\u2019s duties in granting the requested order are largely ministerial, when the order is properly requested the judge has no discretion to deny it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Here, the prosecutor filed a motion seeking an order compelling Fletcher to testify. Attached to the motion was the letter from the Acting Assistant Attorney General authorizing the request pursuant to \u00a7 6003(b). The parties do not dispute that the government\u2019s request met the statutory requirements. Thus, the district court had no discretion but to issue the order compelling Fletcher to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">The district court did so by signing the order in Fletcher\u2019s presence. Specifically, after Fletcher asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege, the district court stated to Fletcher, \u201cOkay. In which case then I\u2019m going to sign the order that the government has asked me to sign. Now, have you explained to Mr. Fletcher what the consequences will be in the event he fails to comply with the order?\u201d Fletcher\u2019s counsel responded that he had, and Fletcher agreed. At this point the statutory preconditions were met \u2014 Fletcher had refused to testify based on his Fifth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>ment privilege and the district court had communicated the order compelling him to testify. Thus, the order to testify became effective, and Fletcher could not refuse to comply with the order based on his Fifth Amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Fletcher argues that the order did not become effective because the district court did not properly \u201ccommunicate\u201d it to him. Fletcher points out that \u00a7 6003(a) provides that the \u00a7 6003 order \u201cbecome[s] effective as provided in section 6002 of this title,\u201d and \u00a7 6002 provides the person presiding must communicate the order to the witness. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6002, 6003(a). According to Fletcher, to properly communicate the order to him, the district court was required to state expressly to him in open court that he had received immunity from prosecution and therefore could no longer assert his Fifth Amendment privilege, which the district court did not do. Because the order did not become effective, Fletcher argues, he was justified in continuing to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege, and his silence was not a \u201cwillful\u201d violation of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">However, nothing in the language of either \u00a7 6002 or \u00a7 6003 states that the district court must inform the witness in open court that he has been given immunity by the government before compelling the witness to testify. Section 6003(a) states that, upon request of the government, the court \u201cshall issue\u201d an order compelling testimony and \u201csuch order,\u201d not the grant of immunity, becomes effective as provided in \u00a7 6002. In turn, \u00a7 6002 prohibits the witness from refusing to comply with the order to testify on the basis of his Fifth Amendment privilege when: (1) the witness \u201crefuses,\u201d on Fifth Amendment grounds, \u201cto testify\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe person presiding over the proceeding communicates to the witness an order issued under this title----\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6002.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court is required only to \u201ccommunicate\u201d the order to testify to the witness, and the district court did so in this case when it told Fletcher it was signing the government\u2019s proposed order compelling him to testify. It was not necessary for the district court to read the entire contents of the written order out loud to Fletcher or to explain the details of the written order to him. That is particularly true where it is apparent from the record that Fletcher already was aware of the order and the possible consequences for failing to comply with it. According to the transcript of the proceedings, Fletcher\u2019s attorney had received a copy of the government\u2019s motion and the proposed order and had discussed it with Fletcher before Fletcher took the witness stand. Moreover, Fletcher\u2019s defense counsel indicated to the district court that no further inquiry of Fletcher was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">Fletcher relies upon <em>United States v. Lach, </em>874 F.2d 1543 (11th Cir.1989). However, <em>Lack </em>is materially different because there was no written order in <em>Lack </em>and the court only orally ordered the witness to testify. In Lach, the government moved for an order compelling the witness, <em>Lack, </em>to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 1545. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>court ruled orally that the government had taken all necessary steps to confer immunity under \u00a7\u00a7 6002 and 6003, that Lach was ordered to testify, and that Lach\u2019s testimony could not be used against him in a criminal case, except for perjury, giving a false statement or failing to comply with the court\u2019s order. <em>Id. </em>at 1545 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">On appeal, Lach argued that his criminal contempt conviction must be reversed because, <em>inter alia, </em>the district court did not issue a written order. <em>Id. </em>at 1547. This Court concluded that a \u201c[a] written order is not required; instead it is sufficient, for purposes of conferring immunity, if the person unequivocally conveys to the witness the fact that immunity has been granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The Court noted that, in making its oral ruling, the district court had \u201cclearly explained to Lach the effect of its order, indicating that it effectively would preclude Lach from asserting his privilege against self-incrimination as a basis for refusing to testify and that any information compelled by it could not be used against Lach in any subsequent criminal proceeding other than a prosecution for perjury or contempt. Accordingly, Lach was fully aware of the effect of the order and of the probable consequences of violating that order.\u201d <em>Id. Lach </em>did not say that all this was required by statute. Rather, <em>Lach </em>held that given all of what the district court told the witness, it was sufficient to compel the witness to testify when there is no written order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Here, the contents of the district court\u2019s written order compelled the witness\u2019s testimony and expressly stated that no testimony compelled thereunder shall be used against the witness. Thus, the contents of the order were the same as in <em>Lach, </em>but only in writing. Fletcher\u2019s attorney had a copy of the motion and proposed order, Fletcher and his attorney were in court when the district court signed the proposed order, the district court told Fletcher he was ordering him to testify and Fletcher\u2019s attorney told the district court Fletcher was aware of the consequences and no further inquiry was needed. Under the particular circumstances of this case, we conclude that nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 6002 and 6003 or in <em>Lach </em>required the district court in open court to read the contents of the written order to Fletcher in order for Fletcher to be convicted of criminal contempt. Rather, sufficient evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings beyond a reasonable doubt that from the totality of the circumstances defense counsel told Fletcher about the grant of immunity, that the court informed Fletcher of the order to testify and that Fletcher wilfully violated the order compelling him to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">B. Base Offense Level</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The Sentencing Commission declined to provide a specific offense level guideline for contempt offenses because \u201cmisconduct constituting contempt varies significantly and the nature of the contemptuous conduct, the circumstances under which the contempt was committed, the effect the misconduct had on the administration of justice, and the need to vindicate the authority of the court are highly context-dependent. ...\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.1 cmt. n. 1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Thus, the advisory guideline for contempt offenses, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.1, directs the district court to apply the guideline provision for \u201cOther Offenses,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X5.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Section 2X5.1, which applies to felony offenses for which no specific guideline has been promulgated, directs the district court to apply \u201cthe most analogous offense guideline.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X5.1 \u201cThe most analogous guideline contemplated by section 2X5.1 is the guideline that applies to the most analogous statute of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Hyde, </em>977 F.2d 1436, 1438-39 (11th Cir.1992). If there is no sufficiently analogous guideline, then the district court must fashion an appropriate sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X5.1.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In this case, the district court found that Fletcher\u2019s conduct was most analogous to the offense of being an accessory after the fact and used the accessory-after-the-fact guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X3.1, to determine Fletcher\u2019s base offense level of 22. Fletcher argues that his conduct is unlike being an accessory after the fact-because he was incarcerated at the time and could not have actively aided or helped Trought. Fletcher argues his conduct is more analogous to being a material witness who has failed to appear and that his base offense level should have been 6 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.5(a)(l), the failure-to-appear guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">We, however, agree with the PSI that Fletcher\u2019s refusal to comply with the district court\u2019s order and testify at Trought\u2019s trial is most analogous to the obstruction-of-justice guideline. At the sentencing hearing, Fletcher admitted that one reason he refused to testify at Trought\u2019s trial was to protect Trought. Fletcher explained that he feared for himself and his family if Trought were convicted based on his testimony. Fletcher\u2019s testimony supports the district court\u2019s finding that Fletcher refused to testify, at least in part, to impede Trought\u2019s trial and conviction. Fletcher\u2019s intent makes his conduct more akin to obstructing justice than to failing to appear. <em>See also United States v. Marquardo, </em>149 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir.1998) (applying \u00a7 2J1.2, and not \u00a7 2J1.5, where a witness refused to testify under a grant of immunity before a grand jury because witness knew his refusal would obstruct the grand jury proceedings); <em>United States v. Remini, </em>967 F.2d 754, 760 (2d Cir.1992) (applying \u00a7 2J1.2, rather than \u00a7 2J1.5, where the district court found the witness intended to obstruct justice when he refused to testify under a grant of immunity).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">Although the district court found Fletcher\u2019s conduct to be most analogous to being an accessory after the fact, the district court\u2019s finding is harmless error because the cross-reference in \u00a7 2J1.2, the obstruction-of-justice guideline, makes the accessory-after-the-fact guideline applicable to Fletcher\u2019s offense. The obstruction-of-justice guideline, \u00a7 2J1.2, provides for a base offense level of 14. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(a). However, \u00a7 2J1.2 also provides that \u201c[i]f the offense involved obstructing the inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>tigation or prosecution of a criminal offense, apply \u00a7 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in respect to that criminal offense, if the resulting offense level is <em>greater </em>than that determined above.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(c) (emphasis added); <em>see United States v. McQueen, </em>86 F.3d 180, 182 (11th Cir.1996) (concluding that \u00a7 2J1.2\u2019s cross-reference to \u00a7 2X3.1 is mandatory if the requirements are met).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In Fletcher\u2019s case, both of \u00a7 2J1.2\u2019s cross-reference requirements were met. First, Fletcher\u2019s contempt involved obstructing the prosecution of criminal charges against Trought. Second, \u00a7 2X3.1 resulted in a greater offense level of 22 than \u00a7 2J1.2\u2019s offense level of 14.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, Fletcher has not shown any reversible error in the district court\u2019s using an offense level of 22 in sentencing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-12\">. The order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-13\">IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 6002, that Kenneth Fletcher give testimony or provide other information which the witness refuses to give or provide on the basis of the witnesses' privilege against self-incrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>as to all matters about which the witness may be questioned before the Jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-15\">HOWEVER, no testimony of information compelled under this order, or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information, may be used against the witness in any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to comply with this Order.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\">. At the time of the criminal contempt sentencing, Fletcher still had some time left to serve on his drug conviction, and the district court ran part of the criminal contempt sentence concurrent with Fletcher's drug sentence. On appeal, neither Fletcher nor the government raises an issue regarding the district court's making part of the criminal contempt sentence concurrent and part of it consecutive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b535-14\">. \"In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in support of a finding of criminal contempt, we must determine whether the evidence, construed in the light most favorable to the government, would permit the trier of fact to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <em>United States v.

Fletcher points to dicta in <em>Lach </em>that \"[t]he grant of immunity is effective once 'communicated' to the witness,\u201d as support for his argument that the district court is required to explain the grant of immunity to the witness. 874 F.2d at 1547. However, \u00a7 6003(a) has no reference to immunity, but says upon motion of the government the court \u201cshall issue\u201d the order to testify and that \"such order,\u201d not the grant of immunity, becomes effective as provided in \u00a7 6002. And, in turn, \u00a7 6002 states that the \"order\u201d must be communicated to the witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">. \"Whether a guideline is or is not analogous to a defendant\u2019s criminal activity is a question of law\u201d we review <em>de novo.

Ortiz, </em>84 F.3d 977 (7th Cir. 1996), cited by Fletcher, is inapposite. In <em>Ortiz, </em>the witness refused to testify in his co-defendant's trial because he did not want to be known as a \"snitch.\" <em>Id. </em>at 982. And, there was no evidence that the witness's refusal \"was designed to assist Ortiz in escaping punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 981. However, in Fletcher's case, there was evidence \u2014 from Fletcher himself \u2014 that his refusal to testify was motivated in part by a desire help Trought avoid conviction. Thus, we find the obstruction-of-justice guideline, while not a perfect fit, is the most analogous guideline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b540-15\">.

The offense level for Trought's underlying drug offense was 28, giving Fletcher an offense level of 22 under \u00a7 2X3.1. Thus, the offense level of 22 under \u00a7 2X3.1 was greater than the offense level of 14 under \u00a7 2J1.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
