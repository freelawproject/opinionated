The district court denied Searls\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP status, Searls is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Aside from conclusional allegations, Searls does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to present an arguable or nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Further, Searls does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action is moot nor does he provide sufficient facts to support his Eighth Amendment claim against all the defendants. Therefore, these issues are deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Searls has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Searls\u2019s IFP motion is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Searls previously accumulated two strikes for filing frivolous \u00a7 1983 actions. <em>See Searls v. Louisiana, </em>No. 2:08-cv-04050-JCZ (E.D.La. Mar. 13, 2009); <em>Searls v. Lee, </em>No. 2:03-cv-01001-ML (E.D.La. Apr. 29, 2003). Searls is now barred from proceeding IFP pursuant to \u00a7 1915 in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b134-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
