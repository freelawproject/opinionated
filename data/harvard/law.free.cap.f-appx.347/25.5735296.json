We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Strong v. Univ. Healthcare Sys., L.L.C., </em>482 F.3d 802, 805 (5th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is proper if the record reflects \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">The magistrate judge dismissed all of Ganheart\u2019s Title VII, Title IX, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d) and state law claims as time-barred. Ganheart\u2019s brief is comprised almost entirely of arguments disputing the magistrate judge\u2019s factual findings. However, the date used by the magistrate judge to calculate whether her claims were time-barred is not a disputed fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-15\">The only argument she raises in response to her claims being time-barred is a passing reference to the Lilly Ledbetter Act of 2009 (the \u201cAct\u201d). The Act, which is retroactive to May 28, 2007, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-16\">For purposes of this section, an unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to discrimination in compensation in violation of this title, when a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice is adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, or when an individual is affected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, including each time wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid, resulting in whole or in part from such a decision or other practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-17\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-18\">Assuming, without deciding, that the Act is applicable to Ganheart\u2019s claims, it nonetheless does not make any of Ganheart\u2019s claims timely. The magistrate judge began his calculations with Ganheart\u2019s last day of employment at Xavier University, not the date that she was first subject to any alleged discriminatory compensation decision. In other words, the magistrate judge\u2019s method of calculating the statute of limitations period comported with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-19\">Even if we were to liberally construe Ganheart\u2019s brief, <em>see Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cAlthough we liberally construe briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants and apply less stringent standards to parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel, <em>pro se </em>parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28.\u201d), we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>no error in the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that all her claims were time-barred. Accordingly, there is no need to review the magistrate judge\u2019s alternative conclusions regarding Ganheart\u2019s failure to state a claim as to many of these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Therefore, we AFFIRM the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b50-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
