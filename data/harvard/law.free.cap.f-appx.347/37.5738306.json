He argues that the district court erred in denying him safety valve reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(ll), 5C1.2 based on a finding that he failed to truthfully provide to the Government all information and evidence he had concerning the offense. We review the district court\u2019s finding for clear error. <em>United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 145 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-16\">The district court was able to assess Ngo\u2019s credibility and that of the testifying agents at the sentencing hearing and found that Ngo had never been entirely forthcoming during debriefing regarding his role in the offense. The court was entitled to discredit Ngo\u2019s testimony to the contrary, <em>see United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 799 (5th Cir.1996), and the agents\u2019 testimony was sufficient to support the district court\u2019s factual finding. <em>See United States v. McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 457 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b62-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
