(collectively \u201cDen-Mar\u201d) on her sexual harassment and retaliation claims under Title VII. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b39-17\">On October 9, 2006, Stingley began working as a clerk at Den-Mar under the supervision of John Muldrow. One month later, Stingley reported to Den-Mar\u2019s human resources director, Kenneth Doake, that Muldrow had been sexually harassing her. That afternoon (a Friday), Doake contacted Muldrow to advise him of the complaint. The following Tuesday, Muldrow stopped reporting to work. As of the second no-show day, he effectively resigned per company policy. Doake promptly notified Stingley of Muldrow\u2019s resignation, and she agreed with Doake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>that further action was unnecessary. Ron French became Stingley\u2019s new supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">On December 30, 2006, Stingley sent Doake another letter to report disagreeable conduct by a coworker, Nina Tillmon. In the letter, Stingley stated that she felt uncomfortable when Tillmon engaged in extensive phone calls with Muldrow at the office, allegedly discussing what had happened to him. She further alleged that Tillmon \u2014 as a result of these calls \u2014 maliciously disparaged her to other co-workers, causing at least one other person to treat her less cordially and implied that Tillmon\u2019s actions were leading to an untenable work environment. Due to severe weather problems delaying mail delivery, Doake received the letter on January 18, 2007, and quickly asked French to investigate the matter. On January 25, 2007, French met with Tillmon to discuss his investigation. The next day, Tillmon abandoned her position and effectively resigned. Thereafter, Stingley reported no further acts of harassment or retaliation to Doake.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">On March 7, 2007, French contacted Doake to suggest eliminating the clerk position, along with a permanent layoff of Stingley, purportedly as part of a company-wide plan to cut costs after the loss of a lucrative contract. Doake agreed and scheduled Stingley\u2019s employment termination for March 17, 2007. On March 12, 2007, Stingley left French a note on his desk, in which she objected to his \u201crude and moody\u201d treatment of her. This led French to contact Doake the next day and suggest accelerating her termination. Doake responded that, despite the note, they would \u201cstay with the plan.\u201d Den-Mar terminated Stingley\u2019s employment on March 17, 2007, as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">After submitting a complaint to the EEOC and receiving a Dismissal and Notice of Rights, Stingley timely filed suit against Den-Mar asserting three Title VII claims, which she characterized as sexual harassment, hostile work environment, and wrongful termination. Den-Mar later moved for summary judgment on Stingley\u2019s claims. The district court denied summary judgment on Stingley\u2019s sexual harassment claim but granted Den-Mar\u2019s motion for summary judgment on her remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The district court later ordered Stingley to present evidence on a necessary (but unchallenged) element of the sexual harassment claim \u2014 that the alleged harassment affected a term or condition of her employment \u2014 to avoid a <em>sua sponte </em>grant of summary judgment for Den-Mar on that claim as well. Stingley filed a motion for reconsideration of the first summary judgment order and a response to the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>order regarding her sexual harassment claim. The district court denied Stingley\u2019s motion for reconsideration, granted summary judgment in favor of Den-Mar on Stingley\u2019s sexual harassment claim, and entered a final judgment dismissing all of her claims. Stingley timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">We have jurisdiction to review the final judgment of the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Strong v. Univ. Healthcare Sys., L.L.C., </em>482 F.3d 802, 805 (5th Cir.2007). A district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is proper when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); <em>see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We may affirm summary judgment, regardless of the district court\u2019s rulings, if the record contains an adequate and independent basis for that result. <em>Degan v. Ford Motor Co., </em>869 F.2d 889, 892 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Because Stingley proceeds <em>pro se, </em>we construe her arguments liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam). Broadly construing Stingley\u2019s brief, she argues that (1) the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her sexual harassment claim <em>sua sponte, </em>(2) a genuine issue of material fact existed on her sexual harassment claim, (3) the district court erred in \u201cmerging\u201d her retaliation and retaliatory discharge claims, and (4) the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her retaliation and retaliatory discharge claims on grounds different from those that Den-Mar raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">A. Sexual Harassment Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">We first address the issues concerning Stingley\u2019s sexual harassment claim. To establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment by a supervisor under Title VII, an employee must show: \u201c(1) that [she] belongs to a protected class; (2) that [she] was subject to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) that the harassment was based on sex; and (4) that the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment.\u201d <em>Aryain v. Wal-Mart Stores Tex. LP, </em>534 F.3d 473, 479 (5th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). The district court notified Stingley of its intention to <em>sua sponte </em>grant summary judgment on Stingley\u2019s sexual harassment claim. After considering her response, the court held that Stingley had failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the alleged harassment affected a term or condition of her employment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">Stingley first argues that the district court erred in acting <em>sua sponte </em>to grant Den-Mar summary judgment on her sexual harassment claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is well settled that a district court can grant summary judgement <em>sua sponte </em>so long as the adverse party had adequate notice to come forward with all of its evidence. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 326, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>see also Love v. Nat\u2019l Med. Enters., </em>230 F.3d 765, 770-71 (5th Cir.2000). A court provides a party with adequate notice by adhering to the same time frame prescribed for a party\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which is at least ten days before the day set for the hearing. <em>See Love, </em>230 F.3d at 770; <em>see also </em>Fed.R.CivP. 56(c). Here, the district court notified Stingley \u2014 in an order dated September 12, 2008 \u2014 to \u201cfile whatever she wishe[d] to file\u201d by September 26, 2008, on whether it should make a <em>sua sponte </em>ruling. Because the court provided Stingley ten business days (within which she in fact filed a response) and implicit instructions to present sufficient evidence, we find she had adequate notice. Therefore, the district court did not err in acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>sua sponte </em>to grant summary judgment on Stingley\u2019s sexual harassment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Stingley also argues that she presented genuine issues of material fact that warranted the denial of summary judgment on her sexual harassment claim. Upon receiving the district court\u2019s notice of potential <em>sua sponte </em>ruling, which pointed out a lack of evidence that the alleged harassment affected a term or condition of Stingley\u2019s employment, Stingley bore the burden of going beyond her pleadings and presenting sufficient evidence to the contrary. <em>See Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548. To do so, she had to present evidence establishing that the alleged harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter her working conditions or create an abusive working environment. <em>Aryain, </em>534 F.3d at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">This Stingley failed to do, as most of the materials she presented did not constitute competent summary judgment evidence. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 sets out the standards for summary judgment and generally requires that evidence be sworn, certified, or verified material for a court to consider it. <em>See </em>Fed. R.CivP. 56(c), (e); <em>Lodge Hall Music, Inc. v. Waco Wrangler Club, Inc., </em>831 F.2d 77, 80 (5th Cir.1987); <em>see also King v. Dogan, </em>31 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir.1994). Here, the competent summary judgment evidence consists of Doake\u2019s affidavit submitted in support of Den-Mar\u2019s motion, Den-Mar\u2019s thirteen referenced and verified exhibits, and Stingley\u2019s one opposing affidavit. Although Stingley\u2019s affidavit references many \u2014 but not all \u2014 of her exhibits, as well as her response to Den-Mar\u2019s motion for summary judgment, she had neither her exhibits nor her response properly sworn or certified as required. Stingley\u2019s complaint and other pleadings were similarly unverified. Thus, neither the factual allegations in Stingley\u2019s complaint or response, nor any of the facts in the unauthenticated documents attached and referred to in her affidavit, are competent summary judgment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Further, none of the competent summary judgment evidence sets forth any facts substantiating Stingley\u2019s allegations of sexual harassment. As Stingley admits, she wrote her affidavit to dispute the factual assertions in Doake\u2019s affidavit. But none of the facts Stingley disputes help her meet the burden of proving that the alleged harassment affected a term or condition of her employment. For example, Stingley disputes that her initial call to Doake occurred on November 10 instead of November 11, that Doake incorrectly recounted what he told Muldrow, and that Doake actually investigated her claim. None of these facts tend to show severe or pervasive harassment by Muldrow; rather, they reflect disputes as to whether Den-Mar promptly and adequately addressed her complaint. The competent evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Stingley, establishes that she reported acts of sexual harassment by Muldrow to Doake, that Doake took action in response, and that Muldrow resigned several days later. Beyond these basic facts, we will not presume as true any of Stingley\u2019s allegations and assertions because she did not present sworn statements as to Muldrow\u2019s acts of sexual harassment. In sum, none of the competent summary judgment evidence sets forth specific facts demonstrating the severity or pervasiveness of the alleged sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">We conclude that Stingley did not present a genuine issue of material fact that would warrant a denial of summary judgment on her sexual harassment claim. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>B. Retaliation and Retaliatory Discharge Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Stingley also appeals the district court\u2019s decision on her retaliation and retaliatory discharge claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, an employee must show: \u201c(1) that she engaged in a protected activity; (2) that an adverse employment action occurred; and (3) that a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse action.\u201d <em>Baker v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>430 F.3d 750, 754 (5th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted, numbering added). Stingley asserts that the district court erred in \u201cmerging\u201d her claims and in granting summary judgment on grounds other than those raised by Den-Mar. We need not address these issues, however, because we find that the record contains an adequate and independent basis to grant summary judgment when assessing these claims on the grounds that Den-Mar did raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">As to Stingley\u2019s retaliation claim, she contends that Tillmon and French perpetuated a hostile work environment in retaliation for Muldrow\u2019s termination due to Stingley\u2019s sexual harassment complaint. In its motion for summary judgment, Den-Mar asserted that Stingley could not prove Tillmon\u2019s alleged retaliatory conduct amounted to an adverse employment action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">An adverse employment action is one that \u201ca reasonable employee would have found ... [to be] materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) (quotation marks omitted). As with Stingley\u2019s sexual harassment claim, the record contains no competent evidence to substantiate Stingley\u2019s allegation that she was subject to an adverse employment action. Stingley offered two pieces of evidence: (1) a letter she sent to Doake, reporting her belief that Tillmon maliciously talked about her and caused others to treat her less cordially, and (2) the note Stingley left on French\u2019s desk, protesting his rude and disrespectful treatment of her. But Stingley\u2019s letter to Doake does nothing to substantiate the alleged harassment, as it is only evidence that she sent a letter and not that the events described in the letter actually occurred. And Stingley\u2019s note to French, in addition to being unverified, fails to recount any specific facts regarding French\u2019s behavior. In short, we find the record insufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether Stingley suffered a materially adverse employment action for this claim. Given that Den-Mar\u2019s motion for summary judgment provided Stingley proper notice to present sufficient evidence to prove an adverse employment action, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Stingley\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">Finally, as to Stingley\u2019s retaliatory discharge claim, she asserts that she was terminated in retaliation for engaging in Title VII-protected activity. In its motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>for summary judgment, Den-Mar argued that Stingley could not prove a causal link between the protected activity of her filing a sexual harassment complaint and her employment termination. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">When a plaintiff presents no direct evidence of retaliation, she bears the initial burden of establishing a causal link \u201cthrough circumstantial evidence of a retaliatory motive.\u201d <em>Fabela v. Socorro Indep. Sch. </em>Dist., 329 F.3d 409, 415 n. 6 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cIf the plaintiff succeeds in offering circumstantial evidence in support of each element of her claim, she creates a ... presumption of retaliation, and the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the employer produces evidence of a legitimate reason for the action, the burden shifts again to the plaintiff to rebut the employer\u2019s non-retaliatory rationale.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Even assuming that Stingley satisfied her initial burden, she has not shown that Den-Mar\u2019s legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating her employment \u2014 to reduce its workforce after losing a lucrative contract \u2014 was pretext for an actual retaliatory reason. The only fact Stingley specifically disputes as to pretext is an inconsistency in the reason Doake provided for her discharge. In his affidavit, Doake asserted that Den-Mar lost the lucrative contract, but in his position statement to the EEOC, he asserted that Rail Unlimited \u2014 the sister company named as co-defendant \u2014 lost the lucrative contract. We find this discrepancy, without more, insufficient to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Den-Mar\u2019s business reason for terminating Stingley\u2019s employment. The same goes for the temporal proximity between any protected activity and Stingley\u2019s termination; although temporal proximity can establish a prima facie case of retaliation, it cannot \u2014 standing alone \u2014 rebut an employer\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action. <em>See Strong, </em>482 F.3d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Given that Den-Mar\u2019s motion for summary judgment provided Stingley with proper notice to present sufficient evidence to prove a causal link, and that she failed to do so, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Stingley\u2019s retaliatory discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Although Stingley appears to ultimately and unknowingly lose on a procedural misstep related to the presentation of her evidence rather than on the potential merits of her claims, a district court has no obligation to provide a <em>pro se </em>litigant with particularized instructions on the requirements and consequences of summary judgment. <em>See Martin v. Harrison County Jail, </em>975 F.2d 192, 193 (5th Cir.1992). The published rules of procedure afford <em>pro se </em>litigants sufficient notice of what steps to take in a summary judgment proceeding, <em>see id., </em>and the decision of whether to give parties the opportunity to remedy material presented for summary judgment is within the discretion of the district court, <em>see Gordon v. Watson, </em>622 F.2d 120, 123 (5th Cir.1980) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Accordingly, we conclude that the competent summary judgment evidence presents neither disputed material facts nor a basis upon which a reasonable jury could return a verdict for Stingley. The absence of evidence to support Stingley\u2019s claims entitles Den-Mar to summary judgment. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b39-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-9\">. Stingley also asserts that the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>decision, after denying Den-Mar's motion for summary judgment on the same claim, amounts to a form of double jeopardy and abuse of discretion. These arguments lack merit. The Double Jeopardy Clause applies to the imposition of punishment, <em>see Hudson v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 99, 118 S.Ct. 488, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 (1997), and neither the district court\u2019s initial denial nor subsequent grant of summary judgment can be considered a punishment. The district court also had inherent authority to re-examine the merits of summary judgment and could not abuse its discretion by doing so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b43-8\">. Stingley contends on appeal that Den-Mar mischaracterized her hostile work environment claim as a retaliation claim. But neither Stingley\u2019s complaint nor her response to Den-Mar's motion for summary judgment alleged that Tillmon\u2019s hostile treatment, individually or in concert with Muldrow, was based on her gender or any other characteristic protected under Title VII. Rather, Stingley alleged that Tillmon mistreated her because of the sexual harassment complaint against Muldrow. Stingley's further allegations in her response regarding French's conduct similarly sound of retaliation. Therefore, liberally construing Stingley\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief, we construe her second and third claims as claims of retaliation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
