In the first case, (Glinton I) Glinton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>was convicted of (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(A)(ii) and (2) distribution of 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(ii). In the second case, (Glinton II) Glinton was convicted of (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(l)(A)(ii) and (2) distribution of 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(ii). While these cases were not consolidated for pre-trial matters or trial, the cases were consolidated for purposes of sentencing. At a consolidated sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced Glinton to 169 months\u2019 imprisonment in each case, specifying the terms were to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Glinton appeals his sentence and also appeals his conviction in Glinton 2. Glinton argues (1) in Glinton 2, the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress and (2) regarding his sentence, the district court erred at sentencing by imposing a sentence based on more than 5 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Glinton argues the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. He asserts the officers lacked reasonable suspicion that he: (1) was engaged in drug trafficking; (2) had violated a traffic law; or (3) was subject to arrest due to a pending indictment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence under a mixed standard of review. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1247 (11th Cir.2000). We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and the district court\u2019s application of law to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>We also give due weight to the inferences that the district court and local law enforcement officers draw from the facts. <em>Id. </em>at 1248. When considering a ruling on a motion to suppress, we must construe all facts in the light most favorable to the party prevailing in the district court. <em>See United States v. Behety, </em>32 F.3d 503, 510 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">In the absence of probable cause, the police may stop a car and briefly detain it and its occupants in order to investigate a reasonable suspicion that such persons are involved in criminal activity. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1879-80, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); <em>United States v. Tapia, </em>912 F.2d 1367, 1370 (11th Cir.1990). In justifying such an intrusion, the \u201creasonableness\u201d standard requires that a police officer \u201cbe able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>88 S.Ct. at 1880. \u201cReasonable suspicion\u201d is determined from the totality of the circumstances, <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989), and from the collective knowledge of the officers involved in the stop, <em>United States v. Williams, </em>876 F.2d 1521, 1524 (11th Cir.1989). \u201cSuch a level of suspicion is considerably less than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence, or even the implicit requirement of probable cause that a fan* probability that evidence of a crime will be found.\u201d <em>Tapia, </em>912 F.2d at 1370 (citations omitted). Nevertheless, the police are required to articulate some minimal, objective justification for the stop. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Here, the officers\u2019 collective knowledge created a reasonable suspicion that Glinton was engaged in drug trafficking, regardless of whether Glinton committed a traffic offense or the pending indictment against him authorized officers to arrest him. The officers\u2019 surveillance corroborated a tip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>from a reliable informant, thus they had reasonable suspicion to stop Glinton\u2019s car. <em>See United States v. Lindsey, </em>482 F.3d 1285, 1291 (11th Cir.2007). Moreover, the officers observed Glinton act consistently with information provided by a confidential informant. <em>United States v. Chaves, </em>169 F.3d 687, 691 (11th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop Glinton to confirm whether he was involved in drug trafficking activity and in denying Glinton\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>Terry, </em>88 S.Ct. at 1880; <em>Tapia, </em>912 F.2d at 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Glinton argues the district court violated his constitutional rights by finding, him responsible for 115 kilograms of cocaine in calculating his guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">We review a preserved <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) claim on appeal <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only for harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court restated the prior conviction rule, holding that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. The \u201c \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or <em>admitted by the defendant.\u201d Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (emphasis added). In a \u00a7 841 case in which a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence falls at or below the statutory maximum penalty provided in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), there is no constitutional error stemming from <em>Apprendi, </em>and drug quantity need not have been submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Underwood, </em>446 F.3d 1340, 1344-45 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 903, 127 S.Ct. 225, 166 L.Ed.2d 179 (2006). A sentence enhancement based on a drug quantity described in a PSI does not violate the constitution when the defendant concedes to the factual accuracy of the presentence investigation report (PSI). <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). Failure to object to factual findings in the PSI is deemed to be an admission of those facts. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>438 F.3d 1272, 1274 (11th Cir.2006). In addition, we have applied <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to hold that judicial fact-finding that increases a defendant\u2019s guideline range does not violate <em>Apprendi </em>under an advisory guidelines system. <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1227-28 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, a defendant who conspires to commit an offense under \u00a7 841 is subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense that was the object of the conspiracy. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Under \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii), a defendant convicted of distributing five kilograms or more of cocaine is subject to a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii). Under \u00a7 841, a defendant who distributes 500 grams or more of cocaine is subject to a statutory maximum sentence of 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Here, the jury specifically found that Glinton had conspired to possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841 (b)(l)(A)(ii), and that Glinton had distributed over 500 grams of cocaine under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(ii). Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>cordingly, Glinton\u2019s statutory maximum sentence was life imprisonment in Glinton I, and 40 years\u2019 imprisonment in Glinton II. Because Glinton\u2019s 169-month sentence did not exceed his statutory maximum, his claim that his sentence violated <em>Apprendi </em>lacks merit. <em>See Underwood, </em>446 F.3d at 1344. Furthermore, Glinton\u2019s claim that the district court violated <em>Apprendi </em>by engaging in judicial fact-finding that increased his guideline range also lacks merit. <em>See Dudley, </em>463 F.3d at 1227-28.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Based on our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Glinton\u2019s sentence and convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-21\">. At sentencing, Glinton did not dispute the amount of drugs for which he was held responsible in the PSI. Instead, he articulated a legal objection to the court's sentencing him based on an amount of drugs that was not charged in the indictment and found by the jury. Accordingly, Glinton admitted to the facts in the PSI and the district court did not violate his constitutional rights by using the admitted drug quantity to determine his sentence. <em>Williams, </em>438 F.3d at 1274; <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2537.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
