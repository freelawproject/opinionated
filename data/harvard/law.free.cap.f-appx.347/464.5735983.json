Hawn against Shoreline Phase I Condominium Association, Inc. and members of its board of directors (collectively, \u201cShoreline\u201d) for alleged violations of federal and state housing laws, as well as intentional infliction of emotional distress. Hawn alleges that by denying his request to permit his service dog, \u201cBooster,\u201d in his condominium unit, Shoreline discriminated against Hawn on account of his disability. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Shoreline on all claims. Hawn timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">In June 2004, Hawn purchased a condominium unit in Shoreline Towers Phase III. According to the condominium\u2019s bylaws, owners of units must comply with regulations promulgated by Shoreline. At the time that Hawn purchased his unit, there was a sign on the property that read, \u201cNo Animals Allowed,\u201d and Hawn was aware of the existence of this sign and Shoreline\u2019s \u201cno pets policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">In a letter to Shoreline dated January 5, 2005, Hawn wrote that he had recently gone on vacation and acquired a puppy named Booster. Hawn stated that on his trip Booster \u201centertained children ... [and was] more well behaved than I ever was as a child! He sleeps at the foot of my bed, and has even jumped into the shower to be with me.\u201d Hawn repeatedly referred to Booster as a \u201cpet,\u201d \u201cpup,\u201d and even a \u201ccompanion,\u201d but never as a service animal. Hawn said that \u201cone impediment\u201d that kept him from \u201cenjoying [his] home\u201d was Shoreline\u2019s no pets policy. Hawn recommended a change to Shoreline\u2019s policy so as to permit homeowners to \u201cown a pet\u201d or for Shoreline to \u201cagree to a 6-month trial period to give folks a chance to prove that they love their pets as one would love any other family member.\u201d Shoreline did not respond to Hawn\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-17\">Hawn sent another letter to Shoreline, dated June 25, 2006, in which he claimed that he suffered from a \u201cphysical disability and psychiatric disability.\u201d Hawn alleged that he had suffered a \u201cdebilitating injury to [his] leg,\u201d resulting in pain and restricted mobility. He also contended that \u201ca long time [ago]\u201d he was robbed, kidnapped, and assaulted by his friend\u2019s stepson and that, when Hawn was out of town, this person lived in Hawn\u2019s condominium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>unit without permission. Hawn claimed that the individual subsequently was arrested, but as a result of those experiences he \u201ccan never feel safe alone.\u201d Hawn\u2019s letter also discussed Booster and, for the first time, referred to him as a \u201cservice animal ... dually trained to help me both physically and psychologically.\u201d Hawn requested that Booster be exempted from Shoreline\u2019s no pets policy. Exhibits were attached in support of this request, including: (a) a document from the Service Animal Registry of America certifying Booster as a \u201cRegistered Service Animal\u201d; (b) letters from Hawn\u2019s chiropractor, Dr. Hoda, and psychologist, Dr. Evans, contending that a service animal was medically necessary for Hawn; and (c) a description of tasks that Booster could accomplish.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">On August 28, 2006, Shoreline\u2019s general manager told Hawn that he needed additional information in order to consider Hawn\u2019s request, including documentation supporting his disability allegations and the qualifications of Drs. Hoda and Evans. Hawn did not respond, and Shoreline sent a letter dated September 13, 2006, which stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">additional information is needed for the Board to consider your request ... including]: Additional expert evidence under oath of the nature of your impairment, the manner in which it substantially limits one or more of your major life functions or activities, how the requested pet is necessary to afford you an equal opportunity to use and enjoy your dwelling and if there are other corrective measures which will permit such use and enjoyment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The letter concluded, \u201c[w]hile the Association sympathizes with your situation, at this time we must deny your request to keep a pet in your condominium unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Hawn again failed to respond to Shoreline\u2019s request for further documentation, but instead he filed a complaint on September 20, 2006 with the Florida Commission on Human Relations (\u201cFCHR\u201d). After an investigation, the FCHR found cause to believe that Shoreline had discriminated against Hawn by refusing to reasonably accommodate his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">In March 2007, Hawn filed the instant action against Shoreline, seeking monetary and injunctive relief for violations of the federal and Florida Fair Housing Acts, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604; Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.23, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, all stemming from Shoreline\u2019s refusal to permit Hawn to have a service animal in his unit. On Shoreline\u2019s motion, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Shoreline on all of Hawn\u2019s claims. With regard to the federal and state Fair Housing Act claims, the court assumed that Hawn had demonstrated that he was disabled but held that he nonetheless had failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that (a) Shoreline knew or should have known of the disability; (b) Hawn\u2019s requested accommodation was necessary to afford him equal opportunity to use and enjoy his dwelling; or (c) the \u201cNo Animals Allowed\u201d sign evidenced discriminatory intent on the part of Shoreline. Moreover, the court held that Shoreline\u2019s conduct was not so egregious as to constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">Hawn appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to all three of his claims. In addition to disagreeing with the district court\u2019s interpretation of the evidence, Hawn argues that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>court failed to consider documents presented to Shoreline during the FCHR investigation and that this evidence, when coupled with the information provided to Shoreline prior to September 13, 2006, was sufficient to put Shoreline on notice of Hawn\u2019s disability and the necessity of a service dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards that bound the district court, and viewing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving pai\u2019ty.\u201d <em>Cruz v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1379, 1382 (11th Cir.2005) (citation and quotation omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">\u201cThe Florida Fair Housing Act contains statutory provisions that are substantively identical to the federal Fair Housing Act.\u201d <em>Loren v. Sasser, </em>309 F.3d 1296, 1299 n. 9 (11th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we apply the same analysis to Hawn\u2019s claims under these two statutes. See <em>id. </em>at 1302.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Hawn alleges that Shoreline violated two different provisions of Section 3604 of the Fair Housing Act: (1) Section 3604(f)(3)(B), which prohibits the denial of a reasonable accommodation that is necessary to ensure an equal opportunity for a disabled person to use and enjoy his dwelling; and (2) Section 3604(c), which prohibits \u201cany notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any ... discrimination based on ... handicap....\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">A <em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">To prevail on a Section 3604(f)(3)(B) claim, a plaintiff must establish that (1) he is disabled or handicapped within the meaning of the FHA, (2) he requested a reasonable accommodation, (3) such accommodation was necessary to afford him an opportunity to use and enjoy his dwelling, and (4) the defendants refused to make the requested accommodation. <em>See Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, </em>544 F.3d 1201, 1218-19 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">An individual is handicapped, for the purposes of the Fair Housing Act, if he has (a) \u201ca physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person\u2019s major life activities,\u201d (b) \u201ca record of such impairment,\u201d or (c) is \u201cregarded as having such an impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3602(h). But, a defendant \u201ccannot be hable for refusing to grant a reasonable and necessary accommodation if [it] never knew the accommodation was in fact necessary.\u201d <em>Schwarz, </em>544 F.3d at 1219 (quoting <em>Keys Youth Servs., Inc. v. City of Olathe, </em>248 F.3d 1267, 1275 (10th Cir.2001)). Other circuits have held that this means that the defendant must know or reasonably be expected to know of the existence of both the handicap and the necessity of the accommodation. <em>See, e.g., DuBois v. Ass\u2019n of Apartment Owners of 2987 Kalakaua, </em>453 F.3d 1175, 1179 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-17\">Hawn argues that his June 25, 2006 letter to Shoreline was sufficient to create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>genuine issues of material fact as to whether Shoreline knew of Hawn\u2019s handicap and the necessity of his requested accommodation. We disagree. \u201c[T]he duty to make a reasonable accommodation does not simply spring from the fact that the handicapped person wants such an accommodation made. Defendants must instead have ... the ability to conduct a meaningful review of the requested accommodation .... \u201d <em>Schwarz, </em>544 F.3d at 1219 (quoting <em>Prindable v. Ass\u2019n of Apartment Owners, </em>304 F.Supp.2d 1245, 1258 (D.Haw. 2003)). Hawn\u2019s June 2006 letter included unclear explanations as to the nature and extent of his disability and was wholly inconsistent with the reasons he provided in his January 2005 letter for wanting Booster in his condominium unit. Hawn\u2019s refusal to comply with subsequent requests for reasonable documentation prevented Shoreline from conducting a meaningful review of Hawn\u2019s application and thereby Shoreline could not have actually known of Hawn\u2019s disability and the necessity of a service animal.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">We are similarly unpersuaded by Hawn\u2019s argument that the district court erred by failing to consider the documentation made available to Shoreline during the course of the FCHR investigation. First, the district court did in fact consider such evidence; it noted in its order that Hawn\u2019s doctors completed \u201cMedical Certification Forms,\u201d in which they \u201copined that plaintiff had a disability and that a service dog was necessary.\u201d Second, a review of the Medical Certification Forms reveals that they lack much of the information requested by Shoreline. The Medical Certification Forms appear to be generic forms obtained from the FCHR that merely required Hawn\u2019s doctors to check \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d boxes and, in some spaces, provided blank lines for brief comments. The forms did not ask for \u2014 and the doctors did not provide \u2014 other information requested by Shoreline, such as Hawn\u2019s doctors\u2019 credentials. Third, aside from the documents addressed by the district court, it is unclear what other evidence was presented to the FCHR and made available to Shoreline. The Medical Certification Forms were the only documents attached to Hawn\u2019s response to Shoreline\u2019s motion for summary judgment that appear to have been created during the pendency of the FCHR investigation. Finally, the FCHR\u2019s opinion, in which it found cause to believe that Shoreline had discriminated against Hawn, relies predominantly, if not exclusively, on evidence predating the filing of the FCHR complaint. It is therefore unclear what additional evidence Hawn believes was presented to Shoreline during the FCHR investigation that put Shoreline on notice of Hawn\u2019s disability and the necessity of a service animal.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Because there is insufficient evidence to create any genuine issues of material fact as to Shoreline\u2019s knowledge of Hawn\u2019s disability and the necessity of an accommodation, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Shoreline on Hawn\u2019s 42 U.S.C. 3604(f)(3)(B) and Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.23(9)(b) claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\n<em>B. J&gt;2 U.S.C. \u00a7 360i(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">With respect to the Section 3604(c) claim, Hawn alleges that summary judgment was inappropriate because the \u201cNo Animals Allowed\u201d sign was discriminatory in nature and was posted in order to \u201cdiscourage any handicap[ped] person with a service animal from renting or owning a unit on the property.\u201d Hawn argues that unlike a sign that reads \u201cNo Pets Allowed,\u201d the \u201cNo Animals Allowed\u201d sign evidences the intent to bar all animals from the property, including a service animal for an individual that is \u201cclearly disabled and in need of a service animal.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Such speculation is unsupported by the record. The sign outside of the condominium complex had been erected approximately ten years before Hawn bought his unit, and there is no evidence that Shoreline ever discriminated against any other handicapped individuals or that handicapped individuals were dissuaded from purchasing units because of the sign. Hawn has not presented any evidence of discriminatory intent or impact and has thus failed to sustain his burden to \u201ccome forward with \u2018specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment as to Hawn\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(c) and Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.23(3) claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\n<em>C. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Having disposed of the Fair Housing Act claims, we need not separately analyze Hawn\u2019s tort law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress because his argument as to this issue is wholly premised on the allegation that Shoreline \u201crecklessly refused to allow Hawn\u2019s service animal on the premises.\u201d <em>See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. McCarson, </em>467 So.2d 277, 278-79 (Fla.1985) (holding that in order to prevail on a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct has been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community\u201d). Because we have disposed of Hawn\u2019s Fair Housing Act claims, and his intentional infliction of emotional distress argument is premised on the viability of these claims, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Shoreline on this tort law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">For the reasons set forth, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Shoreline on all of Hawn\u2019s claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\">. These included, <em>inter alia, </em>notifying Hawn of intruders, bringing the telephone upon request, bringing socks and shoes upon request, opening the refrigerator and bringing water, and giving a \u201chug\u201d to calm Hawn after a panic attack.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-11\">. This opinion will henceforth analyze Hawn's claims in the context of the federal Fair Housing Act's provisions, but the discussion applies equally to Hawn's claims brought under the Florida analogue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b491-18\">. The parallel Florida provisions are found in Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.23(9)(b) and (3), respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
