The convictions were based upon Owen\u2019s creation of five counterfeit one hundred dollar bills by removing the ink from genuine five dollar bills and printing the likeness of one hundred dollar bills on the washed paper using a computer scanner and printer. Owen gave the bills to Sarah Tedford who was subsequently arrested after attempting the pass one of the bills at a store.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">Following his conviction, Owen filed a motion for acquittal and, in the alternative, a new trial, arguing that the fake currency was so poorly made that it did not constitute \u201ccounterfeit\u201d currency. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">At sentencing, the district court applied a base offense level of nine, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.1(a). The district court then enhanced the offense level to fifteen pursuant to \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(2)(A) and (b)(3). The court also applied a two-level increase for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Owen\u2019s total offense level of seventeen, coupled with his criminal history category of VI, yielded a recommended guidelines range of 51-63 months of imprisonment. The district court, after notifying Owen that it was considering doing so, departed upward pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l) on the basis of Owen\u2019s propensity to recidivate. The district court determined that a total offense level of twenty was appropriate, which when coupled with his criminal history category, yielded a post-departure guidelines range of 70-87 months in prison. Owen objected to the application of \u00a7 2B5.1, the enhancements under \u00a7\u00a7 2B5.1(b)(2)(A), (b)(3) and 3C1.1, as well as the upward departure. The district court overruled the objections and sentenced Owen to 87 months imprisonment. Owen now appeals both his conviction and his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-17\">For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court in part and vacate in part and remand the case to the district court for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-18\">I. Insufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b94-19\">Owen appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his motion for acquittal for insufficiency of the evidence. Because Owen preserved his claim, we review the issue de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence \u201cwe must determine whether, viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could have found that the evidence established the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Owen claims that the evidence was insufficient as the counterfeit money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>presented at trial could not be found to \u201cbear[ ] such a likeness or resemblance to any of the genuine money of the United States as is calculated to deceive an honest, sensible, and unsuspecting person of ordinary observation and care dealing with a person who is supposed to be upright and honest.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, the counterfeits closely resembled genuine bills and only upon close inspection is it clear they are counterfeit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Given the quality of the counterfeits, we have no trouble upholding the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">II. Relevance of Prior Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Owen also objected to the admission of his prior counterfeiting conviction. This court reviews evidentiary rulings on a heightened abuse of discretion basis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, even an abuse of discretion may not merit reversal if the error was harmless.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The evidence of the conviction was admitted under Fed. R. of Evid. 404(b) as relevant to Owen\u2019s intent to produce counterfeit money and knowledge of how to do so. We find no abuse of discretion here. Intent was put at issue by the plea of not guilty as it was an element of the crime. We also do not find that the district court abused its discretion in finding that the probative value was not outweighed by substantial prejudice to the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">III. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">As we note below, we find the district court erred when it applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.1(a). However, we find that the sentencing enhancement and upward departures based on \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 4A1.3(a) respectively are independent of that error and are upheld. Because we find the application of \u00a7 2B5.1(a) was in error we do not reach Owen\u2019s objections to his sentencing based on the enhancements under \u00a7\u00a7 2B5.1(b)(2)(A) and (b)(3) or his general objection to the sentencing as unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">A. Sentencing Enhancement Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">Owen also objects to the application of a sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 which provides for an enhancement if the defendant \u201cwillfully obstructed or impeded ... the administration of justice. We review the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines de novo.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Presentencing Report, adopted by the district court, found obstruction through the defendant\u2019s advice to a witness regarding how to lie about where she had obtained the counterfeit money. In light of this evidence, obstruction was plausible and thus the enhancement was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">B. Departure from Guidelines Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-17\">Owen also objects to the district court\u2019s departure from the Guidelines pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>suant to \u00a7 4A1.3(a) which permits an upward departure \u201cIf reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially underrepresents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d We review a departure under \u00a7 4A1.3(a) for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Given the defendant\u2019s pattern of habitual criminal behavior, we do not find the district court\u2019s decision an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">C. Application of U.S.S.G. 2B5.1</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Owen argues that the district court erroneously applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.1 as opposed to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 as his offense involved the alteration rather than manufacture of the bills. We review the interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Section 2B1.1 addresses \u201cbasic forms of property offenses: theft, embezzlement, fraud, forgery, counterfeiting (other than offenses involving altered or counterfeit bearer obligations of the United States).\u201d Section 2B5.1 addresses \u201cOffenses Involving Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States.\u201d Application Note 2 states that the \u201cguideline applies to counterfeiting of United States currency and coins ... and other items that generally could be described as bearer obligations of the United States.\u201d Application Note 3 of that section states that \u201ccounterfeit\u201d means \u201can instrument that purports to be genuine but is not, because it has been falsely made or manufactured in its entirety. Offenses involving genuine instruments that have been altered are covered under [Section] 2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud).\u201d As courts have noted, \u201c[i]f the false currency involved in this case is altered as opposed to counterfeit, neither Guideline section unambiguously welcomes the offense for sentencing.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-16\">The district court found that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t merely an alteration of those [bills], there was a complete new manufacturing process used in that paper\u201d and thus applied \u00a7 2B5.1. We agree with the reasoning set forth in <em>United States v. </em>Dison,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> as well as that provided by our sister Circuits in <em>United States v. </em>Inclema<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and <em>United States v. </em>Schreckengost,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that \u00a7 2B1.1 should apply. The court in <em>Inclema </em>faced an almost identical factual scenario to the one we address here: the defendant there had bleached low denomination Federal Reserve Notes and printed an image of higher denomination Federal Reserve Notes onto that Federal Reserve Note paper.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court first applied a textual analysis and found that as the defendant had started with Federal Reserve Notes and ended with Federal Reserve Notes, the process could best be described as \u201caltering.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It also argued that \u201cwhen there are two rational readings of a criminal statute, one harsher than the other, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>rule of lenity dictates that we are to choose the harsher one only when congress has spoken in language that is clear and definite.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We continue to find this reasoning persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The Government points us to a proposed amendment that would \u201cclarify\u201d the applications of the guidelines in this instance and instruct the courts to apply \u00a7 2B5.1 and asks us to read the guidelines in the light of this amendment. Again, we agree with the reasoning expressed in <em>United States v. Dison,</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and find that the rule of lenity still applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">For the foregoing reasons we VACATE the sentence and REMAND for re-sentencing in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b94-11\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir.
