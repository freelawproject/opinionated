The district court found that Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines was applicable to Green and reduced his previous offense level from 34 to 32 and his original sentence from 240 months\u2019 imprisonment to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-22\">On appeal Green contends that the district court erred by (1) not resentencing him below his amended Guidelines range and not applying intervening Supreme Court caselaw; (2) not granting a downward departure from the amended guideline range after considering his post-sentence rehabilitation; (3) not appointing counsel; (4) failing to provide a new or updated PSI; and (5) ruling on his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion before ruling on his second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-23\">Green\u2019s first argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir. 2009) (holding that, in resentencing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court is bound by the applicable policy statement of the Sentencing Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>that prohibits the district court from imposing a sentence that is less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range). We find no merit in Green\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
