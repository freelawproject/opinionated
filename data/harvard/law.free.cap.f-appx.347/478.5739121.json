Battle appeals his conviction and 180-month sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). On appeal, Battle argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to allow him to present a justification defense. Battle concedes that his contention is foreclosed by Eleventh Circuit precedent, but asserts that this precedent should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant\u2019s proffer is sufficient to establish all of the elements of a justification defense. <em>United States v. Dicks, </em>338 F.3d 1256, 1257 (11th Cir.2003). When a defendant is charged with violating \u00a7 922(g)(1), a justification defense may be available \u201cin only extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Deleveaux, </em>205 F.3d 1292, 1297 (11th Cir.2000). Justification is an affirmative defense to \u00a7 922(g)(1) that requires that the defendant show the following four elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">(1) that the defendant was under unlawful and present, imminent, and impending threat of death or serious bodily injury; (2) that the defendant did not negligently or recklessly place himself in a situation where he would be forced to engage in criminal conduct; (3) that the defendant had no reasonable legal alternative to violating the law; and (4) that there was a direct causal relationship between the criminal action and the avoidance of the threatened harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-13\"><em>Id. </em>\u201cThe first prong requires nothing less than \u00e1n immediate emergency.\u201d <em>United States v. Rice, </em>214 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">Battle\u2019s proffer in support of a justification defense failed to show that he was under a \u201cpresent, imminent, and impending threat of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d Battle\u2019s alleged threat of serious injury was based on a single incident that occurred several years before he was arrested in possession of two firearms. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding Battle\u2019s evidence which failed to show an immediate emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">Battle next argues that, under <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008), his constitutional right to bear arms was unconstitutionally abrogated by 18 U.S.C \u00a7 922(g)(1). He contends that the Second Amendment does not allow an absolute and permanent prohibition of the right to bear arms, as is found in \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">\u201cWhen a motion to dismiss challenges the constitutionality of a statute, we review <em>de novo </em>the interpretation of the statute by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir. 2009). The Second Amendment states that \u201c[a] well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. II. Pursuant to \u00a7 922(g)(1), it is unlawful for a convicted felon to possess a firearm or ammunition. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-18\">In <em>Heller, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of a District of Columbia statute that generally prohibited the possession of handguns. 554 U.S. at-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>128 S.Ct. at 2788. The Supreme Court held that \u201cthe Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to possess weapons unconnected with militia service.\u201d <em>United States v. Tagg, </em>572 F.3d 1320, 1326 (11th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 2787-812). However, \u201cthe right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.\u201d <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 2816. In fact, the Supreme Court noted that \u201cnothing in [its] opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill.\u201d 554 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 2816-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Because the Supreme Court in <em>Heller </em>stated that \u201cthe right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited\u201d and \u201cnothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,\u201d Battle\u2019s argument that the permanent prohibition of the right to bear arms, as found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), violates the Second Amendment is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Battle next argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional because it is an unlawful exercise of Congress\u2019s authority to regulate commerce under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution. We have previously \u201cheld that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause.\u201d <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>124 F.3d 1265, 1266 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that \u00a7 922(g)(1) was not unconstitutional as applied to a defendant who only possessed a firearm intrastate because \u201c \u00a7 922(g) is an attempt to regulate guns that have a connection to interstate commerce\u201d). Thus, the district court did not err by finding that \u00a7 922(g)(1) does not violated the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Battle next argues that his mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. We review <em>de novo </em>constitutional challenges to a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1250 (11th Cir.2005). The Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) provides that any person convicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) who has 3 previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, is subject to a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">We have consistently held that mandatory minimum sentences for armed career criminals under \u00a7 924(e) do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>528 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that \u201c[the defendant\u2019s] contention that his sentence of 185 months for being an armed career criminal in possession of ammunition violates the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment is foreclosed by <em>{Lyons </em>]\u201d), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1315, 173 L.Ed.2d 583 (2009); <em>Lyons, </em>403 F.3d at 1257 (holding that a 235-month sentence for an armed career criminal convicted for being a felon in possession of ammunition was not cruel and unusual punishment); <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding that the defendant\u2019s 180-month mandatory minimum sentence under the ACCA was not cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">Battle\u2019s contention that his mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment is foreclosed by our precedent. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Battle\u2019s conviction and 180-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
