The firearm conviction was vacated, and Magee was sentenced to 235 months in prison. Magee now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence, which was based on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019s base offense levels for crack cocaine. We review the district court\u2019s determination on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-37 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). On appeal, Magee makes the same argument that was rejected by the district court, that \u201capproximately 4.7 kilograms\u201d of cocaine base was likely to have been less that 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, which would have entitled him to two level reduction in his base offense level under the amended guidelines. This argument is refuted absolutely by the record. The presentence report stated unambiguously that Magee\u2019s base offense level of 38 was based on \u201capproximately 4,776.3 grams or 4.7 kilograms of crack cocaine.\u201d Given the specific amount of 4,776.3 grams, Magee has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b151-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir.
