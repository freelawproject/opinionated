He has filed a federal habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 to challenge this conviction, arguing in relevant part that the trial court denied him due process by permitting the State to present rebuttal evidence of an extraneous offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, federal courts will not grant habeas relief on any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the state court\u2019s ruling was the result of \u201ca decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or if the state court decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d). \u201c[A] federal habeas court maldng the \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 inquiry should ask whether the state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Further, this \u201cunreasonableness\u201d inquiry addresses the state court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, not its reasoning process. <em>Santellan v. Cockrell, </em>271 F.3d 190, 193 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">On appeal, Wheeler contends that the introduction of the extraneous offense evidence of his alleged molestation of another child was unduly prejudicial and was not related to the offense of conviction. To the extent that Wheeler is challenging the admissibility of this evidence under state evidentiary rules, an error in the application of state law does not constitute an independent ground for granting federal habeas relief. <em>See Wood v. Quarterman, </em>503 F.3d 408, 414 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1874, 170 L.Ed.2d 752 (2008). To the extent that Wheeler is challenging the admission of the rebuttal evidence on federal grounds, the state court\u2019s evidentiary ruling does not present a cognizable habeas claim unless it violates a specific constitutional right or renders the trial fundamentally unfair. <em>Pemberton v. Collins, </em>991 F.2d 1218, 1226 (5th Cir.1993). The admission of an extraneous offense does not violate due process if the State \u201cmakes a strong showing that the defendant committed the offense and if the extraneous offense is rationally connected \"with the offense charged.\u201d <em>Wood, </em>503 F.3d at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">Wheeler contends that the State failed to make a \u201cstrong showing\u201d that he committed the prior, uncharged offense because the victim was allowed to testify without first establishing that the offense occurred. He has presented no case law requiring such a predicate showing, and the victim\u2019s testimony may show the existence of the offense. <em>See Wood, </em>503 F.3d at 414-15. Wheeler also maintains that the offenses are not \u201crationally related\u201d because they involved different victims and were not connected in any way. But offenses may be rationally related, even if they involve different victims and occurred at different times, if the offenses have \u201cstriking similarities.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 415. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that the two offenses were very similar because they involved Wheeler allegedly reaching into young girls\u2019 clothing to touch them despite the presence of family members nearby. Even were we to disagree with that conclusion, Wheeler has not established that the state court\u2019s rejection of Wheeler\u2019s due process claim in his state postconviction application constituted an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495; <em>Santellan, </em>271 F.3d at 193. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1005-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
