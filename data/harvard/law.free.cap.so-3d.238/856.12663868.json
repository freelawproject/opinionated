Appellee confesses error, and does not oppose reversal of the sentence on the cannabis charge and reversal of the order imposing the contested costs. After reviewing the record, we agree that the trial court erred. We reverse the sentence and contested costs imposed by the trial court for the cannabis charge and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ciklin, Damoorgian and Conner, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
