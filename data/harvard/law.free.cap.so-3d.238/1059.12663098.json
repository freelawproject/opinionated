Belsome\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a code violation case concerning a French Quarter residence. The appeal stems from an administrative adjudication against the Plaintiff, Guido Sutter, by the City of New Orleans, through the Vieux Carr\u00e9 Commission (VCC). The Plaintiff appeals the trial court's February 16, 2017, judgment denying relief and affirming the VCC's administrative adjudication. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Plaintiff owns a residence located at 740 Barracks Street, in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he has claimed a homestead exemption for the last several years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 30, 2016, a VCC building inspector conducted an inspection of the property while workers were present, noting various violations. The violations included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Working without required approval;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Roof repair without a permit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3. Replacing gutters without a permit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   4. Damaged and missing glass doors;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   5. Demolition by neglect;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   6. Hazardous conditions due to portions of the building that may fall;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   7. Defective or deteriorating walls;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   8. Building not watertight due to deteriorated or ineffective waterproofing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   9. Deteriorated roof shingles;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   10. Deteriorated doors;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   11. Missing and deteriorated gutters;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   12. Deteriorated trim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   13. Vegetation on the building;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   14. Deteriorated paint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Due to the alleged violations, a stop work order was issued. On the same day, the inspector mailed a Notice of Violation to the Plaintiff at his Barracks Street address. A Notice of Hearing concerning the alleged violations was mailed to the\n   Plaintiff on May 6, 2016. A subsequent inspection took place on May 13, 2016. Photographs from this date reveal that the Notice of Hearing was affixed to the property. When the Plaintiff failed to appear at the scheduled hearing on May 25, 2016, the hearing officer found the Plaintiff guilty of the fourteen violations. The Plaintiff was fined $7,000.00 ($500.00 per violation) and $75.00 in hearing costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 13, 2016, the Plaintiff filed a \"Petition to Annul/Vacate Notice of Administrative Judgment and/or Appeal\" in the trial court. The administrative record was lodged and the City filed a brief in opposition. The trial court held two hearings on the matter. After the first hearing, the trial court advised the parties to discuss a reduction in fines and to eliminate duplicate violations. Though the record is silent on the matter, the City stipulates that it reduced the violations from fourteen to nine, pursuant to the recommendation of the trial court after the first hearing. After the second hearing, the trial court denied the relief requested in the Plaintiff's petition; however, it reduced the violations from fourteen to nine. As a result, the Plaintiff was ordered to pay $4,575.00 in fines and hearing costs, as well as the City's deferred filing costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court also designated the appeal as final. This devolutive appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The general authority for local government to regulate land use is conferred by La.

Notice shall be personally served or sent to the alleged violator by regular and certified or registered U.S. Mail at the address listed in the assessor's office of the parish. The date of the postmark shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. Any notification so sent and returned by the U.S. Post Office shall be considered as having fulfilled the notification requirement. Proof of notification and attempts at service shall be entered in the record for each case prior to the hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Section 6-36(d) also requires a copy of the notice of violation to be affixed to the property in a prominent location at least five days before the hearing date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The record demonstrates that the VCC gave adequate notice of the hearing as required by the City Code, in accordance with due process of law. The affidavit of Lillian McNee, One Stop Shop Adjudication Coordinator, reveals that the notice of hearing was mailed to the Plaintiff at the Barracks Street address, which was listed as the Plaintiff's address on the assessor's website. The record also contains a copy of a certified envelope that was returned to the Post Office undelivered. Finally, the\n   record establishes that the notice was affixed to the front of the property on May 13, 2016, which is more than five days before the hearing, in accordance with Section 6-36(d). The written adjudication from May 25, 2016 further documents the notice attempt and timely posting, in accordance with 6-36(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Plaintiff argues for the imposition of a higher burden upon the VCC regarding notification. He claims that the VCC had an obligation to mail notice to all reasonably available addresses to ensure notice was received.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Section 6-36 does not impose such a burden to fulfill the notice requirement. Specifically, Section 6-36(c) specifies that any notifications sent and returned shall be considered as fulfilling the notice requirement. Furthermore, in addition to the fact that the certified letter was returned, notice was affixed to the property in a prominent place. Under these circumstances, the VCC complied with the notice requirements under Section 6-36. Accordingly, the Plaintiff received adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard in accordance with due process of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In his second assignment of error, the Plaintiff asserts that the trial court erred in upholding the violations when the work being performed was ordinary maintenance and did not require a permit. He argues that he did not use any new materials; rather, he was re-securing loose or missing shingles, weatherboards, and gutters, and that there was no proof of neglect, deterioration, or hazaradous conditions on the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Contrary to the Plaintiff's argument, the permit requirement does not hinge upon the use of new material. Chapter 166, Section 35 of the New Orleans Municipal Code of Ordinances\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   requires an owner to apply for a VCC permit whenever there are any alterations to any portion of an exterior building in the Vieux Carr\u00e9. Additionally, aside from ordinary maintenance and repairs, La. R.S. 25:737\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   generally requires\n   an owner to apply for a certificate of appropriateness whenever an owner alters or restores exterior architectural features to structures in a historic preservation district. Thus, a permit is required when alterations or restorations to the exterior of VCC property are being made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   By the Plaintiff's own admission, various repairs to re-install loose and/or detached gutters, siding,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   flashing, and weatherboards were being conducted to the exterior of the building. The photographs in the record further document the condition of the property. Since the attempted repairs necessitated alterations beyond ordinary maintenance, we cannot find that the VCC was unreasonable in finding that the Plaintiff required a permit before performing the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Although the Plaintiff did not appear at the hearing to argue the merits of the charged violations; the record, which contains photographs of the condition of the property on March 30, 2016, and May 13, 2016, adequately supports the VCC's adjudication on the violations. Thus, we cannot find that the VCC acted in an unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any error in the trial court's judgment upholding nine of the fourteen violations. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment denying the relief requested is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The Plaintiff claimed a homestead exemption on the property in 2015, 2016, and 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Notably, the Plaintiff did not challenge the portion of the trial court judgment pertaining to the payment of the City's deferred filing costs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Initially, the Plaintiff filed an application for supervisory writs.

Since no deference is owed by the appellate court to the district court's fact findings or legal conclusions, the appellate court need only review the findings and decision of the administrative agency.\n    <em>\n     Sylvester v.
