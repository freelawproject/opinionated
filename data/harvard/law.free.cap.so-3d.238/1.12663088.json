James Clarence McGlothin was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-37-5 (Rev. 2014). Finding reversible error, we reverse and render the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. In May 2014, McGlothin was under surveillance by the Coastal Narcotics Enforcement Team. McGlothin met with a criminal informant. Thereafter, a search warrant was issued for the home where the meeting took place. Upon execution of the warrant, 2 members of the narcotics team entered the home and found no one there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Inside they found that the home contained two bedrooms. There was women's clothing in one bedroom. In the other bedroom, the agents found a man's wallet on a dresser. The wallet contained McGlothin's identification card, social-security card, bank card, and several casino player's cards. There were receipts in McGlothin's name inside a dresser drawer. They also found a loaded Titan .25 semiautomatic handgun inside the pocket of a man's jacket that was hanging inside the closet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. During the search, a woman arrived at the home. She identified herself as the homeowner and McGlothin's grandmother. She informed the agents that her granddaughter, McGlothin's sister, lived in the home. The woman contacted McGlothin via cell phone and placed him on the line with an agent. McGlothin informed the agent that he would arrive at the home within ten to fifteen minutes, but he did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. A warrant was issued for McGlothin's arrest. He was arrested three months later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. The handgun found in the home was examined and tested at a forensics lab. It was determined that the firearm worked properly. No fingerprints were taken from the weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. A grand jury indicted McGlothin, as a habitual offender, for the unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felony. The jury returned a guilty verdict. McGlothin was sentenced to serve ten years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), as a habitual offender pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated section 99-19-81 (Rev. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. McGlothin filed a motion for a new trial or, in the alternative, a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. He asserted that the circuit judge should have granted his motion for a directed verdict or peremptory jury instruction D-1, because the State had failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The circuit judge denied the motion. McGlothin appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. In a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial, the Mississippi Supreme Court has held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [I]n considering whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction in the face of a motion ... for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the critical inquiry is whether the evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that [the] accused committed the act charged, and that he did so under such circumstances that every element of the offense existed; and where the evidence fails to meet this test it is insufficient to support a conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Bush v.

In 2006, he was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent, and in 2009, he was convicted of possession of a controlled substance. Both offenses were felonies. McGlothin does not challenge his status as a convicted felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11. Instead, in this appeal, McGlothin argues that the State failed to prove that he possessed a firearm. He claims that the State did not prove: (1) he was in proximity to the firearm; (2) there was evidence that connected him to the firearm; and (3) the firearm was located on premises that were exclusively under his control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12. \"It is undisputed that [McGlothin] was not actually in possession of the [firearm].\"\n   <em>\n    Peden v.

During the trial, a special agent testified that the home's owner was unknown prior to the execution of the search warrant.

There was evidence that established the firearms were kept in the same closet as the defendant's clothes, the defendant stayed in the home overnight, and the defendant had handled the guns on several occasions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9452327\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/802/137/#p142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9452327\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/802/137/#p142\">\n    at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 12-13).

In this appeal, the State argues that McGlothin's wallet and the receipts in the drawer were sufficient evidence to prove that McGlothin lived in the home. None of these documents listed McGlothin's address as 514 Jefferson Street, which was the address of this home. Instead, the identification card and a receipt from the circuit clerk's office listed McGlothin's home address as 258 Magnolia Street in Biloxi, Mississippi. We find that this evidence offered against McGlothin is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   . There was no testimony that McGlothin lived or stayed overnight in the home, that the clothes in the closet belonged to him, or that he had handled the firearm in the past. There was also no testimony that McGlothin's fingerprints were found on the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17.

This Court held that \"being in a closed area such as a vehicle or a room with contraband does not by itself permit the inference of dominion and control.

Here, the State asserts that McGlothin was observed standing on the home's front porch six days before the warrant was executed. This fact alone does not indicate that McGlothin had dominion or control over the residence, any particular room in the home, or even the jacket where the gun was found. There was no testimony that he owned the home or resided there. The State offered no evidence to establish when the firearm was placed\n   in the pocket of the jacket or any evidence that McGlothin had ever worn the jacket. Finally, the state could not connect the firearm to McGlothin through fingerprints. There was simply no competent evidence offered to establish that McGlothin had dominion or control over the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    II.

In each of these cases, this Court found constructive possession of contraband after each defendant was found in close proximity to the item. Constructive possession was also established through other circumstances that connected them to the contraband. While McGlothin was observed standing on the home's porch six days before the firearm was found, this alone is not enough to establish constructive possession. There is no evidence to indicate when the gun was placed in the home. There was also no testimony confirming who had access to the home. McGlothin was not observed wearing the jacket where the gun had been located. The State produced no evidence indicating that he either owned the jacket or had accessed the jacket before the search warrant was executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22.

The State presented a theory that McGlothin lived in the home where the gun was located. The theory was based on the fact that his wallet and identification were found on a dresser\n   in a room that contained men's clothing. The State further based its theory on the fact that McGlothin was observed standing on the home's porch just days before the search warrant was executed. \"The theory may be correct, but there was not any additional incriminating evidence beyond [the] presence [of McGlothin's identification in a room] to support constructive possession of ... the weapon[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11110344\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/785/1088/#p1093\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 24.
