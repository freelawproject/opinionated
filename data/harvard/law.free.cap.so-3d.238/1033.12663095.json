Belsome, Judge Joy Cossich Lobrano, Judge Marion F. Edwards, Pro Tempore)\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Judge Joy Cossich Lobrano\n   This is an insurance coverage dispute arising from a claim for breach of construction contract and damages. Defendant/Appellant, National Rice Mill, L.L.C. (\"Rice Mill\"), appeals the district court's October 10, 2016 and October 20, 2016 judgments granting two motions for partial summary judgment. The October 10, 2016 judgment ruled that the water intrusion events that took place on September 4, 2011 and August 28, 2012 constitute two occurrences within the meaning of the applicable Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Company (\"Westchester\") policies. The October 20, 2016 judgment dismissed Rice Mill's claims for delay damages/liquidation damages, loss of income/business reputation, and rent concessions. For the reasons that follow, we reverse both judgments and remand this matter for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The following facts are pertinent to this appeal. Gibbs Construction, L.L.C. (\"Gibbs\") was the general contractor for an extensive renovation of the Rice Mill's luxury apartment complex, the Rice Mill Lofts (the \"apartments\"). Gibbs selected Rush Masonry, Inc. (\"Rush\") as the masonry restoration subcontractor for the renovation of the apartments. Westchester issued a policy of commercial general liability (\"CGL\") insurance to Rush, which was the primary layer of insurance during the policy periods of February 1, 2011 to February 1, 2012 and February 1, 2012 to February 1, 2013. Third Party Defendant/Appellee, Fireman's Fund Insurance Company (\"Fireman's Fund\") provided a policy of excess liability insurance to Rush during each of the aforementioned Westchester policy periods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Third Party Defendant/Appellee, Zurich American Insurance Company (\"Zurich\"), issued a CGL insurance policy to Gibbs for the policy periods of January 1, 2011 to January 1, 2012 and January 1, 2012 to January 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The apartments experienced multiple instances of water intrusion, including a thunderstorm in July 2011, on September 4, 2011 during Tropical Storm Lee, and on August 28, 2012 during Named Storm Isaac. Subsequently, Gibbs filed suit against Rice Mill for failure to make payments under the general construction contract. Rice Mill filed a reconventional demand against Gibbs and third party demands against Rush, Zurich, and other parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, Fireman's Fund filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that two separate weather events on September 4, 2011 and August 28, 2012 resulted in two occurrences of property damage, each during a separate Westchester policy period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Fireman's Fund and Zurich also each filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that Rice Mill's claims for management fees, damage to \"your work,\" delay damages or reduction in contract price by liquidated damages, rent concessions, loss of business reputation, and mold remediation are not \"property damage\" as required for coverage under the respective Fireman's Fund and Zurich policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 16, 2016, the district court held a hearing, at which the court ruled from the bench on the respective motions for partial summary judgment. The district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Fireman's Fund, finding that the water intrusion events on September 4, 2011 and August 28, 2012 constitute two occurrences. As to the motions for partial summary judgment filed by Fireman's Fund and Zurich, the district court granted the motions in part and dismissed Rice Mill's claims for \"delay damages or liquidation damages,\" \"loss of income/business reputation,\" and \"rent concessions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 9, 2016, Rice Mill filed a motion to have the district court's judgments designated as final. On October 10, 2016, the district court signed and rendered judgment as to Fireman's Fund's and Zurich's motions for partial summary judgment on the dismissed categories of damages. On October 20, 2016, the district court signed and rendered judgment as to Fireman's Fund's motion for partial summary judgment on number of occurrences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This appeal followed. Rice Mill sets forth two assignments of error on appeal, arguing that the district court erred in (1) granting partial summary judgment dismissing claims for particular categories of damages, and (2) granting partial summary judgment finding that the water intrusion constituted two occurrences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before discussing the merits of this appeal, we first address whether this Court has appellate jurisdiction to review the October 20, 2016 judgment rendered by the district court. On October 13, 2016, Rice Mill filed a motion for appeal relative to two judgments, both purportedly rendered on October 10, 2016, in particular:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">\n   a) That certain judgment dated October 10, 2016 granting a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the number of occurrences and coverage triggers filed by Fireman's Fund; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   b) That certain judgment dated October 10, 2016 granting in part Motions for Partial Summary Judgment filed by Fireman's Fund and Zurich.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court signed the order of appeal on October 17, 2016. The record before us, however, contains only one judgment dated October 10, 2016, which was the judgment granting Fireman's Fund's motion for partial summary judgment relative to the number of occurrences. The record lacks a second judgment dated October 10, 2016. Rather, the record reflects that the judgment granting in part the motions for partial summary judgment filed by Fireman's Fund and Zurich, dismissing claims for certain categories of damages, was not signed until October 20, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This Court ordered the parties to submit briefs addressing whether Rice Mill's appeal of the October 20, 2016 judgment should be dismissed as premature and/or as the order of appeal does not reference the October 20, 2016 judgment. Responding to this Court's order, Rice Mill argues that its appeal should not be dismissed and urges this Court to follow its holding in\n   <em>\n    Law Office of Paul C. Miniclier, PLC v. Louisiana State Bar Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , 2014-1162, p. 4 (La.

In\n   <em>\n    Miniclier\n   </em>\n   , the district court signed an order of appeal referencing a judgment not in the record, and only after the order of appeal was signed did the district court sign and render the judgment that Miniclier had intended to appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867163\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/171/1013/#p1015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 2014-1162 at p. 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867163\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/171/1013/#p1015\">\n    171 So.3d at 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We find that both the October 10, 2016 and October 20, 2016 judgments are properly before this Court on appeal, and we next address the merits of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Appellate courts review a grant of a motion for summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   using the same criteria district courts consider when determining if summary judgment is proper.\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v.

As a result, the version of La. C.C.P. art. 966, which became effective on January 1, 2016 applies to this motion. Summary judgment procedure is favored in Louisiana. La. C.C.P. art. 966(A)(2). \"After an opportunity for adequate discovery, a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if the motion, memorandum, and supporting documents show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact and that the mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" La. C.C.P. art. 966(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Regarding the burden of proof on summary judgment, La. C.C.P. art. 966(D)(1) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The burden of proof rests with the mover. Nevertheless, if the mover will not bear the burden of proof at trial on the issue that is before the\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-28\">\n   court on the motion for summary judgment, the mover's burden on the motion does not require him to negate all essential elements of the adverse party's claim, action, or defense, but rather to point out to the court the absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to the adverse party's claim, action, or defense. The burden is on the adverse party to produce factual support sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that the mover is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We first turn to the partial summary judgment finding that the water intrusion events on September 4, 2011 and August 28, 2012 constituted two occurrences. All parties submit that the Westchester policies define \"occurrence\" as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same harmful conditions.\" Rice Mill contends that the district court erred in considering evidence attached to Fireman's Fund's reply memorandum in violation of La. C.C.P. art. 966(B)(3). Rice Mill also argues that, even if the reply memorandum evidence is considered, genuine issues of material fact remain that preclude summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The record reflects that Fireman's Fund, in support of its motion for partial summary judgment, attached the following exhibits: (1) Rice Mill's opposition to\n   Gibbs' motion for summary judgment on consequential damages and delay damages without exhibits; (2) partial copy of Gibbs' original petition for breach of contract; (3) Rice Mill's answer to Gibbs' original petition and third party demand; (4) Rice Mill's amended reconventional demand and third party demand; (5) Westchester policy issued to Rush for the period February 1, 2011 to February 1, 2012; and (6) Westchester policy issued to Rush for the February 1, 2012 to February 1, 2013. No affidavits, deposition testimony, or discovery responses were introduced into evidence at that time. However, in filing its reply memorandum, Fireman's Fund attached as an exhibit the entirety of its previously filed opposition to Westchester's motion for summary judgment regarding number of occurrences, along with the attachments to the opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Rice Mill responded by filing a motion to strike the additional evidence, arguing that no additional documents could be filed with a reply memorandum and that the late filing of Fireman's Fund's exhibits did not allow Rice Mill time to respond to the additional documents. Fireman's Fund argued that the district court could consider the exhibits to Fireman's Fund's reply because the evidence was already placed into the record when Fireman's Fund filed its opposition to Westchester's motion for partial summary judgment regarding number of occurrences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted Rice Mill's motion to strike, but also ultimately granted partial summary judgment in Fireman's Fund's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under La. C.C.P. art. 966(D)(2), \"[t]he court may consider only those documents filed in support of or in opposition to the motion for summary judgment and shall consider any documents to which no objection is made.\" Comment (k) of La. C.C.P. art. 966 explains that \"[s]ubparagraph (D)(2) makes clear that the court can consider only those documents filed in support of or in opposition to the motion. This rule differs from Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 56(c)(3), which allows the court to consider other materials in the record.\" Subparagraph (B)(3) explicitly provides that \"[n]o additional documents may be filed with the reply memorandum.\" La. C.C.P. art. 966(B)(3). Comment (d) of La. C.C.P. art. 966 notes, \"[t]his Article continues the rule that no new documents may be filed with a reply memorandum.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The hearing transcript reveals that the district court found that Fireman's Fund was not permitted to attach exhibits to its reply memorandum. Nevertheless, the district court also stated on the hearing transcript that Fireman's Fund could \"reference\" the exhibits to its previously filed opposition to Westchester's motion, regardless of whether the exhibits were attached to Fireman's Fund's reply, because those exhibits were in the district court's record. Thus, the district court correctly found that no additional documents may be filed with the reply memorandum; however, the district court erred in determining that it could consider documents in the record, other than those documents filed in support of or in opposition to the particular motion before the district court. Fireman's Fund correctly points out that the documents it attempted to file in support of its reply were already properly placed\n   into the record as part of its exhibits to a different opposition. Nevertheless, we find no support for Fireman's Fund's argument which would allow the court to consider materials in the record beyond those filed in support of or in opposition to the motion for summary judgment before the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diversified Marine Servs., Inc. v.

Nothing in the record indicates that Rice Mill, which was aligned with Westchester on this issue, filed any memorandum in support of or in opposition to Westchester's motion. The record does not reflect that the district court ever heard or considered Westchester's motion, evidently because Westchester reached a settlement with Rice Mill.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <pre id=\"p-38\">Interior Repair $1,025,403.03 Exterior Masonry Restoration $793,708.99 Rent Concessions $145,722.50 Loss of Income/Business Reputation (Past &amp; Future) $2,790,394.00 Delay Damages $2,557,604.80 <strong>Total</strong> <strong>$7,312,833.32</strong></pre>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Fireman's Fund's and Zurich's motions arise from these alleged damages.
