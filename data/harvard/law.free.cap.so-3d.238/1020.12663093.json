For the following reasons, we hereby reverse the decision of the trial court in part, and, affirm in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Karen Poteet Bumpus and her brother, Robert Poteet, were co-owners of a closely-held\n   corporation, Triple R Development, Inc., which they inherited from their parents. Mr. Poteet died in February of 2012, and his succession was administered by his daughter, Symone Poteet. In August of 2015, over three years after the passing of her brother, Mrs. Bumpus filed a rule alleging that Mr. Poteet had misappropriated property and funds of the corporation, seeking to be declared the sole owner of the business. Ms. Poteet filed several exceptions, including an exception of no cause of action, an exception of no right of action, and an exception of prescription. The trial court granted all exceptions and dismissed the suit at Mrs. Bumpus' costs. From that decision, Mrs. Bumpus appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, Mrs. Bumpus asserts three assignments of error. She claims that the trial court erred in granting the exception of no cause of action, that the trial court erred in granting the exception of no right of action, and in granting the exception of prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    No Cause of Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mrs. Bumpus first claims that the trial court erred in granting the Poteet exception of no cause of action.

She did. In her rule for declaratory relief, Mrs. Bumpus names both the succession and Ms. Poteet, who is, in fact, the succession representative. While Mrs. Bumpus did not specifically state that the action was\n   taken against Ms. Poteet in her capacity as representative, La.Code Civ.P. art. 855 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   It is not necessary to allege the capacity of a party to sue or be sued or the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity or the legal existence of a legal entity or an organized association of persons made a party. Such procedural capacity shall be presumed, unless challenged by the dilatory exception.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mrs. Bumpus, while not meticulous in her execution, did file suit against the indispensable succession representative in this matter.

As alleged intentional misdeeds, under La.R.S. 12:1502(D), Mrs. Bumpus would have had two years from the date of the alleged act or omission to file suit, unless more than three years from the date of the alleged act had passed.

It goes without saying that Mr. Poteet could not have posthumously misappropriated corporate funds or property. Thus, any bad actions taken by him obviously occurred over three years prior to Mrs. Bumpus filing this suit.
