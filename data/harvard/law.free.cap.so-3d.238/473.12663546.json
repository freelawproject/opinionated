Brown\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a criminal appeal. Defendant, Marcus O. Cretian seeks review of his conviction of resisting a police officer with force, and his habitual offender sentence of seven years at hard labor. For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's conviction and sentence are conditionally affirmed, and the matter is remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing for a determination of whether reasonable grounds exist to doubt Defendant's mental capacity and to warrant the appointment of a sanity commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 14, 2016, Defendant was charged by bill of information with one count of resisting a police officer with force, a violation of La. R.S. 14:108.2, and one count of possession of drug paraphernalia, a violation of La. R.S. 40:1023.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State offered Defendant a plea bargain agreement on June 22, 2016-a sentence of two years and the State would not seek enhancement of the sentence under the habitual offender statute. Defendant rejected the offer. Prior to trial, on July 11, 2016, the State filed a\n   <em>\n    motion in limine\n   </em>\n   seeking to prohibit Defendant from referring, during the trial, to his possible sentencing exposure for the crime and under the habitual offender statute. The district court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 27, 2016, a six-person jury found Defendant guilty of resisting a police officer with force, but acquitted him of the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, on July 28, 2016, the State filed a habitual offender bill charging Defendant as a third felony offender.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A sentencing hearing was held on\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   August 23, 2016, and the district court sentenced Defendant to eighteen months at hard labor. At the same proceeding, Defendant entered a plea of guilty as a third felony offender in exchange for a sentence of seven years at hard labor, which was below the penalty provided for under the habitual offender statute. During the proceeding, Defendant's attorney raised the question of Defendant's mental capacity, but did not assert Defendant did not understand that he was to entering a guilty plea or motion the court for the appointment of a sanity commission. The district court accepted Defendant's plea as an habitual offender, vacated Defendant's previous sentence, and sentenced him to seven years at hard labor, with credit for time served to run concurrent with any other sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant filed a written motion entitled \"Application for Appointment of Sanity Commission to Examine Defendant and to Report on Mental Condition at the Time of the Alleged Offense, and for a Hearing as to his Present Capacity to Proceed\" (\"motion seeking appointment of sanity commission\") that was date-stamped October 4, 2016, by the clerk of court's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 19, 2017, Defendant orally sought an appeal, and on February 22, 2017, a written motion for appeal was filed and granted the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   More than four months after the filing of the motion seeking appointment of sanity commission and more than one month after the filing of the motion for appeal, on March 30, 2017, a hearing on Defendant's motion seeking appointment of sanity commission was held. The district court denied Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Louisiana State Trooper Alex Nezgoginsky (\"Trooper Nezgoginsky\"), a fifteen-year law enforcement veteran, was assigned to the French Quarter Task Force. On February 22, 2016, Trooper Nezgoginsky participated in the arrest of Defendant in the 800 block of Bourbon Street. Trooper Nezgoginsky was on foot patrol on Bourbon Street with his partner, Huey McCartney (\"Trooper McCartney\"). Trooper Nezgoginsky and Trooper McCartney received a tip regarding illegal activity occurring at 808 Bourbon Street while on the corner of Bourbon and St. Ann. The tip was from the owner of the property. The troopers were about fifteen feet away from Defendant who was sitting on the steps of the property. As they approached, Trooper Nezgoginsky noticed \"no trespassing\" signs were posted on the entrance outside the apartment where Defendant was sitting. The troopers, dressed in uniform, initiated a conversation with Defendant. Defendant quickly got up, pushed Trooper McCartney, and ran. Trooper Nezgoginsky grabbed Defendant by the shirt; however, Defendant broke free and continued running toward the 900 block of Bourbon. Trooper Nezgoginsky told Defendant to stop, but he continued running. Trooper Nezgoginsky deployed his taser, but the taser hooks had no contact so Defendant did not receive the full\n   effect of the taser charge. Defendant continued to run. As Defendant approached a trash can on the sidewalk, he stopped; and as Trooper Nezgoginsky advanced, Defendant pushed the approximately sixty pound trash can toward the trooper. Trooper Nezgoginsky testified the trash can hit him on the left side of his leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On re-direct, Trooper Nezgoginsky read his report of the trash can incident stating, \"Cretian ran down Bourbon Street towards the main street and pushed the metal trash can to hit my left leg.\" Trooper Nezgoginsky testified he deployed his taser a second time. Again, the taser did not work. Trooper Nezgoginsky continued explaining that after Defendant got into a fighting stance, he grabbed him by the front of his shirt and forced him to the ground. As Trooper Nezgoginsky continued to give Defendant verbal commands to put his hands behind his back, Defendant attempted to stand up and started kicking at Troopers Nezgoginsky and McCartney. Trooper McCartney detonated his taser to stun Defendant and the arrest was accomplished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Trooper McCartney, who had been a Louisiana State Trooper since September 2008, testified that as he and Trooper Nezgoginsky approached Defendant, they advised him to drop what he was holding and show his hands. Trooper McCartney asked Defendant whether he lived in the apartment upon whose steps he was sitting. Defendant did not answer, but got up aggressively and pushed Trooper McCartney in his shoulder. Defendant ran down the street, and the troopers chased him. Trooper McCartney recalled that Trooper Nezgoginsky attempted to tase Defendant twice without success. Although Trooper McCartney testified he was behind Defendant and Trooper Nezgoginsky, he stated he saw Defendant push the trash can into the path of his partner. At the end of the chase, Trooper McCartney detonated his taser and it connected. Trooper McCartney explained he stunned Defendant because Defendant, while on the ground, would not allow the troopers to handcuff him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Molly Thomas (\"Ms. Thomas\"), an investigator employed by defense counsel, testified she took photographs of 800 block of Bourbon Street. Ms. Thomas stated there were no signs relating to loitering on the building. Additionally, she noted there were thirteen surveillance cameras in the area of 808 Bourbon Street. On cross-examination by the State, it was determined that Ms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thomas was unaware if the surveillance cameras were in place or functioning on February 22, 2016, the date of Defendant's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ERRORS PATENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In accordance with La. C.Cr.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed by this court for errors patent on the face of the record. A review of the record indicates two errors patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The first error patent is the district court erred in failing to consider Defendant's motion seeking appointment of sanity commission on the merits before granting Defendant's appeal. The statutes governing a defendant's mental capacity to proceed are set forth in La. C.Cr.P. art. 641,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Louisiana Code Criminal Procedure Article 642 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendant's mental incapacity to proceed may be raised at any time by the defense, the district attorney, or the court. When the question of the defendant's mental incapacity to proceed is raised, there shall be no further steps in the criminal prosecution, except the institution of prosecution, until the defendant is found to have the mental capacity to proceed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Louisiana Courts recognize as an error patent a trial court's failure to comply with La.

Defendant, orally motioned for an appeal on January 19, 2017, and on February 22, 2017, a written motion for appeal was filed and granted the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   At the March 30, 2017 hearing on the motion seeking appointment of sanity commission, the district court denied the motion but did not consider the merits of the motion. The district court stated in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   THE COURT: And I've got to be honest with you, we've done some independent research because I thought to myself, how does the Court undo what has already happened in this case? In other words, there was a trial. The question becomes whether or not he was incompetent to proceed at the time of the trial because now we're past the trial, and I can't find anything in the law book that allows me to. A, give you a competency examination at this point, and, B, more importantly, if I gave it to you, what would the remedy be? It's only about competency to proceed. We already proceeded. It would be competency to proceed to do what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court has recognized that the issue of mental capacity\n   to proceed may be raised after conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Seals\n   </em>\n   , in addressing whether a retrospective determination of defendant's capacity to stand trial may be made from the evidence in the record, the Supreme Court set forth the applicable law when a defendant's mental capacity is raised and opined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   At the outset, we note the longstanding precept that a defendant does not have an absolute right to the appointment of a sanity commission simply upon request.\n   <em>\n    State v.

To determine a defendant's capacity, we are first guided by La.Code Crim. Proc. arts. 642, 643, and 647. As a general matter, La.Code Crim. Proc. art. 642 allows \"[t]he defendant's mental incapacity to proceed [to] be raised at any time by the defense, the district attorney, or the court.\" The Article additionally requires that \"[w]hen the question of the defendant's mental incapacity to proceed is raised, there shall be no further steps in the criminal prosecution ... until the defendant is found to have the mental capacity to proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11483389\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/750/832/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Next, Article 643 provides in pertinent part, \"The court shall order a mental examination of the defendant when it has reasonable ground to doubt the defendant's mental capacity to proceed....\" Last, if a defendant's mental incapacity has been properly raised, the proceedings can only continue under La.Code Crim. Proc. art. 647 which provides:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The issue of the defendant's mental capacity to proceed shall be determined by the court in a contradictory hearing. The report of the sanity commission is admissible in evidence at the hearing, and members of the sanity commission may be called as witnesses by the court, the defense, or the district attorney....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   This protection, however, is not to say that every time a defendant feigns incapacity the court must order a full-blown sanity commission. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Berry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9550418\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/391/406/#p411\">\n    391 So.2d 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 411 (La.1980), we firmly held that the trial court is granted great discretion in determining if a defendant should be afforded a mental examination to determine capacity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Indeed, where a trial judge finds enough evidence to doubt a defendant's capacity, the court may order the defendant be examined by a single psychiatrist to satisfy requirements of La.Code Crim. Proc. art. 643. There is no need for a sanity commission to be appointed each time capacity of a defendant is questioned. That being said, questions regarding a defendant's capacity must be deemed by the court to be\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   and in good faith before a court will consider if there are \"reasonable grounds\" to doubt capacity. Where there is a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   question raised regarding a defendant's capacity, the failure to observe procedures to protect a defendant's right not to be tried or convicted while incompetent to stand trial deprives him of his due process right to a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    Drope\n   </em>\n   at 172,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11643095\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/162/#p171\">\n    95 S.Ct. 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Pate v.

In\n   <em>\n    Dorsey\n   </em>\n   , police officers saw the defendant and another man exit an alleyway. When the men saw the police officers, they separated and the defendant walked quickly toward a gate. The officers identified themselves as police and ordered the defendant to stop. The defendant ignored the officers' instructions, quickened his pace, and entered the gate. One of the officers grabbed the defendant's shoulder to detain him. The defendant reached back and hit the officer in the head. As the defendant struggled with one officer, the other officer entered the gate. The defendant squared off against the officers and was tackled by the second officer. While trying to handcuff the defendant as they were on the ground, the defendant hit both officers.

In\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   , officers knocked on the defendant's dorm room and identified themselves as police officers. The defendant was suspected of domestic violence. When the defendant did not respond to the officers' knock, they had a residential advisor unlock the defendant's door. Once the officers entered the dorm suite, they again identified themselves as police officers and knocked on the defendant's bedroom door numerous times before he opened the door. The officers advised him he was under arrest and read him his rights. After placing the handcuff on one of the defendant's wrists, the defendant jerked his arm loose and refused to allow the police to handcuff him. Another officer intervened and the defendant was eventually handcuffed and arrested.

We find he fails to do so. The record indicates the first time Defendant mentioned his lack of mental capacity was at the habitual offender proceeding. Further, the State informed Defendant, starting with the first plea offer, of the possibility of being charged as a habitual offender and Defendant rejected the offer. Following, in July 2016, the State filed a \"\n   <em>\n    Motion in Limine\n   </em>\n   to Prohibit the Defense from Referring to Possible Sentences either for the Crime or Under the Habitual Offender Statute ( La.

The minute entry of July 11, 2017, indicates a hearing was held on the State's\n   <em>\n    motion in limine\n   </em>\n   , and the district court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   This assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error No. 4: Lack of Mental Capacity\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Defendant argues he lacked the mental capacity to have been tried.
