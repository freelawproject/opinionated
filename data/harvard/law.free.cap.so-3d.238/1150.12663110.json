Sedric Sutton was indicted by a grand jury in Washington County on two counts: (1) possession of a controlled substance\n   with intent to distribute and (2) possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. After a trial by jury, Sutton was convicted on the first count and acquitted on the second. The trial court sentenced Sutton as a habitual offender to fifteen years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. He now appeals his conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. All of the State's evidence in the case stemmed from an unconstitutional search pursuant to an invalid warrant which failed adequately to describe the property to be seized by the executing officers. Pretrial, the court denied Sutton's motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search. After review, we reverse Sutton's conviction and sentence and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. On July 15, 2014, a confidential informant (\"CI\") told law-enforcement officers at the Washington County Sheriff's Office that \"stolen items\" were located at 331 Muscadine Street in Greenville, Mississippi ( \"Muscadine house\"). Based on the information provided by the CI, Officers Dwight Donham and Charlton Smith prepared an Affidavit for Search Warrant and presented it to Washington County Justice Court Judge Laverne Holmes-Carter. Judge Holmes-Carter issued a search warrant for \"stolen items\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the Muscadine house at 331 Muscadine Street in Greenville, Mississippi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. The same day, law-enforcement officers-including Officer Smith-executed the warrant on the Muscadine house. Upon entering, the officers detained and searched Sedric Sutton. As a result of the search of Sutton and the Muscadine house, the officers found sixty pills, $4,995 in cash, a handgun, and two digital scales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. While conducting a safety check, Officer Christopher Surf searched Sutton's right, front pocket and discovered sixty small, yellow pills\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in a clear plastic bag. Sutton, who testified in his own defense at trial, admitted to possession of the pills but argued that he had them solely for his personal use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Beyond the pills, the officers found additional evidence in the Muscadine house. Officers discovered $4,995 in cash in Sutton's black waist pack. Officer Smith also discovered a 9 mm handgun in a black holster \"located inside the wall in between the threshold of the dining room and the living room area.\" Investigator Cedric Adams testified that the handgun was in plain view. Additionally, Officer Smith found two digital scales-one small and one large-in the dining room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. After the officers completed the search, Sutton was taken into custody and charged with possession of a controlled substance under Mississippi Code Section 41-29-139(c)(3)(A) -a misdemeanor, given that he had less than 100 pills. A Washington County grand jury indicted Sutton as a habitual offender for possession of a controlled substance with intent under\n   Mississippi Code Section 41-29-139(a)(1) and for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Pretrial, Sutton moved to suppress the evidence from the execution of the warrant. Sutton attacked the warrant on two separate grounds: (1) that the underlying facts and circumstances on which the warrant was based were unreliable and (2) that the warrant failed sufficiently to describe the property to be seized. The trial court held a hearing on Sutton's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. At the hearing, Officer Donham testified that the CI had informed him that the Muscadine house was a warehouse for stolen goods and that he had sold stolen items there. The CI, according to Donham, claimed that he had seen the stolen items in the house two days before the arrest warrant was executed. On cross-examination, Sutton's counsel engaged in the following exchange with Officer Donham:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Q. Now, [the CI] did not give you any specific items whatsoever at Mr. Sutton's address, did he? Isn't that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A. He said there were numerous things there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q. Numerous things. A warehouse of stolen stuff?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q. But he did not give you a single itemized piece of stolen property, did he?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Officer Donham also claimed the CI had given him reliable information in the past and that the CI had personal knowledge-unknown to the public-of a number of local, recent house burglaries. Officer Donham recounted that the CI had told him of a residence at which the CI had sold a \"Barnett cross bow.\" Upon visiting the residence, Officer Donham had recovered the crossbow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 10. After consideration of the testimony and arguments of counsel, the trial court denied the motion to suppress. From the bench, the trial court explained its finding: \"[T]he [c]ourt, having reviewed the underlying facts and circumstances, finds that there is sufficient factual basis presented upon which the magistrate could have verified the v[e]racity or the reliability of the confidential informant.\" In its written order, the trial court found that the information in the affidavit seeking the warrant \"described the things to be seized with sufficient particularity to satisfy [the] Fourth Amendment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 11. Sutton was tried before a jury on May 26, 2016. At trial, Sutton stipulated to his status as a felon. The jury found Sutton guilty of the first count, possession with intent, and acquitted him of the second count, possession of a firearm. On June 1, 2016, the trial court sentenced Sutton to a term of fifteen years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections pursuant to Sections 41-29-139(b)(4)(C) and 99-19-81.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12. Sutton now appeals. Sutton,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , and his counsel raise a number of issues. Because our analysis of the suppression issue is dispositive, we need not address Sutton's other claims of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13. \" 'In reviewing a magistrate's finding of probable cause, this Court does not make a de novo determination of probable cause, but only determines\n   if there was a substantial basis for the magistrate's determination of probable cause.' \"\n   <em>\n    Roach v.

Sutton argues that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress the evidence seized in the search. While we find that the facts and circumstances undergirding the warrant were sufficient to support a determination of probable cause as to \"stolen items,\" we agree with Sutton that the warrant failed adequately to describe the property to be seized. Thus, we find that Sutton's constitutional rights under both the Mississippi Constitution and the United States Constitution were infringed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 15.

Under a totality-of-the-circumstances review, it is evident that there was a substantial basis for Judge Holmes-Carter's determination that the search warrant's language concerning \"stolen items\" was supported by sufficiently reliable information. The affidavit before Judge Holmes-Carter claimed that the CI had shown Officer Donham \"several locations in Washington County where stolen items from recent house burglaries were taken and sold ... and described details of the burglaries that were not public knowledge.\" The CI also knew the brand name-Barnett-of a stolen crossbow that Investigator Donham later recovered. According to the affidavit, the informant demonstrated his knowledge of these burglaries on July 15, 2014, the same day that Judge Holmes-Carter issued the arrest warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 21. Further, as in\n   <em>\n    Roach\n   </em>\n   , Officer Donham testified that the CI had provided reliable information to law-enforcement authorities in the past. The following exchange occurred during Donham's examination at the suppression hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. Did you have any contact with that confidential informant before that day?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A.

Given that the CI proved reliable information on the same day that the search warrant was issued and that the CI had given reliable information in the past, the information supporting the warrants was sufficiently reliable.

At the outset of this analysis, we address the trial court's written order. In it, the trial court cited\n   <em>\n    Logan v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11174329\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/773/338/\">\n    773 So.2d 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2000), for the proposition that the information in the Affidavit for Search Warrant \"described the things to be seized with sufficient particularity to satisfy [the] Fourth Amendment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 26. Upon review, we find that the trial court erred here in this conclusion for a number of reasons. First, the Affidavit for Search Warrant was not incorporated into the issued search warrant and, therefore, did not describe the items to be seized with any particularity for the executing officers. Second, even considering the Affidavit for Search Warrant, it does not describe the items to be seized with any more particularity than \"stolen items.\" Third, while the\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   Court did not record the specific language at issue in the search warrant,\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the instant facts as the items sought in that search were particular: \"... any documents relating to vehicles rebuilt or repaired by Logan at his shop facility....\"\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11174329\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/773/338/\">\n    773 So.2d at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fourth, the trial court's order did not analyze the description of the things to be seized in the warrant under Article 3, Section 23, of our State Constitution, which has been held to \"provide[ ] greater protections to citizens than ... the United States Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9280653\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/866/422/#p425\">\n    866 So.2d at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 27. With the trial court's order addressed, we now turn to the description of the things to be seized in the warrant. Here, the description of \"stolen items\" was wholly inadequate to inform the officers executing the search as to which items in the Muscadine house were to be seized. The description \"stolen items\" is even less descriptive than the conclusory description\n   \"stolen property.\" There simply was no means for the executing officers to distinguish any stolen items from any items that rightfully belonged in the Muscadine house. Indeed, after the search, Sutton had to reclaim a number of his items that were confiscated from the Muscadine house as a result of the warrant's execution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 28. Also, despite the claims that the Muscadine house was a \"warehouse\" for stolen goods, the warrant should have included a more particularized description of at least some of the property to be seized-especially since it is clear from the record that it could have.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Fuccillo\n   </em>\n   , pursuant to warrants authorizing the seizure of \"[c]artons of women's clothing,\" the FBI seized, among other items, a number of cartons of clothing from several warehouses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1369091\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/808/173/#p176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1369091\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/808/173/#p176\">\n    at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While there are clear distinctions between legitimate warehouses, such as those in\n   <em>\n    Fuccillo\n   </em>\n   , and criminal \"warehouses,\" the reasoning undergirding the\n   <em>\n    Fuccillo\n   </em>\n   decision provides us guidance. Here, the Affidavit for Search Warrant provided that the CI had told officers that he \"ha[d] been to the [Muscadine house] on numerous occasions and seen stolen items in the residence.\" In fact, Officer Donham testified that the CI \"had given us information that he had rendered stolen property at that location before. He had taken stolen property there to dispose of.\" Also, the CI demonstrated that he had sufficient memory recall to remember the brand names of certain property that he stole. The CI recalled that he had stolen a \"Barnett\" crossbow that later was recovered by Officer Donham. After review of the record, we are convinced that law-enforcement officers could have provided a more detailed description of the things to be seized beyond the conclusory language of \"stolen items.\" As the information was available to them, the officers should have included it in the warrant. Indeed, both the United States Constitution and our State Constitution required them to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The warrant's drug-related language was not supported by probable cause.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 30. The search warrant additionally was invalid as there was no substantial basis for the inclusion of the language related to drug activity. While not raised by the parties, upon review, we find that there was no probable cause to issue a search warrant for any illegal drug activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 31. Again, \"the information necessary to establish probable cause 'must be information reasonably leading an officer to believe that, then and there, contraband or evidence material to a criminal investigation would be found.' \"\n   <em>\n    Petti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7442684\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/666/754/#p758\">\n    666 So.2d at 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rooks v.

The warrant listed the drug-related items to be seized, yet the record-pretrial, at trial and on appeal-is devoid of any allegation that either the issuing judge or the officers had reason to believe that the Muscadine house contained drugs. The CI related only activity about theft. Also,\n   at the hearing on the motion to suppress, Investigator Donham did not claim that law-enforcement officers had sought the warrant due to drug-related activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 33.

As such, the exclusionary rule applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 37. Here too, the warrant was so facially deficient that the executing officers could not have presumed it to be valid. The executing officers did not have any way to distinguish stolen items from property that was not stolen.

Also, it is important to reiterate that, under the facts of this case, the inclusion of the drug-related language in the warrant does not somehow validate the search.

He had assisted Officer Donham in the preparation of both the Underlying Facts and Circumstances as well as the Affidavit for Search Warrant. He knew that there was no particular description of the stolen property in the underlying facts or affidavit. He knew a better description was available from the informant. He knew there was no probable cause for the drug language in the warrant. This knowledge, in and of itself, should have raised a red flag as to the validity of the warrant. The good-faith exception is to protect those who act in good faith upon a seemingly valid warrant. It is not to protect those who continue forward with full knowledge of the insufficiencies of the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 40. Also of note, the State does not raise the argument on appeal that the search was valid because of the drug-related language. In fact, the State conceded at trial that the search warrant was executed only for \"stolen items.\" Thus, the exclusionary rule applies to this case and prohibits the introduction into evidence of the tangible items seized during the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 41.

In contrast, Sutton was the subject of an ongoing police investigation, and the search warrant against him was supported by probable cause. The remaining case cited by the dissent also is distinguishable as the dispositive issue there was whether or not the evidence was legally sufficient to support the verdict-not whether or not certain evidence should have been suppressed.\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.

Accordingly, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 45. This Court has held repeatedly that, when evidence against a criminal defendant is insufficient to sustain a conviction in the absence of the admission of illegally obtained evidence, the correct remedy is to reverse and render.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook v.

In the present case, had the trial court sustained the defendant's motion to exclude the wrongfully seized evidence, that court also should have dismissed the charge with prejudice, as the State had adduced no other evidence of his guilt. Accordingly, nothing remains for the trial court to do and the proper course for this Court is to reverse and render judgment for the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   KING, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
