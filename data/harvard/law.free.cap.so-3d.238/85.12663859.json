Edmondson (\"the husband\") has filed a petition for the writ of mandamus directing the Mobile Circuit Court (\"the trial court\") set aside its March 8, 2017, order staying the divorce action involving the husband and Karen S. Edmondson (\"the wife\"). The wife has answered the husband's petition and joins in his request that the trial court be ordered to set aside the March 8, 2017, order. The facts underlying the issuance of the March 8, 2017, order are taken from the husband's petition, the wife's answer to that petition, and the materials appended to the husband's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the first day of the divorce trial, the husband was called as a witness. Counsel for the wife asked the husband whether he had had sexual relations with a woman not his wife more than 365 days before the\n   date of trial. The husband's counsel objected, and the husband asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The trial court stopped the trial, imposed a temporary stay on the proceedings, and asked the parties to file letter briefs explaining the parties' positions regarding the husband's right to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when questioned regarding any allegedly adulterous relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After considering the parties' letter briefs, the trial court entered an order staying the divorce action on March 8, 2017. The order explains that the trial court had\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"determine[d] from the subject of the question [posed to the husband at trial] that the current divorce proceeding and any potential criminal proceedings would be parallel proceedings, and the [husband's] Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination in any such criminal proceedings would be threatened if the divorce proceeding is not stayed in accordance with the provisions and standards set forth in [\n   <em>\n    Ex parte] Rawls\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8327312\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/953/374/\">\n    953 So.2d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Therefore, the trial of the divorce is stayed pending resolution of any criminal charges against [the husband] and said charges against [the husband], if any, are adjudicated at the trial level.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its order, the trial court set the case for a status hearing on September 26, 2017, \"for the parties to provide the [trial] court with an update on any potential criminal charges against [the husband] at that time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The husband timely filed this petition for the writ of mandamus. He seeks a writ requiring the trial court to lift the stay it imposed on the parties' divorce action. He asserts, and the wife agrees, that neither party requested or desires a stay of the divorce action.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \" 'A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that is available when a trial court has exceeded its discretion.\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Fidelity Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9187064\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/893/1116/#p1119\">\n    893 So.2d 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1119 (Ala. 2004).

Our supreme court has explained that, in order to determine whether a stay of a civil proceeding based on a parallel criminal proceeding to protect a party's privilege against self-incrimination is warranted, three issues must be examined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"(1) whether the civil proceeding and the criminal proceeding are parallel,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Weems\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11848613\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/711/1011/#p1013\">\n    711 So.2d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1013 (Ala. 1998) ; (2) whether the moving party's Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination will be threatened if the civil proceeding is not stayed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Windom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11251455\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/763/946/#p950\">\n    763 So.2d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 950 (Ala. 2000) ; and (3) whether the requirements of the balancing test set out in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Baugh\n   </em>\n   , 530 So.2d [238,] 244 [ (Ala. 1988) ], and\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Ebbers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9281868\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/871/776/#p789\">\n    871 So.2d 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 789 (Ala. 2003), are met.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Rawls\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8327312\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/953/374/\">\n    953 So.2d at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Both the husband and the wife contend first that the trial court could not stay the divorce action because neither party requested the stay. However, because a trial court has the inherent power to control litigation in its courtroom and to manage its docket, we must reject that contention. The husband's assertion of his privilege against self-incrimination alerted the trial court to the potential need for a stay of the divorce action. Thus, we cannot agree that the trial court was not permitted to consider staying the action\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Secondly, the parties focus their arguments on the second issue set out in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Rawls\n   </em>\n   -whether the husband's privilege against self-incrimination is threatened by the divorce action. The parties agree that the question that prompted the trial court to enter its stay order pertained to alleged acts committed more than one year before the date of trial. They disagree, however, on whether the husband can be prosecuted for any act of adultery that was committed more than one year ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The wife contends that the husband may not assert his privilege against self-incrimination for adulterous activities occurring more than 365 days before the date of any question regarding those activities.

In\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   , we rejected a claim that a husband's constitutional privilege against self-incrimination was violated when he was required to testify about allegedly adulterous \"acts occurring beyond the one-year statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9532161\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/422/296/\">\n    422 So.2d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Handley\n   </em>\n   , we explained that, because \"any testimony about their sexual relations would have related to instances that occurred beyond the one-year statute of limitations for adultery,\" the witnesses \"were not entitled to the privilege against self-incrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Handley\n   </em>\n   , 460 So.2d at 165. The witnesses in\n   <em>\n    Handley\n   </em>\n   had married each other more than one year before the trial on a third-party custody matter,\n   so they could no longer have been committing the crime of adultery, making the opinion less analogous to the facts in the present case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The facts related in the opinion in\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   do not reveal whether the husband and his paramour were still engaged in a relationship or whether that relationship had ended.\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9532161\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/422/296/\">\n    422 So.2d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, based on\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Moore\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   , we agree with the wife that the husband's right against self-incrimination is not implicated by questions regarding allegedly adulterous acts that occurred more than one year before the date of trial because the husband can no longer be criminally prosecuted for those acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The only ground given by the trial court for the stay was the possibility that the husband's privilege against self-incrimination would be threatened by the divorce action if it were not stayed. Because the husband may not be prosecuted for any allegedly adulterous acts that he committed more than one year ago, he is \"not entitled to the privilege against self-incrimination\" with regard to questions about those acts.\n   <em>\n    Handley\n   </em>\n   , 460 So.2d at 165. If the husband is not entitled to assert his privilege against self-incrimination with regard to the questions posed by the wife, his privilege will not be threatened by the divorce proceeding. Therefore, the trial court's reason for imposing the stay is insufficient to support it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Furthermore, the wife also asserts that the stay, which suspends the divorce action indefinitely pending a prosecution that is unlikely to materialize,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   is immoderate. The wife specifically complains that the stay will leave her and the husband in state of \"legal limbo\" and prevent them from getting a divorce for as long as the husband maintains a relationship with his current paramour. As our supreme court has held: \"[An] indefinite stay ordered by the trial court, with no stated justification for it, is immoderate and, consequently, beyond the scope of the trial court's discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte American Family Care, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7014646\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/91/682/#p683\">\n    91 So.3d at 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We have rejected the stated basis for the trial court's stay, and the stay, as worded, is clearly indefinite, preventing the proceedings in the divorce action from resuming until such time as a criminal prosecution of the husband, if any such prosecution is instituted, is concluded. The stay is therefore \"beyond the scope of the trial court's discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7014646\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/91/682/#p683\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the above-stated reasons, we grant the husband's petition and order the trial court to vacate its March 8, 2017, order staying the divorce action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   PETITION GRANTED; WRIT ISSUED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thompson, P.J., and Pittman, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Donaldson, J., concurs in the result, without writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Moore, J., recuses himself.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The wife admits that the husband is entitled to assert his privilege against self-incrimination to any question relating to acts occurring within the year before the question is asked.
