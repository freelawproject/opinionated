O. Box 2333, Marrero, LA 70073-2333, COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT/APPELLANT, OLIVER LEWIS\n </attorneys>\n <judges id=\"p-7\">\n  (Court composed of Judge Terri F. Love, Judge Joy Cossich Lobrano, Judge, Dennis R. Bagneris, Pro Tempore)\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Judge Terri F. Love\n   Oliver Lewis was convicted of aggravated rape and unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling. On appeal, Mr. Lewis contends he cannot receive adequate appellate review without being able to review all of the jury challenges. After reviewing, we find that numerous challenges for cause were exercised off-the-record. To ensure Mr. Lewis meaningful appellate review, we remand the matter to determine whether any documentation created contemporaneous to the trial court's rulings excusing the jurors exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The evidence underlying Mr. Lewis' convictions is not relevant to the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following his indictment on charges of aggravated rape and aggravated burglary, Mr. Lewis entered not guilty pleas, but a jury found him guilty of aggravated rape and returned the responsive verdict of unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling on the burglary count. The trial court denied Mr. Lewis' ensuing motion for new trial and imposed consecutive terms of life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence and six years imprisonment at hard labor. The trial court granted Mr. Lewis' motion for an out-of-time appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Lewis filed a pro se, handwritten, motion for new trial, upon which the trial court failed to rule before imposing his sentence. However, before the trial court sentenced Mr. Lewis, it inquired whether there existed \"any other motions outstanding\" and Mr. Lewis' counsel responded in the negative. Mr. Lewis then interrupted and verbally protested his innocence, while making no reference to the pending motion. Under these circumstances, the technical failure to comply with La. C.Cr.P. art. 853 does not warrant intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   There are no other errors patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     VOIR DIRE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Lewis maintains that the absence of a transcript of portions of the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , which occurred off-the-record, including multiple rulings excusing jurors, denied him meaningful appellate review and requires that this Court reverse his convictions and remand the case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The instant case presents an issue similar to that encountered in\n   <em>\n    State v. Handy\n   </em>\n   , 16-1071 (La. App. 4 Cir. 9/13/17),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12382923\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/1182/\">\n    226 So.3d 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which this Court reversed the defendant's convictions and sentences based on the incomplete record of\n   <em>\n    voir dire.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Handy\n   </em>\n   , this Court considered a\n   case in which the court reporter could not provide a transcript of an in-chambers proceeding during which peremptory and cause challenges had been exercised because her computer had malfunctioned. The defendant's trial counsel certified that the defense had exhausted its peremptory challenges. The record reflected that the defense challenged potential juror 20 for cause and the trial court denied the cause challenge; in addition, the State challenged potential juror 21 for cause, which the trial court granted over defense objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This Court reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial, observing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   that the discussions of the jury challenges are not available and the record does not contain any documentation, i.e., minute entries, jury strike sheet-from which it can be determined whether there was a basis for the challenge for cause that the defense brought and was improperly denied by the trial court, thereby causing the defense to exercise a peremptory challenge against a juror. The record does not contain enough information for defendant to effectively challenge the denial of his challenge for cause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12382923\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/1182/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 16-1071, p. 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12382923\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/1182/\">\n    226 So.3d at 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following this Court's disposition in\n   <em>\n    Handy\n   </em>\n   , the State sought rehearing to supplement the record with the trial court's jury panel sheet, which was submitted with a\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   after this Court's decision, and a full transcript of the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   conducted on May 19, 2011. This Court denied rehearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   However, the Supreme Court granted writs in\n   <em>\n    Handy\n   </em>\n   with the following order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-22\">\n   This matter is remanded to the court of appeal for supplementation of the record with the full transcript of the voir dire proceedings, the per curiam of the district court and the juror strike sheets, and for briefing, argument and opinion on defendant's assignments of error regarding voir dire in light of the newly supplemented material.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court questioned the jurors before excusing them. Thus, presumably they were not removed pursuant to a joint motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Given these facts, the Supreme Court's recent holding in\n   <em>\n    Handy\n   </em>\n   , and to afford Mr. Lewis meaningful appellate review, we remand the matter to the trial court to determine whether any documentation created contemporaneous to the trial court's rulings excusing the jurors exists.
