State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9897233\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/90/308/\">\n    90 So.2d 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1956) and later formalized in Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.691. We reverse the trial court's order denying bond, and remand with instructions to immediately reconsider Ruiz's motion for supersedeas bond and, if appropriate, to set reasonable conditions of release pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ruiz was arrested in August 2015 and charged with, inter alia, three felonies: two counts of battery on a law enforcement officer and one count of resisting an officer with violence. Ruiz was released pretrial on bond and remained out of custody on pretrial release without incident for more than two years during the pendency of the prosecution. Ruiz alleged, without dispute from the State, that during this two-year period he attended court on each occasion his appearance was required and did not violate any conditions of his pretrial release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 28, 2017, following a jury trial, Ruiz was convicted of one count of battery on a law enforcement officer, one count of simple battery, and one count of resisting an officer with violence. Following the verdict, the trial court permitted Ruiz to remain out of custody and on house arrest pending sentencing, scheduled to be held two months later. While awaiting sentencing, Ruiz appeared in court on three separate occasions as directed, and did not violate any conditions of his post-trial/pre-sentencing release. During this time Ruiz asserts that he also completed an anger management course and attended alcoholics anonymous several times per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In advance of the sentencing hearing, Ruiz submitted to a forensic psychological\n   examination. The psychologist noted Ruiz was cooperative, mild-mannered and respectful. At the conclusion of his examination and evaluation, the psychologist indicated that Ruiz presented a low probability of future violence, low probability of serious physical harm, and low risk on both the clinical and future risk management scales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A sentencing hearing was held on January 25, 2018, where the defense requested a sentence of probation. Judge Stacy Glick sentenced Ruiz to 364 days in the Dade County Jail. In imposing this sentence, the trial judge noted that Ruiz was neither a danger to the community nor likely to reoffend. The trial judge also denied Ruiz's previously-filed motion for new trial, which raised eight separate errors, each of which Ruiz contended warranted a new trial. At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, Ruiz was taken into custody and the trial court appointed the Office of the Public Defender to represent Ruiz on appeal. The following day, counsel filed a motion for supersedeas bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The hearing on the motion for supersedeas bond was held on February 1, 2018. Following that hearing, Judge Glick entered an order denying the motion and adopted, as her basis for so ruling, the contemporaneous oral findings she made at the February 1 hearing. The transcript of that hearing reveals the following findings made by the trial judge as the basis for denying the motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The reason that you're still there [in custody] is because the jury found you guilty. You were facing up to 11 years in state prison. My initial sentence was going to be higher than I gave you 364 [days in jail-] based on the wishes of the officers. [The officers] believe that you should have gotten more. I did not give you the maximum. I didn't even give you close to the max. I gave you 364. You asked me why you're here. I heard the facts of the case and that's why you're here. You were found guilty. At this time I am going to deny the motion for supersedeas bond.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It would appear, from the statements made by the trial judge, that she denied the motion for bond pending appeal for two reasons: (1) the jury found Ruiz guilty; and (2) she already gave Ruiz a \"break\" by sentencing him to only 364 days in the Dade County Jail, a sentence well below the statutory maximum and less than the sentence requested by the police officers in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We will not belabor the point that neither of these findings serves as a proper basis to deny a motion for bond pending appeal. Indeed, and as Ruiz's motion for review cogently observes, the first \"reason\" necessarily applies to every single defendant requesting a supersedeas bond. Were they not already found guilty they would not be seeking a bond pending appeal. As to the second \"reason,\" we presume that the trial judge fashioned a sentence she determined to be appropriate given the circumstances of the case and the background of the defendant. There is simply no support for the proposition that, because the trial judge's sentence was below the maximum, or less than that requested by the victim, the defendant received a \"break,\" for which he forfeited any valid consideration of a motion for bond pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rule 3.691 guides the trial court's consideration of a motion for bond pending appeal, and provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) When Authorized.\n   </strong>\n   All persons who have been adjudicated guilty of the commission of any offense, not capital, may be released, pending review of the conviction, at the discretion of either the trial or appellate court, applying the principles enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Younghans v.

However, in no case shall bail be granted if such person has previously been convicted of a felony, the commission of which occurred prior to the commission of the subsequent felony, and the person's civil rights have not been restored or if other felony charges are pending against the person and probable cause has been found that the person has committed the felony or felonies at the time the request for bail is made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Written Findings.\n   </strong>\n   In any case in which the court has the discretion to release the defendant pending review of the conviction and, after the defendant's conviction, denies release, it shall state in writing its reasons for the denial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) Review of Denial.\n   </strong>\n   An order by a trial court denying bail to a person pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (a) may be reviewed by motion to the appellate court and the motion shall be advanced on the calendar of the appellate court for expeditious review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    (d) Conditions of Release.\n   </strong>\n   If the defendant is released after conviction and on appeal, the condition shall be: (1) the defendant will duly prosecute the appeal; (2) the defendant will surrender himself or herself in execution of the judgment or sentence on its being affirmed or modified or on the appeal being dismissed; or in case the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial, the defendant will appear in the court to which the cause may be remanded for a new trial, that the defendant will appear in the court to which the cause may be remanded and submit to the orders and process thereof and will not depart the jurisdiction of the court without leave.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    (e) Approval of Bond.\n   </strong>\n   The court shall approve the sufficiency and adequacy of the bond, its security, and sureties, prior to the release of the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The principles of\n   <em>\n    Younghans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9897233\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/90/308/\">\n    90 So.2d at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , are expressly incorporated into rule 3.691, requiring as a threshold that \"the appeal is taken in good faith, on grounds not frivolous but fairly debatable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9897233\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/90/308/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Fla.
