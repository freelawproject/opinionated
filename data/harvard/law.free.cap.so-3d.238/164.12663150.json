Const.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Bar proposes comprehensively amending rule 4-7.22 (Lawyer Referral Services), and amending or deleting five other rules as a result of those amendments. The Bar's petition stems from\n   <em>\n    In re Amendments to Rule Regulating the Florida Bar 4-7.22-Lawyer Referral Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847507\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/779/\">\n    175 So.3d 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2015), where the Court rejected amendments to rule 4-7.22 proposed by the Bar and directed the Bar to propose amendments that \"preclude Florida lawyers from accepting referrals from any lawyer referral service that is not owned or operated by a member of the Bar.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847507\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/779/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847507\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/779/\">\n    at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court in that case found that the Bar had disregarded the findings of the Special Committee on Lawyer Referral Services (Special Committee) in its July 2012 Final Report as to the potential harm nonlawyer-owned for-profit referral services pose to the public.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847507\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/779/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   the report, the Special Committee concluded, after conducting an investigation into the regulation and practices of lawyer referral services in Florida, that for-profit lawyer referral services, particularly those that work in conjunction with other professionals or occupations and are not owned or operated by a member of the Bar, are more likely to run afoul of the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar and engage in activities that do not serve the public interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847507\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/779/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847507\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/779/\">\n    at 780-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Special Committee recommended greater regulation of lawyer participation in for-profit referral services and issued seven specific recommendations, the first of which provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1. A lawyer shall not accept client referrals from any person, entity or service that also refers or attempts to refer clients to any other type of professional service for the same incident, transaction or circumstance, and shall furthermore be prohibited from referring a client to any other professional service in consideration of the lawyer's receipt of referrals from any lawyer referral service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847507\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/779/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847507\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/779/\">\n    at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The amendments proposed by the Bar in this case, despite the Court's clear direction, do not preclude lawyers from accepting referrals from lawyer referral services that are not owned or operated by a member of the Bar. The proposed amendments instead address lawyer participation in \"matching\" and other similar services not currently subject to regulation by the Bar that connect prospective clients with lawyers. The proposed amendments to rule 4-7.22 establish a single regulatory scheme under which lawyer participation in such services is subject to the same restrictions as lawyer referral services, lawyer directories, and other like services in which lawyer participation is currently regulated. The Bar's proposal prohibits lawyer participation in any service that connects prospective clients to lawyers for a fee, or any other type of benefit, unless the service complies with rule 4-7.22 and all other applicable rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition, the Bar proposes deleting or amending five other rules as a result of its proposed amendments to rule 4-7.22. Because lawyer directories are included in the proposed amendments to rule 4-7.22, the Bar proposes deleting rule 4-7.23 (Lawyer Directory). It also proposes amending rules 4-7.12 (Required Content); 4-7.13 (Deceptive and Inherently Misleading Advertisements); 4-7.16 (Presumptively Valid Content); 4-7.17 (Payment for Advertising and Promotion) to include terminology consistent with the proposed amendments to rule 4-7.22. The Board of Governors approved the proposed amendments on a voice vote with one objection. Pursuant to rule 1-12.1(g), the Bar published formal notice of its intent to file a petition recommending amendments to the Bar Rules. The Court received eight comments and the Bar filed a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Having considered the Bar's proposals, the comments filed, the Bar's response, and having had the benefit of oral argument,\n   the Court adopts the amendments to the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar as proposed by the Bar. These amendments, though not consistent with our directive in\n   <em>\n    In re Amendments to Rule Regulating the Florida Bar 4-7.22-Lawyer Referral Services\n   </em>\n   , are necessary to ensure that all services that connect prospective clients to lawyers conform to the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar and operate in a manner consistent with the public interest. These amendments do not, however, resolve our concern with how some lawyer referral services operate in Florida, especially those that refer clients to other professionals and occupational disciplines for services arising from the same incident. The findings of the Special Committee on this matter are troubling and we continue to believe additional measures are needed to ensure the public is not exposed to harm. We therefore direct the Bar to submit a petition within ninety days proposing amendments to rule 4-7.22, and any other rule necessary, to implement the Special Committee's first recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Accordingly, the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar are hereby amended as set forth in the appendix to this opinion. New language is underscored; deleted language is struck through. The amendments shall become effective on April 30, 2018, at 12:01 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   It is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   LABARGA, C.J., and PARIENTE, QUINCE, and POLSTON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   LAWSON, J., concurs in part and dissents in part with an opinion, in which CANADY, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   LEWIS, J., dissents.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    The Special Committee was tasked with the following:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n    [R]eviewing the current practices of lawyer referral services, reviewing all rules applicable to lawyer referral services, and reviewing any other regulations that may be applicable to lawyer referral services.

I dissent from that portion of the opinion directing The Florida Bar to file a petition within ninety days proposing amendments to implement the Special Committee's July 2012 recommendation to prohibit a Florida lawyer from accepting client referrals \"from any person, entity or service that also refers or attempts to refer clients to any other type of professional service for the same incident, transaction or circumstance.\" Majority op. at 165. The few individuals who still express support for this recommendation have identified only two entities to which the prohibition would apply (\"411 Pain\" and \"Ask Gary,\" both of which refer clients to legal and medical professionals) and have not identified a single incident of misconduct by those entities or by any lawyer or medical professional who takes referrals from those entities. Although I certainly recognize the potential mischief that could flow from doctor/lawyer cross-referral relationships, those relationships exist and appear to be common. I have not been able to discern any basis for concluding that Ask Gary's or 411 Pain's model of connecting an injured citizen to a lawyer-which this nearly six-year-old recommendation would prohibit-poses any danger not existent in direct doctor/lawyer referral relationships-which no one has ever suggested could or should be barred. Additionally, I would note that under the newly adopted rules, Florida lawyers will be prohibited from taking referrals from 411 Pain and Ask Gary if these entities refuse to cooperate with any Florida Bar inquiry into their practices. The same is true of all other \"qualified providers\" operating in Florida. Accordingly, these rules will give The Florida Bar a way to determine whether further regulation is needed in this area. I would wait until The Florida Bar has made that determination, based upon hard data rather than innuendo and supposition, and would trust the Bar's conclusion (overwhelmingly supported) that it would be ill\n   advised to adopt a rule based upon the now-outdated Special Committee recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   CANADY, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   APPENDIX\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    RULE 4-7.12 REQUIRED CONTENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Name and Office Location.\n   </strong>\n   All advertisements for legal employment must include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) the name of at least 1 lawyer, the law firm, the lawyer referral service if the advertisement is for the lawyer referral service, the qualifying provider if the advertisement is for the qualifying provider, or the lawyer directory if the advertisement is for the lawyer directory, responsible for the content of the advertisement; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) the city, town, or county of 1 or more bona fide office locations of the lawyer who will perform the services advertised.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Referrals.\n   </strong>\n   If the case or matter will be referred to another lawyer or law firm, the advertisement must include a statement to\n   <s>\n    such\n   </s>\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    (c)-(d)\n   </strong>\n   [No Change]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Comment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Name of Lawyer or Lawyer Referral Service\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   All advertisements are required to contain the name of at least 1 lawyer who is responsible for the content of the advertisement.

For example, an advertised result that is atypical of persons under similar circumstances is likely to be misleading. A result that omits pertinent information, such as failing to disclose that a specific judgment was uncontested or obtained by default, or failing to disclose that the judgment is far short of the client's actual damages, is also misleading.\n   <s>\n    Such\n   </s>\n   <em>\n    The\n   </em>\n   information may create the unjustified expectation that similar results can be obtained for others without reference to the specific factual and legal circumstances. An example of a past result that can be objectively verified is that a lawyer has obtained acquittals in all charges in 4 criminal defense cases. On the other hand, general statements such as, \"I have successfully represented clients,\" or \"I have won numerous appellate cases,\" may or may not be sufficiently objectively verifiable. For example, a lawyer may interpret the words \"successful\" or \"won\" in a manner different from the average prospective client. In a criminal law context, the lawyer may interpret the word \"successful\" to mean a conviction to a lesser charge or a lower sentence than recommended by the prosecutor, while the average prospective client likely would interpret the words \"successful\" or \"won\" to mean an acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Rule 4-1.6(a), Rules Regulating the Florida Bar, prohibits a lawyer from voluntarily disclosing any information regarding a representation without a client's informed consent, unless one of the exceptions to rule 4-1.6 applies. A lawyer who wishes to advertise information about past results must have the affected client's informed consent. The fact that some or all of the information a lawyer may wish to advertise is in the public record does not obviate the need for the client's informed consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    Comparisons\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   [No Change]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    Characterization of Skills, Experience, Reputation or Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The rule prohibits statements that characterize skills, experience, reputation, or record that are not objectively verifiable. Statements of a character trait or attribute are not statements that characterize skills, experience, or record. For example, a statement that a lawyer is aggressive, intelligent, creative, honest, or trustworthy is a statement of a lawyer's personal attribute, but does not characterize the lawyer's skills, experience, reputation, or record.\n   <s>\n    Such\n   </s>\n   <em>\n    These\n   </em>\n   statements are permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Descriptive statements characterizing skills, experience, reputation, or a record that are true and factually verified are permissible. For example, the statement \"Our firm is the largest firm in this city that practices exclusively personal injury law,\" is permissible if true, because the statement is objectively verifiable. Similarly, the statement, \"I have personally handled more appeals before the First District Court of Appeal than any other lawyer in my circuit,\" is permissible if the statement is true, because the statement is objectively verifiable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Descriptive statements that are misleading are prohibited by this rule. Descriptive statements such as \"the best,\" \"second to none,\" or \"the finest\" will generally run afoul of this rule, as such statements are not objectively verifiable and are likely to mislead prospective clients as to the quality of the legal services offered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Aspirational statements are generally permissible as such statements describe goals that a lawyer or law firm will try to meet. Examples of aspirational words include \"goal,\" \"dedicated,\" \"mission,\" and \"philosophy.\" For example, the statement, \"I am dedicated to excellence in my representation of my clients,\" is permissible as a goal. Similarly, the statement, \"My goal is to provide high quality legal services,\" is permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    Areas of Practice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   [No Change]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    Dramatizations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   A re-creation or staging of an event must contain a prominently displayed disclaimer, \"DRAMATIZATION. NOT AN ACTUAL EVENT.\" For example, a re-creation of a car accident must contain the disclaimer. A re-enactment of lawyers visiting the re-construction of an accident scene must contain the disclaimer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   If an actor is used in an advertisement purporting to be engaged in a particular profession or occupation who is acting as a spokesperson for the lawyer or in any other circumstances where the viewer could be misled, a disclaimer must be used. However, an authority figure such as a judge or law enforcement officer, or an actor portraying an authority figure, may not be used in an advertisement to endorse or recommend a lawyer, or to act as a spokesperson for a lawyer under\n   <s>\n    Rule\n   </s>\n   <em>\n    rule\n   </em>\n   4-7.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    Implying Lawyer Will Violate Rules of Conduct or Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Advertisements which state or imply that the advertising lawyers will engage in conduct that violates the Rules of Professional Conduct are prohibited. The Supreme Court of Florida found that lawyer advertisements containing an illustration of a pit bull canine and the telephone number 1-800-pitbull were false, misleading, and manipulative, because use of that animal implied that the advertising lawyers would engage in \"combative and vicious tactics\" that would violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n   <em>\n    <s>\n     Fla.

Such a statement or implication implies that The Florida Bar endorses a particular lawyer. Statements prohibited by this provision include, \"This advertisement was approved by The Florida Bar.\" A lawyer referral service also may not state that it is a \"Florida Bar approved lawyer referral service,\" unless the service is a not-for-profit lawyer referral service approved under chapter 8 of the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar.\n   <em>\n    A qualifying provider also may not state that it is a \"Florida Bar approved qualifying provider\" or that its advertising is approved by The Florida Bar.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    Judicial, Executive, and Legislative Titles\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   This rule prohibits use of a judicial, executive, or legislative branch title, unless accompanied by clear modifiers and placed subsequent to the person's name, when used to refer to a current or former officer of the judicial, executive, or legislative branch. Use of a title before a name is inherently misleading in that it implies that the current or former officer has improper influence. Thus, the titles Senator Doe, Representative Smith, Former Justice Doe, Retired Judge Smith, Governor (Retired) Doe, Former Senator Smith, and other similar titles used as titles in conjunction with the lawyer's name are prohibited by this rule. This includes, but is not limited to, use of the title in advertisements and written communications, computer-accessed communications, letterhead, and business cards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   However, an accurate representation of one's judicial, executive, or legislative experience is permitted if the reference is subsequent to the lawyer's name and is clearly modified by terms such as \"former\" or \"retired.\" For example, a former judge may state \"Jane Doe, Florida Bar member, former circuit judge\" or \"Jane Doe, retired circuit judge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As another example, a former state representative may not include \"Representative Smith (former)\" or \"Representative Smith, retired\" in an advertisement, letterhead, or business card.

A person's access to the legal system is enhanced by the assistance of a qualified lawyer.

It is the policy of The Florida Bar to encourage qualifying providers to: (a) make legal services readily available to the general public through a referral method that considers the client's financial circumstances, spoken language, geographical convenience, and the type and complexity of the client's legal problem; (b) provide information about lawyers and the availability of legal services that will aid in the selection of a lawyer; and (c) inform the public where to seek legal services.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    Subdivision (b)(3) addresses the publication of a listing of lawyers or law firms together in any media.

A fee calculated as a percentage of the fee received by a lawyer, or based on the success or perceived value of the case, would be an improper division of fees. Additionally, a fee that constitutes an improper division of fees occurs when the qualifying provider directs, regulates, or influences the lawyer's professional judgment in rendering legal services to the client. See e.g. rules 4-5.4 and 4-1.7(a)(2). Examples of direction, regulation or influence include when the qualifying provider places limits on a lawyer's representation of a client, requires or prohibits the performance of particular legal services or tasks, or requires the use of particular forms or the use of particular third party providers, whether participation with a particular qualifying provider would violate this rule requires a case-by-case determination.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    Division of fees between lawyers in different firms, as opposed to any monetary or other consideration or benefit to a qualifying provider, is governed by rule 4-1.5(g) and 4-1.5(f)(4)(D).\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    If a qualifying provider has more than 1 advertising or other program that the lawyer may participate in, the lawyer is responsible for the qualifying provider's compliance with this rule solely for the program or programs that the lawyer agrees to participate in.

For example, the lawyer should ask The Florida Bar whether the qualifying provider has filed any annual reports of participating lawyers, whether the qualifying provider has filed any advertisements for evaluation, and whether The Florida Bar has ever made inquiry of the qualifying provider to which the qualifying provider has failed to respond. If the qualifying provider has filed advertisements, the lawyer should ask either The Florida Bar or the qualifying provider for copies of the advertisement(s) and The Florida Bar's written opinion(s). The lawyer should ask the qualifying provider to provide documentation that the provider is in full compliance with this rule, including copies of filings with the state in which the qualifying provider is incorporated to establish that the provider is using either its actual legal name or a registered fictitious name.

For example, a lawyer may not make an agreement with a qualifying provider that the lawyer must refer clients to the qualifying provider or another person or entity designated by the qualifying provider in order to receive referrals or leads from the qualifying provider. See rule 4-7.17(b). A lawyer may not accept referrals or leads from a qualifying provider if the provider interferes with the lawyer's professional judgment in representing clients, for example, by requiring the referral of the lawyer's clients to the qualifying provider, a beneficial owner of the qualifying provider, or an entity owned by the qualifying provider or a beneficial owner of the qualifying provider. See rule 4-1.7(a)(2). A lawyer also may not refer clients to the qualifying provider, a beneficial owner of the qualifying provider, or an entity owned by the qualifying provider or a beneficial owner of the qualifying provider, unless the requirements of rules 4-1.7 and 4-1.8 are met and the lawyer provides written disclosure of the relationship to the client and obtains the client's informed consent confirmed in writing.
