Brown, Judge Dennis R. Bagneris, Pro Tempore)\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Judge Terri F. Love\n   This appeal arises from the conviction and sentencing of defendant for the second degree murder of her husband. Defendant contends on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction, that the trial court improperly admitted hearsay evidence, and that the jury was improperly influenced by prosecutorial misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After reviewing the record, we find that sufficient evidence was presented at trial to sustain the defendant's conviction for second degree murder. As for the alleged admittance of hearsay evidence, we find that the declarant was unavailable, thus allowing the admittance of the declarant's nontestimonial statements against his penal interest, as recounted by numerous witnesses. Lastly, we find that any alleged misconduct contained in the State's closing arguments was cured by the trial court's jury instructions. As such, the conviction and sentence of Ms. Raine is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Earnest Smith was murdered in New Orleans on April 12, 2006, at his residence on Roger Drive. He died of multiple gunshot wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sergeant Randi Gant of the New Orleans Police Department (\"NOPD\") responded to the homicide by shooting call and described arriving on the scene. Sgt. Gant saw Mr. Smith lying on the bottom of a set of stairs, with a trail of blood leading to his body. Later, police discovered two spent nine-millimeter casings near where Mr. Smith's motorcycle was parked outside the front door. Sgt. Gant testified that Emma Raine, Mr. Smith's wife, dialed 911. Ms. Raine told Sgt. Gant that she had been in her bedroom sleeping all day after taking medication for a toothache. According to Ms. Raine, Mr. Smith went with a friend to a motorcycle racing event. As he came home, Ms. Raine heard a popping noise. When she came down the stairs, Mr. Smith told her, \"Babe, I've been shot,\" and then collapsed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Smith's daughter, Quentine Jefferson, learned about her father's murder from Ms. Raine, who told Ms. Jefferson that \"[s]he asked him to go outside to get his motorbike. When he went around to get his motorbike, someone shot him.\" Ms. Jefferson later briefly lived with Ms. Raine in Picayune, Mississippi. However, Ms. Jefferson moved out after a friend of Ms. Raine's daughter told her Ms. Raine was involved in her father's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Jefferson testified that at the time of her father's death, she was unaware that she was the beneficiary of a life insurance policy on him. Ms. Raine originally purchased the policy in 1997 in the amount of $100,000, naming herself as the sole beneficiary. The policy was increased several\n   times between 2000 and 2005. In November of 2005, Ms. Raine increased the policy to $800,000. On February 20, 2006, less than two months before the victim's death, Ms. Raine changed the beneficiary of the policy, removing herself and naming James Raine (who would become her third husband) and the victim as beneficiaries, so that the proceeds of the policy would be divided between Mr. Raine and the victim's estate, his sole heir being Ms. Jefferson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Jefferson testified that she discovered the existence of the insurance policy in the summer of 2010 when she \"googled\" her own name. Ms. Jefferson believed that she should have received $400,000 upon her father's death. Ms. Jefferson stated that she later learned that Ms. Raine's daughter, Keisha Judge, forged her signature on an insurance document to allow her mother, Ms. Raine, to collect the proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lieutenant Brad Garrett, who investigated the death of Ms. Raine's third husband, confirmed that Ms. Judge signed the policy. Ms. Judge pled guilty to conspiracy and forgery in 2014, and was sentenced to ten years probation. Lt. Garrett explained that Ms. Raine was charged with the same crime, but that the case against her was still pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State also introduced evidence of the death of Ms. Raine's third husband, James Raine. Mr. Raine and Ms. Raine married in 2008 and moved to Poplarville, Mississippi. On October 21, 2011, Mr. Raine's body was found lying on a bed in the home they shared, with multiple gunshot wounds to the head. Although there were signs of forced entry, the home's video surveillance system was turned off the previous day, recording Ms. Raine as the last person in the house. After the discovery of his body, many of Mr. Raine's family members gathered at the house. Among them were Enoch Raine, Mr. Raine's brother, and William Fowler, Mr. Raine's uncle. At the scene, the family overheard rumors that Mr. Raine and another relative, Alfred \"Terry\" Everette, were involved in the murder of Mr. Smith, the victim in this case. Fearing for Mr. Everette's safety, the family later confronted him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Enoch, Mr. Everette's step-brother, and Mr. Fowler, Mr. Everette's uncle, took Mr. Everette for a drive so they could discuss the rumors. The men went to \"a secluded area where nobody could hear or see [them] while [they] were discussing the situation.\" According to Enoch, Mr. Everette began to cry and said, \"I want to do everything to make it right.\" Pressed about what happened, Mr. Everette said, \"James and Emma got me to kill Ernest.\" Mr. Fowler testified similarly about Mr. Everette's confession in the car. According to both Enoch and Mr. Fowler, Mr. Everette continued to describe how he murdered Mr. Smith. Afterwards, the men went to pick up the family's oldest male, Henry Fowler, Mr. Everette's uncle. Henry testified that Mr. Everette said \"James and Emma gave him [the gun] to shoot this man down there.\" The men offered to help and believed that Mr. Everette would turn himself in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Soon after the confession, an anonymous caller told Enoch that she was going to leave some papers in his mailbox. The papers involved the beneficiary change on Mr. Smith's life insurance policy, as well as documents surrounding a suit filed by the insurance carrier against Mr. Raine and Ms. Raine. Enoch shared these documents with the police investigating the murder of Mr. Raine. After seeing a television program that referred to the murder of Mr. Smith as a cold case, Enoch contacted the New Orleans detective assigned to the case. Enoch, Mr. Fowler, and Henry eventually\n   drove to New Orleans to give statements to Detective DeCynda Barnes. After investigating further, Detective Barnes secured warrants for the arrest of Mr. Everette and Ms. Raine, charging Mr. Everette as the shooter and Ms. Raine as a principal to murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Donald Glover testified that he and Mr. Everette became friendly during their incarceration in Orleans Parish Prison, talking every day during their seven or eight months there together. Mr. Glover testified that Mr. Everette admitted to him that he had killed Mr. Smith and claimed that he was to be paid for the murder by his half-brother, Mr. Raine and the half-brother's (soon-to-be) wife, Ms. Raine. According to Mr. Glover, Mr. Everette explained that he was caught because he drunkenly confessed to a family member. Mr. Glover was offered an eight-year plea offer before revealing the information about Mr. Everette. He ultimately received a six-year sentence after pleading guilty to the charge against him after Mr. Everette's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At trial, Mr. Everette took the stand and refused to testify. The State called him as a witness, but he refused to answer the State's questions and would not give a response when counsel for Ms. Raine asked if there was any question he would answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   An Orleans Parish grand jury returned an indictment charging Ms. Raine and Mr. Everette with one count of violating La. R.S. 14:30.1, relative to the second degree murder of Mr. Smith. At their arraignment, both defendants pled not guilty to the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In December of 2014, the State severed the cases of Mr. Everette and Ms. Raine, proceeding to trial with Mr. Everette. After a three-day trial, a jury found Mr. Everette guilty as charged. His conviction and sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor were affirmed by this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In preparation for Ms. Raine's trial, the State filed in open court its notice of intent to use evidence of similar crimes, wrongs, and/or acts against Ms. Raine, pursuant to La. C.E. art. 404(B) and the rules set forth in\n   <em>\n    State v. Prieur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9734982\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/277/126/\">\n    277 So.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973). Specifically, the State sought to introduce evidence surrounding the deaths of Ms. Raine's first husband, Leroy Evans, and her third husband, Mr. Raine. Ms. Raine filed an Opposition to the State's use of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court held a\n   <em>\n    Prieur\n   </em>\n   hearing, ruling that evidence related to Mr. Evans's death was inadmissible but that evidence pertaining to the death of Mr. Raine was admissible as\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   and as substantive evidence of planning, preparation, and motive with respect to the charged murder of Mr. Smith. This Court denied Ms. Raine's supervisory writ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   as did the Louisiana Supreme Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ms. Raine stood trial for second degree murder from August 9, 2016 to August 12, 2016. The jury found Ms. Raine guilty as charged of second degree murder. Ms. Raine was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor. The trial court granted Ms. Raine's motion for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A review of the record for errors patent reveals none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Raine asserts that the evidence was not sufficient to convict her of violating La. R.S. 14:30.1, second degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   La. R.S. 14:30.1(A)(1) provides in pertinent part as follows: \"A. Second degree murder is the killing of a human being: (1) When the offender has a specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm.\" \"Specific criminal intent is that state of mind which exists when the circumstances indicate that the offender actively desired the prescribed criminal consequences to follow his act or his failure to act.\" La. R.S. 14:10(1). Pursuant to La. R.S. 14:24, \"[a]ll persons concerned in the commission of a crime, whether present or absent, and whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense, aid and abet in its commission, or directly or indirectly counsel or procure another to commit the crime, are principals.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The legal standard for reviewing an argument of insufficient evidence is set forth in\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   , which provides that \"the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n    443 U.S. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 319,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n    61 L.Ed.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979).

From 2000 to 2005, Ms. Raine increased the amount of that insurance policy from its original value of $100,000 to the $800,000 the policy paid upon the victim's death. On February 20, 2006, two months before the shooting of Mr. Smith, Ms. Raine executed a beneficiary change form, removing herself as a beneficiary and naming instead Mr. Raine (who would become her third husband) and Mr. Smith (so that the proceeds would go to his estate). The evidence showed that Mr. Raine signed the \"Assignment, Declaration and Disclaimer\" for the policy and Ms. Judge, Ms. Raine's daughter, forged a signature for Quentine Jefferson. As such, Ms. Raine (through her daughter and third husband) collected the $800,000 from the policy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Additionally, Enoch, the brother of Mr. Raine and step-brother of Mr. Everette, testified that Mr. Everette confessed that \"James and Emma got me to kill Ernest.\" Similarly, Mr. Fowler testified to this same conversation, stating that Mr. Everette confessed that \"Emma and James had hired him to murder Mr. Smith.\" Henry, who was also present for this confession, likewise testified that Mr. Everette said that \"James and Emma gave him money to shoot this man down there.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Mr. Glover also testified that Mr. Everette admitted killing Mr. Smith and that Mr. Everette was to be paid for the murder by his half-brother, Mr. Raine and Ms. Raine.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Lastly, the testimony revealed that Ms. Raine became physically involved with Mr. Raine while Mr. Smith was still alive. However, Mr. Raine was later found dead in the bed he shared with Ms. Raine with multiple gunshot wounds to the head. The home's video surveillance system had been turned off the day before, and Ms. Raine was the last person recorded inside.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Like in\n    <em>\n     Mack\n    </em>\n    , where the circumstantial evidence was found to exclude most reasonable hypotheses of innocence, here, the evidence showed that Ms. Raine increased the value of a life insurance policy on Mr. Smith, removed herself as a beneficiary before the shooting, and then hired someone to shoot Mr. Smith, eventually committing insurance fraud to collect the proceeds of the policy. Additionally, the evidence revealed that Ms. Raine's third husband also died under suspicious circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The circumstantial evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, demonstrates that a rational trier of fact could have found Ms. Raine guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, reasonably rejecting the hypotheses of innocence she advanced. The hypothesis that Mr. Raine acted without her knowledge could be rejected because at the time of the killing, Mr. Raine was positioned to receive $400,000 from Mr. Smith's life insurance policy. Thus, he would have had no need to involve Ms. Raine in persuading Mr. Everette that he would actually receive the $10,000 promised. Additionally, a rational factfinder could reject the hypothesis that Ms. Raine purchased the life insurance policy because Mr. Smith purchased a motorcycle and was not a beneficiary at his death. Given the gradual increase in the value of the policy, the change of beneficiaries just two months before the victim's death, the subsequent insurance fraud, and that Ms. Raine eventually did receive the full amount of the victim's life insurance policy, a rational trier of fact could reject\n    this hypothesis. As such, we find that the State presented sufficient evidence to sustain Ms. Raine's conviction for second degree murder.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      HEARSAY EVIDENCE\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Ms. Raine asserts that the trial court improperly admitted hearsay testimony from Enoch, Mr. Fowler, Henry, and Mr. Glover.

Enoch testified that Mr. Everette confessed that \"James and Emma got me to kill Ernest.\" Similarly, Mr. Fowler testified to this same conversation, stating that Mr. Everette confessed that \"Emma and James had hired him to murder Mr. Smith.\" Henry, who was also present for this confession, likewise testified that Mr. Everette said that \"James and\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Emma gave [sic] him to shoot this man down there.\" Also, Mr. Glover testified about conversations with Mr. Everette while they were in jail together where Mr. Everette explained that he was paid to murder Mr. Smith and that a woman, who later married Mr. Everette's half-brother, was watching before the murder and called him when the victim pulled up to the house.

While that statement could arguably have improperly shifted the burden of proof from the State to Defendant, leading the jury to believe that there's a mandatory presumption, the Court found the misstatement was cured by the judge's instruction, which included a correct statement of the law.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441628\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/681/1230/#p1239\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The misstatement of the law by the prosecutor was not \"so dominant that the jurors could not adhere to their charged duty to accept and to apply the law as given by the court.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441628\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/681/1230/#p1239\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Here, like in\n    <em>\n     Hill\n    </em>\n    , where the prosecutor misstated the burden of proof in closing argument, the prosecutor misstated that if the jury believed Ms. Raine was\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    \"probably guilty, then the State has proved with sufficient evidence the case that is presented before you.\" Similarly to\n    <em>\n     Roy\n    </em>\n    , where the prosecutor misstated the law in closing argument, here, the prosecutor misstated the law as it relates to the burden of proof in the closing argument. However, as in\n    <em>\n     Hill\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Roy\n    </em>\n    , any misstatement was cured by the judge's instructions to the jury. The trial court charged the jury as follows, in pertinent part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n    The defendant is presumed to be innocent until each element of the crime is necessary to constitute her guilt is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant is not required to prove that she is innocent. Thus, the defendant begins the trial with the presumption of innocence.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    The burden is upon the State to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In considering the evidence,\n    you must give the defendant every benefit, or the benefit of every reasonable doubt arising out of the evidence or the lack of evidence.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n    If you are not convinced of the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, you must find her not guilty. While the State must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it does not have to prove guilt beyond all possible doubt.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    Reasonable doubt is doubt based on reason and common sense, and is present when, after you have carefully considered all the evidence, you cannot say that you are firmly convinced of the truth of the charge.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    The Opening Statements and Closing Arguments are not to be considered evidence.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Thus, the trial court gave a lengthy jury instruction as to the burden and the meaning of beyond a reasonable doubt. As such, any misleading statement concerning the burden of proof by the prosecutor was not \"so dominant\" that it was not cured by the trial court judge's instruction, which properly stated the burden of proof. Accordingly, the conviction and sentence of Ms. Raine is affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      DECREE\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    For the above-mentioned reasons, we find that sufficient evidence was presented to sustain Ms. Raine's conviction for second degree murder. Additionally, the hearsay statements were properly admitted as nontestimonial statements against interest. Further, the alleged prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments was cured by the trial court's jury instructions. As such, we affirm the conviction and sentence of Ms. Raine.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    <strong>\n     CONVICTION AND SENTENCE AFFIRMED\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
