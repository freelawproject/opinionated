On March 10, 2017, Defendant filed a motion to quash, which was denied on March 15, 2017. On the same date, he entered an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to one count of aggravated incest, a violation of La.R.S. 14:78.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He waived sentencing delays and received a sentence of twenty years at hard labor. The trial court dismissed the other two counts pursuant to a State motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant appeals and assigns a single error, but breaks it into three main arguments. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court's denial of Defendant's motion to quash, and we affirm Defendant's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the plea hearing, the State recited the following facts, without objection by Defendant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Your Honor, this offense happened between January 1st, 2012 and June 1st, 2012. The victim's date of birth is April 5th, 2000, making her between eleven and twelve years of age at all times herein, and the victim was related to Mr. Dixon as his granddaughter. And at times when she was exposed to him and in his presence, he did commit a sexual battery upon her, also indecent behavior with juveniles, and molestation of a juvenile in that he would lewdly fondle and touch her with the intent to arouse and satisfy his sexual desires. Specifically, the\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   behavior that he did with this victim, who's [sic] initials are E.D., was touch her breast, vagina, and buttocks with his hand. In support of that I'd like to offer, file, and introduce the documents filed in discovery in this matter and the actual filing of discovery relates to 87,680, but is also related to the new docket number, 90,481. And I would like to rely on those as part of my factual basis, but I would submit to the Court that were this case to go to trial, that is what the State would prove at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant assigns a single error, but divides it into three major arguments. His general argument is that the trial court erred by denying his motion to quash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Double Jeopardy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant first argues the current case was a second prosecution which violated the constitutional protection against double jeopardy. Although double jeopardy was mentioned in the written motion, the State observes that Defendant did not argue it at the March 15 hearing. However, we will address the argument because double jeopardy can be raised at any time. La.Code Crim.P. art. 594. Further, a double jeopardy error would require dismissal of the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As the State points out, Defendant pled guilty to a sex offense involving the victim, E.D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the prior case, he pled to a sex\n   offense committed against D.D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The present appeal and the previous appeal address two pleas to two different offenses against two different victims. Thus, it is clear that double jeopardy is not implicated in the guilty plea. To the extent Defendant's argument raises concerns regarding the bill of information, any argument regarding the bill is moot given the ultimate plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Plea Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant next argues that the present prosecution violates the plea agreement from the earlier case. In the earlier case, the State agreed to dismiss two counts: one count of aggravated crime against nature, which was alleged to have been committed against D.D. between July 11, 2010 and February 14, 2015, and another count of aggravated crime against nature, alleged to have been committed against E.D. between May 1, 2012 and September 30, 2012. The dismissal of the latter count appears problematic in the context of the current argument because, as already noted, Defendant entered an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea to a sex offense, aggravated incest, against E.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thus, Defendant contends he was prosecuted for conduct that was dismissed pursuant to the plea agreement in the earlier case. It is true that both bills alleged that he committed improper sexual acts against the victim: \"sexual battery, indecent behavior with juveniles and molestation of a juvenile.\" The second bill also charged that Defendant \"did lewdly fondle and touch\" E.D. The former bill alleged the acts occurred between May 1, 2012 and September 30, 2012; the present bill alleged acts between January 1, 2012 and June 1, 2012. Thus, both bills alleged the same general sex acts against the same victim and both alleged that at least some of the acts occurred in May and June of 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although the record is difficult to decipher, after a careful analysis of the facts and circumstances surrounding the pleas, we find Defendant is not being prosecuted again for conduct dismissed as part of the plea agreement in the previous case. Rather, as discussed below, the second bill was brought to correct errors that resulted from all parties relying on an incorrect version of a statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Vindictive Prosecution\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant's third and final argument is that the current prosecution violates constitutional due process protections because the State is punishing him for his success in his earlier appeal. As he points out, vindictive prosecution is prohibited by\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v. Pearce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772134\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/711/\">\n    395 U.S. 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772134\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/711/\">\n    89 S.Ct. 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772134\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/711/\">\n    23 L.Ed.2d 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1969).

In trying the issue of vindictiveness, the prosecutor may offer proof of the sort suggested in\n   <em>\n    Hardwick\n   </em>\n   that as a matter of fact his actions were not vindictive. The burden of proof (by a preponderance of the evidence) remains on the defendant who raised the affirmative defense. If, on the other hand, the course of events provides no objective indication that would allay a reasonable apprehension by the defendant that the more serious charge was vindictive, i.e., inspired by a determination to \"punish a pesky defendant for exercising his legal rights,\" a presumption of vindictiveness applies which cannot be overcome unless the government proves by a preponderance of the evidence that events occurring since the time of the original charge decision altered that initial exercise of the prosecutors discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The procedural history in the instant case is rather straight forward.

This test sets forth both the elements of proof of and defense to a claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness as well as the allocation of burdens and order of proof on this claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The Defendant bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of prosecutorial vindictiveness .... The defendant's establishment of a prima facie case of vindictiveness, in effect, creates a presumption that the government did act vindictively in bringing the second\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   prosecution. The nature of this presumption varies according to the balance struck between the government's interests in enforcing the law and allocating wide discretion to individual prosecutor's to make charging decisions, and the Defendant's interests in being free from both actual vindictiveness and the apprehension of vindictiveness as the consequence of challenging his original conviction. Where the Defendant's interests outweigh the government's interests, the presumption created by the Defendant's establishment of a prima facie case is irrebuttable, and the Defendant is entitled to prevail based entirely upon his initial showing. This occurs where the government baldly escalates the original charge as in Blackledge. But where the balance weighs in favor of the government, as occurs where the escalation of the second charge was possible only because of events occurring between the first and second prosecutions or where the second charge accuses the Defendant of \"different and distinct\" offenses from the first charge, even despite a common origin in the same \"spree of activity,\" the government is entitled to rebut the presumption of vindictiveness by going forward to demonstrate legitimate, nonvindictive reasons for the second charge. In these situations, if the government fails to come forward with any such reasons or fails adequately to rebut the presumption of vindictiveness, the Defendant is entitled to a judgment in his favor based upon the presumption created by his establishment of a prima facie case. But if the government successfully carries its burden of rebutting the presumption, the Defendant must then demonstrate actual vindictive motivation by the government to prevail on his claim. Alternatively, where the government institutes a second prosecution\n   against a Defendant who has had his first conviction set aside but who cannot establish a prima facie case because the second charge carries a less severe penalty than the first, the Defendant may still challenge the second prosecution as vindictive but must demonstrate actual vindictive motivation by the government.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1396304\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/615/251/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1396304\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/615/251/\">\n    at 313-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The record does not reflect an \"objective indication\" as to the reason for seeking enhancement of the sentence.

Accordingly, this court is remanding this case to the trial\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   court for a hearing to allow the state an opportunity to rebut the presumption of vindictiveness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In this case, there was no escalation of the overall sentence that Defendant agreed to in his first plea deal. In fact, his sentence was reduced from the-agreed-upon sentence of thirty years to a total sentence of twenty-seven-and-a-half years. Thus, there was no escalation of charges for the purpose of an increased sentence, and thus no evidence of a vindictive motivation. The crime of aggravated incest ( La.R.S. 14:78.1(A) and (D)(2) ) involving E.D., as charged in the second bill, carried the same sentence range as the cited charge for aggravated crime against nature ( La.R.S. 14:89.1(A)(2) and (C)(2) involving E.D. in the first bill. Both were felonies, and both carried prison sentences of twenty-five to ninety-nine years. A mistake was made in the first bill however, because La.R.S. 14:89.1(C) did not exist in 2012; it was added in 2014, at which time La.R.S. 14:78.1 (aggravated incest) was repealed and folded into La.R.S. 14:89.1 (aggravated crime against nature). But the defense attorney, the district attorney, and two judges all thought the statute was properly cited. This was the same statute pled to in the first conviction involving D.D., and the same mistake that led to the first appeal and remand. The original intent in the first conviction was to sentence Defendant to thirty years for all of his crimes; and that was never exceeded as a result of the second conviction, which involved a different victim. The basis for the\n   <em>\n    Pearce\n   </em>\n   presumption does not exist in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Further, where there are multiple offenses and interdependent sentences, adherence to an original sentencing intent and scheme of punishment is a legitimate reason that negates a claim of vindictiveness.\n   <em>\n    State v.

There, in addressing double jeopardy and vindictiveness, the court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   In a case involving multiple convictions, a trial judge often imposes interdependent sentences according to a scheme of punishment for a defendant's conduct as a whole. When raising a double jeopardy claim, a defendant is effectively contesting the entire scheme of punishment.

The\n   <em>\n    Neville\n   </em>\n   court stated that the judge's intent was to impose a sentence\n   which would be consistent with the original sentencing judge's intent that the defendant serve thirty-five years.

In this case, the felony prosecution had to be brought within six years from the date the offense was committed, pursuant to La.Code Crim.P. art. 572(A)(1).

Rather, he argues that the earlier 2015 count for aggravated crime against nature involving E.D. in 2012 was dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement, and the district attorney's filing of the second bill charging aggravated incest against E.D. in 2012 was technically for the same offense and, therefore, violated the earlier plea agreement.
