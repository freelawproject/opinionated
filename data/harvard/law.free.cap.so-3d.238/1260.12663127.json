On April 3, 2017, the husband timely filed this petition for the writ of mandamus seeking review of the trial court's March 20, 2017, order.

The husband avers that the divorce complaint has still not been served on the wife, and the attachments to the husband's petition demonstrate that the trial court has now denied his request that the circuit clerk proceed with service of process on the wife.

R. Civ. P. (emphasis added). Although I do not find in the materials before us or in the record in the previous appeal any of the postal forms required to obtain service upon Helms by certified mail pursuant to Rule 4(i)(2), Ala. R. Civ. P., I also do not find any indication that the trial-court clerk has requested that Allison furnish any forms as required by Rule 4(a)(5), Ala. R. Civ. P. Therefore, Allison is entitled to the writ of mandamus directing the trial-court clerk to proceed with processing the summons and complaint for service by certified mail as requested by Allison and as required by Rule 4(i)(2), Ala. R. Civ. P., and, if any further forms are necessary, the trial-clerk may request those forms from Allison. See Rule 4(a)(5), Ala. R. Civ.
