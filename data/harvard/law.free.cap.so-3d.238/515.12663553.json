Love, Judge Joy Cossich Lobrano, Judge Dennis R. Bagneris, Pro Tempore)\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Judge Terri F. Love\n   This appeal arises from the trial court's judgment finding plaintiff free from fault in her divorce, as well as a victim of domestic violence, and awarding plaintiff final spousal support following a divorce from defendant. Defendant contends that the trial court erred by finding that plaintiff was free from fault and for awarding $1,280.00 in monthly spousal support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We find that the trial court did not err by concluding that plaintiff was free from fault in the divorce from her husband, as the record revealed a history of domestic violence. Further, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding plaintiff $1,280.00, as representative of only a portion of her monthly expenses and less than her previous interim spousal support award. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Swenja Heinemann Thomas\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Royal Thomas, Jr. were married on December 22, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 11, 2013, Ms. Thomas filed a Petition for Protection from Abuse against Mr. Thomas.

I went in the bathroom just to check, 'cause it started to hurt when I was swallowing, and I was just looking at myself to find out-\n    And he had the nerve to come there and say: Oh, are you hurt?

And in this business, if you don't show up, it's a lot of dollars involved, and you just basically ruin your name. So I had this-I had the tour-guiding job, and then he left and left me with errands, and I had to take my son with me to the job. And we just called a streetcar 'cause we still had no car. And I had my purse, and I just-\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    Until that time, I was still so in shock and-But it was clear to me after I went there and I had done my tour with my son.

And she said, you know-And I told-She said: What's wrong with you?-'cause I was wearing a turtleneck and it was quite warm. And I just said: I think I can go home no more.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Ms. Thomas then testified that her friend brought her to the police.

So he would pull me. Whenever I was laying down, he would pull me out of the bed, whatever he-It was mostly my ankles or my wrists or my upper arms. And he was doing that so rapidly that two days later or a day later, I was bruised up on my wrists and on my ankles and on my arms. And it's-My sister-in-law, I told her about it. She tried to talk to him, but it's worthless.

She contended that Mr. Thomas would take away her debit card and keep track of all of her phone calls.

Mr. Thomas stated that when they returned home, they ate, showered, and went to bed. According to Mr. Thomas, Ms. Thomas was screaming when she finally was able to return to the home.

Indelibly, the trial court's decision was based upon an evaluation of the credibility of Mr. and Ms. Thomas. This finding precludes a finding of abandonment. Given Ms. Thomas' testimony regarding the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of Mr. Thomas, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by crediting Ms. Thomas' testimony or manifestly err by determining that Ms. Thomas was free from fault.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      FINAL PERIODIC SUPPORT\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Mr. Thomas asserts that the trial court erroneously included attorney's fees, child care, travel expenses, and immigration costs in the award for final periodic support, which he also cannot afford to pay.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    As noted above, La.

Ms. Thomas was a \"government-certified optician\" in Germany, but she would have to return to college in the United States to achieve equal status here. She stated that she does not have the financial wherewithal or time to do so. Therefore, Ms. Thomas works as an optician, which is \"the closest it would come to my profession.\" Ms. Thomas testified that these limitations decreased her earning capacity. Ms. Thomas works a second job to \"make enough money to live.\" Further, she stated that she \"cannot work more than I do right now because I have nobody besides an agency that's a babysitter for\" her minor child.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Ms. Thomas' net monthly income is $2,199.77. Her monthly expenses total $3,480,\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    leaving a shortfall of $1,280.23. Ms. Thomas was examined and cross-examined regarding her list of expenses, as depicted on her income and expense list.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Counsel for Mr. Thomas did not object to any of Ms. Thomas' expenses.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Ms. Thomas requested $1,280.00 a month in final periodic support, which was less than the amount she received for interim spousal support.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Mr. Thomas testified that he was working two jobs: one for the Department of Defense (\"DoD\") and one for Ochsner. He stated that he received a letter from the DoD allegedly informing him that he could no longer keep his job with Ochsner. Mr. Thomas stated that he resigned from his Ochsner job approximately one month prior to the hearing. However, Mr. Thomas' counsel failed to admit a certified business document into evidence reflecting same.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Mr. Thomas testified that his monthly retirement income is \"about $1,990.\" His net monthly income is \"[s]omething like\" $1,557.57.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    Mr. Thomas pays $698 a month for the child support of their minor child. Mr. Thomas stated that his expenses exceed his income and that being ordered to pay spousal support would \"cause me a problem.\" Mr. Thomas did not bring his 2014 tax return to the hearing because he \"didn't think [he] needed it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    On cross-examination, Mr. Thomas did not dispute that he receives roughly $3,424 a month gross income from the DoD and, up until about a month before the hearing, was receiving roughly $2,998.66 a month gross income from Ochsner. When asked about his monthly total gross income, Mr. Thomas stated that it was $3,373, as listed on the Statement of Income and Expenses. When confronted that the total gross income listed on the form, $3,373, was less than the singular gross income from the DoD, $3,424, Mr. Thomas stated that he \"added my grosses off of both of those statements\" and could not explain the discrepancy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    When awarding periodic final support, the trial court stated: \"The Court has considered all relevant factors in determining the amount of the spousal support. Based on the testimony and exhibits presented into evidence, the Court shall grant Ms. Thomas a final periodic support of $1,280 a month.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Firstly, Mr. Thomas contends that the trial court awarded \"support for expenses not necessary for maintenance.\" We disagree. The trial court issued a blanket award of $1,280.00 a month. The trial court did not specify what expenses that award was for. Without any delineation within the $1,280.00 award, we cannot say that the trial court awarded the support for unnecessary expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Secondly, Mr. Thomas asserts that the trial court's award is excessive based on his income. Mr. Thomas' Statement of Income and Expenses did not accurately reflect his gross monthly income. His testimony and the evidence revealed that he receives around $1,990 in gross retirement income, $3,424 gross income from the DoD, and was receiving roughly $2,998.66 from Ochsner, which equals $8,412.66 in gross monthly income. Without including Ochsner,\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    that leaves $5,414 monthly gross income, which is greater than the $3,373.00 gross monthly income reported by Mr. Thomas. Further, La. C.C. art. 112(D) provides\n    that \"where support is awarded pursuant to Paragraph B of this Article,\" to a spouse without fault and a victim of domestic abuse, \"the sum awarded may exceed one-third of the obligor's net income.\" Moreover, in regards to La. C.C. art. 112, the trial court stated that it \"considered all relevant factors in determining the amount of the spousal support.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Ms. Thomas testified that her ability to earn a living was impacted by the couple's move to the United States because she would be required to return to school in order to secure a job equal to her occupation in Germany. Likewise, as the single parent to the minor child, the amount of hours Ms. Thomas is able to work is limited. The trial court weighed this testimony, as well as that of Mr. Thomas, and reviewed the documentation of their respective income and expenses. As the trial court is vested with vast discretion when determining the amount of spousal support, and based on the unique facts and circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding Ms. Thomas $1,280.00 in final periodic spousal support.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      DECREE\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    For the above-mentioned reasons, we find that the trial court did not err by finding that Ms. Thomas was free from fault and was a victim of domestic abuse. We further find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when determining Ms. Thomas' award for final periodic spousal support. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <strong>\n     AFFIRMED\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    LOBRANO, J., CONCURS IN THE RESULTS\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-96\">\n     Mr. Thomas is the father of one of Ms. Thomas' adult children.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-97\">\n     Ms. Thomas' income and expense list includes the following expenses:\n    </p>\n    <pre id=\"p-98\">Rent $650.00 Electricity/gas $130.00 Water $57.00 Phone $80.00 Food (groceries) $500.00 Restaurants $80.00 Uncovered medical, etc. $100.00 Mortgage note $200.00 Gasoline $140.00 Maintenance $30.00 Parking $5.00 Books $20.00 Supplies $20.00 Clothing $80.00 Laundry &amp; cleaning $30.00 Personal &amp; grooming $150.00 Household supplies $50.00 Life insurance $12.00 Auto insurance $147.00 Child care $50.00 Recreation $100.00 Immigration costs $49.00 Attorney fees $500.00 Gifts to children $50.00 Gifts to others/travel $250.00 ____________________________________ Total $3480.00</pre>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-99\">\n     The objection made by counsel for Mr. Thomas was in reference to a discussion of alleged child support arrearages.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-100\">\n     Counsel for Mr. Thomas offered into evidence a copy of the letter allegedly received by Mr. Thomas.
