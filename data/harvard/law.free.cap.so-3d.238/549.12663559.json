For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 30, 2014, Mr. Dileo filed a \"Petition for Defamation, Libel, and Invasion of Privacy Damages\" against Mr. Harry. The claims arose out of a civil suit in the 40\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District Court in which the parties were opposing counsel. In his petition, Mr. Dileo alleged that in the earlier case, in an opposition to exceptions, as well as in a pre-trial memorandum, Mr. Harry cited\n   <em>\n    In re Dileo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9623002\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/307/362/\">\n    307 So.2d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1975), a suit involving Mr. Dileo, with the intention to invade Mr. Dileo's privacy and thus \"making an unreasonable public disclosure of embarrassing private facts\" about Mr. Dileo. Mr. Dileo also alleged that during a telephone pre-trial conference with Judge Madeline Jasmine and attorney Steven Reed, Mr. Harry accused Mr. Dileo of child molestation. Mr. Dileo alleged that this statement was defamatory\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 25, 2014, in response to the petition, Mr. Harry filed \"Exceptions of No Cause of Action and Motion for Sanctions.\" Mr. Harry argued that in his petition, Mr. Dileo failed to allege any of the elements of an invasion of privacy claim, and failed to allege all of the elements of a defamation claim. Additionally, he argued that the trial court is not authorized to regulate the practice of law and thus lacked jurisdiction over these claims. On January 12, 2015, the trial court conducted a hearing on the exceptions and took the matter under advisement. In a written judgment with extensive reasons rendered on May 26, 2015, the trial court denied Mr. Harry's exception regarding the unauthorized regulation of the practice of law, granted his exception of no cause of action regarding the invasion of privacy claim, denied his exception of no cause of action regarding the defamation claim, and denied his motion for sanctions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A bench trial on the merits of the remaining defamation claim was held on January 12, 2017. Mr. Dileo called Mr. Harry and himself as witnesses. Mr. Harry testified that he did participate in a telephone conference with Judge Jasmine on October 17, 2013 regarding the selection of a trial date. He testified that he did not say during the telephone conference that Mr. Dileo was a child molester or had molested anyone, but rather that he was looking for evidence of child molestation, if it existed. He testified that the purpose behind mentioning child molestation was to show the court that the case was not ready for trial, as additional discovery was necessary. Mr. Dileo testified that during the telephone conference in question, Mr. Harry told Judge Jasmine, \"I believe we can even prove that he molested his four-year-old daughter.\" He testified that at no time during the conference did Mr. Harry say that he needed more time to prove this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following this testimony, Mr. Dileo rested his case. Mr. Harry then moved for a \"directed verdict.\" In support of his motion, Mr. Harry argued that those persons\n   present on the telephone conference did not testify, nor were they subpoenaed to testify at the trial, and thus there is a presumption that had they testified, they would have testified that Mr. Dileo was not telling the truth. Mr. Harry further argued that Mr. Dileo did not carry his burden of proof to show more likely than not that Mr. Harry made the alleged statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After hearing the parties' arguments, the trial court granted the involuntary dismissal of Mr. Dileo's defamation claim pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 1672(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its written reasons for judgment dated January 13, 2017, the trial court found that the evidence presented by Mr. Dileo was uncorroborated and insufficient to satisfy his burden of proof. The trial court found that it did not believe that Mr. Harry had made a defamatory\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   statement about Mr. Dileo, either expressly or implicitly. According to the trial court, the testimony did not preponderate in favor of either party, and neither party introduced any corroborating evidence to sway the trier of fact. Thus, the trial court found that Mr. Dileo did not \"satisf[y] his preponderance of the evidence burden of proof.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, Mr. Dileo asserts the following assignments of error, to-wit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. The trial court erred as a matter of law when it granted Mr. Harry's exception of no cause of action as to the invasion of privacy claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. The trial court erred when it found that Mr. Harry's statement about child molestation did not rise to the level of defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   when the trial court and this Court found no privilege, qualified or otherwise, existed in a pre-trial conference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   3. The trial court erred in giving the same evidentiary weight to Mr. Harry's testimony when he presented no evidence whatsoever that he had a reasonable belief of his \"defamatory\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   accusations against [Mr.] Dileo.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   4. The trial court erred when it denied introduction of Mr. Harry's July 15, 2014 letter to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (\"ODC\") concerning his molestation accusation, as well as other defamatory accusations, since Mr. Harry waived any privilege he may have had by introducing into evidence Mr. Dileo's first ODC complaint, as well as by filing his reconventional demand for defamation against Mr. Dileo for Mr. Dileo's first ODC complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Invasion of privacy claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, Mr. Dileo argues that the trial court erred when it granted Mr. Harry's exception of no cause of action as to the invasion of privacy claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"In reviewing a trial court's ruling on a peremptory exception of no cause of action, an appellate court considers this question of law\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

In other words, the exception tests the legal sufficiency of the petition by determining whether the plaintiff is afforded a remedy in law based on the facts alleged in the pleading. The exception is triable only on the face of the petition, accepting as true the well-pleaded facts therein. Thus, the standard for granting an exception of no cause of action is not the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail at trial; rather, it is whether, on the face of the petition, accepting all allegations as true, the petition states a valid cause of action for relief. On review, the appellate court asks whether, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and with every doubt resolved in the plaintiff's favor, the petition states any valid cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6830508\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/186/1220/#p1222\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Internal citations omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Jaubert v.

C.E. art. 609. He alleged that the case was referenced with the intention to invade his privacy thereby making an unreasonable disclosure of embarrassing private facts about him. The trial court granted Mr. Harry's exception of no cause of action as to the invasion claim, finding that legal opinions such as that rendered in\n   <em>\n    In re Dileo\n   </em>\n   are not private, and thus Mr. Dileo failed to assert an integral element of his invasion of privacy claim. On appeal, Mr. Dileo argues that the trial court erred in granting the exception because the \"dissemination\n   of personal information about [Mr.] Dileo was prohibited by Code of Evidence Article 609.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Upon\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, we find that the trial court did not err in granting the exception of no cause of action at to the invasion of privacy claim. The factual allegations contained in Mr. Dileo's petition do not support an invasion of privacy claim. In Mr. Dileo's petition, his claim for invasion of privacy is based on Mr. Harry's references to\n   <em>\n    In re Dileo\n   </em>\n   . However,\n   <em>\n    In re Dileo\n   </em>\n   is a published legal opinion and is not private. Since the petition fails to allege that a privacy right was involved, we find that Mr. Dileo has failed to meet his burden of asserting an actionable invasion of privacy claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On appeal, Mr. Dileo argues that Mr. Harry disregarded and violated La. C.E. art. 609 to win his lawsuit, and thus the judgment of the trial court on his invasion of privacy claim should be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We find no merit to this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   An alleged violation of La. C.E. art. 609 does not support a claim of invasion of privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we find that the allegations contained in Mr. Dileo's petition do not give rise to a legally enforceable cause of action for invasion of privacy. The trial court thus properly granted Mr. Harry's exception of no cause of action as to the invasion of privacy claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Proffered evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Dileo also argues on appeal that his proffered evidence should have been admitted. During the trial, Mr. Dileo attempted to offer into evidence a letter written by Mr. Harry to the ODC regarding the ODC investigation initiated by Mr. Dileo against Mr. Harry regarding these same claims. Mr. Harry objected, claiming privilege pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 12. The trial court sustained\n   the objection, prompting Mr. Dileo to proffer the letter and testimony regarding the letter. Mr. Dileo now argues on appeal that Mr. Harry waived any privilege that would prevent introduction of his response letter to the ODC complaint filed against him because Mr. Harry himself introduced Mr. Dileo's first complaint letter to the ODC as an attachment to his Motion for Bond for Security that was previously filed in this case, and that Mr. Harry also violated\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Supreme Court Rule XIX when he reconvened against Mr. Dileo for defamation because Mr. Dileo had filed his first ODC complaint against Mr. Harry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 12, titled \"Immunity,\" provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A. From Civil Suits. Communications to the board, hearing committees, or disciplinary counsel relating to lawyer misconduct or disability and testimony given in the proceedings shall be absolutely privileged, and no lawsuit predicated thereon may be instituted against any complainant or witness. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The record reflects that Mr. Harry filed a \"Motion for Bond for Security Costs\" on October 9, 2014. As attachments to the memorandum in support of his motion, Mr. Harry included communications related to the ODC investigation in question. Specifically, he included Mr. Dileo's initial complaint against him and a letter from the ODC to him noting dismissal of the complaint. At the trial on the defamation claim, Mr. Dileo proffered Mr. Harry's response to the ODC regarding the complaint made against him. Considering Mr. Harry's own public disclosure in the instant case of communications regarding the ODC complaint filed by Mr. Dileo against him, we find that he waived his privilege against disclosure thereof, and thus the trial court erred in not allowing admission of Mr. Harry's response to the ODC complaint filed by Mr. Dileo against him. Considering this additional proffered evidence on\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, we now examine the merits of the trial court's granting of the involuntary dismissal of the defamation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defamation claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, Mr. Dileo argues that the trial court erred in granting the involuntary dismissal of his defamation claim. He asserts that the trial court erred when it found that Mr. Harry's statement about child molestation did not rise to the level of being defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   when the trial court and this Court found no privilege, qualified or otherwise existed, in a pre-trial conference. He also argues that there was nothing to support Mr. Harry's statement that he referenced the child molestation to show the case was not ripe for trial. He argues that Mr. Harry did not introduce any evidence or call any witness to prove that he did not have a reasonable belief of the child molestation allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In a nonjury case, La. C.C.P. art. 1672(B) authorizes the trial court to grant an involuntary dismissal of the action at the close of the plaintiff's case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The trial court has much discretion in determining whether to grant a motion for involuntary dismissal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Treen Constr.

Rather, the court believed Mr. Harry's recollection of events concerning the telephone pre-trial conference with Judge Jasmine that he (Mr. Harry) was merely seeking to extend discovery deadlines to ascertain the truth of the molestation allegation.

LEXIS 1501, the Louisiana Supreme Court recently set forth the well-established guidelines for reviewing factual determinations of the trial court, to-wit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   It is well settled that a court of appeal may not set aside a trial court's or a jury's finding of fact in the absence of \"manifest error\" or unless it is \"clearly wrong,\" and where there is conflict in the testimony, reasonable evaluations of credibility and reasonable inferences of fact should not be disturbed upon review, even though the appellate court may feel that its own evaluations and inferences are as reasonable. This test dictates that a reviewing court must do more than simply review the record for some evidence that may controvert the trial court ruling. Rather, it requires a\n   review of the entire record to determine whether manifest error has occurred. Thus, the issue before the court of appeal is not whether the trier of fact was right or wrong, but whether the fact-finder's conclusion was a reasonable one. The appellate court must not reweigh the evidence or substitute its own factual findings because it would have decided the case differently. Where the factfinder's determination is based on its decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more witnesses, that finding can virtually never be manifestly erroneous. This rule applies equally to the evaluation of expert testimony, including the evaluation and resolution of conflicts in expert testimony.

Mr. Dileo argues that Mr. Harry failed to provide support for his testimony. However, the burden of proof was on Mr. Dileo to prove the publication of a defamatory\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   statement. Even considering the proffered letter to the ODC, we find that Mr. Dileo failed to provide any supporting evidence that Mr. Harry made a defamatory\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   statement about Mr. Dileo. Mr. Harry's response letter to the ODC is consistent with his trial testimony that he was merely seeking to extend discovery deadlines. The trial court heard the testimony of both parties and chose to believe Mr. Harry's testimony over that of Mr. Dileo. Giving great deference to the trial court's ruling and upon review of the entire record, we cannot say that the trial court was unreasonable in finding that Mr. Harry did not make a defamatory\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   statement about Mr. Dileo, either expressly or implicitly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   These assignments of error are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court's dismissal of Mr. Dileo's invasion of privacy and defamation claims.
