R.S. 14:95.1.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  The bill of information cited, as the predicate offense for this charge, a conviction of a prior felony, simple robbery. Mr. Fletcher entered a plea of not guilty at his arraignment on August 16, 2016.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The bill of information also charged Mr. Fletcher with one count of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle (a motor scooter), a violation of La. R.S. 14:68.4. This charge is not at issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 29, 2017, Mr. Fletcher filed a motion to quash the bill of information on the basis that his prior conviction of simple robbery in 2009 was constitutionally defective. He alleged that, while he pled guilty to that charge, the record reflects that the trial court did not advise him of his right to confront his accusers. He further alleged that the record failed to contain a completed plea form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A hearing on the motion to quash was held on April 3, 2017. While the trial court indicated at the oral argument that the motion would be denied, it later issued a written order, by which it granted the motion, indicating that \"[a]fter reviewing the evidence and considering the totality of the circumstances, the State has not proven that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to confront his accuser.\" In so ruling, the court noted that \"[t]he sentencing transcript and the sentencing minute entry are devoid of any such waiver.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State has timely appealed this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its sole assignment of error, the State contends that the trial court abused its discretion in granting Mr. Fletcher's motion to quash. As a general rule, a trial court's decision to grant a motion to quash \"should not be reversed in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

It further noted that, at the time\n   <em>\n    Amos\n   </em>\n   was decided, the reasonable standard \"was consistent with this court's review of other alleged infringements of constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9677836\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/343/166/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the 2012 amendment, however, the standard was expressly heightened to a strict scrutiny standard. The Court framed the limited question before it as follows: \"whether La.

The Court answered this question by holding the statute to be constitutional. As explained in\n   <em>\n    State v.

To the contrary,\n   <em>\n    Draughter\n   </em>\n   simply noted the distinction that, at the time\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   was decided, there was a reasonableness standard applied to the exercise of police power with respect to the right to bear arms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Draughter\n   </em>\n   , 13-0914, p. 9 n.8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279983\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/130/855/\">\n    130 So.3d at 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[i]n\n   <em>\n    State v.
