In\n   June 2009, Beulah and Barry Forstall (the \"Forstalls\") commenced this suit. In their petition, the Forstalls averred that they were the sole owners of the Property; and they named as defendants the following three parties: (i) the City of New Orleans (the \"City\"); (ii) a prior owner of the Property, Ulis Gaines; and (iii) a subsequent donee of the Property, Reconcile New Orleans, Inc. (\"Reconcile\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In July 2016, a one-day bench trial was held in this matter. At trial, three witnesses testified-the Forstalls and Walter O'Brien, the revenue clerking supervisor of the City's Bureau of Treasury, Department of Finance. At the close of the trial, the trial court judge orally ruled as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   The only thing that I'm taking up today is whether or not there was notice to the Forstalls relative to the second tax sale, absent notice to the Forstalls of the second, not the tax sale they participated in but the subsequent tax sale, then I've got to grant their request for nullity of that second tax same. [sic] That's all I'm rendering judgment on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court stated that it was reserving judgment on the following two issues: (i) \"whether or not the Forstalls are entitled to title\"; and (ii) \"whether or not[,] if they [the Forstalls] are entitled to title[,] any reimbursement[s] are due and/or taxes specifically are due to the City.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Six months elapsed between the July 2016 trial and the issuance of a written judgment on January 17, 2017 (the \"January Judgment\"). In the January Judgment, the trial court, memorializing its earlier oral ruling, ordered that \"the trial is bifurcated and the evidence presented at trial pertained only to the validity of the tax sale plaintiff is seeking to be annulled.\" Also in this judgment, the trial court recognized the City's stipulation, at trial, that it had \"no evidence of notice of tax sale\" to the Forstalls. The trial court thus ruled in the Forstalls' favor, and against the City, declaring the October 2, 1986 tax sale adjudication of the Property to the City a nullity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the six-month period between the trial and the January Judgment, Reconcile filed a motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a hearing, the trial court, on November 18, 2016, issued a judgment granting the motion for summary judgment and dismissing Reconcile with prejudice (the \"November Judgment\"). In November 2016, the Forstalls filed a motion for new trial from the November Judgment. The trial court, however, did not rule on that motion until February 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the Forstalls seek review of both the November Judgment and the January Judgment.

The threshold question that must be answered before reaching the merits of an appeal is whether the ruling from which a party seeks review is an appealable judgment. \"A party may appeal (1) from a final judgment in actions in which appeals are given by law; (2) an interlocutory judgment only when expressly provided by law; and (3) from a judgment reformed in accordance with an additur or remittitur.\" Frank Maraist, 1 LA.

Subpart B has the following two subparts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 \"[T]he judgment shall not constitute a final judgment unless it is designated as a final judgment by the court after an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.\" La.

An appeal may be taken from a final judgment under Article 1915(A) without the judgment being so designated.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The November Judgment falls under Subpart A because it \"[d]ismisses the suit as to less than all of the parties, defendants, third party plaintiffs, third party defendants, or intervenors.\" La. C.C.P. art. 1915(A)(1). The November Judgment dismisses the suit as to one party-Reconcile. The November Judgment thus is a partial final judgment that is immediately appealable pursuant to Subpart A without the necessity of a designation of finality by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re LoCicero\n   </em>\n   , 10-0624, p. 4 (La.

This court has jurisdiction over the Forstalls' appeal from the November Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The January Judgment falls under Subpart B because it is a bifurcated judgment not covered by Subpart A. Subpart A authorizes only the following two categories of bifurcated judgments as partial final judgments: (i) a judgment \"on the issue of liability when that issue has been tried separately by the court;\" and (ii) \"when, in a jury trial, the issue of liability has been tried before a jury and the issue of damages is to be tried before a different jury.\" La. C.C.P. art. 1915(A)(5). The January Judgment falls into neither of those categories; it bifurcates the issues before the trial court and grants relief as to only one issue-the nullity of the October 2, 1986 tax sale adjudication to the City. Because the trial court did not certify the January Judgment as immediately appealable, it is a non-appealable judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.
