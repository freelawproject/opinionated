Accordingly, in adopting the Committee's proposed amendments, we provided for a period of sixty days after the date of the Court's opinion for interested persons to file comments with the Court, followed by a period of twenty-one days for the Committee to file a response to any comments filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mediator Rules,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364286\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/220/408/\">\n    220 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   409 &amp; n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court received three comments concerning subdivision (e) (Opinions). The Committee filed a response to the comments, which included an additional proposed amendment to subdivision (e) to specify that advisory opinions of the MEAC are to be published in the DRC's newsletter or on the DRC's website. Upon consideration of the comments filed, and the Committee's response, we adopt the amendment to subdivision (e) as proposed by the Committee. We amend Mediator Rule 10.910 in subdivision (e) to require that advisory opinions of the MEAC be published either in the DRC's newsletter or on its website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Accordingly, the Florida Rules for Certified and Court-Appointed Mediators are hereby amended as reflected in the appendix to this opinion. New language is indicated by underscoring. The amendments shall become effective immediately upon release of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   It is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   LABARGA, C.J., and PARIENTE, LEWIS, QUINCE, CANADY, POLSTON, and LAWSON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    APPENDIX\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Rule 10.910.
