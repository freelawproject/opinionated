He was sentenced to fifteen years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for second degree kidnapping; six years at hard labor for second degree battery; and four years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for each count of domestic abuse aggravated assault.

This court found an error patent because Defendant's sentence for second degree battery was beyond the statutory maximum, vacated his sentence, and remanded the matter for resentencing. This court also amended Defendant's sentences for each of the three counts of domestic abuse aggravated assault to allow for the benefits of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, as required by La.R.S. 14:37.7.

He made her remove her clothing, and he struck her some more. The blows left a four-inch bruise. The victim went to the hospital and was prescribed pain medication. This court affirmed the defendant's maximum sentence of five years at hard labor and a $2,000 fine. This court found the evidence supported the greater charge of aggravated battery. Thus, \"[b]ecause the conduct involved is not adequately described by the conviction, the defendant need not be the 'worst type of offender' to receive the maximum sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12021376\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/692/538/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12021376\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/692/538/\">\n    at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This court's original opinion in this case (\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346610\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/209/143/\">\n    209 So.3d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), shows Defendant grabbed his victim, threw her down stairs, held her in his apartment against her will, threatened to \"juke\" her with a metal meat skewer, sprayed her with lighter fluid, made her think he would set her on fire and \"make her look like a mummy[,]\" repeatedly struck her on the top of her head with a knife, kicked her in the head, threw her to the ground, caused a serious head injury, poured lighter fluid into her head wound, and slapped her face.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346610\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/209/143/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346610\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/209/143/\">\n    at 145-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the original sentencing, the trial judge considered Defendant's conduct during the commission of the offenses to manifest deliberate cruelty to his victim. He should have known the victim was particularly vulnerable. He used threats of violence and actual violence in the commission of the offenses. He used a dangerous weapon. The trial judge did not find testimony that the offenses resulted from \"a lover's quarrel,\" which occurred before the offense, to be a mitigating factor. Defendant's acts support the greater charge of aggravated battery, which is the intentional use of force or violence with a dangerous weapon, just as in\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12021376\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/692/538/\">\n    692 So.2d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant's sentence was within the statutory guidelines. The trial court considered Defendant's indigent status and did not impose the fine allowed by statute. Defendant received a significant benefit from the trial court's ruling that the sentences are to run concurrently, and also\n   received credit for time served. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in sentencing Defendant to the maximum term for second degree battery. Further, Defendant failed to make a non-frivolous argument of an excessive sentence on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Our review of the record reveals no non-frivolous issues Defendant could raise on appeal.
