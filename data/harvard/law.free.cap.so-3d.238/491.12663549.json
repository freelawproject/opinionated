Prior to that time, Defendant's counsel had filed an Application for Appointment of Sanity Commission, which was granted by the trial court. After a December 2016 hearing, Defendant was found competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 13, 2017, as part of a plea agreement, Defendant tendered a plea of guilty to three counts of video voyeurism. According to the factual basis for the charges presented by the State at his guilty plea hearing, Defendant placed a video camera inside the bathroom of the home where he lived with his girlfriend and her nine-year-old daughter, J.I.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which captured videos of an adult female and J.I. in various stages of undress and nudity. Defendant also took still photographs of J.I.'s genital and pubic area from under the covers of her bed. In accordance with the plea agreement, the State dismissed the count of possession of pornography involving juveniles and recommended concurrent sentences. On March 14, 2017, Defendant was sentenced to four years at hard labor, without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence for Count 1, under the provisions of La.R.S. 14:283(B)(3) ; to five years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence for Count 2, in accordance with La.R.S. 14:283(B)(4) ; and to seven years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence for Count 3, in accordance with La.R.S. 14:283(B)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The sentences were ordered to run concurrent with each other, and Defendant was given credit for time served from the date of his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant filed a Motion to Reconsider Sentence wherein he alleged his sentences are excessive under the totality of the circumstances.

First, we look to the nature of the crimes committed by Defendant. Video voyeurism is designated as a sex offense under La.R.S. 15:541. Next, we examine Defendant's nature and background. Defendant has a prior misdemeanor conviction of carnal knowledge of a juvenile for which he was sentenced to six months in jail. Finally, we look to the sentences imposed for similar crimes by the same court and other courts. Defendant was charged with three counts of video voyeurism and received sentences consisting of four, five, and seven years at hard labor all without benefits to be served concurrently with each other and any other sentence. The Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed two sentences of five years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence,\n   to run consecutively, where the defendant pled guilty to two counts of video voyeurism involving juveniles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The\n   <em>\n    Schaller\n   </em>\n   court found that the trial court did not err in imposing the maximum sentence where the \"defendant appeared to have an ongoing history of associations with underage girls\" and had apparently lied about his activities with the underage females who frequented his home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1067.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Additionally, we note that all of Defendant's sentences are mid to upper-range sentences, and none of them reach the maximum sentence available under the sentencing provision applicable to each count. Under the circumstances present in this case, we cannot say that the trial court abused its broad discretion in sentencing Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Alternatively, the State argues, and we agree, that Defendant's assertion that the bill of information must specify the subparagraphs for sentencing is more an argument that Defendant did not receive notice of the sentencing provisions than an excessive sentence claim. Citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9676631\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/584/\">\n    338 So.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1976), the State asserts that Defendant's unqualified guilty plea waived any non-jurisdictional defects and precludes appellate review or review on post-conviction. In\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   , the Louisiana Supreme Court set forth a rule allowing defendants to reserve the right to contest pre-plea non-jurisdictional defects at the time of the guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant herein did not reserve any rights at the time of his guilty plea. Further, he had sufficient notice of the crimes for which he was entering a plea. Defendant stated in his guilty plea hearing that he understood what he was pleading guilty to, and the court explained to him that he would be sentenced under La.R.S. 14:283(B)(3) for the first count involving an adult and that he would be sentenced under La.R.S. 14:283(B)(4) for the second and third counts involving a juvenile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We also conclude that Defendant waived any non-jurisdictional defects when he failed to reserve them at the plea hearing and was properly given notice and sentenced under subparagraphs (B)(3) and (4) of La.R.S. 14:283. Therefore,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant's argument that La.R.S. 14:283(B)(1) does not authorize the denial of parole is without merit as Defendant was not sentenced under this subparagraph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Lastly, Defendant argues that his sentence is excessive because the trial court failed to consider his cognitive abilities and influences on his actions. The trial court, however, stated on the record that it considered the factors of La.Code Crim.P. art. 894.1, including Defendant's medical history, criminal record, and addiction treatment, along with statements from his family, and the contents of the PSI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant's convictions and sentences are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Pursuant to La.R.S. 46:1844(W), the initials of the minor victim will be used to protect and maintain her privacy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Section (B)(3) of the video voyeurism statute provides that anyone convicted of \"observing, viewing, photographing, filming, or videotaping ... actual or simulated sexual intercourse, masturbation,\" or certain body parts shall be \"imprisoned at hard labor for not less than one year or more than five years, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.\" Section (B)(4) of the video voyeurism statute provides that:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Whoever commits the crime of video voyeurism when the observing, viewing, photographing, filming, or videotaping is of any child under the age of seventeen with the intention of arousing or gratifying the sexual desires of the offender shall ... be imprisoned at hard labor for not less than two years or more than ten years without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Both the two-years imprisonment maximum found in La.R.S. 14:283(B)(1), the generalized sentencing provision of the statute, and the enhanced sentences found in La.R.S. 14:283 provide for the imposition of a fine, but no fine was imposed in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    According to the Pre-Sentence Investigation (PSI) which the trial court ordered at the time of his guilty plea, Defendant pled guilty to a misdemeanor count of carnal knowledge of a juvenile in May 2005, and he was sentenced to six months in jail.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Cavernomas are abnormal clusters of vessels with small bubbles (or caverns) filled with blood that can cause seizures, stroke symptoms, hemorrhages, and headaches.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Although he offered no explanation of this assertion in his motion to reconsider, Defendant noted in his brief to this court that he had brain surgery in February 2016.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
