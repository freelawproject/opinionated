The orders of the Supreme Court granting those motions are identical and read as follows: \u201c[T]he judgment of the Appellate Court is set aside and the matter is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to affirm the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>court\u2019s judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.\u201d Pursuant to and in conformity with those orders, the matter is remanded to the trial court with direction to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
