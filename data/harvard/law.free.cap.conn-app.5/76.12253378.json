The defendant filed a motion to dismiss claiming that, since there was no allegation in the complaint that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>plaintiff was licensed by the Connecticut real estate commission, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From the granting of the motion to dismiss and the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to reargue, the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The plaintiff claimed at oral argument in the trial court that she was acting at all times on behalf of the defendant, which was her employer, and that she was not acting for another but, rather, as an agent of the defendant and hence was not required to be licensed. See footnote 1, supra. The plaintiff relied on <em>Colli </em>v. <em>Real Estate </em>Commission, 169 Conn. 445, 451, 364 A.2d 167 (1975), which held that a person negotiating for himself or on behalf of his corporation is not included within the terms \u201creal estate broker or real estate salesman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 143 provides in part: \u201cThe motion to dismiss shall be used to assert (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter .... This motion shall always be filed with a supporting memorandum of law, and where appropriate, with supporting affidavits as to facts not apparent on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The trial court considered the complaint, the affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s mother and the written agreement in reaching its conclusion. It held that \u201cone may infer that the plaintiff \u2018performed services for the defendant\u2019 in connection with the defendant\u2019s purchase and renovation of certain real estate in New London. It is not clear, however, that the plaintiffs claimed performance falls within the exclusionary language of <em>Colli, </em>i.e., that she was acting \u2018on behalf of [her] corporation.\u2019 Accordingly, the court is not able to conclude, on the basis of the allegations of her complaint, that the plaintiff was acting in the capacity of a principal, and the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">A trial court must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light when deciding a jurisdictional question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Soffer, </em>183 Conn. 67, 68, 438 A.2d 1163 (1981). Although only the plaintiff submitted an affidavit that disclosed the presence of an issue of fact\u2014whether the plaintiff was acting as an agent or employee of the defendant\u2014the trial court granted the motion without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u201cWhere affidavits filed by opposing parties present undisputed facts, the court may rule upon the motion without taking additional evidence concerning those facts. This procedure in no way diminishes the right of the parties to present and prove all competent facts in issue within the allegations of their respective pleadings. Moreover, this practice encourages judicial expediency by eliminating evidentiary hearings in those cases where material facts are undisputed .... [H]owever, a different practice obtains where there exists a genuine issue of material fact. Affidavits which disclose genuine issues of material fact cannot resolve the factual dispute raised by them .... A judicial determination of such issues must then be made.\u201d <em>Garden Mutual Benefit Assn. </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>37 Conn. Sup. 790, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>791-92, 437 A.2d 141 (1981). The trial court must conduct an evidentiary hearing to insure the right of each party to present all relevant and material evidence for such judicial resolution. Id., 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The material presented to the trial court on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss left it unclear whether the plaintiff was acting as an agent of the defendant. Given that the plaintiff\u2019s allegations should have been read favorably to her, the proper course was not to dismiss the complaint, but to set the matter down for an evidentiary hearing on that factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo person who is not licensed under the provisions of this chapter . . . shall commence or bring any action in any court of this state ... to recover any commission, compensation or other payment in respect of any act done or service rendered by him, the doing or rendering of which is prohibited under the provisions of this chapter except by persons duly licensed under this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 20-312 provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall act as a real estate broker or real estate salesman without a license issued by the commission . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Thus, pursuant to these two statutes no person who is not properly licensed may sue in our courts for payment for services rendered as a real estate broker or salesman. We agree with the defendant that the strong, clear language of General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (a) makes the issue of a license, when it is required as a condition of rendering such services, an issue affecting the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
