The pertinent evidence was derived from court ordered electronic surveillance obtained, under General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a et seq., at the request of the state\u2019s attorney for the Hartford Judicial District. As a result of information derived from the investigation, search warrants were issued and thereafter the defendant, among others, was arrested. The defendant filed a motion under General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m to suppress the contents and fruits of the wiretaps. The court denied this motion. The defendant thereafter pleaded nolo contendere to a substitute information charging him with one count of professional gambling and one count of using a telephone to transmit and receive gambling information and, after imposition of sentence, filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">We have carefully considered the defendant\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit. The issues raised amount to little more than a wholesale and hypertechnical attack on the procedures set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 54-41d concerning the necessary findings which the panel of judges must make before issuing an order authorizing the interception of a wire communication and those requirements established by General Statutes \u00a7 54-41e concerning the contents of the statement which must be made by the panel of judges issuing such an order. These statutory provisions represent a carefully constructed part of this state\u2019s wiretapping and electronic surveillance law and fully carry out the Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>eral Assembly\u2019s obvious intent that such procedures protect the rights of targets of such court authorized wiretaps.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The issues raised by the defendant are definitively disposed of by <em>Moore </em>v. <em>United States, </em>461 F.2d 1236, 1238 (D.C. Cir. 1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>194 Conn. 447, 456-60, 481 A.2d 730 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Levine, </em>5 Conn.

App. 477, 480, 489 A.2d 1060, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 806, 494 A.2d 903 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
