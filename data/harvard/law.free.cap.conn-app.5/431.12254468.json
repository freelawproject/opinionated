The court issued a detailed and exhaustive memorandum of decision finding all the necessary facts in favor of the plaintiff. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">The defendant\u2019s first claim, that the court erred in admitting without proper foundation two photographs of the particular defect in the sidewalk, is without merit. The plaintiff testified that the photographs accurately depicted the condition of the sidewalk at the point at which she fell. See <em>Tripp </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>1 Conn. App. 433, 435, 472 A.2d 804 (1984). The defendant\u2019s remaining claims of error do no more than attack the trial court\u2019s factual findings, which are not clearly erroneous. See <em>Fukelman </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>4 Conn. App. 30, 31, 492 A.2d 214 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
