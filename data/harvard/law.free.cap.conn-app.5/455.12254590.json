The plaintiff, Charles Olsen, an abutting landowner, appealed to the trial court from the decision of the zoning board of appeals. At the hearing for the zoning appeal, argued on January 6, 1984, the plaintiff claimed that the board violated General Statutes \u00a7 8-3c, asserting that the notice of hearing was inadequate and that the application proposal submitted and approved at the hearing differed from the one originally submitted. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the ground that the plaintiff never presented for the court\u2019s consideration a copy of the zoning regulations in question, particularly \u00a7 535.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From this judgment, upon the granting of certification, the plaintiff has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The principal issue involved in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in ruling that the zoning regulations were not a proper subject of judicial notice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find that zoning regulations may be judicially noticed and, therefore, that the trial court was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the record was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>incomplete, the zoning regulations never having been presented for the court\u2019s review on appeal. In its memorandum of decision on the appeal, the court erroneously relied on <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>145 Conn. 735, 736, 143 A.2d 450 (1958), for the proposition that \u201c[t]he trial court does not take judicial notice of zoning regulations, nor does [the Supreme] court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In 1967, General Statutes \u00a7 52-163 was amended, superseding <em>Martin, </em>to permit courts to take judicial notice of the ordinances of any town, city or borough. Public Acts 1967, No. 353; Holden &amp; Daly, Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 25, p. 44. As zoning regulations are municipal ordinances, the trial court should have taken judicial notice of \u00a7 535 of the Torrington zoning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\"> In addition, the trial court denied the plaintiffs subsequent motions to open the judgment and to correct the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-8\"> Section 535 of the Torrington zoning regulations, amended as of August 23,1980, June 30,1981, and April 13,1983, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe building of multi-family dwellings in a Restricted Residential Community Zone shall be permitted only by the Planning and Zoning Commission after a public hearing as provided in Section 230. . . . The building of multi-family dwellings in any other zone except those in which it is expressly prohibited or which building of multi-family dwellings is authorized by Section 230, may only be allowed as a Special Exception by the Zoning Board of Appeals after a public hearing in accordance with Section 604.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\"> Two other issues were claimed on appeal: (1) whether the hearing notice was adequate, and (2) whether the court in ruling on the motion to correct should have permitted the introduction of the zoning regulations in light of General Statutes \u00a7 8-8. We need not consider these issues, as a ruling on the issue of judicial notice is dispositive of the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
