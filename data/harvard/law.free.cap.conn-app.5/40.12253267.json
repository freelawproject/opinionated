Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the state filed a written request to charge on the lesser included offense of assault in the second degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its charge, the court instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of assault in the second degree as requested by the state but did not charge the jury on either of the subsections of assault in the third degree as requested by the defendant. On May 11, 1984, following a rereading of the court\u2019s instructions on lesser included offenses at the jury\u2019s request, the defendant was convicted of assault in the second degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2). The defendant appeals from the judgment on the verdict, sentencing him to five years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">On the basis of the evidence adduced at trial, the jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On May 14, 1983, at about 9-p.m., the complainant, Thomas Izzo, and Ralph Gaudino, along with their respective dates, Sharon McCreven and Tracy Brereton, drove into New Haven to attend the Agora Ballroom, an entertainment establishment located on Whalley Avenue around the corner from the defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Izzo parked his car on Norton Street and they all walked the short distance to the Agora. Sometime after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>midnight the two women returned to the car and found that it had been broken into. They went back into the Agora and summoned Izzo and Gaudino. All four then returned to the car with Izzo in the lead.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Izzo discovered that a window of the car had been pried open and that a pocketbook, a radio, and a leather jacket were missing. Izzo, angry, noticed the defendant laughing nearby. Izzo pushed the defendant and a fight ensued. The two of them fell back into nearby bushes punching each other. They rolled around on the ground, Izzo punched the defendant on the head repeatedly and, at one point, he stood over the defendant pinning him to the ground face down. During the struggle, the defendant was able to free his left hand long enough to stab Izzo twice in the stomach with a sharp, flat bladed instrument. None of the witnesses was within arm\u2019s reach when the fight broke up.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Jeff Gray, a passerby who had also been at the Agora, testified that he observed Izzo on top of the defendant with his hands around the defendant\u2019s neck, and that he lifted Izzo off of the defendant, ending the fight. The defendant then went into his apartment. The victim began to breathe differently, noticing a feeling of air entering his abdomen. He saw blood on his shirt which he thought was the defendant\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Meanwhile, Gaudino was involved in a fight with three or four males further up Norton Street. Izzo joined in this fracas to help Gaudino. Izzo testified that he took hold of two of the males and pinned both of them to the ground simultaneously. This fight was broken up by the arrival of the police. The officers ordered Izzo and his friends to leave the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Upon returning to the car, Izzo told McCreven that there was something wrong with him. After leaving the scene, Izzo circled back to retrieve a jack. He stopped and got out of the car and hurled the jack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>through the front window of the defendant\u2019s apartment. Izzo was arrested shortly thereafter for criminal mischief. He was taken to the police station and then to Yale-New Haven Hospital. He had two small puncture wounds in his abdomen, one superficial and one penetrating his peritoneum. His recovery was rapid and unremarkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Izzo and his companions testified that the wounds were caused by the fight with the defendant. He felt some punches in his stomach. At no time did he observe any weapon. Izzo\u2019s three companions also testified that they saw blood on Izzo\u2019s shirt after the first fight. Izzo explained that he did not, at the scene, accuse the defendant of having caused his injuries because the police did not give him a chance to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Instructions on a properly requested lesser included offense are critical to the fair presentation of a criminal case to a jury and implicate a defendant\u2019s fundamental right to have the jury pass upon every factual issue fairly presented by the evidence. The Supreme Court has reversed a number of recent convictions because of the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses requested by the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burge, </em>195 Conn. 232, 487 A.2d 532 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>189 Conn. 268, 455 A.2d 342 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 444 A.2d 213 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>185 Conn. 402, 441 A.2d 119 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 989, 102 S. Ct. 1612, 71 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Conn. 63, 441 A.2d 84 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The parties agree that the controlling law is as follows. \u201cA defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense if, and only if, the following conditions are met: (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>supra, 28-29; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 76-77; <em>State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>182 Conn. 66, 72, 437 A.2d 836 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1083, 101 S. Ct. 868, 66 L. Ed. 2d 807 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 407-408, 429 A.2d 919 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The state properly concedes that the first three prongs of <em>Whistnant </em>were met. First, the defendant filed a timely request to charge and, on several appropriate occasions, he took oral exception to the court\u2019s failure to give the charges requested. Second, the only distinguishing element between the crime charged and those requested is a more culpable mental state. Therefore, \u201cit is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser,\u201d as required by <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra. Third, the state proved that the defendant intentionally caused physical injury by means of a dangerous instrument and, in so doing, necessarily \u201csome evidence\u201d was introduced by the state \u201cwhich justifies conviction of the lesser offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra. This third prong is satisfied where the evidence suggests \u201cat least a possibility\u201d that the elements of the lesser offense have been established. <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>supra, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>At the fourth prong of the <em>Whistnant </em>test, the parties go their separate ways. As to this requirement, the elements distinguishing the greater from the lesser offense will be \u201csufficiently in dispute\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra; whenever the evidence permits reasonable minds to differ upon the existence or nonexistence of the missing element. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The law on this subject has recently been exhaustively summed up by Justice Healey in <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>195 Conn. 567, 489 A.2d 1024 (1985). The defendant in that case claimed that the court erred in refusing to charge on robbery in the third degree as a lesser included offense of robbery in the first degree. The count charged against the defendant required the state to prove that he committed the crime of robbery while \u201carmed with a deadly weapon, to wit: a pistol or revolver.\u201d The defendant sought a lesser included offense charge on robbery in the third degree which requires no weapon. He claimed that neither the actual weapon used nor any bullet was ever recovered. The issue of the weapon\u2019s operability was sufficiently in dispute for the purposes of the fourth prong of <em>Whistnant </em>to require a jury charge on the lesser included offense requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u201cThe focal question raised by the defendant\u2019s claim involves the fourth prong of the <em>Whistnant </em>test: whether the evidence of the element that differentiated the included offense of robbery in the third degree from robbery in the first degree, in this case the \u2018armed with a deadly weapon\u2019 element, was \u2018sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u2019 <em>[State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>191 Conn. 604, 616-17, 469 A.2d 767 (1983)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra. \u2018We must answer in the affirmative if viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shuman, </em>37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>N.Y.2d 302, 304, 333 N.E.2d 363 (1975); reasonable minds could differ upon the existence or nonexistence of the element that distinguishes the inclusive from the included offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>180 Conn. 599, 610-11, 430 A.2d 1297 (1980) <em>(Healey, J., </em>dissenting). Otherwise the defendant would lose the right to have the jury pass upon every factual issue fairly presented by the evidence. <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>162 U.S. 313, 314, 16 S. Ct. 839, 40 L. Ed. 980 (1896). . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Conn. 63, 77-78, 441 A.2d 84 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>185 Conn. 402, 423, 441 A.2d 119 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 989, 102 S. Ct. 1612, 71 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>supra, 574-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In finding no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the requested charge, the court stated: \u201cIn sum then, five witnesses for the state testified regarding the incident and the gunshot. The defense neither presented its own witnesses nor did it cross-examine <em>any </em>of these five witnesses regarding their testimony about the gunshot. While we agree with the defendant that jurors in criminal cases should be \u2018free to reject even uncontradicted testimony, if they do not find it credible\u2019; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dudla, </em>190 Conn. 1, 7, 458 A.2d 682 (1983); we are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s claim that the \u2018proof\u2019 differentiating robbery in the third degree from the charged offense of robbery in the first degree was \u2018sufficiently in dispute\u2019 under the fourth prong of <em>Whistnant </em>to require an instruction on the claimed lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u201cWhile this defendant, of course, was under no obligation to present evidence in his own behalf, we recognize as a practical matter that the defendant, for purposes of the <em>Whistnant </em>test, ought, in order to be entitled to a jury instruction on a lesser included offense, to endeavor to place a particular element of the crime charged \u2018sufficiently in dispute\u2019 under the fourth prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>This could occur either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>through the right of cross-examination, the major function of which is to put certain matters in dispute, or through evidence presented as part of the defendant\u2019s case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>supra, 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u201cIn this case, the defendant, as was his choice, decided not to pursue either of these courses. It is not at all improper that the defendant, requesting a lesser included offense instruction, bear an obligation, weak though it may be, to demonstrate that there is evidence \u2018sufficiently in dispute\u2019 to warrant giving the requested instruction. <em>See Rouse </em>v. <em>United States, </em>402 A.2d 1218, 1221 (D.C. App. 1979); <em>Day </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 A.2d 957, 962 (D.C. App. 1978). The fourth prong of <em>Whistnant </em>specifically requires that the \u2018proof\u2019 be \u2018sufficiently in dispute.\u2019 Such proof is \u2018sufficient\u2019 when it is \u2018marked by [a] quality [such as] to meet with the demands, wants or needs of a situation . . . .\u2019 Webster, Third New International Dictionary. In the <em>Whistnant </em>context, therefore, the proof is \u2018sufficiently in dispute\u2019 where it is of such a factual quality that would permit the finder of fact reasonably to find the defendant guilty on the lesser included offense. This requirement serves to prevent a jury from capriciously convicting on the lesser included offense when the evidence requires either conviction on the greater offense or acquittal. See <em>Sansone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>380 U.S. 343, 349-50, 85 S. Ct. 1004, 13 L. Ed. 2d 882 (1965); <em>Sparf and Hansen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 51, 63-64, 15 S. Ct. 273, 39 L. Ed. 343 (1895); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>551 F.2d 236, 239 n.4 (8th Cir. 1977). This rationale comports with the view that \u2018[f]act finding does not require mathematical certainty. [But] [j]urors are supposed to reach their conclusions on the basis of common sense, common understanding and fair beliefs, grounded on evidence consisting of direct statements by witnesses or proof of circumstances from which inferences can fairly be drawn.\u2019 <em>Schulz </em>v. <em>Pennsylva</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>nia R. Co., </em>350 U.S. 523, 526, 76 S. Ct. 608, 100 L. Ed. 668 (1956). Moreover, the trial court, in making its determination whether the proof is \u2018sufficiently in dispute,\u2019 while it must carefully assess all the evidence whatever its source, is \u2018not required to put the case to the jury on a basis [of a lesser included offense] that essentially indulges and even encourages speculations as to [a] bizarre reconstruction [of the evidence].\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>444 F.2d 888, 890 (D.C. Cir. 1971).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>supra, 578-80. Finally, it need not be stressed that the defendant never has any obligation to testify or present any evidence in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We now analyze the issue in this case through the prisms of the parties\u2019 disparate views. The state\u2019s view is that the defendant\u2019s trial strategy was to show that the victim was stabbed by one of the two other individuals he fought with that night and that he accused the defendant of stabbing him because the defendant had him charged with criminal mischief for throwing the jack.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The state claims that the jury could not have found that the defendant recklessly caused serious physical injury because their verdict of assault in the second degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (1) indicated that physical injury was caused by a dangerous instrument. They considered assault in the third degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (1) involving intent to cause physical injury with no dangerous instrument involved, and rejected it. Further, the evidence would not support assault in the third degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3) concerning conduct causing physical injury with a dangerous instrument and acting with criminal negligence. The state rules out General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (2) since the jury found, by its verdict, that a dangerous weapon was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The defendant\u2019s argument makes it clear that the state\u2019s position begs the question. Under the instructions given, the jury had available the following alternatives: (1) assault in the first degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) which requires intent to cause serious physical injury and the causing of serious physical injury by means of a dangerous instrument; (2) assault in the second degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2) which requires intent to cause physical injury and the causing of physical injury by means of a dangerous instrument; and (3) assault in the third degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (1) which requires intent to cause physical injury and the causing of physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Because of the trial court\u2019s refusal to charge on the subsections requested by the defendant, the jury was not permitted to consider either of the following: (4) assault in the third degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (2) which requires the reckless causing of physical injury; or (5) assault in the third degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3) which requires the causing of physical injury with criminal negligence by means of a dangerous instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Thus, the jury was provided legal options only with respect to the seriousness of the injury and the use of a dangerous instrument. The court\u2019s instructions and the state\u2019s position foreclosed the jury from considering whether or not the defendant recklessly or with criminal negligence assaulted the victim <em>with a dangerous instrument.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">There was much confusion in the evidence concerning the cause of Izzo\u2019s injuries. Izzo himself described the general rolling about and punching. Other witnesses for both the state and the defense testified that there was considerable physical contact, tussling, violence, and wrestling and rolling around on the ground. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>was also testimony of Izzo\u2019s intoxication and apparent belligerency and the defendant\u2019s distraught condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The case boils down to the subtle and special role of mental elements in criminal law. State of mind is essentially proven by circumstantial evidence based on inferences drawn from the circumstances of the crime. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antuono, </em>186 Conn. 414, 423, 441 A.2d 846 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>184 Conn. 400, 403-404, 439 A.2d 1040 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 404, 429 A.2d 919 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>174 Conn. 22, 26, 381 A.2d 539 (1977). Except in rare cases, it is a question of fact within the discretion of the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>supra. It is in the field of intent particularly in which the court\u2019s instructions should take special account of the jury\u2019s fact-finding responsibilities. <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979); <em>Morrissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 274, 72 S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 558, 573-74, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982). This court has very recently noted the jury\u2019s \u201cclassic function of drawing inferences of intent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dumlao, </em>3 Conn. App. 607, 619, 491 A.2d 404 (1985), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Giorgio, </em>2 Conn. App. 204, 211, 477 A.2d 134 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Four recent cases in which the Supreme Court upheld a defendant\u2019s right to a lesser included offense instruction under the evidence prong of <em>Whistnant </em>involved state of mind as the differentiating element. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Burge, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Most significantly, even identical evidence may support a jury finding of intent or recklessness (and thus, by compelling analogy, a finding of criminal negligence). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>190 Conn. 639, 652, 462 A.2d 1021 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>The state\u2019s position in this case presents a classic case of wanting to have its inference and eat it too. The whole thrust of the state\u2019s case is based on inferences from circumstantial evidence. No one saw a dangerous instrument. The state\u2019s case rested first on inference from a jumble of facts that the defendant caused the victim\u2019s injuries and, secondly, that he did so intentionally. The court's charge limited the jury to differentiation between serious physical injury and physical injury, and to the use or absence of a dangerous instrument. What\u2019s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury, which was allowed to draw inferences of intent from the tangled web of evidence should likewise have been permitted to draw inferences as to recklessness or negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The court \u201cmust appraise all the testimony and evidence to determine whether it is capable of more than one reasonable inference. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Comer, </em>421 F.2d 1149, 1154 (D.C. Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u201cWTiether the fourth prong of the test for an instruction on a lesser included offense has been satisfied is a mixed question of law and fact that the trial court is uniquely positioned to pass upon, and its determination, unless clearly erroneous, will not be reversed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>supra, 581 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">In this case, the failure to give the charge requested on lesser included offenses was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">There is error, the judgment of the trial court is set aside and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) provides, in pertinent part: <em>\u201cA </em>person is guilty of assault in the third degree when: ...
