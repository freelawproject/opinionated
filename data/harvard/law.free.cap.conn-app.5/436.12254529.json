At the trial, after the parties had rested, the court informed counsel that closing arguments would begin promptly at 10 a.m. the next day. The next morning, the defendant\u2019s counsel attended a pretrial conference in the same courthouse, which delayed his arrival in the courtroom. The trial court waited approximately sixteen minutes for the defendant\u2019s counsel, and then instructed the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to begin his summation. Counsel for the defendant entered the courtroom approximately four minutes later and immediately requested that the summation be transcribed. At the time the court reporter began transcribing the argument, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was describing the allegations of the complaint. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial on the basis that his client was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s instruction to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to begin his final argument in the absence of the defense counsel. This motion was denied. The defendant later moved for a new trial on the same grounds. This motion was likewise denied. The defendant appeals from the denial of these two motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">This appeal does not arise out of the denial of a timely motion to set aside the verdict. Such a motion \u201cis essential for a full review of claims of error . . . .\u201d <em>Pietrorazio </em>v. <em>Santopietro, </em>185 Conn. 510, 515, 441 A.2d 163 (1981); see Practice Book \u00a7 3063. In the absence of such a motion, this court\u2019s review is limited to \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>5 Conn. App. 394, 397, 499 A.2d 64 (1985); <em>Geer </em>v. <em>First National Supermarkets, Inc., </em>5 Conn. App. 175, 177, 497 A.2d 999 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">It is the defendant\u2019s burden to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s conduct constituted plain error. The trial court has inherent authority to regulate the trial of cases before it. See <em>In re Mongillo, </em>190 Conn. 686, 690-91, 461 A.2d 1387 (1983). The record indicates that the trial court sent a clerk who located the defendant\u2019s counsel and alerted him that argument was about to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">An appellate court is bound by the record and cannot consider claims that remarks of counsel made during final argument may have been prejudicial where those remarks were not recorded, and there has been no attempt to reconstruct them. See <em>Gilhuly </em>v. <em>Karazulas, </em>4 Conn. App. 440, 442, 495 A.2d 1077 (1985). Furthermore, the trial court characterized the unrecorded remarks as \u201cnot remarkable, just sort of an introductory basis.\u201d The defendant has failed to make any substantial showing of error or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
