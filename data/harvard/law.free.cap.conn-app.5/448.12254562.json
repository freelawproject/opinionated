Doolittle Road runs east and west and is intersected at its easterly end by Ross Road and at its westerly end by Miller Road. The plaintiff Doolittle\u2019s driveway intersects Doolittle Road approximately at its midpoint. The other plaintiffs either own property on or use Doolittle Road. The defendant accepted responsibility for that portion of Doolittle Road running from Ross Road west to the Doolittle driveway, and the court ordered the defendant to repair that section of the road. The court did not order the defendant to repair or maintain the portion of Doolittle Road running westerly from the Doolittle driveway to Miller Road, on two grounds: (1) in 1966, Doolittle Road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>westerly from the Doolittle driveway to Miller Road had been validly discontinued as a town road by the board of selectmen and the town meeting in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 13a-49; and (2) that portion of the road had been abandoned by public nonuser. The plaintiffs appeal only from that portion of the judgment concerning the westerly portion of Doolittle Road. The plaintiffs claim that the court erred: (1) when it decided that the selectmen and special town meeting of the town of Preston lawfully <em>discontinued </em>the westerly portion of Doolittle Road in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 13a-49, notwithstanding the fact that the selectmen voted and the town meeting approved a decision to \u201cabandon\u201d the road; (2) when it decided that the westerly portion of Doolittle Road had been abandoned by public nonuser notwithstanding allegedly substantial evidence before the court of recent public use thereof; and (3) when it decided not to order the defendant to repair and maintain the westerly portion of Doolittle Road at its own expense and not to award damages to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">There is no dispute concerning the underlying facts as found by the trial court. In 1966, the selectmen of Preston decided to discontinue certain unimproved roads before people began to build upon them as they were too expensive to maintain. On August 24, 1966, the selectmen voted to recommend to a town meeting to be held on August 30,1966, that certain roads including the westerly portion of Doolittle Road be abandoned. The town meeting voted the abandonment of the list of roads and the selectmen voted their approval of this action on September 2, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The trial court concluded that as long as the statutory method of discontinuing a road was strictly followed, thus providing the members of the town the opportunity to vote on the selectmen\u2019s recommendation, it mattered not that the word \u201cabandon\u201d was used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>rather than \u201cdiscontinue.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claim no prejudice from the use of the wrong word in that any of them was misled by the town\u2019s actions. Rather, in a supreme example of exalting form over substance, they seek to take advantage of the erroneous word to invalidate the town\u2019s 1966 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The plaintiffs strenuously argue that statutory discontinuance and common law abandonment are different things. In doing so, they beg the question. There is no doubt that the two methods of terminating a town\u2019s responsibility for a road differ. \u201cA highway may be extinguished by direct action through governmental agencies, in which case it is said to be discontinued; or by nonuser by the public for a long period of time with the intention to abandon, in which case it is said to be abandoned.\u201d <em>Greist </em>v. <em>Amrhyn, </em>80 Conn. 280, 285, 68 A. 521 (1907). The statutory method of discontinuing a highway must be strictly pursued. Id.; <em>New London </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>85 Conn. 595, 601, 84 A. 114 (1912). \u201cIn discontinuing a highway the selectmen act as agents of the law, and can exercise no powers except such as are conferred by statute. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Eastford, </em>30 Conn. 286, 288 [1861]. Their action, and the action of the town approving it, therefore, should be formal and definite, so as to give parties who may be aggrieved an opportunity to apply to the court for the relief which is provided by statute.\u201d <em>Greist </em>v. <em>Amrhyn, </em>supra, 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The plaintiffs make no claim that the defendant\u2019s action was not formal and definite or that anyone was deprived of the statutory right of appeal by the use of the wrong word. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Cornwall, </em>93 Conn. 374, 106 A. 347 (1919), is persuasive authority to uphold the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>validity of the town\u2019s actions. There, the selectmen had warned a special town meeting to take action to \u201cdiscontinue\u201d portions of a certain highway. \u201cPursuant to this warning and notice, the town meeting passed the following vote: \u2018Voted, The vote upon <em>dosing </em>the road or highway mentioned in the foregoing notice was taken as follows: 66 No, 67 Yes. Said vote was declared passed by the Chairman of the meeting.\u2019 Thereafter the selectmen of Cornwall reported, in writing, to the town, that \u2018pursuant to the vote of the town\u2019 they had discontinued two certain portions of highway within the town, describing the portions as contained in the said notice of the town meeting.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The precise issue involved in the present case was never raised in <em>Clark. </em>The issue there was whether the town could later rescind such a vote. Nevertheless, the court\u2019s analysis of the validity of the original \u201cdiscontinuance\u201d is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The selectmen in <em>Clark </em>acted under General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 1442, the predecessor of General Statutes \u00a7 13a-49, which required action by the selectmen manifested by a writing signed by them discontinuing the highway and the approbation of the town in the discontinuance. The <em>Clark </em>court stated: \u201cThe town could not manifest its approbation of the discontinuance of this road in any more pronounced way than by its vote of discontinuance. The vote of Cornwall was of the <em>precise act of discontinuance </em>of the selectmen . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Cornwall, </em>supra, 378-79. This case makes it crystal clear that the incantation of a legal \u201cabracadabra\u201d is not necessary to terminate a town road. The essence of the thing accomplished controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">That this conclusion makes common sense is supported by normal usage which often equates the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u201cdiscontinue\u201d and \u201cabandon.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines the word \u201cdiscontinue\u201d in definition number two as follows: \u201cto abandon or terminate by a discontinuance or by other legal action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We conclude that the action of the selectmen and of the town was formal and definite so as to give parties in interest and the public notice of the action taken. The statutory method of discontinuance was strictly followed so that the defendant\u2019s discontinuance of the westerly end of Doolittle road was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In view of our conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider the plaintiff\u2019s other claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 13a-49 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe selectmen of any town may, subject to approval by a majority vote at any regular or special town meeting, by a writing signed by them, discontinue any highway <em>. ... \u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> The trial court was perhaps echoing the sentiment of Richard Cardinal Cushing who, in describing Fidel Castro, said: \u201cWhen I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.\u201d New York Times, March 1, 1964.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
