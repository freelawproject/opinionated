The trial court rendered judgment ordering the mechanic\u2019s lien discharged and the defendant appealed from this judgment. The plaintiff then cross appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant had not waived its lien rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">The trial court found the following facts: Pursuant to a written agreement between the parties, executed in October, 1982, the defendant contracted to perform certain work on the plaintiff developer\u2019s property, Happy Homes Estates, located in Meriden. The scope of the work included all clearing, blasting, grading, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>landscaping, paving, construction and other work necessary to complete a roadway, sidewalks, paths, curbing, installation of water and sanitary sewer lines, storm drainage systems, erosion and sedimentation control systems and other improvements in accordance with a subdivision plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The defendant filed a mechanic\u2019s lien in the amount of $208,792, dated March 11, 1983, and recorded on March 14,1983, in the Meriden land records upon the subject property. The lien was placed on thirteen residential lots in the subdivision. Some of these lots had already been built upon and sold by the plaintiff. It purports to cover site development work performed by the defendant pursuant to the contract from September or October, 1982, through January 14, 1983. The lien is in blanket form and does not identify the specific work done or materials furnished to any particular house or lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The trial court concluded that the lien was invalid because it failed to conform to the lienable unit requirements and because its blanket single form of certificate failed to identify the particular premises against which the lien is claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The trial court further found that since the defendant had removed its equipment and ceased working in the middle of December, 1982, work thereafter demanded of the defendant by the city inland wetland agency, which was concluded on January 14,1983, did not toll the sixty day requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 49-34.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The defendant claims that the trial court erred in concluding (1) that the mechanic\u2019s lien was invalid because it violated the \u201clienable unit\u201d test, (2) that the work was completed in December, 1982, and (3) that the defendant failed to prove the validity of the lien by clear and convincing evidence. The plaintiff claims in her cross appeal that the trial court erred (1) in excluding paragraph seven from the written agreement, which paragraph provided for a waiver of the defendant\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien rights, on the basis that there was no meeting of the minds between the parties; and (2) in discounting an oral waiver of mechanic\u2019s lien stipulated to by the parties in open court in a separate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Our cases construing the language of General Statutes \u00a7 49-33, before it was amended effective October 1, 1974, required, as a condition of lienability, that the work done be incorporated in or utilized in the building or appurtenance to be constructed, raised, removed or repaired. <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>180 Conn. 545, 552, 429 A.2d 796 (1980). This was the so-called \u201clienable unit\u201d theory. <em>In re Glen Haven Estates, </em>123 F. Sup. 659, 660-61 (D. Conn. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">When General Statutes \u00a7 49-33<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was amended in 1974, the mechanic\u2019s lien was extended to encompass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>claims for materials furnished or services rendered \u201c \u2018in the improvement of any lot or in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land . . . <em>\u2019\"Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>supra, 553-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u201cAlthough the legislative history of the amended \u00a7 49-33 is, as is often true, somewhat murky, it is consistent with an intention to expand the coverage of the mechanic\u2019s lien.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Id., 554. Footnote six in <em>Camputaro, </em>which discusses the legislative history, provides: \u201cPublic Acts 1974, No. 74-310 expanded the scope of General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 to include the terms \u2018the improvement of any lot\u2019 and \u2018the site development or subdivision of any plot of land.\u2019 It is the first of these additions, \u2018the improvement of any lot,\u2019 that is at issue in the present case. In commenting on an amendment to the bill, which was subsequently enacted as Public Acts 1974, No. 74-310, the reporting committee chairman in the House of Representatives stated: \u2018We still have an extension of the mechanic\u2019s lien even though we don\u2019t have an extension of the time to file it. You can file it against the property or sub-division whereas heretofore you could only file it against the house that was being worked on, the building.\u2019 And again, in response to the question, \u2018Does he contend that it\u2019s the amendment that extends the applicability of the land or is it the Ml itself . . . ,\u2019 the reporting committee chairman, Representative Newman responded: \u2018The bill, of course, sir.\u2019 17 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9,1974 Sess., pp. 4138, 4140. Compare the comments of the reporting committee chairman in the Senate, Senator Rome, who stated: \u2018The bill now as amended would provide that sub-dividers of land, persons who might also be doing site work on the land would have lien rights. The question is, under the existing court adjudications, whether or not that (sic) have or have not those rights. This clearly spells it out. They do . . . .\u2019 17 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1974 Sess., p. 1338.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>supra, 554-55 n.6. We conclude that the statute as amended eliminated the \u201clienable unit\u201d requirement from this defendant\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The defendant believed that his task was completed on December 7, 1982, but, at the demand of the city inland wetland agency, returned to perform work on the level spreader<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which was completed on January 14, 1983. The level spreader is located in the vicinity of lot No. twenty-six, and was of value to every lot in the subdivision. All lots in the subdivision will benefit from the erosion protection provided by it. We hre equating the demand of the city inland wetland agency as work performed for the benefit of the whole development. Hence, the lien falls within the site development purview of General Statutes \u00a7 49-33, as amended. We conclude that the filing of the mechanic\u2019s lien on March 14,1983, complied with General Statutes \u00a7 49-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In view of our finding of error as indicated, it is unnecessary to consider the issue of burden of proof relative to the defendant\u2019s appeal. We note, however, that under General Statutes \u00a7 49-35b (a), t-he defendant was only required to establish that there was probable cause to sustain the validity of its lien. The defendant\u2019s burden of proof is not that required of the plaintiff, who is next entitled to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, the invalidity of the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The remaining question of whether the trial court properly concluded that the defendant had not waived its mechanic\u2019s lien rights is raised by the cross appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The Supreme Court \u201chas repeatedly declared that \u2018what the parties intended to encompass in their contractual commitments is a question of the intention of the parties, and an inference of fact.\u2019 ... As such, the findings of the trial court may be overturned only if clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Gallicchio Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Oil Co., </em>191 Conn. 104, 107, 463 A.2d 600 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The continued demands by the plaintiff for lien waivers from the defendant during December and January support the trial court\u2019s finding that the lien waiver clause was not part of the written agreement of October, 1982. This issue presents a question of fact for the trier. Where, as here, the evidence is in conflict, its probative force is for the trier. <em>Robert Lawrence Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Del Vecchio, </em>178 Conn. 1, 14, 420 A.2d 1142 (1979); Holden &amp; Daly, Connecticut Evidence (1966 &amp; Sup. 1983) \u00a7 125 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The same applies to the oral waiver agreement stipulated to in open court on February 22, 1983. Its relevancy was a matter for the trial court. The relevance of evidence is up to the trier. Holden &amp; Daly, supra. This court cannot retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Flammia, </em>169 Conn. 491, 497, 363 A.2d 1048 (1975). The trial court determined that there had been no waiver of the mechanic\u2019s lien contained in the initial agreement despite counsel\u2019s statement before a different trial court. We will not disturb this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA mechanic\u2019s lien is not valid, unless the person performing the services or furnishing the materials, (1) within sixty days after he has ceased to do so, lodges with the town clerk of the town in which the building, lot or plot of land is situated a certificate in writing . . . . \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 provides: \u201cmechanic\u2019s lien, precedence. RIGHTS OF SUBCONTRACTORS, (a) If any person has a claim for more than ten dollars for materials furnished or services rendered in the construction, raising, removal or repairs of any building or any of its appurtenances or in the improvement of any lot or in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land, and the claim is by virtue of an agreement with or by consent of the owner of the land upon which the building is being erected or has been erected or has been moved, or by consent of the owner of the lot being improved or by consent of the owner of the plot of land being improved or subdivided, or of some person having authority from or rightfully acting for the owner in procuring the labor or materials, the building, with the land on which it stands or the lot or in the event that the materials were furnished or services were rendered in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land, then the plot of land, is subject to the payment of the claim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\"> A level spreader is a term used in hydrology, and concerns the movement of water.
