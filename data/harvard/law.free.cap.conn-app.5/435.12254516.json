The trial court found that title was conveyed to the plaintiff by means of an instrument dated June 27, 1976. The instrument lacked the acknowledgment required by General Statutes \u00a7 47-5. The court found, however, that this defect was remedied by a curative act. See Spec. Acts 1983, No. 83-7, \u00a7 12. The defendant claims that the trial court erred in finding that the defective instrument was validated by the curative act. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">The defendant\u2019s argument rests upon the fact that the June, 1976 instrument, \u201cgiving\u201d the plaintiff her interest in the real estate in question, was recorded on the same date as another document dated August, 1979, purporting to \u201cleave\u201d to the plaintiff the same property. At oral argument, the defendant\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>conceded that had the later document not been recorded, there would be no basis for an appeal. The defendant contends that these documents, read together, raise an issue of the donor\u2019s intent, and that they evidence the donor\u2019s desire to devise property to the plaintiff. Therefore, the defendant claims, the curative act does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The recording date of the instruments has no logical relation to the donor\u2019s intent. The documents were not recorded by the donor, having been recorded after her death. The trial court\u2019s finding that the donor intended to convey real property was not clearly erroneous. <em>Spatola </em>v. <em>Spatola, </em>4 Conn.
