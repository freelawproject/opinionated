The plaintiff, Errol Atkins, instituted a two count complaint against the defendant, Bridgeport Hydraulic Company, alleging wrongful discharge from employment and seeking rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>statement and damages. From the granting of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant from November, 1971, until January 28,1983. The plaintiff lodged three complaints with the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities (CHRO). The first complaint, filed on August 17, 1982, claimed that he had been denied a promotion due to his race. The second, filed on September 1, 1982, alleged that he received a disciplinary suspension because of his race and because he had initiated the first complaint. The third, filed subsequent to the termination of his employment, on February 1, 1983, claimed that his discharge was retaliatory and racially motivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">On September 7,1983, the CHRO dismissed all three complaints as being unsupported by the evidence. A request for reconsideration was denied by letter dated September 30,1983, which noted that the time period applicable to an appeal was thirty days for service upon the parties. The plaintiff let the time limit pass and served the defendant with notice on the thirty-first day, Monday, October 31, 1983. The CHRO, although not named as a party, was provided with a copy of the action against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The trial court, in rendering summary judgment for the defendant, found that the plaintiff had failed to follow the statutory route of appeal, and that the independent action was not an appeal and was therefore improper. In his appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that the trial court incorrectly concluded from the dismissals by the CHRO that this action was not an appeal, and that the plaintiff could not bring a separate and independent action.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>The plaintiff contends that the present action constitutes an appeal to a court from a decision by an administrative agency. In the sense of transferring jurisdiction from one court to another, however, this is not an \u201cappeal\u201d but merely \u201ca process, under the misleading name of appeal, for invoking the judicial power to determine a legal injury complained of, or the legality of an act done by the officers of another department.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>173 Conn. 408, 411, 378 A.2d 519 (1977), quoting <em>Mahno\u2019s Appeal, </em>72 Conn. 1, 6, 43 A. 485 (1899). While purportedly challenging the action of the CHRO in dismissing his complaints, the plaintiff has proceeded against the defendant seeking to compel reinstatement and the award of monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Even if we assume arguendo that the plaintiff has filed an appeal, General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cCopies of the petition shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record . . . within thirty days after mailing of the notice of the decision thereon, except that service upon an agency may be made by the appellant mailing a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, without the use of a sheriff or other officer, to the office of the commissioner of the agency or to the office of the attorney general in Hartford.\u201d The plaintiff failed to serve process timely or properly within the proscriptions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\u201cWithout a citation signed by competent authority, the officer to whom it is given for service receives no power or authority to execute its command, and becomes \u2018little more than a deliveryman.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 413; <em>Village Creek Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>148 Conn. 336, 339, 170 A.2d 732 (1961). \u201cThe citation is a matter separate and distinct from the sheriff\u2019s return and is the important legal fact upon which the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ment rests. ... A proper citation is essential to the validity of the appeal and the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Village Creek Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>supra. The purpose of General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b) is not to obviate the need for a citation, but rather to permit service upon the administrative agency in a manner different from ordinary civil actions, that is, by registered or certified mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Appeals to courts from administrative agencies may only be brought under statutory authority and only by strict compliance with the statutory provisions by which they are allowed. <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>177 Conn. 584, 587, 418 A.2d 939 (1979); <em>Newtown </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>3 Conn. App. 416, 488 A.2d 1286 (1985); <em>Board of Educations. State Board of Education, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 712, 717, 461 A.2d 997 (1983). Statutory time provisions which specify when an appeal must be taken are designed to facilitate a speedy determination of the case. The element of time represents not merely a procedural limitation but is an essential part of the remedy. \u201cSuch provisions are mandatory, and, if not complied with, render the appeal subject to [dismissal].\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Norwich Land Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, </em>170 Conn. 1, 6, 363 A.2d 1386 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Where the last day to appeal fell on Sunday, as was the case here, service of process on the following day did not satisfy the statutory requirements. <em>Souza v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>25 Conn. Sup. 174, 176, 199 A.2d 170 (1964). Furthermore, restrictions on the service of process on Sundays were abolished upon the repealing of General Statutes \u00a7 52-71 by Public Acts 1976, No. 76-415, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The process of filing a complaint based on a discriminatory practice is clearly outlined in General Statutes \u00a7 46a-83 (a) which provides in pertinent part that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>\u201cafter the filing of any discriminatory practice complaint, the chairman of the commission shall refer the same to a commissioner or investigator to investigate and if . . . [he] determines . . . that there is reasonable cause for believing that a discriminatory practice has been or is being committed as alleged in the complaint, he shall endeavor to eliminate the practice complained of by conference, conciliation and persuasion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">If these informal procedures are unsuccessful, the CHRO must certify the complaint, hold a hearing and order appropriate relief. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-84, 46a-86. Thereafter, any party aggrieved by a final order of the CHRO may appeal to the Superior Court. General Statutes \u00a7 46a-95 (j). Under the discriminatory practice statutes, the CHRO is charged \u201cwith initial responsibility for the investigation and adjudication of claims of employment discrimination. That the act does not provide an unconditional private right of action for claimants like the plaintiff is underscored by the terms of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-99, which expressly provides such a direct right of action when the allegedly discriminatory employer is a state agency.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>196 Conn. 208, 216, 491 A.2d 1096 (1985). \u201cBecause the plaintiff failed to follow the administrative route prescribed by the legislature for his claim of discrimination, he lacks the statutory authority to pursue that claim in the Superior Court.\u201d <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Rocklen Automotive Parts &amp; Service, Inc., </em>4 Conn. App. 423, 425, 494 A.2d 622 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff had available to him administrative remedies that could have afforded him meaningful relief under the statutes that govern his claim of discrimination. His failure to exhaust his appellate review procedures after bringing his complaint to the CHRO forecloses his access to judicial relief, because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to hear his complaint.\u201d Id., 425-26; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 217-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Count two alleges that, in terminating the plaintiff, the defendant violated Connecticut\u2019s public policy regarding employment practices. A cause of action for wrongful discharge is only recognized where public policy is clearly contravened. <em>Sheets, </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 475, 427 A.2d 385 (1980). <em>\u201cA </em>finding that certain conduct contravenes public policy is not enough by itself to warrant the creation of a contract remedy for wrongful dismissal by an employer. The cases which have established a tort or contract remedy for employees discharged for reasons violative of public policy have relied upon the fact that in the context of their case the employee was otherwise without remedy and that permitting the discharge to go unredressed would leave a valuable social policy to go unvindicated.\u201d <em>Wehr </em>v. <em>Burroughs Corporation, </em>438 F. Sup. 1052, 1054 (E.D. Pa. 177). In <em>Sullivan, </em>the public policy against age discrimination was adequately enforceable through statutory remedies and did not warrant judicial recognition of an independent cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The trial court was correct in ruling that the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to bring an independent cause of action did not constitute an appeal and that the failure to exhaust the appellate review procedures under the Fair Employment Act deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
