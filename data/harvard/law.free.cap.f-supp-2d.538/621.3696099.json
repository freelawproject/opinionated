KAPLAN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b663-22\">On December 2, 2006, Pfizer, Inc. (\u201cPfizer\u201d) announced that it was halting clinical trials of the developmental drug torcetra-pib.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By the close of the next trading day, the price of Pfizer common stock had declined by 10.62 percent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs then brought a class action against Pfizer and three of its current and former officers and directors (collectively, the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs seek recovery against defendants under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They assert an additional claim against the Individual Defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The case is before the Court on defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-23\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-24\">The lead plaintiff in this action is the Uniformed Sanitationmen\u2019s Association Compensation Accrual Fund. It purports to represent a class of all individuals and entities who purchased Pfizer securities between January 19, 2005, and December 2, 2006, (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). Pfizer is a Delaware corporation that develops, manufactures, and markets prescription medicines and consumer healthcare products.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>During the class period, Pfizer was developing torcetrapib, a drug intended to reduce coronary heart disease (\u201cCHD\u201d) by raising so-called \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">In colloquial terms, there are two varieties of cholesterol: \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol. Whether cholesterol is good or bad is defined by the type of lipoprotein to which the cholesterol is attached. Low density lipoproteins (\u201cLDLs\u201d) carry cholesterol into arteries, where excess cholesterol often is deposited as plaque on arterial walls. The deposition of plaque \u2014 a process known as atherogenesis<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 narrows arteries and restricts the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the cholesterol attached to LDLs (\u201cLDL-cholesterol\u201d) is known popularly as bad cholesterol. In contrast, high density lipopro-teins (\u201cHDLs\u201d) remove cholesterol from the blood, transporting it to the liver for excretion, a process known as reverse cholesterol transport (\u201cRCT\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the cholesterol attached to HDLs (\u201cHDL-cholesterol\u201d) is known popularly as good cholesterol.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">High HDL-cholesterol levels correlate generally with low cardiovascular risk,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a fact attributed to HDL\u2019s role in RCT.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Pfizer developed torcetrapib to raise HDL-cholesterol. It anticipated that torcetrapib would accomplish this by inhibiting the cholesterol ester transfer protein (\u201cCETP\u201d), which transfers cholesterol between HDLs and LDLs. This was intended to raise HDL-cholesterol levels by causing cholesterol to accumulate on HDL particles. Ultimately, Pfizer hoped artificially raising HDL-cholesterol would increase RCT and correlate with low cardiovascular risk.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">Phase II clinical tests of torcetrapib were designed to determine whether torce-trapib raised HDL-cholesterol levels.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Those trials showed that torcetrapib was effective at raising HDL-cholesterol, but they showed also a 2-3 mm increase in systolic blood pressure.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">By 2004, Pfizer began Phase III of the clinical trials. As the clinical trials progressed, Pfizer updated the medical and financial communities on torcetrapib\u2019s development through public statements and press releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">On December 2, 2006, Pfizer announced that it was \u201cstopping all torcetrapib clinical trials\u201d based on the recommendation of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (\u201cDSMB\u201d) that monitored the trials. The recommendation was made \u201cbecause of an imbalance of mortality and cardiovascular events.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Following this announcement, shares of Pfizer common stock declined by $2.96 per share, from a closing price of $27.86 per share on December 1, 2006, to a closing price of $24.90 per share on December 4, 2006.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-17\">Plaintiffs allege that defendants, in the period prior to the cessation of Phase III trials, intentionally or recklessly made statements that were misleading because they failed to disclose facts that lessened the likelihood that torcetrapib ultimately would prove safe and efficacious. The misleading statements, plaintiffs claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>were \u201cdesigned to artificially inflate the price of Pfizer securities\u201d and were part of a \u201cdesperate effort to avert significant market loss due to the impending loss of patent protection by principal Pfizer drugs .<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that defendant McKinnell was motivated to maximize his severance package, but do not allege that any Individual Defendant sold stock during the class period.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\n<em>I. Standard Governing Motions to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">In deciding a motion to dismiss, the Court ordinarily accepts as true all well-pleaded factual allegations and draws all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In order to survive such a motion, however, \u201cthe plaintiff must provide the grounds upon which his claim rests through factual allegations sufficient \u2018to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Although this motion is addressed to the face of the pleadings, the Court may consider also the full text of \u201cdocuments incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Defendants have submitted many exhibits in support of their motion, including Pfizer press releases and analyst call transcripts, academic literature, and analyst reports. The parties agreed that all of these documents could be considered on this motion to dismiss,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and the Court considers those documents that the complaint incorporates by reference or are amenable to judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-19\">As this is a securities fraud case, the complaint must satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPSLRA\u201d).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It must state the circumstances constituting fraud with particularity. In particular, it \u201cmust: (1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Where an allegation regarding a misstatement or omission is made on information and belief, \u201cthe complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Finally, the complaint must \u201cstate with particulari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>ty facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">\n<em>II. Plaintiffs\u2019Section 10(b) Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AVl\">\n<em>A. Elements of a 10(b) Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1A\">Section 10(b) makes it unlawful \u201cfor any person, directly or indirectly ... [t]o use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security ..., any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.\u201d Rule 10b-5 in turn provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">To state a claim based on a misrepresentation or omission in violation of Rule 10b-5, as plaintiffs purport to do here, one must allege that a defendant \u201c(1) made misstatements or omissions of material fact; (2) with scienter; (3) in connection with the purchase or sale of securities; (4) upon which plaintiffs relied; and (5) that plaintiffs\u2019 reliance was the proximate cause of their injury.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">\n<em>B. Allegations that Statements were Materially Misleading</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b666-16\">Defendants argue that plaintiffs have not pleaded with particularity facts sufficient to support the belief that defendants\u2019 statements were materially misleading. Plaintiffs, however, contend that they have alleged sufficiently that defendants\u2019 statements misrepresented (1) toreetrapib\u2019s potential for reducing artherosclerosis, and (2) the seriousness of its side effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-17\">Plaintiffs must do more than allege that statements were materially misleading: \u201cthey must demonstrate with specificity why and how that is so.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Where, as here, factual allegations are made on information and belief, the complaint must allege adequate bases for the allegations.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It \u201cmust identify sufficiently the sources upon which [plaintiffs\u2019] beliefs are based and those sources must have been likely to have known the relevant facts.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Second, the factual allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>that are based on adequate sources must justify plaintiffs\u2019 conclusion that defendants\u2019 statements about torcetrapib\u2019s were materially misleading.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> An omission is materially misleading if \u201cthere [is] a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">\n<em>1. Torcetrapib\u2019s Efficacy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AFq\">Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that defendants\u2019 statements were misleading because they cast the likelihood that torcetrapib would prove to be effective in a positive light when in fact this was unlikely.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> They rest this allegation on four subsidiary assertions: (1) a study showed that \u201cRCT was not increased by torcetrapib,\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> (2) another study \u201cdemonstrated only that the patients who took torcetrapib were no worse off than those who did not in terms of cholesterol removal ...,\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> (3) \u201cthere was conflicting evidence on whether CETP inhibition [the mechanism by which torcetrapib raised HDL] was pro- or anti-atherogenic,\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and (4) \u201cPfizer had been warned internally that CETP inhibition would not work.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> None, however, withstands analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">\n<em>(a) Do the Cited Sources Support Plaintiffs\u2019 Subsidiary Allegations?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">The allegation that RCT was not increased by torcetrapib is said to be based on the Brousseau study.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 allegation, however, Brousseau did not reach any conclusion about whether torcetrapib increased RCT.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In fact, the study observed only that torcetrapib did not affect fecal concentrations of neutral sterols and bile acids, which it used to assess RCT indirectly. But it noted also that these surrogates might not be affected by an increase in RCT if torcetrapib were associated with \u201ca decrease in hepatic cholesterol synthesis and a proportional increase in cholesterol synthesis in the peripheral tissues.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The complaint\u2019s reliance on Brousseau therefore is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The claim that another study showed only that patients on torcetrapib were no worse off in terms of cholesterol removal than others rests on the Bamberger study abstract.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Plaintiffs suggest that Bam-berger observed no affirmative evidence of cholesterol removal. In fact, however, the abstract reported statistically significant increases in the two measures of cholesterol removal that were observed and concluded that \u201cpartial inhibition of CETP with T[oreetrapib] does not compromise, <em>and may enhance, </em>the cholesterol efflux potential of HDL, which is considered the first step in reverse cholesterol transport.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of Bamberger, like their characterization of Brousseau, is misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 third allegation is based on scientific articles published between 1993 and 2006.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> These sources support plaintiffs\u2019 allegation \u201cthat there was conflicting evidence\u201d about torcetrapib\u2019s potential efficacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 final and most significant allegation \u2014 viz. that Pfizer had been warned internally that CETP inhibition would not work \u2014 is based entirely on an anonymous blog post.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have identified their source \u2014 the text of the blog post \u2014 and included its full text in their complaint. But this is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">In addition to identifying the source, the source must be shown to have been likely to know the relevant facts.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> There is no reason to believe that the author of this blog, identified only as RADmanZulu, is likely to have known the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">Plaintiffs try to avoid this inevitable conclusion by attributing characteristics to the blog\u2019s anonymous author. They assert that RADmanZulu is \u201ca former Pfizer Vice-President and Medical Therapeutic Head of Pfizer\u2019s Cardiovascular <em>&amp; </em>Metabolic Group, who also acted as medical director of Pfizer\u2019s Cardiovascular Risk Factors Group in the [United States] ... [through the second half of 2002].\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> But the blog post, plaintiffs\u2019 purported source, does not contain any information about RADmanZulu\u2019s identity, and plaintiffs do not articulate any other basis for their belief.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Even if we credited plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that RADmanZulu was employed at Pfizer through the end of 2002, the question of whether he would have been likely to know the relevant facts would remain. In the blog post, RADmanZulu claims that, \u201c[e]arly in the program, people like Brian Brewer and Michael Brown warned Pfizer that blocking CETP was likely to accelerate atherosclerosis.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> To support the inference that RADmanZulu would have been likely to know the relevant facts, plaintiffs rely entirely on his alleged positions at Pfizer.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> But the complaint does not describe RADmanZulu\u2019s role at Pfizer or his participation in relevant events. Moreover, RADmanZulu\u2019s allegation does not claim to be based on personal knowledge and lacks detail that might suggest personal knowledge. For example, the blog post does not describe when,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> how, on what basis, by whom, or to whom the alleged warning was communicated. Even setting aside the numerous deficiencies with this source, RADmanZulu\u2019s assertion that someone warned Pfizer that CETP inhibition was likely to accelerate atherosclerosis does not support plaintiffs\u2019 larger claim that Pfizer was warned it would not work.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\n<em>(b) Does the Sufficiently Sourced Subsidiary Allegation Justify Plaintiffs\u2019 Inference?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The next question is whether the facts alleged, to the extent they are based on adequate sources, support plaintiffs\u2019 inference that torcetrapib was unlikely to reduce artherosclerosis and thus made defendants\u2019 positive statements materially misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">Only one of plaintiffs\u2019 subsidiary allegations is supported by adequate sources\u2014 viz. that there was conflicting evidence on whether CETP inhibition was pro- or anti-atherogenic. Drawing all inferences in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the most this allegation supports is an inference that evidence available during the class period was inconclusive on torcetrapib\u2019s potential efficacy-</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">Defendants\u2019 knowledge that evidence of torcetrapib\u2019s efficacy was inconclusive does not support an inference that their optimistic statements were materially misleading. Defendants were entitled to take an optimistic view of inconclusive evidence, so long as they did not make positive statements while withholding negative information that would have been material to an investor.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> \u201c[Corporate officials need not present an overly gloomy or cautious picture\u201d so long as \u201cpublic statements are consistent with reasonably available data.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">This principle is applicable in the drug development context. In the <em>Carter-Wallace </em>cases, \u201cthe Second Circuit concluded that the drug manufacturer\u2019s assurances about safety \u2018did not become materially misleading until [it] had information that [the drug] had caused a statistically significant number of ... deaths and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>had reason to believe that the commercial viability of [the drug] was threatened.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\">To be sure, <em>Carter-Wallace </em>did not adopt a bright-line rule that a statement is materially misleading only if it conflicts with statistically significant evidence.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Thus, if a drug manufacturer in fact draws a pessimistic conclusion from statistically insignificant evidence, any optimistic statements it makes could be rendered materially misleading if it were to omit even statistically insignificant negative evidence.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> But plaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not support an inference that defendants actually drew a negative conclusion from the inconclusive evidence.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> They allege only that Pfizer\u2019s optimistic statements were misleading because it failed to state also that there was conflicting evidence as to whether CETP inhibition would be pro- or anti-atherogenic. This is insufficient under <em>Carter-Wallace.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Furthermore, while plaintiffs assert that the allegedly omitted facts relating to torcetrapib\u2019s efficacy were material, allegations in the complaint belie that claim.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> An omission is material if there is \u201ca substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information made available.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> In this case, it is clear that the conflicting evidence of torcetrapib\u2019s efficacy was part of the total mix of information available to the market.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">Plaintiffs argue that there is a factual question about whether investors \u201cread and digested\u201d the available information.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> But the relevant inquiry is not whether the truth was absorbed by the market, but whether it was available to the market.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Moreover, the complaint here alleges that the market absorbed all available informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> This allegation allows plaintiffs to avoid a fact intensive question of whether the market actually was aware of defendants\u2019 alleged misstatements. But it simplifies also the question of whether the market was aware of the allegedly omitted facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">It is evident that the allegedly omitted information was available to the market because plaintiffs, in their effort to identify allegedly omitted information, rely entirely on sources that were available publicly during the class period.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Indeed, analysts\u2019 reports acknowledged the conflicting evidence of torcetrapib\u2019s efficacy.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> According to plaintiffs, such reports were \u201cpublicly available and entered the public marketplace.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Finally, plaintiffs argue that the sudden drop in stock price after the \u201crevelation of previously undisclosed information\u201d prevents a conclusion that the allegedly omitted information was absorbed by the market. This is not persuasive. The drop in stock price did not follow the revelation of the allegedly omitted fact \u2014 that there was conflicting evidence about tor-cetrapib\u2019s efficacy. Rather, as plaintiffs explain elsewhere in the complaint, it followed the \u201csudden news ... that the clinical trials were being halted,\u201d a development that was significant independent of whether there previously had been conflicting evidence of torcetrapib\u2019s efficacy.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-16\">\n<em>2. Blood Pressure Side Effect</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A_et\">Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> that defendants\u2019 optimistic statements about torcetrapib\u2019s side effects were misleading because its side effects were unmanageable.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> This assertion rests on subsidiary assertions that: (1) even small increases in systolic blood pressure may be dangerous,<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> and (2) \u201cPfizer believed, but did not disclose, that the metabolite(s) of torcetrapib could inhibit [monoamine oxi-dase], thereby causing increased blood pressure ....\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-17\"><em>(a) Do the Cited Sources Support Plaintiffs\u2019 Subsidiary </em>Allegations.?</p>\n<p id=\"Apd\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first allegation is based on scientific research and statements made by Pfizer in other contexts.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>sources support plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegation that even small increases in blood pressure may be dangerous. However, this does not lead inevitably to the inference that the side effect was unmanageable or unjustifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second allegation is based on the same RADmanZulu blog post discussed above.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> RADmanZulu asserted that \u201c[t]he current wisdom of the time is that one of the metabolites inhibited mono amine oxidase.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Even if we assume, as plaintiffs do, that RADmanZulu was employed at Pfizer through the second half of 2002, this source would be insufficient to support plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that \u201cPfizer believed\u201d that torcetrapib could inhibit mo-noamine oxidase. RADmanZulu\u2019s assertion is vague: it does not claim a basis for personal knowledge, nor does it explain when, by whom, or on what basis the \u201ccurrent wisdom of the time\u201d was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">\n<em>(b) Does the Sufficiently Sourced Subsidiary Allegation Justify Plaintiffs\u2019 Inference?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Drawing all inferences in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations and sources support an inference that small increases in blood pressure can be dangerous. But plaintiffs\u2019 sources and factual allegations do not support the inference that torcetrapib\u2019s side effects were unmanageable. Nor do the sources or factual allegations support an inference that defendants actually believed the side effect was unmanageable. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 own source, the blog post, undermines any inference that Pfizer believed the blood pressure side effect was unmanageable. According to RADmanZulu: \u201cThe Groton team felt that [blood pressure] could be managed by lowering the dose and hoped that atorvastatin would also lower [blood pressure].\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">Finally, torcetrapib\u2019s ultimate failure is not evidence that the side effects were thought to be unmanageable at the time the alleged misstatements were made. Fraud-by-hindsight is not sufficient to establish liability under Rule 10b-5.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> In any case, plaintiffs have not alleged that torcetrapib failed because its side effects were unmanageable.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> They acknowledge that the most they can allege is that torce-trapib failed because \u201cthere was a difference in deaths between the group which got the drug and the group that didn\u2019t.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> * * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">Plaintiffs have not pleaded with particularity facts sufficient to support their allegation that defendants\u2019 statements were materially misleading. Many of plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations are not based on an adequate source or are unsupported by the purported source. Those allegations that are based on adequate sources do not support the inference that defendants\u2019 statements about torcetrapib\u2019s safety or efficacy were materially misleading. For the foregoing reasons, the complaint fails to state the circumstances constituting fraud with particularity as required by Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>C. </em>Scienter</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Even if the complaint had pleaded adequately the circumstances constituting fraud, it would be insufficient nonetheless. Plaintiffs must \u201cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that [each] defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> A complaint may satisfy this requirement \u201cby alleging facts (1) showing that defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit the fraud or (2) constituting strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior.\u201d <footnotemark>81</footnotemark> A complaint gives rise to a strong inference of <em>scienter </em>\u201conly if a reasonable person would deem the inference of <em>scienter </em>cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">\n<em>1. Motive and Opportunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">To plead motive, plaintiffs must allege facts demonstrating \u201cconcrete benefits that could be realized by one or more of the false statements and wrongful nondisclosures alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> It is not sufficient to allege motives that are \u201cgenerally possessed by most corporate directors and officers.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> And \u201c[g]eneral allegations that the defendants acted in their economic self-interest\u201d are insufficient.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-15\">Plaintiffs attempt to plead motive by alleging that Pfizer had a \u201cdesperate need ... to assure the financial community of the existence of a new blockbuster drug.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> This is not a unique motive. Rather, it is a way of saying, in a manner tailored to a pharmaceutical company, something that is true for all profit enterprises \u2014 each has an incentive to portray the likelihood that it will continue to prosper.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-16\">Courts in this district have found similar allegations of motive Insufficient. For example, plaintiffs in <em>In re Bayer </em>sought to plead motive by alleging that \u201c[Bayer] was under pressure to bring a \u2018blockbuster drug to market.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>87</footnotemark> And in <em>In re Bristol-Myers Squibb, </em>the plaintiffs alleged motive based on the defendants\u2019 desire to \u201c \u2018maintain a facade of future potential\u2019 for [its] drug pipeline, ... [and to] address potential concerns about patent expirations ....\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Both courts found these allegations insufficient. The latter court described such allegations as \u201cnothing more than a pejorative characterization of ... ordinary corporate desires.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-17\">Plaintiffs argue that McKinnell had motive to commit fraud in order to increase his severance package.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Performance based compensation plans \u201care typical of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>nearly every corporation\u201d and are usually insufficient to plead motive.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> \u201cIf scienter could be pleaded on that basis alone, virtually every company in the United States that experiences a downturn in stock price could be forced to defend securities fraud actions.\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to distinguish McKinnell\u2019s severance agreement from generic performance-based compensation plans is disingenuous.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">\n<em>2. Conscious Misbehavior or Recklessness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">To raise a strong inference of <em>scienter </em>based on recklessness, plaintiffs must allege conduct that is \u201chighly unreasonable and which represents an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> If a complaint fails adequately to allege motive, \u201cthe strength of the circumstantial allegations of conscious misbehavior or recklessness \u2018must be correspondingly greater.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> \u201cWhere the complaint alleges that defendants knew facts or had access to non-public information contradicting their public statements, recklessness is adequately pled for defendants who knew or should have known they were misrepresenting material facts ....\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">Plaintiffs attempt create a strong inference of <em>scienter </em>by alleging that: (1) defendants had knowledge or access to information contradicting their public statements,<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> (2) \u201cPfizer intentionally established endpoints for the Phase II trial of increased HDL-[eholesterol] in order to ensure that the endpoints would be obtained, knowing full well that such endpoints ... potentially were associated with increased coronary heart risk,\u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> (3) \u201cPfizer intentionally violated AHA [American Heart Association] Rules in order to pre-announce its Phase III clinical results in order to \u2018spin\u2019 the adverse blood pressure side effect results found therein,\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> and (4) \u201cPfizer knowingly designed the torcetrapib Phase III trials to allow the trial to continue until an unreasonably high statistical certainty was met.\u201d<footnotemark>100</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">Plaintiffs rely on the same factual allegations and sources to assert defendants\u2019 knowledge of or access to information contradicting their public statements. As addressed above, plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations and sources do not support the inference that defendants\u2019 statements were materially misleading. \u201cIf the facts al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>leged in the Complaint are insufficient to support Plaintiffs\u2019 belief that false or misleading statements were made, those facts cannot support an inference that Defendants knew or should have known their statements were false or misleading when Defendants made them.\u201d<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Even if plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations about torcetrapib\u2019s efficacy and safety could be understood as contradicting defendants\u2019 statements, the contradictory information was publicly available.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Numerous courts have suggested or assumed that the contradictory information must have been non-public in order to raise a strong inference of intent.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> That the information was publicly available when the allegedly misleading statements were made weakens any inference that defendants intended to defraud the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining allegations are con-clusory statements of defendants\u2019 intent. The complaint makes no factual allegations that suggest that Pfizer violated AHA rules in order to spin the results, or that Pfizer designed Phase II studies to avoid uncovering adverse clinical results, or that Pfizer used an unreasonably high measure of statistical significance to postpone termination of Phase III.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> Conclusory allegations of intent are not sufficient.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> Plaintiffs cannot circumvent this requirement by providing subsidiary allegations that merely are conclusory allegations of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">\n<em>III. Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 20(a) Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">Plaintiffs assert also claims under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> against the individual defendants. Section 20(a) claims are necessarily predicated on a primary violation of securities law and impose \u201ccontrol person\u201d liability on individual defendants.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Because plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for a primary violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, their Section 20(a) claim must be dismissed against all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">For the foregoing reasons, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended complaint [docket item 13] is granted.
