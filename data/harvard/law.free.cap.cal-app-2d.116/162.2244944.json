B. Winston had attempted to make a U-turn at a place other than an intersection, but had not completed the turn. \u201cHis (Winston\u2019s) front wheel struck against the east curb. The motor stalled. . . . His starter was working satisfactorily but he never tried to move his car by means of the starter so that it would be parallel to the curb and within 18 inches thereof,\u201d as required by the Motor Vehicle Act. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 588(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">It may be noted that there is a street intersection \u201capproximately one mile from the scene of the accident and north of it,\u201d and that another intersection is located \u201cabout one-quarter if a mile south.\u201d Mr. Winston \u201cstated in his deposition that he started his turn from the lane next to the center line. ... At the time of trial he stated that he started his turn from the extreme west lane. ...\u201d Shortly before reaching the scene of the accident, Winston \u201cslowed down, looked for traffic from either direction, and seeing no traffic he made a signal with his left hand, turned on his blinker lights\u201d and attempted to make the U-turn by cutting the steering wheel to the left as far as it would go, but because of the curb was unable to complete the maneuver. He testified that \u201che was stopped for one or two minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">D. A. Morelli, an instructor in physics, testified to making certain tests in respect to turning radius at the point in question, and that \u201cif plaintiff\u2019s turn were made from the lane next to the center that it would be impossible for plaintiff to get much further around in the turn than about an 80 degree angle between the right side of plaintiff\u2019s vehicle and the east curb. If the turn were made from the westernmost lane of traffic with the wheel cramped to the left the turn could be made with three feet to spare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">There is a conflict of evidence concerning the angle at which the Winston car came to a rest. Plaintiff testified that the rear of the car was \u201c2 or 3 feet from the curb\u201d; other witnesses placed the distance at \u201cfrom five to eight feet.\u201d Defendant estimated that the Winston car \u201cwas headed at around a sixty degree angle to the curb,\u201d and extended \u201cabout 2 to 4 feet into the lane.\u201d Another ear had drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>up behind the Winston ear and stopped, according to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, \u201ceight or ten car lengths back of him.\u201d The defendant Penney testified that this so-called <em>\u201cX\u201d </em>car was \u201ctwo or thr\u00e9e car lengths back of the Winston car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s car was a black Packard sedan; defendant was driving a Chevrolet sedan at a speed of approximately 35-40 miles per hour. It was the defendant\u2019s testimony \u201cthat he saw the X car stopped in the lane . . . about 1 foot from the curb.\u201d Defendant did not slow down, \u201cbut he turned to the left to pass the X car and did pass the X ear while straddling the white line ... he started to swerve his car back into the curb lane and then for the first time his headlights picked up plaintiff\u2019s vehicle and he first noticed the Winston car. He then immediately swerved back to the left, but the right portion of his ear struck the right rear portion of the Winston car.\u201d Penney and a passenger testified \u201cthat they saw no lights on the Winston Vehicle.\u201d L. B. Winston testified that \u201che had his lights on at all times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Appellants contend that \u201cThe trial court committed error in not giving a basic instruction requested by appellants, based on their theory of the case, when there was evidence in the record to support the giving of such instruction.\u201d The refused instruction was as follows: \u201cIf you find that plaintiffs\u2019 vehicle was disabled or temporarily unable to proceed prior to the accident, then I instruct you that plaintiff was not required to park parallel to the curb with the rear wheels of his vehicle less than 18\" from the curb.\u201d As authority for this instruction <em>Flemming </em>v. <em>Flick, </em>140 Cal.App. 14 [35 P.2d 210], is cited, holding that where a rear axle broke on a grade, and embankments prevented getting the car off the highway, and a tow car further obstructed the highway, plaintiff was not negligent as a matter of law in thus blocking the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Respondents\u2019 brief, answering this argument, observes that, \u201cThe instruction offered was properly refused since the element that the vehicle must have been disabled through no negligence of the plaintiffs was omitted.\u201d Considering the matter on motion for a new trial, the trial judge called attention to the fact that there was evidence \u201cfrom which the jury could have found that the plaintiff, Mr. Winston, was negligent in attempting to make his turn at that point, in attempting to turn so close to the east curb that he could not complete his turn and was going to be stalled at a place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>where he could not proceed without backing up and going ahead. It was not until he hit the curb that the engine stalled. . . . Tour instruction did not say any such thing. It said that he was excused if his engine stalled, no matter how it stalled. I pointed this out to you ... I told you that element was lacking, but there was no offer made to give any other instruction. However, I think the matter was fully covered by the instruction which was given twice, that he was not negligent in doing so if under all the circumstances that was excusable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">A survey of the instructions as a whole indicates that appellants\u2019 theory of the case was properly covered, and that no prejudice could have resulted from the court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction. As noted by the trial court, there was evidence of negligence on the plaintiffs\u2019 part in attempting to make the turn, and the weight and effect of this evidence was for the jury to decide. The requested instruction, as phrased by plaintiffs, might have led the jury to believe that such negligence, if any, was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Appellants also claim that \u2018 \u2018 The jury should not have been instructed concerning the rule governing the parking of a motor vehicle on the highway,\u201d namely section 588(a) of the Motor Vehicle Code, for the reason that \u201cthere is no evidence . . . showing that appellants had ever stopped their car voluntarily,\u201d and that the court erred in assuming that appellants had \u201cparked\u201d the car. However, as noted by respondents, the jury was instructed that section 588(a) requires that every vehicle be \u201cstopped or parked\u201d parallel and within 18 inches of the right-hand curb. Appellants\u2019 car was certainly \u201cstopped\u201d on the roadway. As hereinbefore indicated, whether appellants\u2019 stopping was excusable or justifiable was, under all the evidence, a question for the jury. No reversible error is here apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Further complaint is made that \u201cThe trial court erred in unduly emphasizing certain instructions ... by repeating and stressing unfavorable aspects of the instructions so far as appellants were concerned.\u201d More specifically, appellant points out that the trial judge, in discussing the last clear chance doctrine, emphasized by repetition that defendant might be liable if, after acquiring actual knowledge of plaintiffs\u2019 perilous situation, he had a clear opportunity\u2014\u201cthat means just what it says, a clear opportunity to avoid the accident,\u201d and that the court \u201craised its voice and emphasized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>this portion by voice intonation and slower phrasing.\u201d The jury was further told that, as to the last clear chance, \u201cIt is not a matter of split seconds,\u201d but whether defendant \u201cdid have an opportunity to avoid the accident after he became aware of the danger, and what a reasonable man would have done,\u201d etc., which was a matter for the jury \u201cto determine from all of the evidence.\u201d In explaining the doctrine the judge mentioned that \u201cLaw students and judges study this doctrine a long time, and some do not understand it even then. However, I am trying to make it clear to you, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Appellants\u2019 contentions in respect to this matter present no reversible error. The matter of voice intonation in giving the above instructions is not presented by affidavit, and the repetition of correct instructions so that the jury may have the matter firmly in mind, cannot be deemed either erroneous or prejudicial to the appellants\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Finally, it is claimed that \u201cas a matter of law, appellant, L. B. Winston, under the stipulated facts, was not chargeable with any negligence which was a proximate cause of the accident.\u201d As hereinbefore noted, the evidence was in conflict as to various facts, and the question of appellants\u2019 negligence was for the jury to determine. It cannot be doubted that the record discloses substantial evidence in support of the verdict. No prejudicial error has been pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
