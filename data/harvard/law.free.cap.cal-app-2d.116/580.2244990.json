Her complaint sought relief upon three grounds: (1) that the execution of the agreements in question was procured by the fraud of the defendants; (2) that the agreements constitute \u201csecurities\u201d within the meaning of the Corporate Securities Act and hence are void because the sale and issuance thereof was not authorized by a permit of the Commissioner of Corporations, and (3) that they are violative of the provisions of the Business and Professions Code regulating the sale and leasing of subdivided lands. The trial court\u2019s findings were adverse to the plaintiff upon all issues. Plaintiff however makes no attempt to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding against her upon the issue of fraud and hence no consideration thereof is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">At all the times herein mentioned the respondent corporation has been the owner of a parcel of real property situate in the city of Palm Springs approximately 270 feet square. Prior to the time when the agreements hereinafter mentioned were executed the property was unimproved. However, the corporation had theretofore filed with the Building Department of the city of Palm Springs a plot plan of this property which was designated thereon as \u201cBonaire Village.\u201d On this plot plan there are delineated separate rectangles, consecutively numbered, which in the agreements hereinafter mentioned are referred to as \u201cbuilding units,\u201d a parking area, walks and a swimming pool. What purports to be a photographic copy of this plot plan appears upon the reverse side of the lease agreements hereinafter mentioned.\" While no notation appears thereon as to the scale of the drawing, the exterior dimensions of the property are noted thereon, and, applying the scale to be derived therefrom, each of the \u201cbuilding units\u201d appears to be of the dimensions of 30' x 20' The filing of this plot plan with the Building Department was preliminary to the execution of the plan of the respondent corporation to divide and improve the property in the manner therein designated, and to construct upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the \u201cbuilding units\u201d bungalows of the character mentioned and described in the agreements now to be mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\">Tn July, 1948, appellant and respondent corporation executed two agreements, identical in terms except for the description of the \u201cbuilding unit\u201d covered thereby, entitled \u201cLease Agreement\u201d wherein the respondent corporation is designated as \u201cLessor\u201d and appellantus designated as \u201cLessee, \u2019 \u2019 the terms of which may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">\u201cLessor leases and lets to Lessee for the term of ninety-nine (99) years from this date (July 9 and 14, 1948, respectively) building unit marked No. 10 (25) as shown on the plot plan appearing on the reverse side of this Lease, which plot plan is known as 1 Bonaire Village\u2019 on file with the Building Department of the City of Palm Springs, Riverside County, State of California, located on that parcel of real estate more particularly described as follows:\u201d after which is set forth a description of the entire parcel of real property to which reference has previously been made and to which we will hereinafter refer by the designation given it by respondents, namely \u201cBonaire Village.\u201d Lessee agrees to pay Lessor the sum of $7,500 as follows: $500 in cash, $1,000 upon demand within 30 days and the balance in monthly payments of $80, including interest at 6 per cent per annum, beginning September 1, 1948. Lessor may cancel the lease \u201cupon the failure of Lessee to meet his obligations imposed hereunder\u201d and in the event thereof all monies theretofore paid by the lessee shall be retained by lessor \u201cand shall constitute rental for the use and occupancy of the <em>leased premises </em>up to that time, and lessor shall have the right to re-enter and take possession of said <em>leased prem</em>ises.\u201d Lessor shall within a period of 30 days begin to construct and thereafter diligently prosecute to completion \u201cthe construction of a <em>building </em>with the elevations, floor plan, dimensions and general specifications set out on the reverse side hereof, and will begin and diligently prosecute to completion the work necessary to landscape the entire <em>block </em>shown therein by planting shrubbery and lawns and by installing walks, driveways and a swimming pool. \u2019 \u2019 Turning to the reverse side of the agreement we find a perspective drawing of the building to be constructed by lessor together with floor plan thereof shelving a building having the exterior dimensions of 28' x 18', which is to be of \u201cframe and stucco construction, concrete slab floor, and Tropicool roof-, to meet all requirements of City and State building codes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Continuing, the lease agreement provides that if, for reasons beyond the control of the lessor, it is unable to deliver the <em>building </em>within five months, lessor shall refund all monies theretofore paid by lessee and \u201clessee agrees to relinquish all documents and execute any further documents <em>quitclaiming back to lessor any rights, title and interest under this lease which may have been acquired and recorded by said lessee.\u201d </em>The lease shall be binding upon the heirs, administrators, executors and assigns of the parties, and while the lessee may assign the lease, any such assignment \u201cshall be made only to persons of the white or Caucasian race,\u201d and \u201cno persons of any other race shall occupy or use the said <em>leased premises </em>except as domestic servants.\u201d The lessee \u201cshall have the right without cost to use the various walks, driveways, and the swimming pool . . . while this lease is in good standing,\u201d and lessor agrees to maintain the same, furnishing necessary water for the lawns, shrubbery and swimming pool <em>\u201cand to pay all real estate taxes assessed or assessable against the entire parcel embracing the leased premises;\u201d </em>lessee, however, agreeing to pay \u201cto said lessor his proportionate 1/38 share of said money so expended by the lessor for the above items.\u201d \u201cLessor agrees to arrange for the furnishing of electric energy, domestic water and gas for the <em>building </em>referred to in the said lease and to furnish maid and laundry service as may be desired by lessee,\u201d for all of which the latter agrees to pay. The two final paragraphs of the agreement read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">\u201c10. That the <em>building </em>to be constructed for the lessee by lessor herein shall be considered the personal property of the lessee herein upon the payment in full of the amount of money as indicated on line 2, paragraph 2 herein ($7,-500.00), and a bill of sale to said personal property shall be given to said lessee by the said lessor without lien or encumbrance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201c11. That when lessee has paid the amount of money set out on line 2, Paragraph 2 herein as payment in full, lessor will within sixty (60) days thereafter cause this lease to be acknowledged in order that it may be recorded in the records of Riverside County, State of California, by the lessee herein.\u201d (Emphasis throughout is our own.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">At or about the same time as the execution of the lease agreements the parties entered into a \u201cProperty Management Agreement\u201d whereby the respondent corporation agreed to care for, manage and operate the \u201cbuilding units,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>manager being constituted the sole and exclusive agent to rent the building at such times as the owner desired to rent the same to other persons, for which the manager was to receive a compensation of 20 per cent of the rental received. The Property Management Agreement covering unit No. 10 was to continue for a period of one year from December 1, 1948, and that covering Unit No. 25 was to continue until June 30, 1950. At the same time appellant purchased from the respondent corporation furniture and furnishings for the buildings for the price of $3,653.24, on account of which she paid $1,173.24, and executed a Conditional Sales Contract for the balance to the respondent, Clarke.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\">We have set forth the terms of the lease agreements in some detail because the provisions thereof are necessary to proper understanding of the questions presented upon the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">We direct our attention first to the question as to whether the lease agreements in question fall within the purview of the statute regulating the sale and leasing of subdivided lands, for in our view it is decisive of the controversy. The particular provisions of the Business and Professions Code with which we are concerned are sections 11000 and 11010 which, insofar as material here, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">\u201c11000. 'Subdivided lands\u2019 and \u2018subdivisions\u2019 refer to improved or unimproved land or lands divided or proposed to be divided for the purpose of sale or lease, whether immediate or future, into five or more lots or parcels. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201c11010. Notice of intention to sell subdivided lands. (When and by whom notice to be given.) Prior to the time when subdivided lands are to be offered for sale or lease, the owner, his agent or sub divider shall notify the commissioner in writing of his intention to sell such offering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">\u201c(Contents.) The notice of intention shall contain the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">(a) The name and address of the owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">(b) The name and address of the subdivider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">(c) The legal description and area of lands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">(d) A true statement of the condition of the title to the land, particularly including all encumbrances thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-12\">(e) A true statement of the terms and conditions on which it is intended to dispose of the land, together with copies of any contracts intended to be used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-13\">(f) A true statement of the provisions, if any, that have been made for public utilities in the proposed subdivision, including water, electricity, gas and telephone facilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>(g) Such other information as the owner, his agent, or sub-divider, may desire to present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Failure to comply with the provisions of the last quoted section is denounced as a public offense punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for a term of not to exceed two years or by a fine of not to exceed $2,000 (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 11020). It may be noted in passing that the foregoing are a codification of substantially similar provisions of an earlier statute, the constitutionality of which was upheld in <em>In re Sidebotham, </em>12 Cal.2d 434 [85 P.2d 453, 122 A.L.R. 496].</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Admittedly respondent corporation did not comply with the provisions of section 11010, and hence if the lease agreements executed by it with appellant are comprehended by the provisions of section 11000, they are illegal and void.  We entertain no doubt that Bonaire Village constitutes \u201csubdivided lands\u201d within the meaning of the statute quoted above, for a mere reference to the plot plan filed by the respondent corporation with the Building Department of the city of Palm Springs discloses a tract of land which is divided into more than five parcels, namely 38 separate areas, to which access is afforded by means of designated walks and driveways. The fact that these are designated in the agreements in question as \u201cbuilding units\u201d and not as \u201clots\u201d is of no significance.  As used in the statute the word \u201clot\u201d applies to any portion, piece, or division of land and is not limited to parcels of land laid out into blocks and lots regularly numbered and platted. (See <em>Westbrook </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>92 Okla. 149 [218 P. 873, 875]; <em>Cowell </em>v. <em>Clark., </em>37 Cal.App.2d 255, 258 [99 P.2d 594]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallinger </em>37 Cal.App.2d 261, 262 [99 P.2d 597].)  While the separate areas or parcels delineated upon the plot plan are not designated thereon as \u201clots\u201d the entire parcel is referred to in the lease agreement as \u201cthe block,\u201d and the \u201cunits\u201d into which it is divided unquestionably constitute \u201cparcels\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in the statute. Moreover, it is too clear to admit of argument that, as disclosed by the agreements executed between the parties, the respondent corporation dealt with each \u201cunit\u201d as a separate parcel, and the testimony of Mr. Clarke, president of the respondent corporation, is to the effect that from the inception of the project the corporation intended to deal in a similar manner with more than one-half of the 38 \u201cunits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Respondents, however, contend that the statute is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>applicable because, so it is said, respondents did not, by the terms of the agreements in question, lease any <em>land </em>but only \u201ca bungalow\u2014which is by express written agreement of the parties to be regarded as personal property only.\u201d Conceding for the moment that each of the agreements constitutes a lease of a bungalow (a question to be hereinafter discussed), it by no means follows, as respondents assume, that this compels the conclusion that they do not constitute leases of real property. The very converse is true, for since the days of Lord Coke it has been recognized that the lease of an entire house or building operates as a lease of the land upon which it stands. <em>(McMillan </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>42 Ala. 356, 358 [94 Am.Dec. 654].)</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\">\u201cThe general rule is that the lease of an entire building <em>co nomine </em>is a lease of the land on which the building stands, at least as far as needed for its support, and adjacent land belonging to the lessor which is used with the building as necessary to its proper occupation for the purpose for which it was intended. . . . Where the lease is of the \u2018premises\u2019 with no qualifying words, it is generally held that \u2018premises\u2019 means land and buildings thereon.\u201d (51 C.J.S. 944.)</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The statements in the foregoing text will be found abundantly supported by the authorities. <em>(Buckhorn Plaster Co. </em>v. <em>Consolidated Plaster Co., </em>47 Colo. 516 [108 P. 27, 33]; <em>Crabtree </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>194 Mass. 123 [80 N.E. 225, 226]; <em>Szulerecki </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer, </em>283 Ill. 525 [119 N.E. 643, 645]; <em>Brager </em>v. <em>Bigham, </em>127 Md. 148 [96 A. 277, 279]; <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Farnsworth, </em>128 Mass. 487, 488; <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Bowdoin, </em>22 Pick. (Mass.) 401, 406; <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>113 Mass. 481, 484 [18 Am.Rep. 522]; <em>Lanpher </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>37 Minn. 4 [33 N.W. 10,11]; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>55 Mont. 295 [175 P. 892, 894]; <em>Nashville, Etc. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Heikens, </em>112 Tenn. 378 [79 S.W. 1038, 1040, 65 L.R.A. 298]; <em>Gainer </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>76 W.Va. 426 [85 S.E. 713, 714]; <em>Bussman </em>v. <em>Ganster, </em>72 Pa. 285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Bowdoin, supra, </em>the court at page 405 says: \u201cIt is objected, that the land was not demised, but the buildings only, and that the plaintiff has only an easement in the land. . . . But by the demise of the building, the land on which it stood clearly passed as incident to the demise. The exclusive possession of the land was necessary to the enjoyment of the demise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">And the rule above stated is the same whether the building demised be in existence at the time of the lease or is to be constructed in the future. In <em>Bussman </em>v. <em>Ganster, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>supra., </em>the court says (p. 290) : \u201cBy the agreement in suit, Ganster agreed as party of one part with Bussman, Rahe &amp; Company as parties of the second part, to erect a store-house in front of his own house, on the Negley lot in East Liberty, and to furnish the same with counters, shelving and other fixtures, to be ready by the 1st of August 1868, or as much sooner as practicable, at the rate of $600 until the 1st of April 1869, and thereafter, for the term of five years, at the rate of $800 per annum. It is true that there are here no formal words of demise, but it is very manifest that after the erection of the building there was created a term of years in the premises with a certain commencement and a certain termination; in short, with all of the requisites of a demise. Ought there to be any doubt that if this was a demise of the buildings when erected it was also a demise of the ground upon which it stood?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">And at page 289 the court says: \u201cThat the agreement in question was a lease of the land as well as of the building thereon, we think is very manifest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We need not, however, rest our determination upon the foregoing alone, for a reading of the lease agreement renders inadmissible the contention of respondents that it constitutes nothing more than a lease of a house. Indeed, in the true sense of the word, it is not a lease of a house at all.  As is said in <em>Pringle </em>v. <em>Canfield, </em>19 S.D. 506 [104 N.W. 223]: \u201c (W)here title to specific personal property is to pass to the person taking possession thereof upon the completion of stipulated payments, together with interest and attorney\u2019s fees for collecting the amount in ease of default, the term \u2018lease\u2019 is a misnomer, and the transaction a conditional sale, in exact accordance with the intention of the parties. Authorities are abundant in support of the suggestion that a transaction, by whatever name, is a conditional sale whenever payment is a prerequisite to the passing of title, and contracts framed to partake more of the qualities of a lease than the one before us have been so construed. ...\u201d (See, also, <em>Lundy Furn. Co. </em>v. <em>White, </em>128 Cal. 170, 172 [60 P. 759, 79 Am.St.Rep. 41].)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\"> The agreements here have a dual character: (1) a contract whereby lessor agrees to construct and sell to lessee a bungalow and which lessee agrees to purchase for the specified price payable at the times and in the manner therein set forth, with title to remain in the lessor until the full purchase price of $7,500 is paid\u2014a conditional sales contract, and (2) the grant by lessor to lessee of the right to occupy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>site or parcel of real property therein described and upon which the bungalow is to be erected for a definite term of 99 years. It is in the latter aspect alone that the agreement answers to the legal description of a lease. The subject matter of the contract of sale is the bungalow; that of the lease the parcel of real property therein described by reference to the plot plan showing its situs and dimensions. While the lease is to continue for a period of 99 years, the bungalow is to become the absolute property of the lessee \u201cwithout lien or encumbrance\u201d upon the payment of the agreed price of $7,500, which (in accordance with our hasty computation) is fully payable under the terms of the agreement in not to exceed nine years at the very latest. From and after the time that title to the bungalow vests in the purchaser it may not with reason be said that the latter is the lessee of the house of which he is the absolute owner free of \u201clien or encumbrance.\u201d There is nothing in the agreement to suggest that the lessee may not remove the house from the premises after it has been fully paid for, and respondents concede that she may freely do so.  It is equally clear that the removal of the house would not operate to terminate the rights of the lessee in and to the building site or release her from the obligations under the lease for the balance of the 99-year term, for it is expressly provided that the lessee shall, <em>for the full term, </em>pay 1/38 of respondent corporation\u2019s cost of maintaining \u201cthe grounds, walks, driveways, and swimming pool,\u201d including the necessary water required therefor, as well as, \u201call real estate taxes assessed or assessable against the entire parcel embracing the leased premises.\u201d Of necessity there must be some consideration for lessee\u2019s continuing promise to make these payments. And lessee\u2019s obligation in this regard cannot be relegated to the purchase of the bungalow, for the <em>total price </em>therefor is fixed at $7,500. Neither may it be considered as a charge for the right to use the bungalow after it is fully .paid for (an event which must necessarily occur long prior to the expiration of 99 years) for it is then the sole property of the lessee.  It becomes evident therefore that the obligations thus laid upon the lessee can only be in the nature of a charge or rent for the right to use and occupy the site upon which the building is erected without regard to whether it remains thereon for the full term or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\">Indeed, although perhaps unwittingly, counsel for respondents concede this to be true for in their brief they say: \u201cThose obligations (maintenance costs and taxes) assumed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>lessee are part of the price of the <em>lease. </em>\u2019 \u2019 And again it is said: \u201cOf course, it is possible that the lessee will pay for the bungalow and get a bill of sale to it as provided in paragraph 10 of the Lease Agreement long before the expiration of the 99-year period but the obligation to pay 1/38 of the maintenance cost and of the taxes, etc., <em>is still a continuing obligation. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s ownership of the bungalow would not end at the expiration of the 99 years but <em>her right to keep it on the land </em>as personal property would end at that time, the same as a person\u2019s right to sever from the real estate the leased neon sign at the expiration of his lease on the building.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">To admit, as they do, that by the agreements under consideration appellant was granted and acquired, the \u201cright to keep it (the bungalow) on the land\u201d for a period of 99 years is necessarily to concede that the agreement constitutes a lease of the land upon which it is erected, for a lease is nothing other than an instrument by which one is granted, upon stated terms and conditions, <em>the right to occupy a parcel of land to the exclusion of the grantor. (Morris </em>v. <em>Iden, </em>23 Cal.App. 388, 393 [138 P. 120]; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>68 Cal. 290, 293 [9 P. 166]; Tiedeman, Real Property, \u00a7 538; <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>79 Okla. 165 [192 P. 358, 360, 12 A.L.R. 819, 821].)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">While in the foregoing discussion we have undertaken to point out that lessee\u2019s obligation to pay a proportionate part of the maintenance cost of and taxes upon the entire tract of land of which the \u201cleased premises\u201d are a part, answers to the description of rent, it may be noted that reservation of rent is not an essential requirement of a lease. <em>(Barnett </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>162 Wash. 613 [299 P. 392, 394]; <em>Willcox </em>v. <em>Bostick, </em>57 S.C. 151 [35 S.E. 496, 497].)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Moreover, as is made evident by a cursory reading of the agreements, the word \u201cbuilding\u201d is used therein in contradistinction to the term \u201cleased premises.\u201d The property demised (\u201cleased premises\u201d) is a \u201cbuilding unit\u201d designated by number and reference to the copy of the plot plan appearing upon the reverse side of the agreements whereon it is delineated as a specific parcel of real property. Although not expressly so stated in the agreements, it is implicit therein that the \u201cbuilding\u201d is to be constructed upon the particular parcel thus designated as constituting the \u201cleased premises.\u201d The \u201cbuilding\u201d becomes the sole property of the \u201clessee\u201d upon payment of the .purchase price thereof but the \u201cleased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>premises \u2019 \u2019 (the building unit) never became her property; lessee\u2019s sole right with respect thereto being to use and occupy the same to the exclusion of the owner (lessor) for the term of the lease unless sooner terminated by reason of her default in the performance of her obligations thereunder.  Significant also is the provision whereby lessee is obligated to pay 1/38 of the \u201creal estate taxes\u201d assessed \u201cagainst the <em>entire parcel embracing the leased </em>premises.\u201d The expression \u201cleased premises\u201d as used in this connection cannot reasonably be construed as referring to the bungalow alone, not only because, as previously noted, it is not leased, but also because, being personal property (as respondents themselves strenuously insist), it may not be said to be embraced by \u201cthe entire parcel\u201d of real property constituting Bonaire Village. As employed here the meaning of the word \u201cembrace\u201d would appear to be \u201cto include as parts of a whole\u201d (Webster's New Intl. Dict., 2d ed.).  While the property demised, the \u201cbuilding unit\u201d\u2014a parcel of real property\u2014is undoubtedly embraced by \u2022 the larger tract of which it forms a part, the bungalow (personal property) is no more embraced thereby or a part thereof than is the furniture and furnishings located therein. If upon any theory, however, it may be said that the term \u201cleased premises\u201d as used in the provision of the agreements in question comprehends the bungalow alone, it would necessarily follow that upon its removal by the lessee after it was fully paid for she would thereupon be released from the obligations thereby imposed of paying her proportionate share of the maintenance cost and real estate taxes; yet, as we have seen, counsel for respondents contend to the contrary. Nothing, we believe, more clearly demonstrates the unsoundness of their contention that the agreement in question constitutes nothing other than a lease of a bungalow.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\">We confess our inability to perceive the relevancy of the discussion in respondents\u2019 brief whereby they seemingly labor the point that leases are chattels real\u2014personalty and not realty. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 765.)  No one, of course, would undertake to dispute this elementary proposition but, while leaseholds are thus classified, they are nonetheless <em>estates in real property. </em>(Civ. Code, \u00a7 761; <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>3 Cal.2d 110, 118 [43 P.2d 788, 101 A.L.R. 871]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallinger, </em>supra; 37 Cal.App.2d 261, 262.) A 99-year lease no less than one for a term of one year is personalty\u2014a chattel real, but each is a \u201clease of land.\u201d Inasmuch as the statute under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>consideration expressly includes <em>leases </em>of subdivided land, it is of no moment that such leases are, in law, regarded as a class of personal property rather than realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">We have no doubt that the draftsman of the lease agreement, for reasons not too difficult to discern, strove valiantly to bring forth a document which, in legal effect, would operate as an agreement for the erection and sale of a bungalow with the right in the purchaser (for a consideration independent of the price to be paid for the building) to maintain the same upon a designated parcel of real property for 99 years, and yet would not, in contemplation of law, constitute a lease of the land upon which it was to stand for this prolonged period. His efforts, however, proved unavailing for inevitably the result of his labors was precisely that which he so studiously sought to avoid. Looking through form to substance, we experience no difficulty in ascertaining its true character, namely, that which in fact was intended and understood by both parties\u2014a lease of real property for a term of 99 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Respondents having failed to comply with the provisions of the statute referred to, all of the agreements (five in number) are illegal and void, and appellant is entitled to recover the monies paid by her under all of such illegal and void agreements. <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>San Gabriel Mfg. Co., </em>99 Cal.App.2d 365, 368 [222 P.2d 85].) This makes unnecessary the consideration of appellant\u2019s further contention that the agreements constitute securities within the meaning of the Corporate Securities Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to the court below to ascertain the amount of monies paid by appellant to respondents under all five of the aforesaid agreements in issue, and thereupon to render judgment in favor of appellant for such amount, with interest thereon from May 25, 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">White, P. J., and Doran, J., concurred..</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 31, 1953.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
