J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARD\">Prior to March, 1950, Sam Stephanian owned a lot at the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and Fiekett Street in the city of Los Angeles. The lot has a frontage of 45 feet on Pennsylvania Avenue and depth of 120.9 feet on Fiekett Street. There are two houses and a double garage on the lot; one house faces Fiekett and the other faces Pennsylvania. The area is zoned R4 (multiple dwelling zone) and the Los Angeles Comprehensive Zoning Plan, adopted as a part of the municipal code by ordinance No. 90,500, by an amendment adopted in 1950, provides that in an R4 zone \u201cevery lot shall have a minimum width of fifty (50) and a mini-mum area of five thousand (5,000) square feet.\u201d (Mun. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Code, \u00a7 12.11-C, 4.) Although Stephanian\u2019s lot was nonconforming as to minimum area it did not violate the ordinance. This, because the lot was so constituted at the time the ordinance was adopted and the ordinance by its terms did not apply to such lots. However, the zoning ordinance further provides: \u201cNo lot or parcel of land held under separate ownership at the time this Article became effective shall be separated in ownership or reduced in size below the minimum lot width or lot area required by this Article. ...\u201d (12.21-C, l(k), Ordinance No. 92,066 adopted August 19, 1947.) In March, 1950, Stephanian sold the entire lot to plaintiffs and they, in turn, sold the northerly 40 feet (40x45) and the house fronting on Pickett Street to other persons. The remaining portion of the lo.t (45x80) with the other house was retained by plaintiffs. Section 11.00 (m) of the Los Angeles Municipal Code declares that it shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or to fail to comply with any of the requirements of the code and provides punishment by fine or imprisonment for such offenses. After the sale by plaintiffs a criminal prosecution was commenced in the Los Angeles Municipal Court by the People against Mr. and Mrs. Morris complaining that by the division and sale of their lot they had committed misdemeanors, not only in selling the 40 x 45-foot part, but also in maintaining the 45 x 80 that remained. That proceeding is still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Plaintiffs brought this action seeking to enjoin prosecution of the municipal court action and for a declaratory judgment that sections 12.11-C, 4 and 12.21-C, l(j) and (k) are invalid for various reasons and for an injunction against criminal prosecution or other interference with the use of their property. The trial court found that both residences have been on the subject property for more than 25 years as have the majority of the buildings in the neighboring area and that practically all of the corner lots in the area have more than one dwelling unit thereon. The court further found that each of the dwelling units had separate utility connections and that: \u201cCorner lots having thereon two or more separate and unconnected dwelling units, when such lots are divided and sold, together with a residence, to separate owners who occupy the same, are better kept, maintained or occupied by a better type of occupant and have fewer occupants than those which are tenant occupied, and neither public health or sanitary regulations are adversely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>affected where such corner lots are sold and the residences thereon are occupied by separate owners. \u2019 \u2019 From the findings the court concluded that: \u201cSections 12.11-C, 4, 12.21-C, l(j) and 12.21-C, l(k) of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, as applied under the evidence in this case to the subject property, are invalid, arbitrary, discriminatory and unconstitutional and are not a reasonable use of the police power vested in the City of Los Angeles, and the enforcement of the said sections, as against the subject property, would in no way tend to accomplish the purposes for which the Comprehensive Zoning Plan and the other provisions of the Los Angeles Municipal Code were intended.\u201d The court further concluded that the sale of the northerly 40 feet of the property was legal, proper and valid and that insofar as the above mentioned sections of the Los Angeles Municipal Code purport to forbid the sale of the remaining 80 feet of the property, such sections are void. On the basis of its conclusions the court adjudged sections 12.11-C, 4, 12.21-C, l(j) and 12.21-C, l(k) to be unconstitutional as to plaintiffs and permanently enjoined the city of Los Angeles from prosecuting or bringing any civil or criminal action based on said sections against either of the plaintiffs by reason of the accomplished sale of the northerly 40 feet or by reason of the maintenance or future sale of the southerly 80 feet. (\u00a7 12.21-C, l(j) would apply only as \u00a7 12.21-C, l(k) applies to the present ease.) From this judgment the defendant city appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">It is defendant\u2019s contention that all the issues of this case were settled adversely to plaintiff by <em>Clemons </em>v. <em>City of Los </em>Angeles, 36 Cal.2d 95 [222 P.2d 439], and the trial court erroneously refused to follow that decision. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The Clemons decision went no further than to sustain the ordinance as applied to the particular state of facts established by the agreed statement of facts and the findings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The pertinent facts were the following: Clemons had acquired a bungalow court on Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles, some 20 years old, containing nine units; by deeds or 99-year leases he subdivided the court into nine parcels, each with a building thereon, and proceeded to sell or lease them separately; two of the units had no access to a street or alley; with each parcel was conveyed an easement over the walkways of the court to Beverly Boulevard; the entire property was serviced by only one incinerator and two sewer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>connections. From the facts, <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 experts in the field of community development\u201d evolved certain theories which impressed the trial court as realities and were carried into the findings. These related to the distressing conditions which the experts envisioned as a result of separate ownership of units in the bungalow court. These opinions of the experts were received as evidence and furnished the foundation of the trial court\u2019s findings, which, in turn, were deemed controlling on the appeal. We quote from the opinion (p. 99) : \u201cIn support of its view that the \u2018ordinance is an important factor in the orderly development of the city,\u2019 the trial court found that the \u2018attempted cutting up\u2019 of such property as plaintiff\u2019s bungalow court would \u2018tend to create and accelerate the creation of slum conditions\u2019 and \u2018overcrowd[ing].\u2019 thus \u2018militating against orderly, quiet and peaceful living\u2019; that \u2018health and sanitary regulations and laws would be more difficult to enforce\u2019 if the bungalow units \u2018were sold to various separate owners\u2019; and that therefore \u2018said ordinance has a reasonable relation to the public health, safety and general welfare, and was enacted for the public good.\u2019 \u201d Referring to a written opinion of the trial judge the court said (pp. 100-101) : \u201cThe comment is there made that according to the view of experts in the field of community development, the subdivision of \u2018bungalow courts into separate parcels\u2019 tends \u2018to create slum conditions\u2019 because it would be unlikely that a uniform state of repair would be maintained by the various owners and a \u2018hodge-podge appearance' would result, with a consequent depreciation in value of the entire property; \u2018overcrowding\u2019 develops because where it is \u2018a common practice for landlords to limit the number of people who may occupy a bungalow in a court, \u2019 such restriction would not apply under separate ownership of the various units, and the probable increase and concentration of people within the limited area would \u2018add to the noise and other irritations that militate against orderly, quiet and peaceful living\u2019; \u2018health and sanitary regulations\u2019 become \u2018more difficult to provide for and enforce,\u2019 and particularly where such \u2018close living\u2019 in separately owned bungalow units contemplates \u2018each person . . . constantly making use of easements over the others\u2019 property, and where there is no one to make or enforce any rules touching items of common necessity to all, such as, for example, use of incinerators or other disposal of trash, and keeping clean the common walkways, \u2019 the situation could create disturbing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>tensions. As is further there said, the \u2018City Council may well have had all these matters in mind in passing the ordinance here under attack and may have concluded that it was necessary in furtherance of the general welfare of the city and its orderly development. \u2019 \u201d And in discussing the case of <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Town of Needham </em>(population about 16,000), 311 Mass. 560 [42 N.E.2d 516, 141 A.L.R. 688], which upheld a zoning law of the town of Needham prescribing a minimum area of one acre for residential lots, it was said in the Clemons case (p. 101) : \u201cAmong the factors considered pertinent in relation to the municipality\u2019s power to so regulate the size of house lots in a district which appeared \u2018admirably suited for one family residences\u2019 were the following (p. 518 [42 N.E.2d]): avoidance of \u2018 congestion in the streets\u2019; prevention of \u2018overcrowding of land\u2019; facilitation in furnishing \u2018transportation, water, light, sewer and other public necessities\u2019; provision of recreational space for \u2018children to play\u2019; encouragement of the \u2018cultivation of flowers, shrubs and vegetables.\u2019 \u201d And at page 100 the court said: \u201cWhere from a consideration of the evidence the trial court has found certain physical facts and conditions to exist in relation to the particular property restriction involved as would justify regulation by the city through the exercise of its police power, all intendments must be indulged to sustain such findings and the resulting judgment.\u201d And again (p. 104) it was said: \u201cThe various factors above reviewed as found by the trial court to be possible motivating forces in the city\u2019s adoption of the ordinance show it to have a reasonable relation to the interests of the community as a whole in establishing a recommended residential pattern through regulation of minimum lot areas under single ownership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">We have quoted the court\u2019s findings on the material facts in the instant case. The properties here involved front on public streets; those in the Clemons case did not; there are separate utility services and customary outbuildings, whereas in the Clemons case there were but two sewer connections and one incinerator for nine units. We now come to a comparison of other factual matters covered by the findings in the two cases. According to expert opinion in the Clemons case, separate ownership would \u201ctend to create and accelerate the creation of slum conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was no expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>testimony on this or any other subject in the present case, which is a fact of considerable significance. Such opinions as were expressed in the Clemons case would have been opposed to the actual conditions shown to exist in plaintiffs\u2019 neighborhood. The direct evidence and the findings were that there are actually fewer occupants in the owner-occupied properties than in the rental properties. The owner-occupied properties were kept in better condition. In the Clemons ease the experts were of the opinion that if the units were owned separately \u201chealth and sanitary regulations and laws would be more difficult to enforce.\u201d In the instant case the court was considering actual, existing conditions and found: \u201cNeither public health or sanitary regulations are adversely affected where such corner lots are sold and the residences thereon are occupied by separate owners. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">It is well established that the question whether a zoning ordinance is unreasonable, arbitrary and discriminatory, is related to its application to the particular property involved. It may be valid in its general aspects and as to some properties and invalid as to others. <em>(Reynolds </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>12 Cal.2d 244 [83 P.2d 29]; <em>Skalko </em>v. <em>City of Sunnyvale, </em>14 Cal.2d 213 [93 P.2d 93]; <em>Bernstein </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>29 Cal.2d 773 [177 P.2d 913]; <em>Hagenburger </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>51 Cal.App.2d 161 [124 P.2d 345].) It is settled that the provisions of the ordinance under consideration are generally valid. The question is whether they are valid as applied to conditions as found by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The findings of the trial court in the present case of conditions which bear upon the reasonableness of the ordinance and which reflect upon its validity are entitled to the same consideration and weight that was given to the findings in the Clemons case which tended to establish the reasonableness of the application of the ordinance to the Clemons property.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The conditions considered in the Clemons case were novel and they were extreme conditions. Those of the instant case are common and of long duration in the neighborhood. The trial court in our case was not compelled to rely upon theories and opinions of experts, but was dealing with established facts and matters of general knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">It is of common knowledge among those who are at all familiar with the history of the City of Los Angeles that the section of the city east of the river, approached by Brooklyn Avenue, and known as Brooklyn Heights, is one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>original sections of the city into which the pueblo expanded. The property herein involved is a part of J. W. Browning\u2019s Subdivision of Lots 4 and 5 of Mathews and Fickett Tract, map of which was filed for record August 6, 1886. It was an old and well developed section before Hollywood and Beverly Hills emerged from grainfields and orchards. For at least 75 years the property owners had been permitted to develop the district as it now exists without interference by city authority. There was evidence that the average house is of four or five rooms and its average age from 25 to 35 years, from which it would be inferred that many of them have stood since the early days. Property values have been declining. It was shown by a map in evidence that in the vicinity of the subject property there are 26 corner lots. One of them is occupied by the Jewish Community Center; 13 of them have been divided into separate ownership; eight of the remainder, although not divided in ownership, have two or more houses on them, some as many as four houses; only four remain with a single residence. Where lots have been divided the usual size of the lot is around 50 x 60, or 40 x 70 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">This particular zoning regulation, as applied to the Brooklyn Heights area, comes 50 years too late. That section of the city belongs to the citizens who live there. They have built it to suit themselves, as they had a right to do. It was argued to the trial judge that this old district, which has been by-passed by modern development, may sometime become the scene of new and intensive apartment house development, and that the owner of a small parcel might refuse to sell at a fair price and thus \u201csit back and hold up the economic progress of the area.\u201d It was said: \u201cBut sometimes people just have eccentricities and they want to live where they have always lived and they are not going to move.\u201d We do not recognize this desire as an eccentricity, but as one of the virtues of a sturdy society, to be cultivated and protected, and not throttled by mischievous legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Although zoning measures are essentially prospective in their operation, it frequently occurs that regulations which are primarily designed for the development of new districts are framed in terms which render them applicable to sections of a city that have been fully improved and which cannot be made to conform to an entirely new scheme of development. Application of such regulations must be rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>sonable. However desirable it may be that each residence be situated on a lot of 5,000 square feet, it would be futile to make that a requirement in a residential district of small houses built on small lots. Although the ordinance provision in question does not except from its operation old settled districts which were developed under different standards, it must be assumed that it was enacted with the understanding that it would not be given effect where the result would be to oppress the property owners without accomplishing any good whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">We are concerned only with the facts of the plaintiffs\u2019 ease and the factual conclusions of the trial court. Plaintiff has done nothing out of conformity with the general conditions in his neighborhood. Under the findings the purchaser of the 40 x 50-foot lot has all the usual residential facilities; plaintiff has the same on the 45 x 80-foot parcel which he retained. Many other property owners in the district are in the same situation. Their occupancy interferes in no manner with the health, safety or welfare of the community. They do not have 5,000 square feet for each of their dwellings and are thus prohibited from selling less than all of their property. Plans developed through years of thrift and careful investment would thus be frustrated. The ordinance would stand in the way of a sale of part of a lot to pay off an indebtedness on the whole, or giving a deed to a marrying son or daughter. Such oppression would be beyond reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Upon the facts found, the trial court properly concluded that the ordinance provision in question is invalid and unenforcible as to plaintiff\u2019s sale of a part of his property or to his ownership of the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">There are other substantial questions as to the power of the city to legislate with respect to transfers of real property and the constitutionality of the ordinance provision in question. We have considered the sole ground upon which the trial court rendered its judgment and deem it unnecessary to decide whether it is sustainable on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Wood (Parker), J., and Vall\u00e9e, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 9, 1953, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 21, 1953. Gibson, C. J., and Spence, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Slum: <em>\u201cA </em>thickly populated street or alley, especially one marked by squalor, wretched living conditions, or the degradation of its inhabitants.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
