MARGUERITE SNELL PUTMAN, Respondent.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b859-12\">Eleanor V. Jackson for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b859-13\">No appearance for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b859-14\">THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"AClb\">This is an action for annulment of marriage. Defendant wife was served with summons, and defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>At the trial the husband testified that he was potent, and he introduced medical testimony in corroboration thereof; that he tried to enter into marital relations with his wife but that she was incapable of it physically; and that prior to the marriage he asked her if she could be a wife in every sense of the word and she said she could.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">No other testimony was heard by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">When the case was submitted the following colloquy took place between court and counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-7\">\u201cMiss Jackson. May I ask your Honor on what grounds the annulment is being denied?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-8\">\u201cThe Court. The proof is insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-9\">\u201cMiss Jackson. What proof would Tour Honor like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-10\">\u201cThe Court. I do not suggest what proof should be produced. I say this proof is insufficient and the annulment will be denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">Plaintiff appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">Two causes of action were proved: physical incapacity to enter into the marital state on the part of the wife, and fraud on her part inducing plaintiff to enter into the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">It is the settled rule in this state that it is error for the trial court to arbitrarily refuse to grant a decree of annulment when plaintiff\u2019s testimony establishes grounds for annulment, and is not impeached, contradicted, or inherently improbable. <em>(Shepard </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>65 Cal.App. 310 [223 P. 1012]; <em>Dobson </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>86 Cal.App.2d 13 [193 P.2d 794].)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">A death certificate has been filed in this case, showing the death of defendant after judgment in the superior court and before the submission of the case in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">Therefore, in order to protect plaintiff\u2019s rights, whether claimed under the marriage, or otherwise, the judgment is reversed, with direction to enter judgment annulling the marriage <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as of the date of said judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
