The property was a \u201cduplex\u201d and the selling price was $6,500. Defendant took possession and collected the rents. The contract was dated February 28, 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The complaint, in several causes of action, seeks a rescission, quiet title, and damages for fraud. A notice of rescission was served on defendant on June 30, 1950, following defendant\u2019s failure to make the payments according to the terms of the contract, and the within action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">It is defendant\u2019s contention that \u201c(1) the pleadings and judgment are lacking in any of the essential elements of any cause of action; (2) the Judgment cannot be sustained on any theory of Unlawful Detainer, Fraud, or Trusteeship; (3) the Judgment should be reversed and remanded for a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">It is unnecessary to go into further detail. The appeal is on the judgment roll and the record supports plaintiff\u2019s position in every respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">White, P.
