However, the trial transcript has since been properly resettled to reflect that the challenged portions of the charge represented transcription errors <em>(see People v Santorelli, </em>95 NY2d 412, 424 [2000]; <em>People v Williams, </em>2 AD3d 546 [2003]; <em>People v Scott, </em>197 AD2d 646, 647 [1993]; <em>cf. People v Laracuente, </em>136 AD2d 742, 744 [1988]).</p><p id=\"b681-8\">The defendant also contends that his conviction of murder in the second degree was against the weight of the evidence. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>fulfilling our responsibility to conduct an independent review of the weight of the evidence <em>(see </em>CPL 470.15 [5]; <em>People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342 [2007]), we nevertheless accord great deference to the jury\u2019s opportunity to view the witnesses, hear the testimony, and observe demeanor <em>(see People v Mateo, </em>2 NY3d 383, 410 [2004]; <em>People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]). Upon reviewing the record here, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt as to that count was not against the weight of the evidence <em>(see People v Romero, </em>7 NY3d 633 [2006]). Skelos, J.P., Dillon, Duffy and LaSalle, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
