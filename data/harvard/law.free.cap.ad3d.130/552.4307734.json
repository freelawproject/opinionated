The plaintiff was also entitled to a new order of reference since, in support of its motion, it submitted the mortgage, the underlying unpaid note, the complaint setting forth the facts establishing the claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>and an affidavit attesting to the default on the mortgage, and the appellant failed to interpose an answer to the complaint <em>(see </em>RPAPL 1321; <em>HSBC Bank USA, N.A. v Taher, </em>104 AD3d 815, 816 [2013]; <em>Bank of N.Y. v Alderazi, </em>99 AD3d 837, 838 [2012]; <em>US Bank, N.A. v Boyce, </em>93 AD3d 782 [2012]).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The Supreme Court properly granted those branches of the plaintiff\u2019s motion which were to amend the complaint, notice of pendency, and the underlying mortgage to correct a scrivener\u2019s error in the description of the mortgaged property, and to make certain other amendments to the complaint, as the amendments sought were not substantive and did not prejudice the appellant <em>(see Wells Fargo Bank, NA v Ambrosov, </em>120 AD3d 1225 [2014]; <em>Deutsche Bank Natl. Trust Co. v Meah, </em>120 AD3d 465 [2014]).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The appellant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.
