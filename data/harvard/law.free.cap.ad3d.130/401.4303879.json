Mullen, J.), rendered May 28, 2013, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, assault in the third degree and criminal mischief in the fourth degree, and sentencing him, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate term of <em>2xh </em>to 5 years, unanimously affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The court erred in its determination that defendant opened the door to a modification of its <em>Sandoval </em>ruling. Nonetheless the error was harmless in light of the remaining overwhelming evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The verdict was not against the weight of the evidence (see <em>People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342, 348-349 [2007]). There is no basis for disturbing the jury\u2019s determinations concerning credibility, and its mixed verdict does not warrant a different conclusion (see <em>People v Rayam, </em>94 NY2d 557 [2000]).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Defendant\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s jury charge is unpreserved and we decline to review it in the interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we find no basis for reversal. Concur\u2014 Gonzalez, P.J., Sweeny, Renwick, Saxe and Feinman, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
