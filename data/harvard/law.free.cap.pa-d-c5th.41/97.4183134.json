While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the statutes foci are quite different \u2014 the WCA governs medical services provided to employees injured at work, and the MVFRL governs medical services provided to people injured in auto accidents \u2014 both statutes require that an insurer pay claims within 30 days after it is billed properly by a medical provider or that it pay interest on the amount it does not pay timely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">One of the earlier of this court\u2019s medical provider class actions was filed in 2002, under the MVFRL, by Richard S.Glick, D.O. against Progressive Northern Insurance Company (\u201cProgressive\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court certified the class of medical providers in <em>Glick</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and made rulings as to Progressive\u2019s liability for payment of interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Those rulings were eventually appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">While <em>Glick </em>was being litigated before this court, additional, similar, class actions were filed by plaintiff Freedom Medical Supply, Inc. (\u201cFreedom\u201d). Specifically, Freedom filed the present action against the PMA Companies (\u201cPMA\u201d) under the WCA,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and it filed an action against American Independent Insurance Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>(\u201cAIICo\u201d) under, the MVFRL.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Freedom also filed several other class actions against other insurance companies under the WCA and MVFRL, which actions either settled or are in the process of settling.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">In this case, this court certified the following class against PMA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">All providers who submitted bills and reports under the Pennsylvania Workers Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a71, et seq., as amended (the \u201cAct\u201d), to one or more defendants, and who received a payment which was issued more than thirty (30) days after receipt of the bill and report by defendant(s), but which payment did not include interest earned on or after April 8, 2002, or included less than the amount of interest provided for in the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Similarly, in the <em>AIICo </em>case, this court certified a class of medical providers who were owed interest under the MVFRL.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The parties in this <em>PMA </em>action then proceeded to conduct contentious merits discovery, and in November, 2013, this court held a trial of this matter. The parties submitted their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law on January 31, 2014. One week prior to those submissions, the Superior Court\u2019s decision in <em>Glick </em>was announced.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">In the <em>Glick </em>opinion, the Superior Court held that the class of medical providers should not have been certified under the MVFRL because \u201cwhat will constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u2018reasonable proof\u2019 [of the amount of benefits due] is a question of fact answered on a case by case basis after review of relevant evidence addressing several factors, including coverage, causation, and medical necessity.... This factual inquiry requires individualized determinations not readily suitable for class action.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">After the <em>Glick </em>decision was issued, defendant in <em>AIICo </em>filed a motion for reconsideration on the issue of class certification. In addition, this court allowed PMA to file a motion to decertify the class in this action, which motion was not fully briefed until May, 20, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">On June 9, 2014, this court granted the <em>AIICo </em>defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration and decertified the class in that case. That decision has been appealed. The precise issue that was before the Superior Court in <em>Glick </em>was before this court in <em>AIICo </em>\u2014 namely whether a medical provider\u2019s submission to the insurer of a standard HCFA-1500 or UB-92 form<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is sufficient evidence of the benefits due to the provider under the MVFRL that it triggers the thirty day period in which the insurer must pay the claim or pay interest if the claim is paid late.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Although the Superior Court\u2019s <em>Glick </em>opinion is unpublished and generally non-precedential,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> this court was compelled for consistency\u2019s sake to adopt the Glick court\u2019s reasoning as this court\u2019s own in <em>AIICo </em>because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>two classes of medical providers overlapped significantly. Now, in its motion to decertify the class, PMA asks this court to apply similar reasoning in this WCA case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Although the MVFRL and WCA evidence the same legislative intent \u2014 to encourage insurers to pay provider claims promptly by imposing an interest penalty for late payment \u2014 the two statutes use different language to create the disincentive to late payment. The MVFRL provides that \u201c[bjenefits are overdue if not paid within 30 days after the insurer receives reasonable proof of the amount of the benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The WCA is worded differently; it provides that \u201c[t]he employer or insurer shall make payment and providers shall submit bills and records in accordance with the provisions of this section. All payments to providers for treatment provided pursuant to this act shall be made within thirty (30) days of receipt of such bills and records.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, the difference in language is not sufficient to create a difference in outcome. If a class of late paid providers cannot be certified under the MVFRL, then it should not be certified under the WCA either.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The question before the <em>Glick </em>court and before this court in <em>AIICo </em>was whether the HCFA1500 billing form, which is routinely submitted by the provider class members to the insurer, constitutes \u201creasonable proof of the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the benefits\u201d so as to trigger the statute\u2019s 30 day payment period. The question before this court in this WCA case is what constitutes submission of sufficient \u201cbills and records\u201d to trigger the insurer\u2019s duty to pay within 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">While the HCFA 1500 appears to qualify as a \u201cbill\u201d \u25a0under the WCA,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it is not also the requisite \u201creport.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Instead, providers are apparently required to submit the necessary reports on a form known as LIBC-9, which calls for information different than and in addition to what is set forth on the HCFA-1500.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">For the same reasons that the HCFA 1500 alone is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>not reasonable proof of the amount of benefits under the MVFRL, the HCFA 1500 alone cannot trigger the running of the 30 day period under the WCA. Other documentation is needed, and such documentation will vary from patient to patient.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">As the Superior Court reasoned in <em>Glick, </em>which reasoning this court adopted in <em>AIICo, </em>and as borne out by the requirements of the WCA and its implementing regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">Receipt of the HCFA-1500 Form is merely indicative of treatment and provides prima facie evidence that such treatment was medically justified. It does not establish coverage for such treatment. Whether an insured is entitled to coverage in the form of medical benefits raises additional questions unanswered by mere submission of the form, including causation for example [and medical necessity. Such questions of fact must be] answered on a case by case basis after review of relevant evidence... This factual inquiry requires individualized determinations not readily suitable for class action.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The proof offered at trial in this action also supports this conclusion. Freedom introduced evidence from PMA\u2019s computerized records which showed an initial \u201cimage received date\u201d for each claim and a payment date more than thirty days thereafter. However, Freedom failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>to establish that the \u201cimage received date\u201d constituted the date that all the requisite \u201cbill and report(s)\u201d were submitted to PMA. To the contrary, PMA\u2019s witness testified that the \u201cimage received date\u201d may reflect the receipt of only one of such necessary forms, or neither, and providers may have to submit supplemental forms or information to PMA after the \u201cimage received date\u201d in order to trigger the 30 day payment period under the WCA.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">In this case, proof as to one claimant does not constitute proof as to all;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> instead, it constitutes proof as to none. In order to prove the class members\u2019 claims, plaintiffs would have to sift through each of the insurer\u2019s claims files<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> to show what forms and information were submitted and when such submission was complete before plaintiffs could establish the date from which interest could be computed on each class member\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Freedom apparently recognizes that the claims files are the best and only proof as to when all the requisite forms and information were submitted to PMA because it has filed a motion to re-open the trial record to include 9 of Freedom\u2019s claims files on which Freedom asserts it is due a total of $4,965 in interest from PMA. Freedom neglected to offer such files as evidence at trial,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> so understandably PMA did not cross-examine any Freedom witness or offer rebuttal evidence as to those non-proffered files. It would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>be prejudicial to PMA to admit such files now when PMA can no longer dispute or explain their contents. However, such prejudice can be cured by allowing both parties to re-litigate Freedom\u2019s individual claims only. Since such limited claims are for less than $50,000, the re-trial shall take place in this court\u2019s arbitration program.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">For all the foregoing reasons, defendants\u2019 motion to decertify the class and for judgment in favor of defendants and plaintiffs\u2019 motion to re-open trial record are both granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">And now, this 8th day of August, 2014, upon consideration of defendants\u2019 motion to decertify the class and for judgment in favor of defendants, the response thereto, and all other matters of record, and in accord with the opinion issued simultaneously, it is ordered that said motion is granted in part and the class is decertified. The remainder of the motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Upon consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 motion to re-open trial record, the response thereto, and all other matters of record, it is ordered that said motion is granted in part and plaintiff\u2019s individual claims against defendants shall be transferred to this court\u2019s arbitration program for trial. The remainder of the motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">It is still further ordered that plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\">.
