(hereinafter \u201cBochetto &amp; Lentz\u201d) against defendants Michael Trachtman, Esquire, Benjamin Anderson, Esquire and Powell Trachtman Logan Carrie &amp; Lombardo, P.C. (hereinafter \u201cattorney defendants\u201d) and WFIC, LLC, Ace American Insurance Company and West Chester Fire Insurance Company (hereinafter \u201ccorporate defendants\u201d) for initiating and continuing the action captioned <em>WFIC v. LaBarre, et. al., </em>September Term No. 3183 (\u201cthe underlying action\u201d). Presently before the court are defendants\u2019 respective preliminary objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">I. Martin v. Turner Action</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">Defendants Ace American Insurance Company and West Chester Fire Insurance Company insured and represented attorney Alan Turner, Esquire (\u201cTurner\u201d) in a legal malpractice action brought by Larry Martin (\u201cMartin\u201d) in Federal Court and captioned <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>docket no. 2:10-cv-01874 (E.D. Pa.)(\u201cMartin Action\u201d). (Com. \u00b6 5, 24). The attorney defendants were hired by Ace American Insurance Company and West Chester Fire Insurance Company to represent Turner in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the Martin Action. (Com. \u00b633).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\">In the Martin Action, Martin alleged that Turner failed to renew a UCC-1 filing statement concerning Martin\u2019s $1.4 million loan to Polymer Dynamics, Inc. (\u201cPDI\u201d). (Com. \u00b6 25). Between October 1, 1998 and March 25, 1999, Martin made three loans to Polymer Dynamics, Inc. (\u201cPDi\u201d) totaling $ 1,400,000.0o.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> PDI defaulted on the loans and on June 28, 2001, Martin confessed judgment against PDI in the amount of $ 1,404,999.31 <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">On October 24, 2001, PDI and Martin entered into a settlement agreement wherein PDI executed and delivered a promissory note in favor of Martin in the amount of $1,730,147.95. To secure the promissory note, on October 25,2001, PDI executed and delivered to Martin a Collateral Assignment and security agreement which gave Martin a first position security interest, after satisfaction of PDI\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and tax liens, in the proceeds derived from a lawsuit filed by PDI against Bayer Corporation (Bayer lawsuit). In the Bayer lawsuit, PDI alleged that Bayer machinery malfunctioned causing PDI to become insolvent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 26,2001, Turner, Martin\u2019s attorney filed a UCC-1 financing statement regarding the security interest in the Bayer proceeds. In 2006, Turner failed to renew Martin\u2019s UCC-1 against PDI and another creditor of PDI, PAFCO Investments, LLC took priority over Martin and Martin received nothing from PDI. (Com. \u00b6 26-27).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Turner\u2019s defense in the Martin action was that Martin\u2019s loan to PDI was a \u201cpayment intangible\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>rely for its priority on a UCC-1, but was automatically perfected. (Com. \u00b6 28). Prior to trial, the <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Turner </em>case settled. Defendant Ace Insurance Company tendered Turner\u2019s entire policy amount, $1,000,000.00, in return for a complete release from Martin and an assignment of Martin\u2019s remaining rights in the <em>PDI </em>v. <em>Bayer </em>litigation. (Com. \u00b6 29). Turner and Insureds assigned Martin\u2019s remaining rights in the <em>PDI </em>v. <em>Bayer </em>litigation to WFIC, an entity which did not exist at the time of the settlement in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Turner. </em>(Com. \u00b6 32). Upon the <em>Martin v. Turner </em>settlement, the corporate defendants retained the attorney defendants to initiate a civil action on behalf of WFIC against PDFs various creditors. Those creditors included Bochetto &amp; Lentz who were paid by PDI based upon the assignment received from the <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Turner </em>settlement. (Com. \u00b6 35).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">II. Bochetto &amp; Lentz\u2019s Involvement and the Underlying Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In 2009, PDI had retained Bochetto &amp; Lentz to prosecute a claim against its trial counsel in the <em>PDI </em>v. <em>Bayer </em>case, Bruce McKissick. (Com. \u00b6 44). On October 22, 2009, one of PDFs attorneys, Donald LaBarre, Esquire paid $100,000 from his attorney escrow account to Bochetto &amp; Lentz as a retainer. Bochetto &amp; Lentz represented PDI and incurred fees in excess of $100,000. (Com. \u00b6 45).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">On September 19, 2011 defendant attorney Anderson forwarded a letter to Bochetto &amp; Lentz informing it that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>suit would be instituted against it to recover the $100,000 paid to it for the legal services rendered to PDI. (Com. \u00b6 50). On September 27, 2011, after an exchange of correspondence between defendant attorneys and Bochetto &amp; Lentz, a complaint was filed captioned <em>WFIC, LLC </em>v. <em>LaBarre, </em>et. al. September term 2011 no. 3183 (\u201cthe underlying action\u201d). (Com. \u00b6 54). The underlying action was filed against numerous creditors of PDI including Bochetto &amp; Lentz seeking to recoup moneys allegedly paid to them. The underlying action alleged claims for conversion, civil conspiracy, tortuous interference with contract and unjust enrichment. (Com. \u00b6 56). Bochetto &amp; Lentz filed preliminary objections to WFIC\u2019s complaint which were overruled by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The Hon. Gary S. Glazer held a \u201cbifurcated trial\u201d in the underlying matter and framed the relevant legal issues as follows: (1) Whether Larry Martin perfected a security interest in the proceeds of the Bayer litigation and if so, was that security interest superior to all other security interests in the proceeds of the Bayer litigation at the time it was perfected; (2) If the answer to question 1 is yes, whether that security interest thereafter continued to be superior to all the security interests in the proceeds of the Bayer litigation; and (3) whether the assignment of Martin\u2019s rights to the proceeds of the Bayer litigation from Martin to WFIC was a valid assignment capable of being enforced by the court. (Com. \u00b6 65-66).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Each party briefed the issues and on November 7, 2013, the Hon. Gary S. Glazer issued his order and opinion holding that Martin\u2019s alleged interest in PDFs anticipated judgment was not an automatically perfected payment intangible. (Com. \u00b6 67-69). Bochetto &amp; Lentz filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis of the November 7,2013 order and opinion. (Com. \u00b6 71). WFIC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>did not contest the motions for summary judgment and on February 28, 2014, the court granted Bochetto &amp; Lentz\u2019s motion for summary judgment. (Com. \u00b6 72,74). In April 2014, Bochetto &amp; Lentz commenced this action against the attorney defendants and the corporate defendants for wrongful use of civil proceedings for initiating and continuing the underlying matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">To withstand a demurrer, the instant complaint must at least include the factual allegations required for wrongful use of process under the applicable law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Wrongful use of civil proceedings is a tort which arises when a party institutes a lawsuit with a malicious motive and lacking probable cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The elements that must be established for a viable cause of action pursuant to the Dragonetti Act (\u201cAct\u201d) are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">(a) Elements of action. \u2014 A person who takes part in the procurement, initiation or continuation of civil proceedings against another is subject to liability to the other for wrongful use of civil proceedings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">(1) He acts in a grossly negligent manner or without probable cause and primarily for a purpose other than that of securing the proper discovery, joinder of parties or adjudication of the claim in which the proceedings are based; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">(2) The proceedings have terminated in favor of the person against whom they are brought.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">Thus, in an action for wrongful use of civil proceedings, the Act requires Bochetto &amp; Lentz to establish that (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>attorney defendants procured, initiated or continued the underlying action against them, (2) the proceedings were terminated in Bochetto &amp; Lentz\u2019s favor, (3) the attorney defendants did not have probable cause for the underlying action, (4) the primary purpose for which the proceedings were brought was not that of securing the proper discovery, joinder of parties or adjudication of the claim on which the proceedings were based, and (5) Bochetto &amp; Lentz suffered damages as set forth in \u00a7 8355 (damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Specifically at issue in these preliminary objections is whether the attorney defendants and the corporate defendants had probable cause to bring the underlying action. The act defines probable cause as it applies to the attorney defendants and the corporate defendants as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">A person who takes part in the procurement, initiation or continuation of civil proceedings against another has probable cause for doing so if he reasonably believes in the existence of the facts upon which the claim is based, and either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">(1) Reasonably believes that under those facts the claim may be valid under the existing or developing law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">(2) Believes to this effect in reliance upon the advice of counsel, sought in good faith and given after full disclosure of all relevant facts within his knowledge and information; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">(3) Believes as an attorney of record, in good faith that his procurement, initiation or continuation of a civil cause is not intended to merely harass or maliciously injure the opposite party.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The existence of probable cause is a matter of law for the court to decide.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\">Upon review of the complaint\u2019s allegations as well as the existing case law, it is clear that Bochetto &amp; Lentz failed to state a claim for wrongful use of civil proceedings. There is a lack of controlling case law in this jurisdiction and outside this jurisdiction on the issue of whether assignments of anticipated proceeds in litigation constitute a payment intangible subject to automatic perfection. Indeed, the court in the underlying action readily acknowledged a lack of relevant precedent in this jurisdiction on the issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The attorney defendants and the corporate defendants cannot be deemed to have lacked probable cause to initiate and continue the underlying matter solely because the court in the underlying matter determined that the Martin assignment was not a payment intangible after reviewing conflicting case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Moreover, it is clear that the funds in dispute were not clearly protected by 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9332 as suggested by Bochetto &amp; Lentz. Bochetto &amp; Lentz allege that the attorney defendants lacked probable cause to prosecute the underlying matter because they accepted the $100,000 payment for PDI as payment for legal services without knowledge of Martin\u2019s alleged right to receipt of funds from the Bayer award, citing 13 Pa.C. S. \u00a79332. Title 13 Pa.C. S. \u00a79332 provides in relevant part are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">(a) Transferee of money. \u2014 A transferee of money takes the money free of a security interest unless the transferee acts in collusion with the debtor in violating the rights of the secured party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>(b) Transferee of funds from deposit account. \u2014 A transferee of funds from a deposit account takes the funds free of a security interest in the deposit account unless the transferee acts in collusion with the debtor in violating the rights of the secured party.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In the case at bar section (a) does not apply since the funds received by Bochetto &amp; Lentz do not constitute \u201cmoney\u201d. \u201cMoney\u201d as defined by the UCC refers to currency.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Bochetto &amp; Lentz did not receive currency, it received funds. Therefore, section (a) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Furthermore, section (b) does not apply. Section (b) only applies if Bochetto &amp; Lentz received the funds from a deposit account. A deposit account is defined as a \u201cdemand, time, savings, passbook or similar account maintained with a bank. A deposit account does not include investment property or accounts evidenced by an instrument\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is undisputed by the parties that the account from which Bochetto &amp; Lentz received its $100,000 distribution was an escrow account set up and maintained by PDFs counsel, LaBarre.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> An escrow account, however, is not a deposit account and therefore reliance upon \u00a7 9332 (b) is misplaced to demonstrate lack of probable cause.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Based on the forgoing, this court concludes there was probable cause to assert claims against Bochetto &amp; Lentz in an effort to recover amounts paid to Bochetto &amp; Lentz and therefore the preliminary objections are sustained.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Bochetto &amp; Lentz also rely upon allegations it classifies as judicial admissions to support the lack of probable cause element. The alleged admissions are Martin\u2019s statements in the underlying Martin action repudiating the payment intangible theory, attorney defendants\u2019 statements in correspondence to Bochetto &amp; Lentz that they lacked the requisite facts to impose liability upon Bochetto &amp; Lentz under the UCC and the settlement in the Martin malpractice action. The court finds that these alleged admissions are insufficient to satisfy the requisite element of lack of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">First, the alleged judicial admissions in the Martin action regarding the viability of the payment intangible theory are conclusions of law which do not qualify as judicial admissions. Whether Martin\u2019s interest in the litigation proceeds constituted a payment intangible is an issue of law. Admissions to legal conclusions are not judicial admissions. Similarly, the allegation that the Martin action settled is not a judicial admission and does not suggest a lack of probable cause to bring this action. Although, the defense in the Martin action was based on the payment intangible theory, said defense was never tested and the issue was never judicially resolved. For an averment to qualify as a judicial admission, it must be a clear and unequivocal admission of fact. Judicial admissions are limited in scope to factual matters otherwise requiring evidentiary proof, and are exclusive of legal theories and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>conclusions of law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Since the Martin action settled, it remains unclear and equivocal as to whether the theory would have been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">As for the alleged admissions in attorney defendants correspondence, attached as exhibits \u201cC and E\u201d to the complaint, said alleged admissions do not support the allegation that the attorney defendants lacked the requisite facts to impose liability upon Bochetto &amp; Lentz. On the contrary, the reasonable inference one draws from the correspondence is that as the attorney defendants understood the law, after investigation and research, they had a reasonable belief that the action was valid under the clearly existing law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The presence of probable cause, however, does not necessarily defeat the entire cause of action for wrongful use of civil proceedings, as \u201cthe clear language of Section 8351 permits a cause of action to be based on gross negligence or lack of probable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Gross negligence is defined as the want of even scant care and the failure to exercise even that care which a careless person would use.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Bochetto &amp; Lentz rely on the same allegations used to allege probable cause, to support gross negligence. For instance, Bochetto &amp; Lentz rely upon allegations of clearly established law on the issue of payment intangibles, the UCC, the settlement of the Martin action and the absence of WFIC\u2019s verification to allege gross negligence. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>discussed supra, said allegations are not sufficient to state a claim for wrongful use of proceedings based on lack of probable cause or gross negligence. As discussed above, there is a dearth of controlling case law on this complex issue and a failure to succeed on the underlying claim does not equate to gross negligence. Similarly, the settlement of the Martin action does not equate to gross negligence. Based on the forgoing, the attorney defendants and corporate defendants\u2019 preliminary objections as to gross negligence are sustained.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Based on the foregoing, the attorney defendants and corporate defendants\u2019 preliminary objections are sustained and the complaint is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">And now, this 22nd day of September 2014, upon consideration of defendants preliminary objections to plaintiff\u2019s complaint and all responses in opposition, it hereby is ordered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">1.
