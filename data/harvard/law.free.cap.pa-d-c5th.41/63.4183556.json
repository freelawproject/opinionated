Plaintiff USI is a licensed insurance producer and consulting firm which specializes in providing Property and Casualty Commercial Insurance and Employee Benefits products and related consulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>services to its client.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Howard G. Wilson (\u201cWilson\u201d) joined USI as a producer focusing on USI\u2019s Property &amp; Casualty products lines on September 21, 2012 as part of an acquisition. At the time of the hiring, Wilson understood and contemplated that he would thereafter sign a formal employment agreement with USI. Upon joining USI, Wilson held himself out to the public as a Vice-President-Regional Market Producer for USI.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">On April 1, 2013, Wilson executed an Employment Agreement with USI. The agreement set forth Wilson\u2019s position, responsibilities and term.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The agreement also provided for a non-solicitation and confidentiality provision which stated in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">6. NON-SOLICITATION AND NON INTERFERENCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">6.1. Non-Solicitation of Clients and Active Prospective Clients. On behalf of any Competitive Business, Producer [Wilson] shall not, without the Company\u2019s [USI] prior written consent, for the benefit of Producer [Wilson] or another Person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">(a) Solicit, sell, or provide or accept any request to provide services to, consult for, sign or accept a broker of record letter, with, or induce the termination, cancellation or non-renewal of, any Company [USI] client, in each case, whose Client Account Producer [Wilson] managed or regularly serviced, and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>about which Producer [Wilson] obtained Confidential Information on behalf of the Company [USI] in the two (2) years prior to the termination of the Producer\u2019s [Wilson] employment with the Company [USI]; and/or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">(b) Solicit, sell, or provide or accept any request to provide services to, consult for, sign or accept a broker of record letter with, or induce the termination, cancellation or non-renewal of, any Active Prospective Client, in each case, which Producer [Wilson] solicited and/or about which Producer [Wilson] obtained Confidential Information on behalf of the Company [USI] in the six (6) months prior to the termination of the Producer\u2019s [Wilson] employment with the Company [USI].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">(c) The restrictions set forth in Section 6.1 (a), above, shall apply throughout the Term hereof and thereafter until two (2) years after the effective date on which Producer [Wilson] is no longer employed, for any reason, by the company, its successors or assigns. Producer [Wilson] agrees that (i) the duration of the non-solicitation obligations hereunder shall be extended by the period of time in which the Producer [Wilson] is in breach of those obligations and (ii) the extended duration shall be measured from the date of the court order granting injunctive relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">By executing the Employment Agreement, Wilson represented and warranted to USI that he had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ownership rights to any Client Accounts and that he understood the purpose behind the Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality provisions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After executing the Agreement, Wilson was provided access to USI\u2019s confidential, proprietary and trade secret information.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Employment Agreement provided and set forth compensation terms which provided Wilson with substantial financial consideration for the Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality provisions in the Employment Agreement. In addition to an annual base salary of $200,000 during his first two years with USI, Wilson received additional compensation in the form of a \u201cRetention Bonus.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>As a Producer, Wilson had access to USI\u2019s confidential and proprietary information. While still employed by USI and prior to his resignation, Wilson sought out and secured employment with defendant Lyons, a company that competes directly with USI within the Property &amp; Casualty insurance space in which Wilson specializes in or around Philadelphia.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On July 18, 2014, Wilson tendered his resignation to USI\u2019s president and CEO, Philip Remig. Prior to submitting his letter of resignation, Wilson notified his long time clients that he would be leaving USI.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On the same day the letter of resignation was tendered, USI received from three major USI clients, who were long time clients of Wilson, broker of record letters transferring their accounts to Lyons as their exclusive broker.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thereafter, several more USI clients were lost to Lyons.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">On July 21, 2014, counsel for USI sent Wilson and Lyons letters demanding that they cease and desist their unlawful conduct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On July 24, 2014, USI filed a complaint and Petition for Special Injunction. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>issued an order requiring a response to the petition and scheduled a rule hearing for August 8, 2014. At the time of the hearing, seven of nine clients which were handled by Wilson submitted broker of record letters transferring their business from USI to Lyons. On August 8, 2014, the court heard oral argument and after taking into consideration the papers submitted by the parties as well as the arguments made by counsel, the court granted the petition for a Special Injunction. The order specifically provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">1. Wilson shall be prohibited from violating the restrictive covenants set forth in his Employment Agreement with USI;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">2. Wilson and Lyons, and any other persons acting on their individual or collective behalf, shall be prohibited from using, utilizing, reviewing or copying any of USI\u2019s confidential and proprietary information, including but not limited to its: a) customer lists and key-person contact information; b) client-specific data, such as client needs and insurance requirements and preferences; c) client policyholder information, including but not limited to policy numbers, expirations and carrier information, d) active prospective client lists, including contact and other pertinent information developed by USI to provide it with a competitive advantage when soliciting the prospective client\u2019s business, and e) copies of various forms and business documents devolved and used by USI to conduct its business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>3. Wilson and Lyons shall, not later than ten (10) days from the date of this Order, return any and all originals and destroy and/or permanently delete any and all copies of USI\u2019s confidential and proprietary information in their individual and/or collective possession;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">4. Wilson shall, not later than ten (10) days from the date of this Order, contact each and every client of USI he contacted and advise each client that as a result of litigation that neither he nor Lyons may accept their business and that they may return to USI or engage any other broker of their choice, other than Lyons, until said issue is resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">5. This Special Injunction shall continue in effect until further Order of this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">6. A bond of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) shall be posted by plaintiff and deposited with the Court of Common Pleas Philadelphia County\u2019s Office of Judicial Records, formerly known as the Prothonotary.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">On August 12, 2014, Wilson and Lyons appealed this court\u2019s order dated August 8, 2014 and docketed August 11, 2014. On August 13, 2014, Wilson and Lyons filed a motion requesting the court to stay the August 8, 2014 order pending appeal. On August 21, 2014, the motion to stay was denied. Thereafter, Wilson and Lyons filed a motion to stay with the Superior Court which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>ultimately denied on September 5, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\">For the reasons discussed below, the court\u2019s order dated August 8, 2014 should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Restrictive covenants, of which non-disclosure and non-competition covenants are the most frequently utilized, are commonly relied upon by employers to shield their protectable business interests. The non-disclosure covenant limits the dissemination of proprietary information by a former employee, while the non-competition covenant precludes the former employee from competing with his prior employer for a specified period of time and within a precise geographic area.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In Pennsylvania, restrictive covenants are enforceable if they are incident to an employment relationship between the parties; the restrictions imposed by the covenant are reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer; and the restrictions imposed are reasonably limited in duration and geographic extent. Equitable enforcement of employee covenants not to compete is permitted in so far as reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer. However, restrictive covenants are not favored in Pennsylvania and have been historically viewed as a trade restraint that prevents a former employee from earning a living.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, the \u201cpresence of a legitimate, protectable business interest of the employer is a threshold requirement for an enforceable non-competition covenant.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>In the case sub judice, USI placed before the court the task of interpreting paragraph 6 of the Employment Agreement, specifically the Non Solicitation and Non Interference provision. Unlike traditional non-compete provisions, the Non Solicitation and Non Interference provision at issue here did not prohibit Wilson from competing with USI. Rather, this provision prohibits Wilson from soliciting and interfering with clients that had been with USI for two years prior to Wilson\u2019s departure from USI and for a period of two years after Wilsons\u2019 departure. Since Wilson is not prohibited from competing with USI, the Non Solicitation and Non Interference provision does not constitute a restraint on trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In light of the foregoing, the relevant question before this court was whether the equitable enforcement of the Non Solicitation and Non Interference provision was necessary to protect USI against wrongful appropriation of its customer relationships. In deciding the issue, this court balanced USI\u2019s interest in protecting the customer relationship along with the confidential information within Wilson\u2019s possession against Wilson\u2019s ability to earn a living in his chosen profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The record evidence shows that Wilson had access to a great deal of confidential and proprietary information belonging to USI. Wilson began working for USI on September 21, 2012 when his previous employer was acquired by USI.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At the time of the acquisition, Wilson provided services to clients which he claims were serviced by him for approximately twenty years. When Wilson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>decided to leave USI to join Lyons, Wilson notified his long time clients that he would be leaving USI. Seven of the nine clients contacted Lyons and arranged to have their insurance business moved to Lyons.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Wilson\u2019s contacting of the clients as well as acceptance of the broker of record letters constitutes a breach of the Non Solicitation and Non Interference provision of the Employment Agreement. The Employment Agreement clearly and unambiguously prohibits Wilson from soliciting, selling or providing or accepting any request to provide services to, consult for, sign or accept a broker of record letter with Company Clients. The seven clients that ultimately left USI for Lyons after Wilson contacted them about his resignation were Company Clients. Wilson\u2019s longstanding relationship with these particular USI Company Clients caused him to be viewed as a leader in the industry, and USI has a legitimate business interest in ensuring that Wilson did not transfer that goodwill to Lyons, its direct competitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Wilson and Lyons argue that equitable relief was not necessary since USI has an adequate remedy at law in that it may sue for damages. This court did not agree. There are six \u201cessential prerequisites\u201d that a party must establish prior to obtaining preliminary injunctive relief. The party must show: 1) \u201cthat the injunction is necessary to prevent immediate and irreparable harm that cannot be adequately compensated by damages\u201d; 2) \u201cthat greater injury would result from refusing an injunction than from granting it, and, concomitantly, that issuance of an injunction will not substantially harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>other interested parties in the proceedings\u201d; 3) \u201cthat a preliminary injunction will properly restore the parties to their status as it existed immediately prior to the alleged wrongful conduct\u201d; 4) \u201cthat the activity it seeks to restrain is actionable, that its right to relief is clear, and that the wrong is manifest, or, in other words, must show that it is likely to prevail on the merits\u201d; 5) \u201cthat the injunction it seeks is reasonably suited to abate the offending activity\u201d; and, 6) \u201cthat a preliminary injunction will not adversely affect the public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While an injunction is an extraordinary remedy which should not issue if the parties may be adequately compensated by damages, the injury caused by Wilson and Lyons\u2019 violation of the non solicitation and non interference provision is particularly difficult to quantify for damage purposes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Here, USI suffered irreparable harm from the departure of seven clients as well as Wilson\u2019s use of confidential and proprietary information to lure clients from USI to Lyons.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\">The clear balance of the equities weighs in favor of enforcing the Non Solicitation and Non Interference provision by entering the August 8, 2014 order. USI is likely to prevail on the merits based on Wilson\u2019s breach of the provision which is clear and unambiguous. Moreover, greater harm will result to USI if the requested relief was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>not entered than any harm to Wilson and Lyons. Wilson is not prohibited from working and earning a living and may compete with USI.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The order entered is suited to abate Lyons\u2019 acceptance of the broker of record letters and Wilson\u2019s solicitation, interference and use of confidential information. This court\u2019s order served to restore the status quo. Wilson was ordered to inform those clients that served broker of record letters to Lyons to either return to USI or locate another broker. The order preserves Wilson\u2019s reputation and ensures that the affected clients would be given a choice to return to USI or find another broker. Defendants argue that those clients that already transferred to Lyons should remain with Lyons since these clients made a choice to move to Lyons and therefore would be most affected by this court\u2019s order. However, defendants\u2019 suggestion does not preserve the status quo. USI paid $100 million for the acquisition of TD Bank insurance business and acquired the book of business including the seven clients that transferred their business to Lyons. The status quo is for the seven clients to return to USI. This court is not in a position to order these clients to return to USI and therefore the best and most reasonable solution is to provide the clients with a choice, return to USI or find another insurance broker. Allowing the clients to remain with Lyons only serves to excuse Wilson\u2019s breach of the Employment Agreement which was not privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Based on the forgoing, this court\u2019s order dated August 8, 2014 should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\">.
