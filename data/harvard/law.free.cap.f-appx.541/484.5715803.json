In addition to five years of probation, the district court sentenced Henry to restitution in the amount of $5,000, to be paid in monthly installments of $150 until paid in full. Henry contends that the district court failed to properly consider his limited financial resources when setting his restitution payment schedule, resulting in a monthly payment amount that far exceeded his means.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-21\">Because Henry did not object to the restitution schedule in the district court, his argument is reviewed under the plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Arledge, </em>553 F.3d 881, 900 (5th Cir.2008). The following factors are to be considered in setting a restitution payment schedule: (1) the defendant\u2019s financial resources and assets, including whether any assets are jointly controlled; (2) the defendant\u2019s projected earnings and any other income; and (3) the defendant\u2019s financial obligations, including obligations to dependents. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2); <em>Arledge, </em>553 F.3d at 900. This court will not reverse a district court\u2019s decision concerning the scheduling of restitution payments unless the defendant shows \u201cthat it is probable that the district court failed to consider one of the mandatory factors and the failure to consider that factor influenced the court.\u201d <em>United States v. Schinnell, </em>80 F.3d 1064, 1070 (5th Cir.1996). Henry\u2019s challenge is unavailing, as the district court\u2019s questions and comments at sentencing demonstrate that it was familiar with Henry\u2019s financial circumstances and considered the \u00a7 3663(f)(2) factors in deciding his restitution payment schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
