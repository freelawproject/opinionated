United States, </em>109 Fed.Cl. 551 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>(2013). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Mr. Kalick is a veteran of the United States Army. He applied to the VA for disability benefits for \u201cbi-lateral foot disabilities\u201d that he believed were connected to his military service. <em>Id. </em>at 554-55. The VA\u2019s determination on his application is not in the record, but Mr. Kalick contends that the VA found his injuries to be service-connected, yet assigned him a 0% disability rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Mr. Kalick sought review of the VA\u2019s decision by the Court of Federal Claims, asserting his entitlement to disability compensation under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110. <em>Id. </em>at 555. On the government\u2019s motion, the court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, holding that 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511 and other provisions of Title 38, U.S.Code, require that any challenges to initial VA benefit decisions proceed through the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBVA\u201d) and the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (with review then in this court). <em>Id. </em>at 556-58. Additionally, the court denied Mr. Kalick\u2019s alternative request to transfer his action to a district court or to this court. <em>Id. </em>at 559-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Mr. Kalick timely appealed the decision. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">Whether the Court of Federal Claims possesses jurisdiction over a claim is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Western Co. of N. Am. v. United States, </em>323 F.3d 1024, 1029 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">Mr. Kalick raises an individual challenge to the VA\u2019s decision to assign him a <em>0% </em>disability rating. The Veterans Judicial Review Act of 1988 (\u201cVJRA\u201d) establishes the appellate review process for individual challenges to VA benefits determinations. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7104(a), 7266(a). Courts have uniformly ruled that the VJRA provides the exclusive regime for reviewing denials of veteran benefits. <em>See, e.g., Jackson v. United States, </em>242 Fed.Appx. 698, 700-01 (Fed.Cir.2007); <em>Zuspann v. Brown, </em>60 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Sugrue v. Derwinski, </em>26 F.3d 8, 10-11 (2d Cir.1994); <em>Hicks v. Veterans Admin., </em>961 F.2d 1367, 1369-70 (8th Cir.1992). Under the VJRA, an individual challenge to the VA\u2019s initial benefits determination must be brought by filing a notice of disagreement (\u201cNOD\u201d) with the BVA within one year of the determination. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7104(a), 7105(a). BVA decisions are subject to review only by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7266(a). Thus, as we have previously noted, \u201cthe [VA\u2019s] decisions can be appealed only to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, not to the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>242 Fed.Appx. at 701. Therefore, the Court of Federal Claims properly found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Kalick\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">Mr. Kalick\u2019s reliance on <em>Sabo v. United States, </em>102 Fed.Cl. 619 (2011), is misplaced. <em>Sabo </em>concerned a claim for disability retirement pay brought under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, a different statute than at issue here. This court has found section 1201 to be a money-mandating statute, thereby conferring jurisdiction on the Court of Federal Claims for claims arising under that statute. <em>See Chambers v. United States, </em>417 F.3d 1218, 1223 (Fed.Cir. 2005); <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1167, 1174-75 (Fed.Cir.2005). Mr. Kalick\u2019s disability benefits claim, however, arises under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110. As explained above, Title 38 establishes an exclusive remedial procedure for review of VA disability benefits decisions. In light of that detailed statutory scheme, Mr. Kalick must seek review of his claim through the VJRA\u2019s procedures; it is irrelevant wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>er section 1110 is a money-mandating statute, an issue we need not decide. <em>See United States v. Bormes, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 12, 18, 184 L.Ed.2d 317 (2012) (explaining that jurisdiction under Tucker Act is displaced when money-mandating statute contains its own judicial remedies).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Furthermore, the Court of Federal Claims did not abuse its discretion by declining to transfer Mr. Kalick\u2019s suit to a district court or to us. <em>See Rick\u2019s Mushroom Serv., Inc. v. United States, </em>521 F.3d 1338, 1342 (Fed.Cir.2008) (reviewing decision to transfer claim for abuse of discretion). First, Mr. Kalick\u2019s constitutional claims are based on the VA\u2019s decision regarding his individual benefits claim, and precedent uniformly holds that district courts lack jurisdiction over such allegations. <em>Zuspann, </em>60 F.3d at 1159 (\u201cSince the enactment of the VJRA, federal courts have refused to entertain constitutional claims if they are based on the VA\u2019s actions in a particular case.\u201d). Second, this case does not qualify as one which this court enjoys original jurisdiction to hear: that is, claims brought under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 502 that allege an agency violated 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(l)\u2019s publication requirements or 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\u2019s notice-and-eomment rulemaking requirements. Mr. Kalick alleges neither and, thus, transfer to our court would be inappropriate. <em>See Hilario v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>937 F.2d 586, 589 (Fed.Cir.1991) (finding that this court lacks original jurisdiction over a \u201cchallenge [to] the VA\u2019s application of the veterans\u2019 benefits statutes to the facts of his particular claim\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Federal Claims thus acted well within its discretion in denying the motion to transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">We have considered Mr. Kalick\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Court of Federal Claims is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-8\">. It appears that Mr. Kalick also requests that we toll a deadline for filing a future claim under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\u201d). Appellant\u2019s Br. 13. We decline to afford such equitable relief prospectively by tolling the filing deadline for an unfiled claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
