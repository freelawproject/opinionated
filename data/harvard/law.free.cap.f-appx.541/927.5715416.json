In his \u00a7 2254 petition, he argued that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in failing to present character witnesses at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">At a new trial hearing after Kurtz\u2019s criminal trial, Kurtz\u2019s trial counsel testified that he did not call any good character witnesses because he thought that the jury would assume Kurtz\u2019s character from Kurtz\u2019s profession and he wanted to preserve the final closing argument. After the state trial court denied Kurtz a new trial and the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed his convictions, Kurtz filed a state application for writ of habeas corpus, asserting trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to present a good character defense, and appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to raise that issue on appeal. In a deposition submitted at the state habeas court evidentiary hearing, Kurtz\u2019s appellate counsel testified that he decided not to raise the issue of trial counsel\u2019s failure to present good character evidence because he believed that trial counsel knew of potentially damaging rebuttal testimony and he did not want to give the state the opportunity to present that evidence. The state habeas court denied Kurtz\u2019s application for habeas relief, crediting appellate counsel\u2019s testimony explaining his reason for not bringing the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on appeal over trial counsel\u2019s explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">In the federal habeas proceeding, a magistrate judge recommended the denial of Kurtz\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, finding that the state court did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The district court, however, determined that the state habeas court made an unreasonable determination of fact, under \u00a7 2254(d)(2), in finding that appellate counsel decided not to raise trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness on appeal because he thought that trial counsel knew of potentially damaging character evidence. The district court, therefore, reviewed the state habeas court\u2019s decision <em>de novo, </em>but concluded that Kurtz failed to show a reasonable probability that the outcome of the appeal would have been different if appellate counsel had raised trial counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">We granted a certificate of appealability on a single issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-12\">Whether the district court erred in finding that Kurtz\u2019s appellate counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise trial counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance in not presenting character witnesses at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">We also directed the parties to discuss the effect, if any, of the deference standard under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">On appeal, Kurtz argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 2254 petition because appellate counsel\u2019s reason for failing to raise the ineffectiveness of trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>counsel was demonstrably false, thus showing his deficient performance. He further contends that the deficient performance prejudiced him because his trial was essentially a credibility dispute between himself and the victim, so there is a reasonable probability that evidence of Kurtz\u2019s good character would have changed the outcome of the trial. After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition, we review \u201cquestions of law and mixed questions of law and fact, including ineffective assistance of counsel claims, <em>de novo, </em>and review findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Pardo v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>587 F.3d 1093, 1098 (11th Cir.2009). However, the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), imposes a \u201chighly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings ... and demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d <em>Renico v. Lett, </em>559 U.S. 766, 773, 130 S.Ct. 1855, 1862, 176 L.Ed.2d 678 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo, </em>but review the state habeas court\u2019s decision with deference. <em>Reed v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>593 F.3d 1217, 1239 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">A federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus for a state prisoner where the claim was adjudicated on the merits by a state court unless the state court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-7\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-8\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2). The Supreme Court decision applicable in an ineffective-assistance case is <em>Strickland. See Premo v. Moore, </em>562 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 733, 739, 178 L.Ed.2d 649 (2011). \u201cThe standards created by <em>Strickland </em>and \u00a7 2254(d) are both highly deferential, and when the two apply in tandem, review is doubly so.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 788, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA certain amount of deference is always given to a trial court\u2019s credibility determinations,\u201d and a credibility determination in a case on habeas review receives heightened deference. <em>Gore v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>492 F.3d 1273, 1300 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-16\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201ca state-court factual determination is not unreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.\u201d <em>Wood v. Allen, </em>558 U.S. 290, 301, 130 S.Ct. 841, 849, 175 L.Ed.2d 738 (2010). A habeas court cannot supersede the trial court\u2019s determination \u201ceven if [reasonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the finding in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-17\">Under \u00a7 2254(e)(1), a state court\u2019s factual determinations are presumed correct unless the petitioner can rebut that presumption by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2254(e)(1). The Supreme Court has stated that \u00a7 2254(d)(2) and (e)(1) have independent requirements, and that \u201cAEDPA does not require petitioner to prove that a decision is objectively unreasonable by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 341, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1042, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We have indicated that, if a petitioner establishes that the state court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>made an unreasonable factual determination based on the evidence presented in the state habeas proceeding, we are \u201cnot bound to defer to unreasonably-found facts or to the legal conclusions that flow from them\u201d and may review the claim <em>de novo, </em>without deference to the state court\u2019s decision. <em>Jones v. Walker, </em>540 F.3d 1277, 1288 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5 (11th Cir.2008) <em>(en </em>bane).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">To succeed on an ineffective-assistance claim under <em>Strickland, </em>a petitioner must show that (1) his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Under \u00a7 2254(d), \u201cthe question is not whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable [but] whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential standard.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 788. \u201cClaims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are governed by the same standards applied to trial counsel under <em>Strickland\" Philmore v. McNeil, </em>575 F.3d 1251, 1264 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cIn order to establish prejudice, we must first review the merits of the omitted claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1264-65. If the defendant makes an insufficient showing on the prejudice prong, we need not address the performance prong, and vice versa. <em>Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">With respect to the deficient-performance prong, \u201ca defendant must show that his counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in light of prevailing professional norms at the time the representation took place.\u201d <em>Cummings v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corn., </em>588 F.3d 1331, 1356 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). A district court considering a claim of ineffective assistance must apply a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s representation was \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. A fair assessment of counsel\u2019s performance \u201crequires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In assessing an appellate attorney\u2019s performance, we are \u201cmindful that the Sixth Amendment does not require appellate advocates to raise every non-frivolous issue. Rather, an effective attorney will weed out weaker arguments, even though they may have merit.\u201d <em>Philmore, </em>575 F.3d at 1264 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">With regard to the prejudice prong, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome,\u201d but \u201csome conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding\u201d is not a reasonable probability. <em>Id. </em>at 693-94, 104 S.Ct. at 2067-68. \u201cWhen a defendant challenges a conviction, the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2068-69. Appellate counsel\u2019s performance will be deemed prejudicial if we find that \u201cthe neglected claim would have a reasonable probability of success on appeal.\u201d <em>Philmore, </em>575 F.3d at 1265 (internal quotation marks omitted). Where a claim of ineffective assistance is based on counsel\u2019s failure to call a witness, the burden to show prejudice is heavy because \u201coften allegations of what a witness would have testified to are largely speculative.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. DeLoach, </em>459 F.3d 1097, 1109 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>Although the district court erred in concluding that the state habeas court made an unreasonable determination of the facts and, therefore, used the wrong standard of review, the district court correctly determined that Kurtz failed to establish that he was prejudiced by his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment denying federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
