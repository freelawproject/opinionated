We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-18\">\n<em>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-19\">On June 15, 2003, Baxter purchased a residential property located on Vintage Drive in Round Rock, Texas. To fund the purchase, Baxter obtained a loan, which he secured with a promissory note (\u201cNote\u201d) in favor of National City Mortgage Company (\u201cNational\u201d) for the amount of $322,000. Additionally, Baxter executed a Deed of Trust, granting National a security interest in the property. PNC ultimately acquired National\u2019s rights under the Note and Deed of Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-20\">The Deed of Trust authorized PNC to acquire \u201cforce-placed insurance\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to insure Baxter\u2019s property, and its security interest, should Baxter fail to maintain insurance coverage on the property. The Deed of Trust provided in pertinent part: \u201cIf Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at Lender\u2019s option and Borrower\u2019s expense.... Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>coverage so obtained might significantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained.\u201d In 2010, Baxter\u2019s insurance policy, insuring the property for $632,000, lapsed due to nonpayment. PNC subsequently acquired a policy, insuring the property for $641,480. Baxter later defaulted on the Note. PNC then exercised its right to accelerate the maturity of the Note, and when Baxter did not pay the outstanding balance owed, scheduled a foreclosure sale of the property. In an attempt to prevent the foreclosure, Baxter filed suit in Texas state court. PNC removed to the federal district court on grounds of diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The district court dismissed Baxter\u2019s original breach of contract complaint against PNC, based on allegations of breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Baxter then filed an amended complaint stating a claim for \u201crestitution \u2014 unjust enrichment \u2014 constructive trust.\u201d PNC filed another motion to dismiss, which the district court granted, dismissing Baxter\u2019s claims with prejudice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). On appeal, Baxter alleges that the district court erred by ruling against his claims for restitution, unjust enrichment, and the imposition of a constructive trust under Texas law. Further, for the first time on appeal, he asserts claims under the Real Estate Settlement Procedure Act (\u201cRES-PA\u201d). <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(m) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss de novo. <em>Bass v. Stryker Corp., </em>669 F.3d 501, 506 (5th Cir.2012) (citing <em>Wampler v. Sw. Bell Tel. Co., </em>597 F.3d 741, 744 (5th Cir.2010)). We accept all well-pleaded facts as true and view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Jebaco Inc. v. Harrah\u2019s Operating Co., </em>587 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir.2009)). \u201cDismissal is appropriate when the plaintiff has not alleged enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face or has failed to raise his right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Wampler, </em>597 F.3d at 744).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">\n<em>A. Restitution and Unjust Enrichment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">Claims for restitution and unjust enrichment sound in quasi-contract or contract implied in law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There can be no recovery based on these theories when the same subject matter is covered by an express contract. <em>Fortune Prod. Co. v. Conoco Inc., </em>52 S.W.3d 671, 684 (Tex.2000).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Deed of Trust provided for PNC\u2019s obtainment of insurance on the property in the event of Baxter\u2019s default. The Deed warned Baxter about the potential high costs of force-placed insurance, explicitly providing that the \u201ccost of the [forced-placed] insurance might <em>significantly exceed </em>the cost of insurance that [Baxter] could have obtained.\u201d (emphasis added). Baxter does not dispute that he failed to maintain insurance coverage as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>by the Deed of Trust nor that he later defaulted on his mortgage. Baxter fails to allege any plausible facts showing that PNC was unjustly enriched through PNC\u2019s obtainment of this insurance and when it accelerated the terms of the Note. PNC acted in accordance with its contractual rights under the Deed of Trust. Baxter\u2019s restitution and unjust enrichment claims based on \u201cgrossly usurious and extortionate level\u201d premiums fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\n<em>B. Constructive Trust</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">A constructive trust is an equitable remedy used to prevent unjust enrichment. <em>Everett v. TK-Taito, LLC, </em>178 S.W.3d 844, 859 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2005, no pet.). In order to establish a constructive trust, the proponent must prove: (1) breach of a special trust, fiduciary relationship, or actual fraud; (2) unjust enrichment of the wrongdoer; and, (3) tracing to an identifiable res. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The proponent must strictly prove the elements necessary for the imposition of the trust. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Unjust enrichment occurs when one person obtains a benefit from another by \u201cfraud, duress, or taking an undue advantage.\u201d <em>Heldenfels Bros., Inc. v. City of Corpus Christi, </em>832 S.W.2d 39, 41 (Tex.1992) (citations omitted). Unjust enrichment is not a proper remedy \u201cmerely because it might appear expedient or generally fair that some recompense be afforded for an unfortunate loss to the claimant, or because the benefits to the person sought to be charged amounted to a windfall.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The majority of Baxter\u2019s allegations center around the existence of a \u201cspecial trust, fiduciary relationship, or actual fraud\u201d in this case. However, even if Baxter could prove the first prong of the constructive trust test, which we do not hold herein, he nevertheless has failed to carry his burden with respect to the second prong. As we held supra in Section A, there has been no unjust enrichment to PNC. Accordingly, we hold that Baxter\u2019s equitable claim seeking imposition of a constructive trust also fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\n<em>C. Violation of RESPA \u00a7 2605(m)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">For the first time on appeal, Baxter alleges that Congress, through the enactment of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(m), required that any force-placed insurance be both \u201cbona fide and reasonable.\u201d As a \u201cgeneral principle of appellate review,\u201d failure to raise an argument before the district court waives that argument on appeal, unless the issue is a purely legal one and the asserted error is so obvious that the failure to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>Conley v. Bd. of Trustees of Grenada Cnty. Hasp., </em>707 F.2d 175, 178 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted); <em>see also XL Specialty Ins. Co. v. Kiewit Offshore Serv. Ltd., </em>513 F.3d 146, 153 (5th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Stokes v. Emerson Elec. Co., </em>217 F.3d 353, 358 n. 19 (5th Cir.2000)) (\u201cAn argument not raised before the district court cannot be asserted for the first time on appeal.\u201d). Our review of the record indicates no such plain error here. Consequently, we decline to consider Baxter\u2019s arguments pertaining to PNC\u2019s alleged violations of RESPA \u00a7 2605(m).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-13\">. Force-placed insurance is the insurance that a lien holder places on a property to provide coverage in the event the borrower allows the coverage to lapse or when the borrower\u2019s coverage actually lapses. It ensures that the property remains insured, protecting both the property owner and the lien holder. Costs of the insurance are typically paid up-front by the lien holder, but then added to the balance of the lien.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b419-7\">. Texas courts have not recognized a claim for unjust enrichment as an independent cause of action, but have recognized that a lawsuit for restitution or a lawsuit seeking the imposition of a constructive trust may be raised on the theory of unjust enrichment. <em>Mowbray v. Avery, </em>76 S.W.3d 663, 679-80 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2002, pet. denied) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b419-13\">. This does not foreclose such a claim if there were overpayments on a stated contract amount. Sw. <em>Elec. Power Co. v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., </em>966 S.W.2d 467, 469-70 (Tex. 1998) (holding that a claim for restitution based on a theory of unjust enrichment was invalid absent any overcharges on the contract).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
