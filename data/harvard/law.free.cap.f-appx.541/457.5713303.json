The IJ based that ruling on Aleman\u2019s conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude for which a sentence of more than one year in prison could be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-19\">Aleman contends his prior conviction does not bar his eligibility for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C), which provides that a nonpermanent resident may be eligible for cancellation of removal if he has not been convicted of an offense under three statutes, including 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2) (deportable criminal offenses). Aleman claims: \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) should be interpreted to include all of the immigration-related elements in the three statutes; and the BIA improperly concluded only language regarding the criminal offense determines whether an offense is \u201cunder\u201d one of the three statutes. Aleman additionally asserts the BIA\u2019s construction of \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) has an impermissible retroactive effect. To the extent that Aleman raised other claims in the immigration proceedings, he has abandoned them by not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>presenting them in his petition for review. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The Government claims we lack jurisdiction to review Aleman\u2019s petition because he failed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to his appellate issues. The Government alternatively maintains Aleman\u2019s claims lack merit and are effectively foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. We pretermit any jurisdictional concerns because Aleman\u2019s claims lack merit. <em>See Zamora-Vallejo v. Holder, </em>378 Fed.Appx. 386, 389 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Lakhavani v. Mukasey, </em>255 Fed.Appx. 819, 822 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Madriz-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 321, 327-28 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The BIA\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo </em>\u201cunless a conclusion embodies the [BIAJ\u2019s interpretation of an ambiguous provision of a statute that it administers\u201d. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006). Such a conclusion is entitled to deference. <em>Chevron U.S.A, Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The first, well-known step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether Congress has directly spoken to the question at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If so, we, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. <em>Id. </em>at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. As is also well established, if an unambiguous answer is not found, we must determine whether the agency\u2019s interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. And, when deciding the permissibility of an agency\u2019s interpretation, we must consider \u201conly whether the decision is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute\u201d. <em>Khalid v. Holder, </em>655 F.3d 363, 366-67 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Previously, our court has rejected contentions virtually identical to those made by Aleman. <em>Nino v. Holder </em>held the plain language of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) unambiguously refers to the elements of the offenses set forth in the three statutes and does not refer to any aspects of immigration law. 690 F.3d 691, 697-98 (5th Cir.2012) (concluding \u00a7 1227(a)(2) provides \u201ca list of the kinds of offenses which bar cancellation of removal\u201d and \u201cit does not matter when the offense occurred in relation to the alien\u2019s admission\u201d). Furthermore, because <em>Nino </em>held there was an unequivocal answer to the meaning of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C), our court declined in <em>Nino </em>to engage in additional <em>Chevron </em>analysis and consider the BIA\u2019s construction of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">In the light of our holding in <em>Nino, </em>Aleman\u2019s contentions that \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) should be read to include aspects of immigration law and that the BIA wrongly interpreted the statute by reaching a contrary determination are effectively foreclosed. Similarly, his claim he should not be subject to the BIA\u2019s construction of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) because such a construction conflicts with the BIA\u2019s prior decisions and is impermissibly retroactive is unavailing, given the holding in <em>Nino </em>that the plain language of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) is unambiguous. <em>See id. </em>To the extent Ale-man contends <em>Nino </em>should be ignored or overturned, it goes without saying that a panel of this court may not overrule the holding in an earlier opinion of this court, absent an intervening change in law or an <em>en banc </em>or Supreme Court decision. <em>See Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
