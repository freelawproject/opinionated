Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). \u201c[A] \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not a civil postconviction action but a \u2018step in a criminal ease.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Because Ramirez\u2019s motion to reconsider was filed after the expiration of the 14-day period for noticing an appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 3582 motion on July 25, 2012, the motion to reconsider did not serve to extend the time for filing the notice of appeal. Ramirez did not file his notice of appeal until November 9, 2012, following the October 31, 2012, denial of his motion for reconsideration. Thus, Ramirez\u2019s notice of appeal is effective only as to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. The Government has filed a brief on the merits and does not suggest that the denial of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is not properly before us; therefore, we address the merits of Ramirez\u2019s arguments. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 388-89 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-24\">Ramirez\u2019s notice of appeal was timely as to the denial of the motion for reconsideration, and he stated in his notice of appeal that he desired to appeal that order. However, in his brief, Ramirez makes no argument challenging the denial of his motion for reconsideration, and so that portion of his appeal is considered abandoned. <em>See United States v. Reyes, </em>300 F.3d 555, 558 n. 2 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-25\">Ramirez argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it failed to engage in the two-step analysis under <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010), and failed to consider <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011). Ramirez contends that <em>Freeman </em>permits relief because he pleaded guilty under a plea agreement that projected a possible sentencing range and that the district court overlooked this fact and misapprehended the applicability of <em>Freeman </em>to his request for relief under \u00a7 3582.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The district court correctly determined that Ramirez was sentenced as a career offender and so was not entitled to a sentence reduction because \u201c[t]he crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009). Ramirez\u2019s reliance on <em>Freeman </em>is without merit. In <em>Freeman, </em>the Supreme Court held that defendants who were sentenced pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements were not categorically precluded from receiving a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Freeman, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2692-95. Nothing in <em>Freeman </em>concerns defendants sentenced as career offenders or alters our holding in <em>Anderson. </em>Ramirez\u2019s plea agreement was made pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(B) and did not contain an agreement concerning the application of a particular guideline or sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Because the district court correctly determined that Ramirez was ineligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court was not required to proceed to the second step to determine whether the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors warranted a sentence reduction. <em>See Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691-92. The district court did not err or otherwise abuse its discretion in denying Ramirez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion due to his career offender status. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237-38 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Anderson, </em>591 F.3d at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
