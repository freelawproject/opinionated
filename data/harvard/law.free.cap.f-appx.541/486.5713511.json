He appeals his 105-month sentence, asserting the district court procedurally erred in calculating the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The court calculated Villanueva\u2019s base-offense level through Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1 (unlawful receipt of firearms). Finding the firearms were transferred with knowledge or intent that they would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense, the court applied the cross-reference provision of Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A) and calculated the offense level using Guideline \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(l) (assault with intent to commit murder). Villanueva contends the court erred by using Guideline \u00a7 2A2.1, claiming the evidence failed to show he had any intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">As an initial matter, we reject the Government\u2019s assertions that Villanueva waived this issue by fading to adequately brief it on appeal and, in the alternative, that plain-error review applies. Villanueva both sufficiently raised this issue at sentencing and adequately briefed it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). Villanueva does not challenge the substantive reasonableness of the sentence; instead, he asserts only that the court made a procedural error in calculating the proper base-offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">By application of \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A)\u2019s cross-reference provision, the court assessed a base-offense level of 33, which applies \u201cif the object of the offense would have constituted first degree murder\u201d. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(1). The commentary to \u00a7 2A2.1 defines \u201cfirst degree murder\u201d as \u201cconduct that ... would constitute first degree murder under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.1, comment. (n.l). Section 1111(a) provides in relevant part: \u201cMurder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought\u201d. In addressing \u00a7 1111, our court has held: \u201c[mjalice does not require a subjective intent to kill, but may be established by evidence of conduct which is a reckless and wanton and a gross deviation from a reasonable standard of care\u201d. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>701 F.2d 367, 392 n. 20 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see United States v. Lemus-Gonzalez, </em>563 F.3d 88, 92 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">In short, Villanueva is incorrect in asserting Guideline \u00a7 2A2.1 requires showing an intent to kill. He does not assert on appeal that the facts presented in the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report, and adopted by the district court, fail to establish either \u201cintent to do serious bodily injury\u201d or \u201cextreme recklessness and wanton disregard for human life\u201d. <em>LemusGonzalez, </em>563 F.3d at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
