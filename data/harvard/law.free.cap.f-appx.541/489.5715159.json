He argues that his within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-21\">We consider the reasonableness of a sentence by engaging in a bifurcated review process. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Mendoza-Espinoza does not argue that the district court committed any procedural error, we consider only the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-22\">Although Mendoza-Espinoza asserts that a presumption of reasonableness should not apply to his within-guidelines sentence because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis, that issue is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). His argument that \u00a7 2L1.2 is unreasonable because it is not empirically based likewise is foreclosed, and we have repeatedly rejected the argument that a sentence imposed pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2 is greater than necessary to meet \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals as a result of any double counting inherent in that Guideline. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>As for his argument that the guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his illegal reentry offense and failed to reflect his personal history and characteristics, the record reflects that the district court considered mitigation factors and balanced them against other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Mendoza-Espinoza has failed to show that his within-guidelines sentence \u201cdoes not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, ... gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or ... represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). We find no reason to disturb the presumption of reasonableness in this case. <em>See id.; United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
