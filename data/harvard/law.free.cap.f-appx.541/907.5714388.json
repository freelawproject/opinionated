The District Court denied the defendant\u2019s motion on the ground that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction because he was sentenced as a career offender, despite being sentenced below the applicable Guidelines sentence range for career offenders due to downward variances or departures. Each defendant argues that the court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because, after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), a career offender who received a departure or variance and was sentenced below the career offender sentence range was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction under Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-16\">A district court may only reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if his sentence was based upon a sentence range the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered and if the reduction is consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is not consistent with those policy statements if, due to the operation of another guideline provision, it does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s sentence range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)). The defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is the guideline range that was in effect before any departures or variances were applied. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)). The application of \u00a7 1B1.10 does not vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>late the Ex Post Facto Clause so long as the effect of the post-conduct Guidelines amendment does not increase the defendant\u2019s punishment beyond what it would have been without the amendment. <em>United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255, 1258-59 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Amendment 750 reduced the offense levels associated with various amounts of crack cocaine found in the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Pt. A, <em>cross referencing </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 748 (2011). Amendment 750 did not make any changes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">When a defendant is sentenced as a career offender, his base offense level is determined under \u00a7 4B1.1, not under the Drug Quantity Table set forth in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Moore, </em>we faced the question of whether defendants who were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief in light of Amendment 706, which, like Amendment 750, lowered the \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) base offense levels for certain quantities of crack cocaine. 541 F.3d at 1325. We held that the defendants did not qualify for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 706 had no effect on their Guidelines sentence ranges, which were calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28, 1330. Further, where the court granted a downward departure based on one defendant\u2019s substantial assistance, there was no basis to conclude that Amendment 706 lowered the defendant\u2019s sentence range. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">In <em>Freeman, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether a defendant could be eligible for a sentence reduction where he entered into a Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement that included a recommended sentence or guideline sentence range. <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. In <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012), we specifically addressed Freeman\u2019s impact on <em>Moore </em>and held that <em>Moore </em>remained binding precedent. We concluded that <em>Freeman </em>was not \u201cclearly on point\u201d as to the issue addressed in <em>Moore </em>regarding the eligibility of career offenders for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief based on the retroactive lowering of crack cocaine base offense levels. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, <em>Freeman </em>did not address \u201cdefendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the offense level and guideline sentence range for career offenders were not lowered by Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">Based on our precedent, the District Court did not err in denying the defendants\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. The defendants\u2019 total offense levels and Guidelines sentence ranges were not based on the drug quantity offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1, but instead were based on the career offender offense levels in \u00a7 4B1.1. Because the sentence ranges were based on the career offender guidelines, not on the drug quantity guidelines, Amendment 750 did not lower the sentencing ranges upon which the defendants\u2019 sentences were based. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">The defendants\u2019 argument that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman </em>abrogated our decision in <em>Moore </em>is explicitly foreclosed by our decision in <em>Lawson. See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Moreover, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and its commentary, a reduction is only authorized where an amendment has the effect of lowering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>applicable Guidelines sentence range, which is determined before any departure or variance. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Thus, the defendants applicable sentence ranges for the purpose of determining their eligibility for a sentence reduction are the ranges produced by applying the career offender sentence range without regard to any downward departure or variance, and those ranges were not lowered by Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Finally, the defendants\u2019 arguments regarding the definition of \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d in the 2011 guidelines commentary are also unavailing. Section 3582(c)(2) explicitly incorporates applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission, and we have previously rejected the argument that the amendments to \u00a7 1B1.10 violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>Colon, </em>707 F.3d at 1258-59. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying the defendants\u2019 motions for a sentence reduction because they were sentenced as career offenders, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
