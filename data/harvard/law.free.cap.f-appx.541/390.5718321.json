Jones and George Silva of the San Antonio Police Department, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Finding no reason to alter the sound reasoning of the district court, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Cevallos filed a divorce action against his then-wife, Carolyn Cevallos, in 2008. Cevallos later learned that Carolyn and Silva had a romantic relationship. In October 2009, Cevallos was with a female companion when she was attacked and assaulted by Carolyn. San Antonio police officers were dispatched to the scene. After an investigation at the scene, the reporting police officer filed a report alleging that Carolyn had assaulted the female companion. Following this report, Cevallos and his female companion were interviewed by Jones as part of Jones\u2019 investigation of the charges against Carolyn. In December 2009, Jones filed criminal charges against Cevallos with the Bexar County Criminal District Attorney\u2019s office. In January 2010, Silva arrested Cevallos at his home and transported him to the magistrate\u2019s office. The District Attorney\u2019s office later dismissed the charges against Cevallos.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Cevallos brought suit in state court \u201cfor malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and violation of [his] civil and constitutional rights\u201d against Silva and Jones, and \u201cby virtue of their acting in the course and scope of their authority as San Antonio Police Officers, the City of San Antonio.\u201d The City removed the case to federal court and subsequently moved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of Procedure Rule 12(b)(6), asserting that Cevallos\u2019 pleadings were insufficient to state a claim against the City. Jones and Silva filed Rule 12(b)(6) motions asserting insufficient pleadings and, in the alternative, that Jones and Silva were entitled to qualified immunity. Cevallos moved to remand the case to state court. The matter was referred to a magistrate judge who issued a recommendation that the motions to dismiss be granted; the district court accepted the recommendations of the magistrate and dismissed Cevallos\u2019 claims. Cevallos timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s order on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Jebaco, Inc. v. Harrah\u2019s Operating Co., </em>587 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir.2009). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the factual allegations must be sufficient to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face and to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A claim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). The mere possibility of misconduct is not sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Cevallos first contests the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to remand the case back to state district court. Cevallos argues that the defendants waived their right to removal by filing for removal more than thirty days after they were served with Cevallos\u2019 original petition. A defendant who receives a pleading or \u201cother paper\u201d supporting federal jurisdiction may remove the case to federal court within thirty days of receiving such information. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b). Cevallos\u2019 Original Petition alleges \u201cviolation of his civil and constitutional rights\u201d and that Silva and Jones \u201cacted under color of law.\u201d Cevallos argues that by pleading those two elements, he was pleading a cause of action under \u00a7 1983. However, the well-pleaded complaint rule provides that the plaintiffs properly pleaded complaint governs jurisdictional determinations. If, on its face, such a complaint contains no issue of federal law, there is no federal question jurisdiction. <em>Caterpillar, Inc. v. Williams, </em>482 U.S. 386, 391-92, 107 S.Ct. 2425, 96 L.Ed.2d 318 (1987). Cevallos\u2019 Original Petition does not allege any specific claim under \u00a7 1983 or a violation of the United States Constitution; thus, the allegations in Cevallos\u2019 petition were too ambiguous to establish federal question jurisdiction definitively.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Cevallos alternatively argues that defendants\u2019 involvement in state court proceedings waived their right to remove. The record does not show that the City, Silva, or Jones made clear and unequivocal waivers of their rights to remove. The City\u2019s Motion to dismiss Silva and Jones occurred in state court before the case was removable and could thus not waive the right to remove before it arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Against the City of San Antonio, Cevallos argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims. The court held the pleadings insufficient to establish an official policy, practice, or custom of the City or the police department that was the moving force behind the alleged violations of Cevallos\u2019 constitutional rights. The court aptly noted that Cevallos\u2019 allegation that Silva and Jones acted \u201cin the course and scope of their authority as San Antonio Police officers\u201d was not sufficient to impose liability on the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">A city is not liable under \u00a7 1983 on the theory of respondeat superior; a municipality is only liable for acts directly attributable to it \u201cthrough some official action or imprimatur.\u201d <em>Valle v. City of Hous., </em>613 F.3d 536, 541 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Piotrowski v. City of Hous., </em>237 F.3d 567, 578 (5th Cir.2001)). To establish municipal liability, the plaintiff must show the deprivation of a federally protected right caused by action taken \u201cpursuant to an official municipal policy.\u201d <em>Valle, </em>613 F.3d at 541 (citing <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978)). The plaintiff must identify: \u201c(1) an official policy (or custom), of which (2) a policymaker can be charged with actual or constructive knowledge, and (3) a constitutional violation whose moving force is that policy or custom.\u201d <em>Valle, </em>613 F.3d at 541-42 (internal citations omitted) Nowhere does Cevallos\u2019 amended complaint allege that a policy, practice, custom, or procedure of the City or of the police department was the moving force behind the alleged violations of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar8\">It is also not enough that Cevallos\u2019 Response Appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss elaborated on his allegations against the City. Even if his Response stated a claim for relief cognizable under <em>Twombly, </em>the <em>complaint </em>must contain either direct allegations on every material point necessary to sustain recovery or contain allegations from which an inference may be fairly drawn that evidence will be introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>at trial. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955; <em>Campbell v. City of San Antonio, </em>43 F.3d 973, 975 (5th Cir.1995). Cevallos did not seek leave to amend his complaint to include the detailed allegations against the City found in his Response. Accordingly, his pleadings remained void of allegations against the City sufficient to withstand dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Last, Cevallos argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against Silva and Jones on the basis of qualified immunity. The court correctly noted that this court has rejected a freestanding right to be free from malicious prosecution or abuse of process. <em>Castellano v. Fragozo, </em>352 F.3d 939, 945 (5th Cir.2003) (malicious prosecution); <em>Sisk v. Levings, </em>868 F.2d 159, 161-62 (5th Cir.1989) (abuse of process). Because Cevallos did not distinguish his malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims from those this Court has rejected or plead facts demonstrating false arrest without probable cause, the district court dismissed Cevallos\u2019 claims against Silva and Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Although it is no longer mandated as a first step in the qualified immunity analysis, we first \u201cdecide whether the facts that [the] plaintiff has alleged ... make out a violation of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Doe ex rel. Magee v. Covington Cnty. Sch. Dist. ex rel. Keys, </em>675 F.3d 849, 869 (5th Cir.2012) (citing <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 232, 236, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009)). Cevallos\u2019 Original Petition alleges \u201cmalicious prosecution and abuse of process and violation of his civil and constitutional rights.\u201d Cevallos\u2019 claims predicated on \u201cmalicious prosecution\u201d or \u201cabuse of process\u201d fail as a matter of law unless founded in another constitutional right. <em>See Castellano, </em>352 F.3d at 945; <em>Sisk, </em>868 F.2d at 161-62. Cevallos alleges that Silva and Jones \u201cviolat[ed] his civil and constitutional rights\u201d but identifies no predicate for such \u201crights\u201d in his pleadings. As the district court noted, Cevallos\u2019 Response to defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss attempted to assert facts demonstrating false arrest without probable cause, a claim cognizable under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., Gerstein v. Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 111-12, 95 S.Ct. 854, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975). Cevallos did not, however, seek leave to amend his petition to include this argument. Thus, for the reasons stated above as applied to Cevallos\u2019 claim against the City, Cevallos\u2019 pleadings against Silva and Jones are insufficient to withstand dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). We need not reach the scope of qualified immunity as to Silva or Jones. <em>See Doe, </em>675 F.3d at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">. Cevallos' appellate brief charges the City with unconstitutional failure to train, but that theory does not appear in the amended complaint and is waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
