After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">On December 11, 2002, Mr. Nelson pled guilty to distribution of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). The pre-sentence investigation report indicated that Mr. Nelson\u2019s total offense level was 25 based upon the quantity of cocaine base (24.3 grams) as well an adjustment for accepting responsibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Nelson, however, qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which subjected him to an enhanced total offense level of 31 and a sentencing guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Mr. Nelson as a career offender to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">On November 18, 2011, Mr. Nelson filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2374 (2010). The district court denied Mr. Nelson\u2019s motion because (1) <em>\u201ca </em>defendant whose original sentence was based on the Career Offender Guidelines ... cannot receive a sentence reduction pursuant to a Guideline amendment like Amendment 750,\u201d and (2) the Fair Sentencing Act does not apply to defendants sentenced before its enactment. <em>See </em>D.E. 133 at 2-4. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">\u201cIn a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u2018we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the terms of a defendant\u2019s imprisonment if the sentence was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. If, however, \u201ca retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">In this case, Mr. Nelson was not eligible for a reduced sentence because he was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. His sentencing guideline range remained unchanged because \u00a7 4B1.1 was not affected by Amendment 750. <em>See id. </em>at 1327 (holding that defendants sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 are not entitled to sentence reductions based on an amendment to the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses in \u00a7 2D1.1); <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent and applies to Amendment 750).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">Mr. Nelson urges us to reconsider this interpretation of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he believes that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), has \u201ccall[ed] Moore\u2019s narrow interpretation of the phrase \u2018based on\u2019 into question.\u201d <em>See </em>Initial Brief at 7. We have, however, already rejected that argument in a published decision. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321 (interpreting <em>Freeman </em>and holding that <em>\u201cMoore </em>remains binding precedent because it has not been overruled\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>And, under our prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow <em>Lawson </em>\u201cunless and until it is overruled by this court <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>342 F.3d 1245, 1246 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Mr. Nelson\u2019s claim for relief under the Fair Sentencing Act is similarly foreclosed by our precedent. In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012), we held that the Fair Sentencing Act is not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission and, therefore, cannot be the basis for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In addition, Mr. Nelson was sentenced before the effective date of the FSA, and it is not retroactively applicable to him. <em>See id. </em>(\u2018We agree with every other circuit to address the issue that there is \u2018no evidence that Congress intended [the FSA] to apply to defendants who had been sentenced prior to the August 3, 2010 date of the Act\u2019s enactment.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">In sum, the district court correctly denied Mr. Nelson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-8\">. If Mr. Nelson had been sentenced according the offense level for his crack cocaine offense, his sentencing guideline range would have been 110-137 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (2000). , In his initial brief, Mr. Nelson erroneously states that the sentencing guideline range based on his offense was identical to the sentencing guideline range based on his career offender status. <em>See </em>Initial Br. at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
