According to Mr. Gorrell, the Federal Bureau of Prisons violated his due process rights when it disciplined him following a positive drug test, and unlawfully discriminated against him during his disciplinary proceedings because he is HIV-positive. On appeal, he claims that the district court erroneously (1) concluded that his discrimination-based claims were inappropriately raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition; (2) concluded that the BOP satisfied its procedural due process obligations regarding notice and a hearing; (3) denied his subpoena request; and (4) failed to review the merits of his due process claim regarding entitlement to consideration of certain toxicology results at his disciplinary hearing. We address each of Mr. Gorrell\u2019s claims below.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Skinner v. Wiley, </em>355 F.3d 1293, 1294 (11th Cir.2004). Mr. Gorrell first contends that the court erred in rejecting his claims that the BOP\u2019s actions amounted to unlawful discrimination on the basis of his disability (HIV-positive), in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\u201cRehabilitation Act\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)-(c), and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">A \u00a7 2241 habeas petition is the appropriate vehicle to bring challenges to the execution of sentence. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P: Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1351 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). Importantly, there is a \u201cline of demarcation\u201d between habeas claims and civil rights claims. <em>See Hutcherson v. Riley, </em>468 F.3d 750, 754 (11th Cir.2006) (comparing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas claims and civil rights claims). So, when an inmate raises a challenge to the \u201ccircumstances of his confinement\u201d rather than the execution of his sentence, the claim should be brought in a civil rights action rather than a habeas petition. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">The Rehabilitation Act provides that \u201c[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). Similarly, the ADA prohibits a \u201cpublic entity\u201d from discriminating against \u201ca qualified individual with a disability\u201d on account of the individual\u2019s disability. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Here, the district court did not err in rejecting Mr. Gorrell\u2019s Rehabilitation Act and ADA claims as improperly asserted in his \u00a7 2241 petition. Mr. Gorrell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition correctly raised his challenge to the BOP\u2019s execution of his sentence, particularly the removal of good-conduct time and visiting privileges. But, the claims for relief under the Rehabilitation Act and ADA concerned not the execution of the sentence, but instead asserted that BOP officials unlawfully took action against Mr. Gorrell on the basis of his disability. Independent civil causes of action exist to remedy that alleged discrimination, so the district court did not err in ruling that Gorrell\u2019s Rehabilitation Act and ADA claims were inappropriately raised here. Accordingly, we affirm as to these claims. Mr. Gorrell, of course, is free to assert these claims in a separate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Mr. Gorrell also argues that he did not receive adequate notice and a hearing during the BOP proceedings, and that he was entitled to such process owing to the \u201catypical and significant hardship\u201d he endured as a result of the BOP\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have explained that \u201c[djetermining whether one was deprived of liberty presents a unique challenge with prisoners, who are already deprived of their liberty in the ordinary understanding of the word.\u201d <em>Kirby v. Siegelman, </em>195 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.1999). Procedural safeguards are owed, however, if a prisoner is subjected to a change in the conditions of confinement \u201cso severe that it essentially exceeds the sentence imposed by the court,\u201d or if a prisoner is deprived of some consistently bestowed benefit, such as good-time credits, that \u201cimposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291 (citing <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 558, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2976, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>In <em>Wolff, </em>the Supreme Court set out the hearing procedures that must be satisfied to meet the standards of due process in the prison setting. <em>Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 556, 94 S.Ct. at 2975. According to <em>Wolff, </em>prisoners must receive (1) advance written notice of the charges against them; (2) an opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence, so long as doing so is consistent with institutional safety and correctional goals; and (3) a written statement by the factfinder outlining the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action. <em>Id. </em>at 563-67, 94 S.Ct. at 2978-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">In <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484-85, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 2300-01, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), the Supreme Court clarified that the <em>Wolff </em>procedural protections are owed if the state imposes \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,\u201d though it did not elaborate on what hardships would qualify. In <em>Kirby, </em>however, we noted that the deprivation of good-time credits qualifies as an \u201catypical and significant hardship.\u201d <em>Kirby, </em>195 F.3d at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">In light of these principles, the district court\u2019s ruling on Mr. Gorrell\u2019s due process claims was sound. As an initial matter, it is undisputed that Mr. Gorrell was deprived of good-time credits as a result of the disciplinary hearing officer\u2019s (\u201cDHO\u201d) findings, so he was entitled, under <em>Wolff </em>and <em>Kirby, </em>to procedural due process safeguards. <em>Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 558, 94 S.Ct. at 2976; <em>Kirby, </em>195 F.3d at 1291. <em>Wolff </em>clearly provided that procedural protections are due when an inmate is deprived of good-time credits, and <em>Kirby </em>clarified that such deprivation itself is a qualifying hardship. <em>Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 558, 94 S.Ct. at 2976; <em>Kirby, </em>195 F.3d at 1291. The BOP did not violate those safeguards, however, as the record shows that Mr. Gorrell was given advance written notice of the charge against him, that he was granted an opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence \u2014 and in fact, presented such evidence \u2014 and, finally, that he was issued a written statement by the DHO outlining the evidence relied on, its reasoning, and its findings. Mr. Gorrell was even given some protection not mandated by <em>Wolff, </em>such as the right to staff assistance at the disciplinary hearing. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling as to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Next, Mr. Gorrell argues that the court erred in denying his request for leave to file a civil subpoena to obtain the actual toxicology results underlying his positive drug-test. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">A habeas petitioner is generally \u201cnot entitled to discovery as a matter of ordinary course,\u201d but evidence may be obtained upon showing \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Arthur v. Allen, </em>459 F.3d 1310, 1310 (11th Cir.2006). <em>See </em>Rule 6(a) of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases (\u201cA party shall be entitled to invoke processes of discovery available under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if, and to the extent that, the judge in the exercise of his discretion and for good cause shown grants leave to do so, but not otherwise.\u201d); Rule 1(a) of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases (\u201cThe district court may apply any or all of these rules to a [\u00a7 2241] habeas corpus petition.\u201d). \u201c[G]ood cause for discovery cannot arise from mere speculation.\u201d <em>Arthur, </em>459 F.3d at 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">A claim must be dismissed as moot if the issue presented is no longer \u201clive,\u201d such that the courts cannot grant meaningful relief. <em>See, e.g., Soliman v. U.S. ex rel INS, </em>296 F.3d 1237, 1242 (11th Cir.2002). When a district court does not expressly rule on a party\u2019s pending motion, the entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>of a final judgment against the party, as a general matter, implicitly denies that motion. <em>See Chalwest (Holdings) Ltd. v. Ellis, </em>924 F.2d 1011, 1012 (11th Cir.1991) (holding that appellant\u2019s request for evidentiary hearing was denied <em>sub silentio </em>by district court\u2019s order of dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Here, Mr. Gorrell\u2019s complaint regarding the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for leave to file a civil subpoena is moot because he has admitted receiving the report at issue after filing a separate civil action against the testing laboratory\u2014 indeed, he has attached that report to his brief to this Court. In any case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mr. Gorrell\u2019s motion because he asserted only that the documents sought were exculpatory, but \u201cmere speculation\u201d alone does not satisfy the \u201cgood cause\u201d necessary to obtain habeas discovery. <em>See Arthur, </em>459 F.3d at 1311. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Gorrell\u2019s subpoena request.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Lastly, Mr. Gorrell argues that the district court failed to address his contention, <em>See </em>D.E. 1 at 26, that he was entitled to have the DHO consider the actual toxicology results at his disciplinary hearing, in violation of <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc). </em>On this point, we agree with Mr. Gorrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">In <em>Clisby, </em>we \u201cinstructed] the district courts to resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 ... regardless whether habeas relief is granted or denied.\u201d <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 936. A \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 is defined as \u201cany allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a district court fails to address all of the claims in a habeas petition, we will \u201cvacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938. Later, in an unpublished case, we extended <em>Clisby </em>to cover petitions filed pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See Smith v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>432 Fed.Appx. 843, 844-45, n. 1 (11th Cir.2011) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">The district court did not comply with <em>Clisby. </em>In a report, the magistrate judge reasoned that Mr. Gorrell\u2019s due process rights were not violated because the DHO considered all of the exculpatory evidence that was presented at the disciplinary hearing, but the magistrate did not consider Mr. Gorrell\u2019s claim that he had a due process entitlement to review of the actual toxicology results. Mr. Gorrell objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion, but the district court did not directly the address the claim on review. Instead, the district court concluded that Mr. Gorrell received the due process he was owed because the DHO \u201cconsidered all evidence <em>presented </em>at the disciplinary hearing.\u201d Notably, however, the court did not address or resolve the question whether the BOP or DHO had obligations with respect to evidence not presented at the hearing, such as the actual toxicology results. Because the court did not address Mr. Gorrell\u2019s claim that he was entitled to a review of the actual toxicology results underlying his positive drug test, we vacate and remand for the limited purpose of resolving this claim.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-7\">. Mr. Gorrell also suggests that his initial drug test, out of which the instant case arose, may have been administered in retaliation for a related case he filed in the Third Circuit. <em>See Gorrell v. Yost, </em>509 Fed.Appx. 114 (3d Cir.2013). Because Mr. Gorrell did not raise this claim before the district court, it was waived. <em>See Adkins v. Warden, Holman CF, </em>710 F.3d 1241, 1247 (11th Cir.2013) (holding that the state waived an argument raised for the first time in supplemental briefing on appeal because it had not raised the argument before the district court or in its initial brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b969-9\"> We express no view on the merits of this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
