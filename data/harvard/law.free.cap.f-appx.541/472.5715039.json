Cali</em>forniai 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Anyanwu has not filed a response. Counsel contends Anyanwu can raise no nonfrivolous issues on appeal because she agreed to waive her rights, including those conferred by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, to appeal from her conviction and sentence. Further, counsel has certified, as required by <em>United States v. Acquaye, </em>452 F.3d 380, 382 (5th Cir.2006), that the Government intends to rely on the appellate waiver in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
