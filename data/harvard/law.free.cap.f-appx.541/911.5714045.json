Because we agree with the district court that Mr. Cadman\u2019s claim is barred by the libel-slander-misrepresentation exception to the FTCA, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">In 2008, Mr. Cadman, a federal contractor for Booz-Allen-Hamilton, was hired by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help run its \u201cSecure Communities\u201d program. The program was controversial because it required participating state and local law enforcement agencies and employees to submit arrest information to ICE that could later be used for immigration and removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">Under the supervision of ICE officials, Mr. Cadman was directed to produce position papers indicating whether participation in the program was statutorily mandated or optional. Mr. Cadman subsequently delivered position papers to his supervisors presenting his opinion that the program was mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">In 2009, ICE officials decided not to enforce mandatory participation and created an official opt-out policy. When ICE employees continued to take varying positions on the issue, Mr. Cadman was asked to explore ways to deal with certain localities\u2019 resistance to participation. Mr. Cad-man felt that the resistance was politically driven and in response to one city\u2019s choice to opt out of the program, he wrote an email saying, \u201cThis is not good, not good at all! ... Time perhaps for a full court press?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">ICE\u2019s inconsistent positions drew attention from a Congressional Representative, the public, and the press. Amidst this concern, a large number of e-mails (including Mr. Cadman\u2019s) were released pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request. During this controversy, John Morton and Brian Hale, agents of ICE, published statements attributing ICE\u2019s inconsistent positions and problems to Mr. Cadman. In March of 2011, ICE and Booz-AllenHamilton terminated their contracts with Mr. Cadman. Agent Morton and Agent Hale issued further communications to third parties implying that Mr. Cadman\u2019s termination \u201cwould cure or had cured the issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">Mr. Cadman filed an administrative claim with ICE for false light/invasion of privacy and negligence under the FTCA. After ICE denied the claim in June of 2012, Mr. Cadman filed suit against the United States, alleging that Agents Morton and Hale had made false statements about him and that their supervisors had behaved negligently by failing to stop or correct the statements. After determining that Mr. Cadman\u2019s claims all \u201carose out of\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>certain torts \u2014 libel, slander, and misrepresentation \u2014 which are expressly exempted under a provision of the FTCA, the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under the FTCA based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). <em>See JBP Acquisitions, LP v. United States, </em>224 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2000). We accept the well-pleaded factual allegations of Mr. Cadman\u2019s complaint as true. <em>See Lawrence v. Dunbar, </em>919 F.2d 1525, 1529 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">\u201c[Sjovereign immunity bars suit against the United States except to the extent that it consents to be sued.\u201d <em>Means v. United States, </em>176 F.3d 1376, 1378 (11th Cir.1999). The FTCA provides a limited waiver of sovereign immunity in some situations, and federal district courts have jurisdiction over certain tort actions against the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b); <em>Means, </em>176 F.3d at 1378-79. This limited waiver of sovereign immunity does not include suits \u201carising out of ... libel, slander, [or] misrepresentation....\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). FTCA exemptions, like the one found in \u00a7 2680(h), are strictly construed in favor of the United States. <em>See JBP, </em>224 F.3d at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">Mr. Cadman correctly notes that the substantive law which governs his claims of false light/invasion of privacy and negligence is District of Columbia law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1) (stating that liability is determined in accordance with the \u201claw of the place where the act or omission occurred\u201d). The determinative issue on appeal, however, involves a matter of federal law: whether Mr. Cadman\u2019s alleged false light/invasion of privacy and negligence claims are barred by \u00a7 2680(h). <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. United States, </em>788 F.2d 845, 851 (2d Cir.1986) (\u201cThe scope of \u00a7 2680(h) is a matter of federal law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">More than twenty-five years ago, we specifically addressed whether the torts of invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress come within the \u00a7 2680(h) exemption. <em>See Metz v. United States, </em>788 F.2d 1528, 1532 (11th Cir.1986). We held in <em>Metz </em>that the exceptions in the FTCA are not limited to the torts specifically named, but instead encompass situations where \u201cthe underlying governmental conduct which constitutes an excepted cause of action is \u2018essential\u2019 to plaintiffs claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1534. <em>See also O\u2019Ferrell v. United States, </em>253 F.3d 1257, 1265-66 (11th Cir.2001) (applying <em>Metz </em>and holding that false light/invasion of privacy claims based on defamatory statements were barred by \u00a7 2680(h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">Our sister circuits have also ruled that claims for false light/invasion of privacy are barred by the libel and slander exception in \u00a7 2680(h). <em>See Wuterich v. Murtha, </em>562 F.3d 375, 379-81 (D.C.Cir.2009) (holding that invasion of privacy and false light claims arose out of libel or slander and were barred); <em>Kugel v. United States, </em>947 F.2d 1504, 1507 (D.C.Cir.1991) (concluding that claims based on \u201cdissemination of [defamatory] information\u201d were barred by the FTCA\u2019s exemptions). <em>See also Johnson v. Sawyer, </em>47 F.3d 716, 725 (5th Cir.1995) (noting that the district court held a false light claim was barred because \u201c[fits essence is injury to [plaintiffs] reputation, and it therefore falls under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h)....\u201d); <em>Thomas-Lazear v. F.B.I., </em>851 F.2d 1202, 1206 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>Cir.1988) (rejecting an \u201cattempt to fashion the slander and libel claims into a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress ...\u201d under the FTCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">The underlying conduct in <em>Metz </em>and <em>O\u2019Ferrell</em>\u2014government officials\u2019 state ments about the plaintiffs \u2014 is similar to the alleged statements that harmed Mr. Cadman here. <em>See Metz, </em>788 F.2d at 1535; <em>O\u2019Ferrell, </em>253 F.3d at 1265-66. The fact that there was \u201cno other governmental action upon which the [false light and intentional infliction of emotional distress] claims could rest\u201d was dispositive in <em>Metz </em>and <em>O\u2019Ferrell. See </em>788 F.2d at 1535, 253 F.3d at 1265-66. This same rationale governs here. At bottom, all of the allegedly tortious actions here are based on \u201cstatements, representations, or imputations,\u201d and there is no other independent government action on which Mr. Cadman\u2019s claims can rest. We therefore agree with the district court that Mr. Cadman\u2019s claims come within, and are barred by, the libel-slander-misrepresentation exemption of the FTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">Mr. Cadman argues that District of Columbia law recognizes an action for false light/invasion of privacy different from a traditional action for defamation. He says that the \u201crepresentations made about [him] were not necessarily false,\u201d and so, \u201cthey could not have given rise to an action for defamation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As we explained in <em>Metz, </em>however, the \u201cproper analysis is a comparison between the plaintiffs\u2019 claim and the \u2018traditional and commonly understood definition\u2019 of the torts excepted by that section, rather than a comparison with the law of any particular state.\u201d 788 F.2d at 1535 n. 8. <em>See also </em>Rodney A. Smolla, Law of Defamation \u00a7 10:10 (2d ed.1999) (explaining that any distinction between false light/invasion of privacy and defamation is \u201coften elusive ... and not completely satisfactory\u201d). Accordingly, we reject Mr. Cadman\u2019s argument that his possible inability to recover for defamation in the District of Columbia necessarily means that \u201chis claims must not be for \u2018libel [or] slander\u2019 under the FTCA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">On appeal, Mr. Cadman attempts to re-characterize his negligence claims. In his complaint, Mr. Cadman alleged that the ICE agents\u2019 statements about him were negligent, and that there was an overall failure by the supervising agents who were in charge of the Secure Communities program to train and supervise Agents Morton and Hale and to mitigate the harm caused by the statements. Mr. Cadman urges in his brief that \u201cthose directly in charge\u201d of the program did not properly present his work product to Agent Morton and Agent Hale. Moreover, he says that those in charge failed to advise Agent Morton to review the documentation, which caused him to \u201cerroneously attribute the problems\u201d with the program to Mr. Cadman and to \u201ctake direct action to terminate [his] employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">Even if we accept Mr. Cadman\u2019s re-characterization of the negligence claims, they cannot survive for two main reasons. First, the claims cannot circumvent \u00a7 2680(h)\u2019s bar because the sole basis for any harm caused to Mr. Cadman were the <em>statements </em>made to third parties by Agent Morton and Agent Hale that cast him in an alleged false light. <em>See O\u2019Ferrell, </em>253 F.3d at 1265-66 (rejecting an attempt to use a \u201cnegligent supervision\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>theory to avoid the holding of Metz). No amount of \u201csemantical recasting\u201d can alter this fact. <em>See United States v. Shearer, </em>473 U.S. 52, 55, 105 S.Ct. 3039, 87 L.Ed.2d 38 (1985) (stating that \u201cno semantical recasting of events [could] alter the fact that battery\u201d \u2014 which was barred by \u00a7 2680(h) \u2014 was the cause of the injury). Second, the portion of the negligence claim alleging a \u201cfailure to investigate,\u201d which purportedly led to Mr. Cadman\u2019s termination from Booz-Allen-Hamilton, fails because the harm \u2014 interference with contract rights \u2014 is another tort expressly barred by \u00a7 2680(h). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) (exempting claim arising out of \u201cinterference with contract rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Cadman\u2019s complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-7\">. <em>See Jankovic v. International Crisis Group, </em>429 F.Supp.2d 165, 173 (D.D.C.2006) (stating that a \"false and defamatory statement\u201d is a required element for a defamation claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
