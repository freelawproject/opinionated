There being no substantial question presented on appeal, we will summarily affirm.3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Johnson filed a pro se complaint in 2012. As the Magistrate Judge described it, the complaint was \u201cin part a polemic, expressing his views on the constitution,\u201d coupled with a \u201cdemand\u201d that the court \u201cabrogate the judicial immunity of\u2019 judges who presided over his proceedings, along with a request to pursue a private criminal action against federal judges and prosecutors in Texas. (Dkt. No. 5, p. 1.) The Magistrate Judge determined that, to the extent Johnson\u2019s complaint sought relief that he was \u201cnot entitled to receive,\u201d namely, the abrogation of immunity for judges and prosecutors, it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>(Id. </em>pp. 8-9.) The Magistrate Judge also determined that Johnson legally could not bring a private action against judges and prosecutors. Finally, to the extent that Johnson was challenging his federal conviction in Texas, the Magistrate Judge concluded that he needed to pursue relief through a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in that judicial district, and recommended dismissing his complaint with prejudice. <em>(Id. </em>p. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">After considering Johnson\u2019s objections, the District Court conducted a de novo review and adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Though Johnson wrote \u201cextensively as to why he believes judicial immunity is unconstitutional,\u201d the District Court determined that he made no allegations that the judges presiding over his eases \u201cacted outside the scope of judicial duties or without jurisdiction.\u201d (Dkt. No. 16, p. 4.) The District Court also noted that, even though it was Johnson\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d that \u201cevery form of immunity\u201d was unconstitutional, \u201cit is certainly not the law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>p. 5.) Finally, the District Court agreed that Johnson\u2019s \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d was to file a \u00a7 2255 motion in the Northern District of Texas, where he was tried and sentenced. <em>(Id. </em>p. 7.) Johnson\u2019s complaint was dismissed with prejudice, and leave to amend was denied as futile. He timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). Upon review, we conclude that the District Court properly dismissed Johnson\u2019s complaint, and that it did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">Johnson\u2019s claims against any individual judges were barred by the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity. A judge is immune from liability for all actions taken in his or her judicial capacity, unless such action is taken in the absence of all jurisdiction. <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). As the District Court pointed out, Johnson made no allegations that the judges acted outside of their judicial capacity or in the absence of jurisdiction. Further, prosecutors are absolutely immune from liability for actions performed \u201cin a quasi-judicial role,\u201d including filing and bringing criminal charges against a defendant. <em>Yarris v. Cnty. of Del., </em>465 F.3d 129, 135 (3d Cir.2006). Again, nothing in Johnson\u2019s complaint justified abrogating that immunity. Nor could Johnson bring a private criminal complaint against the judges or prosecutors, as \u201ca private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution ... of another.\u201d <em>Linda R.S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 619, 93 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973). Finally, to the extent that Johnson was attacking his conviction and the sentence imposed by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, we agree with the District Court that he must file a \u00a7 2255 motion in that district. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255(a) and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Miller\u2019s appeal does not present a substantial question. We will therefore summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. All pending motions are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
