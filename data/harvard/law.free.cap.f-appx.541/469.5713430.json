(Arana-Ventura). However, when interviewed by the probation officer following his plea, he revealed for the first time that his true name was Santos Lucio Cornejo. The district court applied an adjustment for obstruction of justice because Arana-Ventura had used a false name before the MJ, and the district court also denied credit for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">Arana-Ventura contends that the district court clearly erred by denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. He asserts that he provided information that permitted investigators to learn all they needed to prosecute and sentence him. He notes that the majority of his criminal history was discoverable under the name \u201cArana-Ventura,\u201d and he further notes that he eventually provided his true name to the probation officer, which enabled discovery of his remaining previous conviction. He argues that his conduct is consistent with acceptance of responsibility and that his is an extraordinary case in which conduct amounting to obstruction of justice does not indicate lack of acceptance of responsibility. The parties dispute the standard of review, but we need not decide the applicable standard because, as discussed below, Arana-Ventura cannot prevail even assuming that the issue was preserved. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">Conduct resulting in an enhancement for obstruction of justice ordinarily \u201cindicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4)). Only in \u201cextraordinary cases\u201d will both adjustments apply. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4). The defendant bears the burden of proving entitlement to the reduction. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>120 F.3d 564, 574-75 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">Because the sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, his analysis of this issue must be afforded \u201cgreat deference\u201d on review. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.5). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Deferring to the district court\u2019s unique position, we examine the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility \u201cunder a standard of review even more deferential than a pure clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d 701, 705 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Although Arana-Ventura ultimately provided his true name to authorities, he concealed his identity until after he had pleaded guilty, and he used an alias before the MJ and at his guilty plea hearing. This conduct served to conceal, at least temporarily, his previous immigration conviction, and it warranted an adjustment for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1, comment (n.4), which states that the adjustment applies where the defendant \u201cprovides] materially false information to a judge or magistrate.\u201d <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>964 F.2d 390, 392-93 (5th Cir.1992). The fact that Arana-Ventura came forward with his real name after he pleaded guilty does not make his an extraordinary case in which credit for acceptance of responsibility is warranted even though an adjustment for obstruction of justice applies. <em>See United States v. Chung, </em>261 F.3d 536, 540-41 (5th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s denial of credit for acceptance of responsibility must be upheld as it is not \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002) (quotation marks and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b492-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
