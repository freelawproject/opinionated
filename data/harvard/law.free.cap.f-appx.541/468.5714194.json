By moving to proceed IFP, Jones is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The district court concluded that Jones was not eligible for a sentencing reduction pursuant to Amendment 750 of the Sentencing Guidelines because pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), his life sentence resulted from his two prior felony drug convictions. In addition, the district court found that Jones\u2019s base offense level was not reduced by the amendment. For the first time before this court, Jones contends that the failure to reduce his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) constitutes an equal protection violation because Amendment 750 was enacted to ameliorate sentencing disparities for powder and crack cocaine offenses. He has not established a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>Sonnier v. Quarterman, </em>476 F.3d 349, 367 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Hayden, </em>898 F.2d 966, 967 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Jones also contends that because the jury did not find the pertinent drug quantity beyond a reasonable doubt, he should have been sentenced for an indeterminate amount of cocaine under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). We decline to consider this challenge to the validity of the originally imposed sentence. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">As a final matter, Jones maintains that because the underlying guidelines calculation influenced the court\u2019s sentencing decision, he is entitled to a sentencing reduction. Under the authority of this circuit, Jones\u2019s mandatory minimum statutory penalty overrides the retroactive application of the guidelines amendments. <em>See United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Jones\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A8A\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
