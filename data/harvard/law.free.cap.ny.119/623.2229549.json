This is necessary when the appellant intends to review before the General Term findings of fact based upon conflicting evidence, in relation to which no exception lies. In such a case we affirmed the propriety of the rule adopted in the Supreme Court, which refused to review questions of fact based upon conflicting evidence, unless the case contained the statement that all the evidence was returned. We affirmed the Supreme Court in such practice both because we thought it right and because the question more immediately concerned that court. <em>(Porter </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>107 N. Y. 531.) But an exception filed to a finding of fact can only mean that it is intended to bring up the question of law, that there is not any evidence tending to sustain the finding. In that event it behooves the respondent to see to it that all the evidence which tends in any way to support such finding is contained in the case, and we can review the question of law raised by the exception, without the statement that the case contains all the evidence. This is said in response to the claim of the counsel for respondent that, as the case herein does not contain such statement, it will be presumed there was other and sufficient evidence given on the trial to support the finding of fact.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b646-7\"><em>Esek Cowen </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b646-8\"><em>L.
