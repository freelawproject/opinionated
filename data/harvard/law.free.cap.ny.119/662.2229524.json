Of course, if the amendment be of such nature as to show that the record as amended, was not before the General Term, we should not hear it, as our jurisdiction is confined to a review of the decisions actually made by that tribunal. (N. <em>Y. Cable Co. </em>v. Mayor, <em>etc., </em>104 N. Y. 1.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b684-15\">\u201c The plaintiff\u2019s motion to remit for the purpose of permitting the court below to amend the record, if it should desire to do so, is therefore, unnecssary and must be denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b685-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u201c The defendant\u2019s motion for judgment will be held until the first motion day of the coming term, when it may be brought on without further notice. What disposition beneficial to the plaintiff can be then made of the case, it is somewhat difficult to see. If a record show that the order or judgment of a court below was by consent, or was not an actual determinan tion of such court, an appeal to this court could not be heard, for, as already stated, we can not review decisions of the lower courts entered by consent or taken merely <em>pro </em>forma, where the record shows such facts.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b685-3\"><em>Arthur L.
