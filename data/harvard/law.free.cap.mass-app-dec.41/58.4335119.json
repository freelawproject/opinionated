It appears that the defendant was engaged to construct a warehouse in Holland for the storage of automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The report states \u201cThe plaintiff served the defendant by service in the said Town of Holland on one David Dorman, an employee of the defendant corporation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The defendant filed a plea in abatement, in which it denied it was \u201cdoing business\u201d in the Commonwealth and also attacked the sufficiency of the service. The plea was allowed and the plaintiff claimed a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">It could be found that the defendant was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>foreign corporation doing business in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We assume (it is not specifically so stated in the report) that the defendant had not appointed the Secretary of State, G.L. c. 181, \u00a7 3 its attorney for the service of process. If the plaintiff had chosen to effect service by serving the Secretary of State as provided in this situation by the provisions of G.L. c. 181, \u00a7 3A, there presumably would be no problem. Instead it chose to attempt to serve \u201can agent or other officer in charge of its business\u201d under G.L. c. 223, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 38.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b66-7\">John J. O\u2019Shaughnessy of Southbridge for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b66-9\">Thomas J. O\u2019Connor of Springfield for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">To have valid service on an agent of a corporation it must appear that the agent was \u201cin charge of its business\u201d. <em>Luce </em>v. <em>Columbia River Packers Association, </em>286 Mass. 343, 344. <em>United Drug Company v. Cordley and Hayes, </em>239 Mass. 334, 337-338.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The return of service in the case under consideration did not state on the officer\u2019s return that the employee upon whom service was made was \u201cin charge of its business\u201d. Service on an employee not in charge of its business is not authorized. The report is to be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-11\"> See now the \u201cLong Arm Statute\u201d, G.L. c. 223A enacted in 1968.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
