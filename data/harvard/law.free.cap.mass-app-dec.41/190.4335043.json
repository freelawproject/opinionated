There was a finding for the plaintiff and the defendant alleging to be aggrieved by the judge\u2019s denial of two requests for rulings of law claimed a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\"><em>There was evidence tending to show that </em>agents for the defendant went to the plaintiff\u2019s place of business and asked it to continue work for the New York and Worcester Express Company which Company the defendant was taking-over. An officer of the plaintiff told them it was owed Seventeen Thousand ($17,000.) Dollars by the New York and Worcester Express Com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>pony and that he would do no further work for it. The defendant\u2019s agent said \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s terminal was used by defendant which had a rate agent employed by it on the premises. The defendant installed a telephone \u201chot line\u201d in the plaintiff\u2019s terminal connecting the terminal of the defendant. It was used solely by the defendant. The plaintiff received a call on said \u201chot line\u201d from the defendant\u2019s terminal in Albany, New York, requesting it to pick up tires purchased by the defendant and deliver them to its terminal in New Jersey. Shipments were billed on \u201cpros\u201d (bills of lading) which bore the name \u201cEastern Freight Way, Inc.\u201d (the defendant). Bills were submitted to the defendant on behalf of the plaintiff and payment being overdue, the plaintiff contacted the defendant at its terminal in New Jersey and was told there \u201cwas confusion at this time, but the bills would be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">At the close of the evidence the defendant presented two requests for rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201c1. When an authorized agent makes a contract in the name of a disclosed principal, the principal and not the agent is liable on the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">2. The evidence requires a finding for the defendant. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The judge disposed of the requests as follows: \u201cNumber one is denied because the facts cited in the request are not found.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">I do not find that the defendant was the agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>of a disclosed principal. I further find that the defendant contracted with the plaintiffs in its own capacity as a trucking company.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b199-9\">John J. O\u2019Connor, Jr. and Edward N.

There was ample evidence here.</p>\n<p id=\"AON\">As both requests became immaterial on the facts found, it was not error to deny them. <em>Donohue </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>342 Mass. 89, 92 and 93. <em>M.
