The statute above cited provides an exclusive procedure for notice and failure of the plaintiff to comply with its requirements was fatal. The subsequent order of notice was invalid. Since no jurisdiction was acquired over the defendant the motion to dismiss should have been allowed. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Fales, </em>342 Mass. 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">It is ordered that the case be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-13\"> \u201cThe Plaintiff\u2019s affidavit of compliance herewith and the defendant\u2019s return receipt if received by the plaintiff shall be filed in the case on or before the return day of the process or within such further time as the court may allow.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
