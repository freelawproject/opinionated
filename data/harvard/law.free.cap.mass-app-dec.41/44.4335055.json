Roy as \u201cBorrower\u201d and the defendant as \u201ccomaker.\u201d The defendant filed an answer in abatement alleging nonjoinder of a necessary party defendant, Gaston P. Roy. Not waiving the answer in abatement the defendant also filed an answer containing a general denial, denial of the signature and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>demand for proof thereof. After a hearing, the trial judge overruled the answer in abatement and the defendant duly claimed a report. At a subsequent hearing the judge allowed plaintiffs motion for judgment based on an affidavit of no defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">There was no error. The note stated \u201cthe undersigned <em>jointly </em>and severally.....promise to pay to the order of Valley Bank and Trust Company...\u201d At the bottom of the note was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">Signatures (Write in full)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">Addresses: (Give complete address)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">(1) Borrower: Gaston P.

Roy he is in fact the maker and the defendant, as set forth, is co-maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-16\">\u201cUnless the instrument otherwise specifies two or more persons who sign as maker ... and as a part of the same transaction are jointly and severally liable even though the instrument contains such words as \u201cI promise to pay.\u201d G.L. c. 106, $ 3-118 (e). In this case the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>specifically provides that they \u201cjointly and severally promise. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b52-7\">Gerald R.
