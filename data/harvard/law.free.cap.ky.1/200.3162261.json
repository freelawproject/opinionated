Satisfactory proof being made to the court, they are of opinion that the said McConnell has a right to a settlement of 400 acres of land, to include the above location, and the pre-emption of 1,000 acres adjoining, and that a certificate issue accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-5\">And on the 3d day of February, in the same year, entered the certificate for settlement with the county surveyor in the following words, to-wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">\u201cFrancis McConnell enters 400 acres by certificate, etc., lying-on the head of the south fork of Elkhorn, joining the land of William McConnell on the east.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-7\">And having obtained a pre-emption warrant, entered the same on the 29th day of April, in the year 1780, in the following words, to-wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-8\">\u201cFrancis McConnell enters 1,000 acres upon a pre-emption warrant, adjoining his settlement, bounded by his settlement on the south, William McConnell on the

described in the connected plat, departed this life, leaving James McConnell his heir-at-law, who, having also departed this life, left John McConnell, etc., who were the defendants with the appellant in the district court, his heirs-at-law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-10\">It appeared that James McConnell, during his lifetime, had obtained a grant of elder date than that of the appellee, and had sold his interest in that part of the pre-emption which interfered with the appellee\u2019s survey to the appellant, but was not to warrant the title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-11\">This suit was brought by the appellee in the court of appeals, while that court had original jurisdiction in land causes, and removed for trial to the district court when that jurisdiction was taken away, against the heirs of James McConnell and the appellant; and a decree in favor of the \u00e1ppellee for the whole interference was pronounced by that court, from which decree the appellant prayed for and obtained this appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-12\">The

Robert Todd deposed that in the year 1783 he made for Benjamin Netherland the survey under which John Coburn claims. That Francis McConnell was present when it was made, and that it was made before the said McConnell made the survey of his pre-emption. That McConnell expressed some dissatisfaction about it, but that he advised Netherland to abide by the survey, telling him at the same time that McConnell could not come far enough west with his pre-emption to interfere with him. That when McConnell did make the survey of his pre-emption, he made the same in such a manner as to interfere with a claim of his, and upon his threatening to caveat him, the said McConnell promised to give up the interference, provided he would let his patent issue, which he understood was done by McConnell in order to get a patent before Netherland. That he assisted James Greer, about the month of December, 1776, to improve at the sinking spring, near the north-west line of Netherland\u2019s said survey, which then, and at the time he a\u00f1ade the survey, was a sinking spring. That the said Greer left lais wedges there under a log, and that he went, when he removed his family to this country, to the said spring to hnnt for the wedges, but could aaot find them, but found the log under which they had been laid, and the stump from which the log had beeai cut, and then well knew the spring to be the same. That this sinking spring was the only one he knew near Lexington on vacant land, and the only siaaking spa-ing near the town on the north-north-east or east side, and that he believed there was no other. That there was a sinking spring iaa Floyd\u2019s military <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>survey, and another in Patterson\u2019s claim. That the boundaries of the Lexington tract were not, in the year 1780, the same as they are now, but that he could not tell how they differed, but that he laid down the old lines shown to him in the survey made out in the caveat, <em>The Trustees of Lexington </em>v. <em>Bradford. </em>That he was acquainted with Floyd\u2019s military survey of 200 acres. That Col. Patterson showed one of the corners near where the house now stands in 1783, and John Floyd showed him the sinking spring and the north-west line in 1776, and that he then saw several of the marked trees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">Robert Patterson deposed, that he always understood and believed that John Floyd, in the year 1775, made a private survey for John Maxwell, beginning at the south-east corner of Shelby\u2019s military survey, and the north-east corner of Preston\u2019s, and that the line from the corner ran south 70 degrees east to a mulberry and locust, and perhaps another tree, which stood within his present garden fence, and not far either from his present house or stable. That the mulberry and locust were marked to answer as a corner for the said survey. That the other tree, if there was another, was down. That the second line of the said survey was run north 20 degrees east. That himself and many others in the town of Lexington knew, as early as the 2d of June, in the year 1780, that John Floyd claimed a military survey on the north-west of the town tract, which was likely to interfere with the same, and that, in 1781, an agreement took place between John Todd, who had purchased the same of Floyd, and himself, by which the said Todd relinquished his claim to the part that interfered with his settlement. That he knew the sinking spring in Nctherland\u2019s survey in 1780. It sank before it ran to any branch. That he thinks he was first at it in 1776, but since 1779 he has been at it every year, and that he knew of no other answering the description. That he got his information respecting the military survey of Floyd himself. That he made an improvement at the sinking spring included in it, and gave it to David Perry, but that he never saw any marked lino, except the line of Maxwell\u2019s private survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\">That on the 2d of June, 1780, the bounds of Lexington were not as now surveyed. That there had been a survey of 640 acres made, and, as the lines ran, there wTas little or no land on the south side of the branch, and the lines extended further to the east than the present tract.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Breckinridge for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaE\">The appellant claims under the eldest grant; therefore, it is only necessary to inquire whether the claim of the appellee can be supported.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-5\">It can not. Major\u2019s entry must have reference to the Lexington tract as it then stood. That the town had not the boundary that it now has, you will find by the testimony of Patterson and Todd. The entry must have reference to the state of things as they were when the entry was made. Suppose the name had beep changed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-6\">The first call is for the east side, and joining the Lexington tract. As the town is now bounded,'it has not a side nearer east than north-cast; but let Major adjoin the town as surveyed by Pendleton on the loDg line, and he will adjoin on a side which is within twenty degrees of being a north side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-7\">Including a sinking spring. Where is this spring? And what is the proof about it?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-8\">The witnesses describe two other sinking springs : the one in Patterson\u2019s settlement, and the other in Floyd\u2019s military survey, which is the largest and most notorious of the two. This spring is on the west side. By the cases of <em>Pawling </em>v. <em>Merewether, </em>and <em>GonsiUa </em>v. Briscoe, you may reject a repugnant call in an entry. What would you reject here ? Certainly the sinking spring known only to Todd and Patterson, and then you must lay Major on the lino run by Pendleton north 4.5 east; or, if you reject the call on the east side, you may fix him so as to take in Patterson\u2019s sinking spring, and adjoin the military survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-9\">Patterson\u2019s testimony ptrovos two things with respect to Pendleton\u2019s lines:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-10\"><em>First. </em>That he made that survey subsequent to the act of 1779.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-11\"><em>Secondly. </em>That he did run those lines as a boundary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-12\">Let it be admitted that Pendleton had no sufficient authority to mark out a boundary for the town, still ho did it, and it then had the reputation of being the boundary of the town, and that was sufficient as an object of description in an entry. If we show a Lexington tract in 1780, or a thing called a Lexington tract in 1780, it is sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-13\">Todd says he laid down those'lines as the old bounds of the town in the suit of <em>The Trustees </em>v. <em>Bradford,.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-14\">It was contended, in the argument in the inferior court, that, by an agreement amongst themselves, the adjacent vil lagers had fixed the piresent bounds of the town.

Besides, it shall not lay in the mouth of Francis McConnell to say these are not the town bounds, when he has surveyed to them himself. But what testimony is there to show that any other bounds were agreed to by the inhabitants? None. The surveyor has, as directed, laid down the old town bounds as run by Pendleton, and laid down on a plat. <em>The Trustees </em>v. <em>Bradford. </em>What does this prove? That Pendleton ran lines, but not that it was assented to by the town. Neither of the witnesses say so; and Pendleton\u2019s linos could not have been the boundaries, because Patterson says the old bounds extended to the north and north-east farther, and those do not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-10\">Besides, Pendleton\u2019s lines run into Todd, assignee of Floyd, whereas the town quantity of 640 acres does not, and they have seventy acres by purchase. But in opposition to this we have,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-11\"><em>First. </em>The assent of the inhabitants to the other bounds. By the adjacent surveys of the villagers, the other line would have altered the situation of Todd and Patterson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-12\"><em>Secondly. </em>The act of assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>Thirdly. </em>The decision against Bradford.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">Robert Patterson is a villager, calling for about one-half a mile from Lexington to include his improvement, which must have been from the fort. Todd, assignee of May, is on the south-east, and McConnell on the north-west. Beside, the villagers had then no right to bound their town. 640 acres shall not be entered for, say the legislature, until their case can be made known.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">It was then a matter of uncertainty whether that land would be confirmed to them or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">The provision is, that 640 acres to which no other person hath a previous legal claim. The villagers then were bounded by Floyd, and in 1780, when the commissioner\u2019s sat, no doubt' they agreed among themselves to run the town out for quantity to the northeast, where James Greer improved, as General Todd tells you, who abandoned his improvement, and obtained a certificate on Clear creek, the 22d April, 1780, as the only vacant land. But this argument is a strange one in the mouth of a villager, and well might the owner of a treasury warrant thus address him: For your benefit 640 acres has been reserved, beside your settlement and pre-emption. I have been obliged to wait your agreement. If I had entered otherwise, I should have lost my land, and yet you now contend you have a right to go out of your entry to deprive me of my land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-8\">The second call is to include a sinking spring. Patterson and Todd prove this to have been a sinking spring, and that there was no other answering the description. The distance from the old block-house is 530 poles, only 50 poles more than the mile and a half. The last call joining John Floyd\u2019s 200 acre tract, explains the doubt as to the side of Lexington, and shows with more certainty the sinking spring, as it proves it can not be that included in Floyd\u2019s tract. This is an old military survey, proved by Todd and Patterson, and the plat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-9\">But admitting, for a moment, that the complainant\u2019s claim ought to have adjoined Pendleton\u2019s lines, he was also to adjoin Floyd, and to include the sinking spring; and as he was to lie east, he ought certainly to run at 45 degrees from Floyd\u2019s corner at 9.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-10\">By this means he would leave out about 25 acres at the northeast end. I do not admit that one claim calling to adjoin the line of another is to adjoin the whole length of the line. But if it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>true, as a general principle, the call here for the sinking spring would take it out of the general rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">I will examine the appellant\u2019s claim. As it is the pre-emption which interferes, I will consider that. The calls are to be bounded by his settlement on the south, William. McConnell on the west, and John Floyd on the east.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">Certainly the course of Floyd\u2019s north-west line, continued, ought to bo the eastern boundary of the pre-emption. \u2022 Beside, McConnell has in his pre-emption 351 acres, 1 rod and 16 perches of' surplus, much more .than the whole interference, and all the interference is out of his entry.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\">And now, at this term, the following decree was pronounced:</p>\n<author id=\"AKy\">Bv the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag-R\">It seems to the court, that, the call in the 400 acre entry on which the claiurof the appellee is founded, adjoining to the Lexington tract, must be taken to mean to adjoin the survey of the Lexington tract, which had been made before the time he made his entry by William Pendleton, and represented by the connected plat, signed by B. Todd.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">And it also seems to the court, that the identity and notoriety of John Floyd\u2019s tract, and of the sinking spring called for in the said entry, and represented in the surveyor\u2019s report, made by the order of the said district court, are both satisfactorily ascertained, and th^t to give these two calls effect, as well as the calls on the east side of the Lexington tract, the said sinking spring should have been just included in the most northwardly eorper of the survey made on the said entry, and have been run from thence to the most eastwardly corner of the said Floyd\u2019s survey; thence with the south-eastwardly line of the same to the most northwardly line of the said Lexington survey; thence eastwardly with the same, and with a line run at right angles from the beginning of the said first mentioned line so far that \u00e1 line parallel to the same would have included the quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">And whereas the said appellant, and those who were co-defendants with him to the suit in the district court, have shown no other right to the land in contest, but a survey and patent obtained subsequent to the date of the said entry: Therefore, it is decreed and ordered, that the decree aforesaid be reversed, annulled, and set aside; that the cause be remanded to the court from whence it came, who are directed to have a survey of the land claimed by the appellee made agreeably to the foregoing opinion of this court, and that the said district court do decree accordingly.
