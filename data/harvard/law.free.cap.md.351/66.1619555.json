Because the Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners failed to demonstrate that documents in its possession relating to its investigation of Loretta V. Fioretti, a dental hygienist, were investigatory files compiled for a law enforcement purpose and, additionally, failed to demonstrate that her inspection of the documents should have been denied to the extent that such disclosure would prejudice the Dental Board\u2019s investigation, we shall reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of the Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The facts in this case are not in dispute. On April 17, 1997, the Secretary-Treasurer of the Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners (the Board) sent Loretta V. Fioretti, appellant, a letter informing her that the Board, appellee, had reason to believe that on April 16, 1997, appellant \u201cmay have performed dental hygiene procedures without on-site supervision by a licensed dentist, as required by the Maryland Dentistry Act, Md.Code. Ann., Health Occ. (\u201cHO\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 to 4-702 (1994).\u201d The letter went on to advise appellant that she should \u201cimmediately cease and desist the unsupervised practice of dental hygiene.\u201d The letter further stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">\u201csubject to the hearing provisions of \u00a7 4-318 of this subtitle, the Board may ... reprimand any licensed dental hygienist, place any licensed dental hygienist on probation, or suspend or revoke the license of any licensed dental hygienist, if the ... licensee ... (7)[p]erforms intraoral functions not authorized by statute or the rules and regulations of the Board ... [and] (9)[v]iolates any rule or regulation adopted by the Board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The letter then informed appellant that the Board\u2019s Discipline Review Committee would consider the matter at a meeting to be held on April 23, 1997.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board also required appellant to sign, date, and return an \u201cAgreement,\u201d which stated that she agreed to \u201conly practice dental hygiene in the State under the supervision of a licensed dentist who is physically on the premises and available for personal consultation while the services are being performed, and only as provided in the Maryland Dentistry Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Appellant\u2019s counsel wrote a letter dated April 21, 1997, to the Administrator of the Board. This letter sought a copy of the complaint lodged against appellant and other appropriate documents relating to the matter. On April 28, 1997, after receiving no reply to his initial letter, appellant\u2019s counsel made a second request to the Board. The Administrator responded in a letter dated May 7, 1997. This letter acknowledged receipt of counsel\u2019s April 21 letter, but went on to state that appellant\u2019s request was denied as a case under investigation pursuant to the Maryland Public Information Act, Maryland Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.), sections 10-611 to 10-630 of the State Government Article (the PIA).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Appellant filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on May 22, 1997, alleging that under sections 10-611 to 10-630 of the PIA, appellant had an absolute right to inspect the Board\u2019s files. Appellee filed a Motion to Dismiss on July 10, 1997, in which it argued that it properly denied inspection to appellant because the documents comprised \u201can investigatory file\u201d under section 10-618(f)(1)(ii) of the PIA and disclosure of the documents would prejudice the Board\u2019s pending investigation pursuant to section 10-618(f)(2)(vi).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>motion was not supported by affidavit, and we did not find any other form of evidentiary support of the motion in the record. On July 25, 1997, appellant filed a response to appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. Without holding a hearing, the circuit court granted appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss on August 1, 1997. This order was not entered on the docket until August 11, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">On August 19, 1997, appellant filed with the circuit court a Motion for Reconsideration and Request for Hearing. By an order signed on September 12,1997, and subsequently filed on September 17,1997, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion without a hearing. Appellant timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a Writ of Certiorari before that court heard arguments in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Appellant presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">I. Is a complaint filed with the Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners an investigatory file compiled for law enforcement or prosecution purposes within the meaning of the Public Information Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">II. Assuming that the Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners is a law enforcement or prosecutorial agency within the meaning of the Public Information Act, is the Board required to make a particularized showing that its records are exempt from disclosure?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">In accordance with Maryland Rule 2-322(b)(2), a defendant may seek dismissal of a complaint if it fails \u201cto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d The proper standard for reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss is whether the trial court was legally correct. <em>Bobo v. State, </em>346 Md. 706, 709, 697 A.2d 1371, 1373 (1997); <em>Rossaki v. NUS Corp., </em>116 Md.App. 11, 18, 695 A.2d 203, 207 (1997); <em>Hrehorovich v. Harbor Hosp. Center, Inc., </em>93 Md.App. 772, 785, 614 A.2d 1021, 1027 (1992), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>330 Md. 319, 624 A.2d 490 (1993). In reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss, we must determine whether the complaint, on its face, discloses a legally sufficient cause of action. <em>Bramble v. Thompson, </em>264 Md. 518, 520, 287 A.2d 265, 267 (1972). <em>See also Rossaki, </em>116 Md.App. at 18, 695 A.2d at 207; <em>Lubore v. RPM Assocs., Inc., </em>109 Md.App. 312, 322, 674 A.2d 547, 552, <em>cert. denied, </em>343 Md. 565, 683 A.2d 177 (1996); <em>Hrehorovich, </em>93 Md.App. at 785, 614 A.2d at 1021. An appellate court should presume the truth of all well-pleaded facts in the complaint, along with any reasonable inferences derived therefrom. <em>Bobo, </em>346 Md. at 708, 697 A.2d at 1372; <em>Bennett Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc. v. NationsBank, </em>342 Md. 169, 174, 674 A.2d 534, 536 (1996); <em>Morris v. Osmose Wood Preserving, </em>340 Md. 519, 547, 667 A.2d 624, 630 (1995); <em>Faya v. Almaraz, </em>329 Md. 435, 443, 620 A.2d 327, 331 (1993); <em>Flaherty v. Weinberg, </em>303 Md. 116, 136, 492 A.2d 618, 628 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">III. Discussion and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The Maryland PIA provides that \u201c[a]ll persons are entitled to have access to information about the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.\u201d \u00a7 10-612(a). \u201c[U]nless an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of a person in interest would result,\u201d the PIA \u201cshall be construed in favor of permitting inspection of a public record.\u201d \u00a7 10-612(b). A person in interest is defined as \u201ca person ... that is the subject of a public record,\u201d \u00a7 10-611(e)(l). There is no dispute in the instant case that appellant is or was the subject of the alleged investigation and thus is a person in interest, or that the records at issue are a public record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>This Court has noted that \u201cthe provisions of the Public Information Act reflect the legislative intent that citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u201d <em>A.S. Abell Publishing Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 32, 464 A.2d 1068, 1071 (1983). Custodians may deny access to records, however, under certain specific statutory exemptions. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10-615 to 10-619; <em>see also Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County, </em>299 Md. 493, 506-07, 474 A.2d 880, 887(1984) (\u201c[T]he Maryland Public Information Act, like the FOIA,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] mandates disclosure of certain records in the possession of certain agencies unless the requested records are within the scope of a statutory exemption.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">One of the PIA\u2019s exemptions provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a custodian may deny inspection of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">(i) records of investigations conducted by the Attorney General, a State\u2019s Attorney, a city or county attorney, a police department, or a sheriff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">(ii) an investigatory file compiled for any other law enforcement, judicial, correctional, or prosecution purpose; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">(iii) records that contain intelligence information or security procedures of the Attorney General, a State\u2019s Attorney, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>city or county attorney, a police department, a local correctional facility, or a sheriff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">(2) A custodian may deny inspection by a person in interest only to the extent that the inspection would:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">(i) interfere with a valid and proper law enforcement proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">(ii) deprive another person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">(in) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">(iv) disclose the identity of a confidential source;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">(v) disclose an investigative technique or procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">(vi) prejudice an investigation;, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">(vii) endanger the life or physical safety of an individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">\u00a7 10\u2014618(f). Appellee claims its files regarding appellant are exempt from disclosure under section 10-618(f). There is no dispute that the Dental Board is not one of the \u201cenumerated agencies\u201d listed in section 10-618(f)(l)(i).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, in addressing appellant\u2019s questions, we first must resolve whether the Board demonstrated to the circuit court that the files in appellee\u2019s possession relating to appellant\u2019s alleged misconduct were \u201cinvestigatory file[s] compiled for any other law enforcement, judicial, correctional, or prosecution purpose.\u201d \u00a7 10-618(f)(1)(ii). If so, we then must address whether the Dental Board demonstrated that the disclosure of its records would prejudice its investigation of appellant. \u00a7 10-618(f)(2)(vi).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>A. Is a complaint filed with the Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners an investigatory file compiled for law enforcement or prosecution purposes within the meaning of the Public Information Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">This Court has not had occasion to examine specifically the exemption provided in section 10\u2014618(f)(l)(ii) and the extent to which disclosure may be denied under that exemption pursuant to section 10-618(f)(2). The federal courts and the United States Supreme Court, however, have analyzed extensively similar exemption provisions of the FOIA. Although the FOIA does not contain a provision stating that a custodian may deny disclosure of a record \u201cto the extent that the inspection would ... prejudice an investigation,\u201d \u00a7 10-618(f)(2)(vi),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this Court has stated that the interpretations and reasoning of the federal courts addressing the \u201cinvestigatory files\u201d exemption provided in section 552(b) of the FOIA, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>so-called \u201cExemption 7,\u201d are persuasive. We said in <em>Faulk, </em>299 Md. at 506, 474 A.2d at 887:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">Where the purpose and language of a federal statute are substantially the same as that of a later state statute, interpretations of the federal statute are ordinarily persuasive. <em>See, e.g., East v. Gilchrist, </em>293 Md. 453, 459, 445 A.2d 343, 345 (1982); <em>James v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 330, 418 A.2d 1173, 1181 (1980); <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Mandel etc. Re-election Committee, </em>280 Md. 575, 580, 374 A.2d 1130, 1133 (1977); <em>Montgomery County Board of Education v. Glassman Construction Co., </em>245 Md. 192, 202-04, 225 A.2d 448, 454-55 (1967). The purpose of the Maryland Public Information Act, enacted by Chapter 698 of the Laws of 1970, is virtually identical to that of the FOIA, enacted in 1966 by Pub.L. No. 89-487, 80 Stat. 250. The Maryland Public Information Act, like the FOIA, was broadly conceived. Its purpose was to provide the public the right to inspect the records of the State government or of a political subdivision. <em>A.S. Abell Publishing Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 32, 464 A.2d 1068, 1071 (1983). Its basic policy was in favor of disclosure. [\u00a7 10-612]. Additionally, the language of [\u00a7 10\u2014618(f) ], as amended by Chapter 1006 of the Laws of 1978, the general exemption of investigatory records compiled for law-enforcement purposes, is virtually identical to the language of its federal counterpart, Exemption 7, as amended in 1974 by Pub.L. No. 93-502, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 1561, 1563. Moreover, the historical development of [\u00a7 10-618(f) ] parallels that of its federal counterpart, Exemption 7(A). Under these circumstances, the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Exemption 7(A) is persuasive. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The Supreme Court has stated that judicial review of FOIA Exemption 7 requires a \u201ctwo-part inquiry. First, a requested document must be shown to have been an investigatory record \u2018compiled for law enforcement purposes.\u2019 [Second,] [i]f so, the agency must demonstrate that release of the material would have one of the six results specified in the Act.\u201d <em>Federal Bureau of Investigation v. Abramson, </em>456 U.S. 615, 622, 102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>S.Ct. 2054, 2059-60, 72 L.Ed.2d 376 (1982). <em>See also Pope v. United States, </em>599 F.2d 1383, 1385 (5th Cir.1979) (noting two-step inquiry); <em>Pilar v. SS Hess Petrol, </em>55 F.R.D. 159, 162 (D.Md.1972) (noting application of exemption provisions of FOIA requires two-part inquiry); <em>cf. Pratt v. Webster, </em>673 F.2d 408, 413 (D.C.Cir.1982) (describing the FOIA Exemption 7 language as prescribing a three-part test: the materials at issue (1) must be an \u201cinvestigatory record,\u201d (2) \u201ccompiled for law enforcement purposes,\u201d and (3) must satisfy the requirements of one of the six sub-parts of Exemption 7).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The Maryland Court of Special Appeals likewise has held that under the PIA, judicial review of the \u201cinvestigatory files\u201d exemption requires a two-step inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">[I]t must be expressly shown that the data sought ... is part of investigatory files compiled ... for law enforcement ... purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">... Having determined that the requested information comes within the investigatory files exception, we must now determine whether this information should be accorded immunity from disclosure. Resolution of this question depends on whether disclosure would produce one of the seven harms enumerated in section 3(b)(i).[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-7\"><em>Equitable Trust v. Commission on Human Relations, </em>42 Md.App. 53, 75-77, 399 A.2d 908, 921-23 (1979), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>287 Md. 80, 411 A.2d 86 (1980). Additionally, in keeping with the broad purpose of the FOIA, courts must interpret the exemptions narrowly and in favor of disclosure. <em>John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., </em>493 U.S. 146, 152, 110 S.Ct. 471, 475, 107 L.Ed.2d 462 (1989); <em>Nadler v.

Montgomery County, </em>300 Md. 759, 780, 481 A.2d 221, 231 (1984): \u201cIf any agency has frustrated judicial review ... the trial court may ... exercise its discretion ... simply by ordering disclosure because of the agency\u2019s failure to meet its burden of satisfying the court that an exemption applies.\u201d This burden extends to both steps of the mandated inquiry. The unenumerated government agency must demonstrate both that the records are \u201can investigatory file compiled for any other law enforcement, judicial, correctional, or prosecution purpose,\u201d and that disclosure is not warranted \u201cto the extent that the inspection would\u201d result in one of the enumerated harms. The Supreme Court has noted that courts also \u201cmust be mindful ... that the FOIA was not intended to supplement or displace rules of discovery.\u201d <em>John Doe Agency, </em>493 U.S. at 153, 110 S.Ct. at 475, 107 L.Ed.2d 462. <em>See also Faulk, </em>299 Md. at 509, 474 A.2d at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In considering the threshold determination of whether appellee\u2019s investigatory files were compiled for a law enforcement purpose, we shall examine the scope of the term \u201claw enforcement purpose.\u201d In so doing, we must resolve whether this term contemplates only criminal proceedings. Appellant avers that because the Dental Board is an administrative agency, not a law enforcement or prosecutorial agency, the files it compiled during its investigation of appellant do not fall within the PIA\u2019s exemption and should not be withheld. Appellant\u2019s argument, however, misses the point. The language of section 10-618(f)(l)(ii) does not specify that the investigatory files must have been compiled by a law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>agency. </em>Rather, it exempts files, subject to sub-section (f)(2), compiled by any nonenumerated agency for law enforcement <em>purposes; </em>there is a distinct difference.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">This Court said in <em>Superintendent v. Henschen, </em>279 Md. 468, 475, 369 A.2d 558, 562 (1977), that the legislature intended to differentiate between investigative files compiled by the law enforcement agencies enumerated in section 10-618(f)(i), which essentially are presumed to be of a law enforcement nature, and investigatory files collected by other unenumerated agencies pursuant to section 10-618(f)(ii):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">Section [10\u2014618(f)(1)] is in the disjunctive, excepting records of investigation by the enumerated types of law enforcement agencies <em>or </em>investigatory files compiled for any other law enforcement or prosecution purposes. The statutory provision exempts from the mandatory disclosure requirement two categories of documents: (1) investigatory records of certain named law enforcement agencies; (2) investigatory records of other governmental agencies which were compiled for law enforcement or prosecution purposes. It is only with respect to the second category that there is an express requirement that the records be compiled for law enforcement or prosecution purposes. The statutory language, and particularly the use of the word <em>other </em>before the phrase \u201claw-enforcement or prosecution purposes,\u201d suggests that the Legislature believed that investigatory records of one of the enumerated law enforcement agencies were presumptively for law enforcement or prosecution purposes, but that investigatory records compiled by other agencies might or might not be for such purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Because the records sought in <em>Henschen </em>were compiled by the police department, an enumerated agency, we held that the legislative presumption negated the need for the agency to demonstrate that the files were compiled for a law enforcement purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">In the case at bar, simply because the Dental Board is not a traditional law enforcement agency or an enumerated agency does not take the files it compiles relative to investigations for law enforcement purposes out of the purview of the section 10\u2014618(f)(1)(11) exemption. Rather, the key determination is whether the agency, even if it typically' does not perform law enforcement duties, compiled its investigatory files for a law enforcement <em>purpose.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Just as the agency compiling the investigatory records need not be a traditional \u201claw enforcement agency,\u201d the investigation itself need not be of a \u201ccriminal\u201d nature. The Court of Special Appeals recognized this principle in <em>Equitable Trust, </em>42 Md.App. at 75-76, 399 A.2d at 921:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">Although <em>Henschen, supra </em>was not concerned with and did not answer the question of when records of an agency other than one named in section [10-618(f)(1)(i)] are considered as compiled for \u201claw enforcement or prosecution purposes,\u201d there is a spate of federal cases which hold, as a general proposition, that where files are prepared in connection with related government litigation and adjudicative proceedings currently under way or contemplated, they are compiled for law enforcement purposes within the meaning of 5 U.S.C., section 552(b)(7) of the ... [FOIA,] which closely parallels [sections 10\u2014618(f)(1)(ii) and (f)(2)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">An examination of the many federal cases reveals that FOIA\u2019s Exemption 7 is not limited to criminal investigations. In a recent case, <em>Mittleman v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>76 F.3d 1240 (D.C.Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 975, 136 L.Ed.2d 858 (1997), Elaine Mittleman requested documents collected in a background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regarding her application for government employment. OPM released cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tain documents after redacting portions identifying the sources of certain information, claiming its right to withhold such information under section 552(b)(7)(D) of the FOIA. Mittleman filed a claim pursuant to the FOIA to enjoin OPM from withholding the documents. The federal district court granted OPM\u2019s motion for summary judgment, determining that OPM properly withheld the information under Exemption 7(D). On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Mittleman challenged only the district court\u2019s determination that her background check was compiled for law enforcement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Noting that the primary purpose of OPM\u2019s background investigations is to make certain that a prospective employee has not broken the law or otherwise engaged in conduct rendering her ineligible for government employment, the court held that the information gathered by OPM in its investigation was compiled for \u201claw enforcement purposes.\u201d The court stated: \u201c[T]he term \u2018law enforcement purpose\u2019 is not limited to criminal investigations but can also include civil investigations and proceedings in its scope. <em>See Pratt v. Webster, </em>673 F.2d 408, 420 n. 32 (D.C.Cir.1982). Thus, \u2018 \u201c[e]nforcement\u201d of the law fairly includes not merely the detection and punishment of violations of law but their prevention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mittleman, </em>76 F.3d at 1243 (quoting <em>Miller v. United States, </em>630 F.Supp. 347, 349 (E.D.N.Y.1986)). Other courts have held likewise. <em>See Pope, </em>599 F.2d at 1386 (holding that Exemption 7 of the FOIA \u201capplies to civil, and regulatory proceedings as well as to criminal matters\u201d); <em>Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. v. I.T.O. Corp., </em>508 F.2d 945, 949 (4th Cir.1974) (\u201cThe legislative history indicates that this exemption is meant to apply to all law enforcement proceedings, not just to violations of the criminal statutes.\u201d); <em>Wellman Indus. v. N.L.R.B., </em>490 F.2d 427, 430 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 834, 95 S.Ct. 61, 42 L.Ed.2d 61 (1974) (determining that the legislative history of Exemption 7 supports the interpretation that the exemption is not limited to criminal investigations). <em>See also Yarbrough v. Department of Corrections, </em>199 Mich.App. 180, 185, 501 N.W.2d 207, 210 (1993) (\u201cThe law enforcement exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>contained in [Michigan\u2019s Freedom of Information Act] is not limited in application to police investigations of criminal matters.\u201d). In light of the close parallels between the FOIA and the PIA, we are persuaded that \u201claw enforcement purposes\u201d is not limited to criminal investigations and applies to civil and regulatory proceedings as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">This determination, however, is not without limits. The fact that an unenumerated government agency, which seeks to withhold documents under this exemption, typically conducts as one of its main functions some form of law enforcement is not dispositive of whether the flies were compiled for a law enforcement purpose. <em>Pratt, </em>673 F.2d at 418. This is because many agencies, if not most, perform functions not related to law enforcement as part of their day-to-day business. <em>Id. </em>Even traditional law enforcement agencies conduct administrative or other types of business totally unrelated to enforcing laws. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, although it has been held that FOIA\u2019s \u201cexemption 7 protection does not end \u2018when there is no longer any prospect for future enforcement proceedings ...,\u2019\u201d <em>Rural Housing Alliance v. United States Dep\u2019t of Agriculture, </em>498 F.2d 73, 80 (D.C.Cir.1974), \u201cthe bare assertion that the files are for law enforcement purposes is not sufficient to preclude disclosure when no enforcement proceedings are contemplated.\u201d <em>Moore-McCormack, </em>508 F.2d at 949. Therefore, simply because an agency asserts that its files were compiled for law enforcement purposes is insufficient under the language of the exemption. The agency must, in each particular PIA action, demonstrate that it legitimately was in the process of or initiating a specific relevant investigative proceeding in order to come under the aegis of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In the case at hand, appellee filed a Motion to Dismiss and supporting memorandum arguing it was permitted under the PIA exemptions to deny inspection of the Dental Board files to appellant. The crux of appellee\u2019s argument in that memoranda stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>First, the \u201ccomplaint and other relevant documents\u201d requested, comprise the Board\u2019s investigatory file on Plaintiff, compiled for the purpose of enforcing the Maryland Dentistry Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), Md.Code Ann., Health Occ. (\u201cHO\u201d) \u00a7 4-101 <em>et seq. </em>If the investigation reveals Plaintiff violated a provision of the Act, the Board may refer the matter for administrative prosecution against Plaintiffs license. The requested documents therefore comprise \u201can investigatory file compiled for any other law enforcement, judicial, correctional, or prosecution purpose.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-618(f)(1)(ii).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\">Second, disclosure of the requested documents to plaintiff at this time would jeopardize and hinder an ongoing investigation. Disclosure may, for example, reveal the identity of potential witnesses in the case before Board representatives have an opportunity to interview the witnesses or other individuals who have relevant information. It is important to note that as the investigation is ongoing, no charges have been issued against Plaintiff and no disciplinary action has been proposed against Plaintiffs license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In its brief before this Court, appellee asserts the circuit court had a sufficient basis for determining that the Board\u2019s files were compiled for a law enforcement or prosecution purpose. We disagree. As we stated <em>supra, </em>the government agency bears this burden. Here, appellee\u2019s motion was not supported by any affidavits, a summary of the so-called investigatory files, or other relevant evidence. The only information appellee put forward relative to the first step of the PIA exemption inquiry was its bald assertion that because the Board may refer the matter for some form of administrative prosecution, the files it had compiled were of a law enforcement nature. Appellee did not explain to the trial court, for instance, the nature of its \u201cinvestigation,\u201d what typically occurred upon the conclusion of such investigations, or the possible penalties appellant could face.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">It is quite possible that the Board presented no specific evidence in this matter because no substantial investigation took place. Only one day after appellant\u2019s alleged misconduct occurred, the Board issued its letter informing appellant of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>complaint filed against her and ordering her to \u201ccease and desist\u201d from such conduct. Further, the Board attempted to have her to sign an \u201cagreement\u201d or consent order that she would cease engaging in the activity for which she was ordered to cease and desist in the first place.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Agencies usually do not issue cease and desist orders until after an investigation is held that results in a finding that the conduct did occur and is likely to occur again.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Moreover, the Board never held its April 28, 1997, meeting to address appellant\u2019s alleged conduct and did not, as far as the record discloses, initiate contact with anyone who may have had information relating to the alleged incident other than the letter it sent to appellant. We also note that it was revealed at oral argument that the Board essentially ceased whatever investigation it had begun, apparently because of the present PIA litigation. No activity or \u201cinvestigation,\u201d therefore, was conducted with regard to the complaint against appellant in the intervening four months between the date the complaint was taken to the date the circuit court granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. Likewise, no investigative activity occurred between the order dismissing appellant\u2019s claim under the PIA and the present appeal, some fourteen months later. By all reasonable appearances, it would seem that no tenable investigation of appellant\u2019s alleged misconduct is now taking place or ever took place.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>In any event, appellee did not put any evidence before the court on a motion for summary judgment or otherwise. Therefore, the trial judge must have based his order only upon the face of the documents submitted. We conclude that the trial court erred in this regard because these documents did not satisfy the government\u2019s threshold burden of demonstrating that the records at issue fell within the section 10-618(f)(l)(ii) exemption. The motion and memoranda provided nothing but a bare conclusion by appellee that the documents were investigatory files compiled for a law enforcement purpose. Without more supporting information or an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the investigatory files, we fail to discern how the Board could have met its burden of establishing the nature of the information sought or how the trial court properly could have exercised discretion in the making of such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">We are mindful that pursuant to section 10\u2014623(c)(2), an <em>in camera </em>hearing is purely discretionary. <em>Cranford, </em>300 Md. at 779, 481 A.2d at 231 (\u201c[T]he ultimate standard under the [PIA] for determining whether an <em>in camera </em>inspection is to be made is whether the trial judge believes that it is needed in order to make a responsible determination on claims of exemptions.\u201d). In <em>Cranford, </em>however, the trial judge denied an <em>in camera </em>hearing where the government had presented its reasons for nondisclosure of the documents in writing and then further explained those reasons with oral testimony. We suggested in <em>Cranford </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">[i]f a detailed description cannot be given in affidavits without revealing the very information sought to be protected, there is strong reason for conducting an <em>in camera </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>inspection. If an agency has frustrated judicial review by presenting testimony or affidavits in conclusory form, the trial court may, depending upon all of the circumstances, appropriately exercise its discretion by ordering more detailed affidavits or by conducting an <em>in camera </em>inspection or simply by ordering disclosure because of the agency\u2019s failure to meet its burden of satisfying the court that\" an exemption applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 780, 481 A.2d at 231. In the present case, appellee presented neither affidavits nor testimony or any other evidence for that matter. We hold, therefore, that in the first instance, appellee failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the records at issue were investigatory files compiled for a law enforcement purpose so that the exemption at issue would apply. Accordingly, we shall reverse the order granting appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">B. Assuming that the Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners is a law enforcement or prosecutorial agency within the meaning of the Public Information Act, is the Board required to make a particularized showing that its records are exempt from disclosure?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We shall also address the second portion of the two-part test, which requires that, in addition to establishing that its records relate to law enforcement purposes, the government agency must demonstrate to the circuit court that specific records are exempt from disclosure. More precisely, section 10\u2014623(b)(2)(i) provides that in an action under the PIA, the government agency \u201chas the burden of sustaining a decision to deny inspection of a public record.\u201d We cannot conceive of language any more direct requiring that the defending government agency, here the Dental Board, make some showing to sustain its assertion that otherwise public documents should be withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Moreover, section 10\u2014618(f)(i) provides that the custodian of the record may only deny inspection of the documents <em>subject to </em>subsection (2). Subsection (2) provides that \u201c[a] custodian may deny inspection by a person in interest <em>only to the extent </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>that the inspection would\u201d result in one of seven enumerated harms. \u00a7 10\u2014618(f)(2) (emphasis added). Our reading of this language, particularly in conjunction with section 10-623(b)(2)(i), leads us to conclude that not only is the Dental Board required to show that the documents it seeks to withhold are investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes, but that disclosure of the records would have prejudiced its investigation. What is more, even if the Dental Board demonstrated to the circuit court that such prejudice would have occurred, the statute makes clear that this does not create an across-the-board immunity from disclosure. Rather, the circuit court can deny inspection <em>only to the extent </em>that disclosure would result in prejudice to the particular investigation. That is, if the Dental Board only could show that disclosure of the name of the person filing the complaint would have prejudiced its investigation, then the files should have been disclosed to appellant with the complainant\u2019s name, or any other information identifying the complainant, redacted. We reiterate that it was appellee\u2019s burden to prove the harm and the extent to which disclosure to appellant would have resulted in the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Various cases support the interpretation that \u201cthe agency must demonstrate that release of the material would have one of the ... results specified in the Act.\u201d <em>Abramson, </em>456 U.S. at 622, 102 S.Ct. at 2060, 72 L.Ed.2d 376; <em>John Doe Agency, </em>493 U.S. at 152, 110 S.Ct. at 475,107 L.Ed.2d 462; <em>Pratt, </em>673 F.2d at 413; <em>Pope, </em>599 F.2d at 1385; <em>Pilar, </em>55 F.R.D. at 162; <em>Equitable Trust, </em>42 Md.App. at 75-77, 399 A.2d at 921-22. Moreover, the Supreme Court, in interpreting the FOIA, has stated that an agency must so demonstrate with specificity. <em>N.L.R.B. v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 235, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 2323, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978). \u201cThus, where an agency fails to \u2018demonstrate] that the ... documents [sought] relate to any ongoing investigation or ... would jeopardize any future law enforcement proceedings,\u2019 Exemption 7[] would not provide protection to the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(some brackets in original Xquoting Administration of the Freedom of Information Act, H.R.Rep. No. 92-1419 (1972), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>reprinted in </em>House Committee on Government Operations and Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Freedom of Information Act and Amendments of 1974 (Pub.L.93-502) Source Book, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 15 (Joint Comm. Print 1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Appellee argues that under our decision in <em>Faulk, </em>it is not required to \u201ccome forward with evidence to support its exemption claim.\u201d Rather, appellee contends, a circuit court can make a determination that disclosure of the documents would necessarily prejudice the Board\u2019s investigation in the absence of any direct evidence to that effect. In <em>Faulk, </em>investigatory police reports regarding criminal offenses allegedly committed by Faulk were presented to a grand jury. The grand jury indicted him of two separate burglaries. Faulk then sought to obtain, by a discovery request pursuant to criminal proceedings pending against him, production of the investigatory records. The trial court denied Faulk\u2019s request for disclosure of the investigatory police reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Affirming the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, we held that the custodian of the investigatory police reports properly withheld disclosure. In so holding, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">[UJnder Art. 76A, \u00a7 3(b)(i)(A) the State is not required to make a particularized showing that the disclosure of investigatory police reports compiled for law-enforcement purposes to a defendant in a pending criminal proceeding would interfere with that pending criminal proceeding. Rather, a generic determination of interference can be made whenever a defendant in a pending criminal proceeding seeks access to investigatory police reports relating to that pending criminal proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\"><em>Faulk, </em>299 Md. at 511, 474 A.2d at 889.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">In <em>Faulk, </em>the records sought were files that were part of an investigation by the police department into criminality, and the police department was an enumerated agency pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>the statutory predecessor to present section 10\u2014618(f)(1)(i). Under those circumstances, we followed our holding in <em>Henschen, </em>279 Md. at 475, 369 A.2d at 562, that \u201cwhen the documents in question constitute records of an investigation by a police department (or sheriffs office or any of the other law enforcement agencies specifically listed in \u00a7 [10-618(f)(1)(i)]), there need not be an actual showing that the records were compiled for law enforcement or prosecution purposes for the exception to be applicable.\u201d <em>See also Faulk, </em>299 Md. at 507, 474 A.2d at 889-90. Under both cases, we based our determination that an enumerated agency was not required to make a particularized showing that its investigatory files were compiled for law enforcement purposes primarily upon the notion that \u201cthe Legislature believed that investigatory records of one of the enumerated law enforcement agencies were presumptively for law enforcement or prosecution purposes, but that investigatory records compiled by other agencies might or might not be for such purposes.\u201d <em>Henschen, </em>279 Md. at 475, 369 A.2d at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">We went on in <em>Faulk </em>to explain that the Legislature had given no indication that it required the enumerated agencies to make a document-by-document determination that disclosure of the otherwise public documents would create an interference with the particular case. Accordingly, we concluded that when the enumerated law enforcement agencies are involved, a trial court could make, even in the absence of direct evidence, determinations that \u201cdisclosure of the requested materials necessarily \u2018would interfere\u2019 with law-enforcement proceedings.\u201d <em>Faulk, </em>299 Md. at 508, 474 A.2d at 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Appellee\u2019s reliance on <em>Faulk </em>is misplaced as that case can be distinguished from the case <em>sub judice </em>in two ways. First, the Dental Board is not an enumerated law enforcement agency, such as a police department, so there is no presumption that its investigatory files are compiled for law enforcement-related purposes. Second, in <em>Faulk, </em>the agency relied upon a completely different enumerated harm: that the disclosure would \u201cinterfere with valid and proper law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>proceedings.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 10\u2014618(f)(2)(i). The harm claimed by appellee in the present case is that disclosure of the records would \u201cprejudice an investigation.\u201d \u00a7 10\u2014618(f)(2)(vi). Therefore, the Dental Board cannot claim that disclosure of its files would \u201cnecessarily interfere\u201d with its enforcement proceedings when it only has claimed that disclosure, under the circumstances present, would prejudice its investigation. Accordingly, any application of <em>Faulk </em>by appellee\u2019s reasoning cannot be extended to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Appellee similarly relies on <em>Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber, </em>437 U.S. 214, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 57 L.Ed.2d 159, the case underlying our opinion in <em>Faulk, </em>for several propositions including the notion that \u201cCongress did not intend to prevent the federal courts from determining that, with respect to particular kinds of enforcement proceedings, disclosure of particular kinds of investigatory records while a case is pending would generally \u2018interfere with enforcement proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236, 98 S.Ct. at 2324, 57 L.Ed.2d 159. We believe <em>Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber </em>is distinguishable from this case for the same reasons we stated above in our discussion of <em>Faulk.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Finally, appellee relies upon <em>Faulk </em>for the proposition that the PIA \u201cwas not intended to be a device to enlarge the scope of discovery beyond that provided by the Maryland Rules.\u201d <em>Faulk, </em>299 Md. at 510, 474 A.2d at 889. We do not believe that disclosure under the circumstances of this case would do so. In <em>Faulk, </em>discovery of the police reports at issue was not mandated under the Maryland Rules. In the case at hand, however, appellee admitted at oral argument that had the investigation resulted in a formal complaint, appellant may have had access to the files pursuant to discovery. Additionally, if the Dental Board ceased the investigation and dropped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the accusations, appellant would have access to the files at issue under the PIA because there then would be no investigation to be prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Here, because appellant asked to see the files, the Dental Board ceased its investigation, apparently because of the instant litigation, and has left the matter in a state of limbo for the past fourteen months. Had appellee continued its investigation, as indeed it should have, the investigation likely would have been concluded. Under those circumstances, appellant probably would have had access to the documents by now. The legislature clearly did not intend for public agencies to avoid disclosure under the PIA by failing to conclude investigations. Therefore, under the circumstances present, we fail to see how disclosure of the documents at issue in this case would enlarge the scope of the discovery rules such as to warrant the withholding of these documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Because appellee failed to demonstrate, or even attempt to demonstrate, that appellant\u2019s inspection of the documents would prejudice its investigation and to what extent disclosure would prejudice its investigation, the trial court abused its discretion in granting appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. Accordingly, for this and because appellee failed to show that the records at issue were investigatory files compiled for a law enforcement purpose, we reverse the order granting the Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Concurring opinion by RAKER, J., in which RODOWSKY and WILNER, JJ., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Concurring opinion by WILNER, J., in which RODOWSKY and RAKER, JJ., join.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-6\">.

I agree that the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>State Board of Dental Examiners failed to meet its burden in proving that the documents in its possession were investigatory files compiled for a law enforcement purpose. I join in the concurring opinion of Judge Wilner. In as much as the majority gratuitously addresses issues that need not be addressed in this case, I write separately because I disagree with the <em>dicta </em>in Section III. B. of the majority opinion as to the manner in which the State may satisfy its burden in sustaining its denial of a request to inspect records.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The majority correctly concludes that once the Board shows that the files were compiled for law enforcement purposes, the burden is on the Board to show that disclosure of the records would have prejudiced the investigation. Maj. op. at 87. Yet in interpreting Maryland Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-618(0(2) and 10-623(b)(2)(i) of the State Government Article,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the majority concludes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">[T]he circuit court can deny inspection <em>only to the extent </em>that disclosure would result in prejudice to the particular investigation. That is, if the Dental Board only could show that disclosure of the name of the person filing the complaint would have prejudiced its investigation, then the files should have been disclosed to appellant with the complainant\u2019s name, or any other information identifying the complainant, redacted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Maj. op. at 87. If the majority is suggesting that the circuit court must make a document-by-document, case-specific determination in every case that the examination of a particular record would prejudice an investigation, and that no generic determination of prejudice can ever be made, I believe the majority is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The Board relies on <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford Co., </em>299 Md. 493, 474 A.2d 880 (1984), to support its argument that it may make a generic<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> determination that disclosure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>documents would necessarily prejudice an investigation. In <em>Faulk, </em>the records sought were police investigatory files related to a criminal investigation, and the police department was an enumerated agency under the statutory predecessor to present \u00a7 10-618(f)(1)(i). We held that a trial court could make a <em>generic </em>determination that disclosure of the requested materials necessarily would interfere with law enforcement proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 508, 474 A.2d at 888. We concluded that \u201cthe General Assembly did not intend to preclude generic determinations of interference when the circumstances were such that disclosure necessarily \u2018would interfere\u2019 with law-enforcement proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508, 474 A.2d at 888. This Court permitted the generic determination that disclosure to a defendant of investigatory police reports in a pending criminal proceeding would interfere with law enforcement proceedings because it would substantially alter criminal discovery rules and likely would delay the adjudication of the criminal proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 510, 474 A.2d at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Faulk relied on <em>N.L.R.B. v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978), a case interpreting the federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1976) (hereinafter \u201cFOIA\u201d). The question in <em>Robbins Tire </em>was whether, under Exemption 7(A) of FOIA, the N.L.R.B. was required to present particularized evidence showing that the examination of witness statements would interfere with the pending labor proceedings. \u201cThe Supreme Court concluded that, when an unfair labor practice proceeding was pending, a particularized factual showing was not required and that a generic determination of interference was appropriate.\u201d <em>Faulk, </em>299 Md. at 499, 474 A.2d at 883. The Supreme Court held that \u201c[wjhile the Court of Appeals was correct that the amendment of Exemption 7 was designed to eliminate \u2018blanket exemptions\u2019 for Government records simply because they were found in investigatory files compiled for law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>enforcement purposes, we think it erred in concluding that no generic determinations of likely interference can ever be made.\u201d <em>Robbins Tire, </em>437 U.S. at 236, 98 S.Ct. at 2323-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The majority distinguishes <em>Faulk </em>on two grounds: first, that the Dental Board is not an enumerated law enforcement agency in the statute and, second, that in <em>Faulk, </em>\u201cthe agency relied upon a completely different enumerated harm: that the disclosure would \u2018interfere with valid and proper law enforcement proceedings.\u2019 \u201d Maj. op. at 89-90. The majority summarily distinguishes <em>Robbins Tire </em>\u201cfor the same reasons we stated above in our discussion of <em>Faulk.\u201d </em>Maj. op. at 90. The majority does not elaborate on the significance of these distinctions, perhaps because there is none.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis because I find no basis to conclude that the General Assembly intended to require a case-by-case determination of \u201cprejudice\u201d with regard to either named or unnamed agencies that compile investigatory records. <em>Cf. Faulk, </em>299 Md. at 508, 474 A.2d at 888 (\u201cThere is nothing in the language or the legislative history of \u00a7 3(b)(i)(A) to indicate that the General Assembly intended to require a case-by-case showing that disclosure would reveal the State\u2019s case prematurely, result in delay or otherwise create a demonstrable interference with the particular case, and that generic determinations of interference could never be made.\u201d). I find the reasoning of <em>Faulk </em>and <em>Robbins Tire </em>to be applicable to enumerated and unenumerated agencies alike. The only distinction between those agencies that are enumerated in \u00a7 10-618(f)(1)(i), and those agencies not enumerated in \u00a7 10-618(f)(1)(ii), is that the investigatory records of the named agencies are <em>presumptively </em>compiled for law enforcement purposes. <em>See Superintendent v. Henschen, </em>279 Md. 468, 475, 369 A.2d 558, 562 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Once, however, an unenumerated agency has made a successful showing that the requested records were compiled for law enforcement purposes, there is no rational basis to distinguish between named and unnamed agencies. Nor does the statute reflect any intention on the part of the General Assem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>bly to treat the agencies differently. Subparagraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) of \u00a7 10-618(0(1) are all equally subject to the limitations of \u00a7 10-618(0(2). \u201cAlthough [the Legislature] could easily have required in so many words that the Government in each case show a particularized risk to its individual \u2018enforcement proceedings,\u2019 it did not do so.... \u201d <em>Robbins Tire, </em>437 U.S. at 234, 98 S.Ct. at 2323. Indeed, as footnote 15 of <em>Robbins Tire </em>recognized, Congress failed to enact proposals which would have required the government to show a particularized risk to an enforcement proceeding in each case. <em>Id. </em>at 234 n. 15, 98 S.Ct. at 2323 n. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Similarly, there is no evidence that the General Assembly intended to permit a generic determination that disclosure of certain documents would \u201cinterfere\u201d with a valid and proper law enforcement proceeding under \u00a7 10\u2014618(f)(2)(i), and yet simultaneously preclude a generic determination under \u00a7 10-618(f)(2)(vi) and instead require a particularized case-by-case showing that disclosure would \u201cprejudice\u201d an investigation. <em>See Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 660-61, 705 A.2d 1128, 1134 (1998) (recognizing the special emphasis placed upon construing simultaneously enacted statutory provisions in a consistent and harmonious fashion). In <em>Robbins Tire, </em>the Supreme Court noted that Exemption 7(A), the provision permitting a federal agency to refuse disclosure of investigatory records only to the extent that they would \u201cinterfere with enforcement proceedings,\u201d was distinct from the other exemptions for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">There is a readily apparent difference between subdivision (A) and subdivisions (B), (C), and (D). The latter subdivisions refer to particular cases\u2014\u201ca person,\u201d \u201can unwarranted invasion,\u201d \u201ca confidential source\u201d\u2014and thus seem to require a showing that the factors made relevant by the statute are present in each distinct situation. By contrast, since subdivision (A) speaks in the plural voice about \u201cenforcement proceedings,\u201d it appears to contemplate that certain generic determinations might be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\"><em>Robbins Tire, </em>437 U.S. at 223-24, 98 S.Ct. at 2318. The same rationale applies to the Maryland Public Information Act. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>find no \u201capparent difference\u201d between interfering with a law enforcement proceeding under subparagraph (i) and prejudicing an investigation under subparagraph (vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">I agree with the majority that the Board had the burden of proving that all of the documents requested were investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes. This protects against an agency commingling its file material to avoid disclosure of additional documents. <em>See Robbins Tire, </em>437 U.S. at 229-30, 98 S.Ct. at 2321. If the Board satisfies that burden, however, the Board should be permitted to rely upon a generic determination of prejudice, and need not make a case-specific factual showing that disclosure of each document would actually prejudice an investigation. Courts may make a generalized determination that, with respect to particular kinds of enforcement proceedings, disclosure of particular kinds of investigatory records while a case is pending would generally \u2018prejudice an investigation.\u2019 <em>See Robbins Tire, </em>437 U.S. at 236, 98 S.Ct. at 2324; <em>see also Wright v. Occupational Safety and Health Admin., </em>822 F.2d 642, 646 (7th Cir.1987); <em>Barney v.

My concern with the Court\u2019s Opinion is two-fold. First, the Court holds that, because the Board failed to demonstrate that appellant\u2019s inspection of the documents would prejudice an investigation then being conducted by the Board, the Circuit Court abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint. I do not believe that, when the agency fails to establish that non-disclosure is permissible under \u00a7 10-618 of the State Government Article, there is any discretion involved. If the agency fails to sustain its burden of establishing a permissive non-disclosure, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>court must order disclosure. Second, to reach its ultimate conclusion, the Court gratuitously addresses a number of issues that need not be addressed in this case and that can best be left for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">This is really a simple case. The Board apparently received a complaint that, on April 16, 1997, Ms. Fioretti, a dental hygienist, had performed dental hygiene procedures in the office of Randall Ramin Yazhary, D.D.S., without on-site supervision by a licensed dentist. If true, that conduct <em>may </em>have been in violation of the Maryland Dentistry Act (title 4 of the Health Occupations Article).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 17\u2014the day after the alleged misconduct\u2014the Board sent Ms. Fioretti a letter informing her that it had received information, and therefore had reason to believe, that she had violated the law and ordering her, immediately, to cease any unsupervised practice. After reminding her that the unsupervised practice of dental hygiene could result in the suspension, or revocation of her license, the Board, based solely on the undisclosed information that it had received, \u201crequire[d]\u201d her to sign, date, and return a written agreement that she would henceforth practice only under the supervision of a licensed dentist.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Through counsel, Ms. Fioretti promptly requested a copy of any complaint that was filed \u201cand all other appropriate documents.\u201d That letter, sent April 21, 1997, was apparently ignored by the Board, so a second request was mailed on April 28, seeking \u201cthe courtesy of a reply.\u201d On May 7, the Board responded that \u201c[t]he case is currently under investigation\u201d and that the request was denied. The Board cited, as the basis for its non-disclosure, State Government Article, \u00a7 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>618(f)(1)(i) and (ii) and \u00a7 10-618(2)(vi). Section 10-618(f)(1)(i) allows a custodian to deny the inspection of records of investigations conducted by the Attorney General, a State\u2019s Attorney, a city or county attorney, a police department, or a sheriff. Why the Board cited that provision is unclear, as it is not any of those agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Section 10-618(f)(1)(ii) provides that, <em>subject to \u00a7 10-618(f)(2), </em>a custodian may deny inspection of \u201can investigatory file compiled for any other law enforcement, judicial, correctional, or prosecution purpose ...\u201d The Board urged that the documents sought by Ms. Fioretti constituted part (or all) of an investigatory file compiled for a law enforcement or prosecution purpose, and the Court spends considerable effort addressing that question. That effort is quite unnecessary, however, for, even if the documents in question, whatever they are, fall within the ambit of that provision, to deny inspection, the Board must also satisfy \u00a7 10-618(f)(2). Section 10-618(f)(2)(vi)\u2014the only part of \u00a7 10-618(f)(2) cited by the Board\u2014permits a custodian to deny inspection by a person in interest \u201conly to the extent that the inspection would ... (vi) prejudice an investigation.\u201d Ms. Fioretti is certainly a person in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">As the Court points out, when a proper request is made for the inspection of public records, the State agency seeking to deny disclosure has the burden of establishing a legally justifiable reason for the non-disclosure. Section 10-613 provides that, \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by law, a custodian shall permit a person ... to inspect any public record at any reasonable time,\u201d and \u00a7 10-623(b)(2)(i) expressly requires that, in any judicial proceeding to enforce compliance with the law, the agency \u201chas the burden of sustaining a decision to deny inspection of a public record.\u201d In <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford Co., </em>299 Md. 493, 507, 474 A.2d 880, 887 (1984), we held that, in such a judicial proceeding, \u201cthe burden is on the public official denying the right to inspect to show that the requested records are within the scope of a statutory exemption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The simple answer to this case is that the Board has made no such showing. We need not get into the thicket of what would or might have sufficed, for no evidentiary foundation whatever was produced to warrant non-disclosure. The Board\u2019s written motion to dismiss Ms. Fioretti\u2019s complaint asserted only that \u201c[a]t this time, disclosure of records to the Plaintiff would prejudice the Board\u2019s pending investigation. If the Board determines, based on its investigation, that formal disciplinary action is appropriate in this case and issues charges, Plaintiff would, at that time, be entitled to inspection of the Board\u2019s investigatory file as permitted by law.\u201d In an accompanying memorandum, the Board repeated its view that \u201cdisclosure of the requested documents to plaintiff at this time would jeopardize and hinder an ongoing investigation\u201d and that disclosure \u201cmay, for example, reveal the identity of potential witnesses in the case before Board representatives have an opportunity to interview the \"witnesses or other individuals who have relevant information.\u201d The Board asserted further, in its memorandum, that \u201c[i]t is important to note that as the investigation is ongoing, no charges have been issued against Plaintiff and no disciplinary action has been proposed against Plaintiffs license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Up to that point, the \u201ccase\u201d against Ms. Fioretti consisted solely of information that the Board received that, on one day\u2014April 16, 1997\u2014Ms. Fioretti had practiced dental hygiene in Dr. Yazhary\u2019s office without the on-site supervision of a licensed dentist. That information was in the Board\u2019s hands by April 17 and was sufficient, in the Board\u2019s view, for it to order Ms. Fioretti to cease and desist any such activity and to sign a written statement agreeing to conduct herself in accordance with the law. There has never been any suggestion that Ms. Fioretti violated any other provision of the law or that her alleged practice without on-site supervision occurred at any time other than April 16 or at any place other than Dr. Yazhary\u2019s office. The motion and accompanying memorandum were filed on or about July 10,1997\u2014some three months after the Board made its first and last communication to Ms. Fioretti regarding the matter. No hearing was ever held on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the motion (or on the complaint itself). On August 1, 1997, the court simply granted the motion and dismissed the complaint without assigning any reason. It summarily denied a motion to reconsider on September 12, 1997, also without the benefit of a hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Other than the bald, unsupported statements contained in the Board\u2019s motion and memorandum, there is nothing\u2014absolutely nothing\u2014in this record to indicate what, if any, kind of investigation was ongoing, what kinds of records the Board had that might be relevant to any ongoing investigation, or how any documents or categories of documents might prejudice an investigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">An agency cannot satisfy its statutory burden of \u201csustaining a decision to deny inspection of a public record\u201d by simply asserting that all of the records sought would prejudice an investigation, for, if it could do that, the Public Information Act would be meaningless. That is where this case begins and where it should end. If an agency\u2019s decision to deny inspection of a public record is challenged in court, the agency must produce persuasive evidence of some kind to establish that the requested documents are legally shielded\u2014that they fall within one of the statutory exceptions to the general requirement of disclosure. The nature and quantum of that evidence, and whether it should be subjected to <em>in camera </em>inspection by the court, may well depend on the circumstances, but we need not address the specifics of that in this case, as no evidence, of any kind, was produced by the Board. I would hold that, even if the documents sought qualify as an investigatory file compiled for a law enforcement or prosecution purpose, within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>meaning of \u00a7 10-618(f)(1)(ii), the Board failed, as a matter of law, to sustain its burden of showing that disclosure of the documents would prejudice an investigation under \u00a7 10-618(f)(2)(vi). Given that failure, I would direct that the Circuit Court order the requested disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Judges RODOWSKY and RAKER have authorized me to state that they concur with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\">. Section 4-308 of the Health Occupations Article provides that a general license to practice dental hygiene authorizes the licensee to practice that occupation only under the supervision of a licensed dentist who is on the premises and available for consultation, and only in certain settings including a dental office. Section 4-308(d) allows the Board to waive the supervision requirement, however, under certain circumstances. There is nothing in this record to indicate whether, if Ms. Fioretti indeed performed dental hygiene services without on-site supervision by a licensed dentist, any of the circumstances allowing for a waiver might have existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-5\">. As neither the Board nor Ms. Fioretti requested a hearing on either the motion to dismiss or the motion to reconsider, the court was not obliged to hold a hearing on either motion. The problem, thus, is not specifically the lack of a hearing but the failure of the Board to establish a factual foundation for its assertion that disclosure would prejudice an on-going investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b154-6\">. The Board continued to raise the prospect of prejudice to an ongoing investigation at oral argument in this Court, on June 9, 1998\u201414 months after it sent its one and only letter to Ms. Fioretti. It gave us no more basis for that prospect than it gave the Circuit Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
