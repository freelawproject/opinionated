Concluding that it could, the Circuit Court for Kent County enhanced the petitioner\u2019s sentence pursuant to both statutes, and the Court of Special Appeals agreed. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">The petitioner, Ade Yemi Scott, was convicted by a jury of, <em>inter alia, </em>possession of 79.8 grams of crack cocaine with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>intent to distribute. The State, having timely filed the requisite notices, in accordance with Maryland Rule 4-245,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> proved the qualifying convictions, and asked the court to sentence the petitioner pursuant to both \u00a7 293 and \u00a7 286(f)(3). The court sentenced the petitioner for the possession with intent to distribute count, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">\u201cIn... Madame Clerk, let it be the judgment of this Court, in 4698, Count 1, and that is possession of cocaine in sufficient quantity to indicate an intent to distribute, specifically 50 grams or more, in violation of Article 27 Section 286(a)(1) and (f), it is the judgment of this Court, as a penalty for that offense, the Defendant is committed to the Division of Corrections for a period of 28 years, and that is effective March 19, 1996. He is to be given credit for time he has already served pre-trial and pre-sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In summarizing all of the sentences imposed on the petitioner, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">\u201cThat\u2019s an effective sentence of 28, 28 and 1, of 57 years as I calculate it. And this sentence is imposed ... the sentence in Count 1 of 4698 is imposed under Article 27 Section 286(f), which means a minimum mandatory 5 years. All other provisions are imposed under Article 27 Section 293.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Both the docket entry for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and the Commitment Record signed by the court refer to \u00a7 286(f) as the section pursuant to which that sentence was imposed. The petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In that court, one of the petitioner\u2019s contentions was that the sentence the trial court imposed for the possession with intent to distribute count was illegal. Pointing to the trial court\u2019s sentencing remarks as well as the docket entries and the Commitment Record, he argued, as he does here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">\u201c[T]he trial court specifically and unequivocally sentenced [him] under count one, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in the amount of fifty grams or more, pursuant to \u00a7 286(f) and under all other eligible provisions pursuant to \u00a7 293. As the maximum sentence under \u00a7 286(f) is twenty years imprisonment, and the court imposed a twenty-eight-year sentence, eight years of the sentence imposed on count one is illegal\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in an unreported opinion. Rejecting the petitioner\u2019s argument, the court held that the trial court sentenced the petitioner pursuant to both \u00a7 293 and \u00a7 286(f), and, that its doing so was proper. Aware of our holding in <em>Gardner v. State, </em>344 Md. 642, 645, 689 A.2d 610, 611 (1997), that a sentence on a single count of an indictment or information may not be enhanced pursuant to both \u00a7 286(c) and \u00a7 293, the intermediate appellate court distinguished the case on the basis that \u201c[s]ection 286(e), unlike section 286(f), is a subsequent offender provision.\u201d Thus, the Court of Special Appeals interpreted <em>Gardner </em>as prohibiting only \u201cenhancing the sentence on a single count twice under two subsequent offender provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">The petitioner filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we granted. <em>Scott v. State, </em>348 Md. 334, 703 A.2d 1265 (1998). For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The petitioner makes two arguments in this Court. First, as he did in the Court of Special Appeals, he maintains that the trial court enhanced his sentence for possession with intent to distribute pursuant to \u00a7 286(f) only, that the language used by the court clearly and unambiguously demonstrates this, and, thus, eight years of the twenty-eight-year sentence imposed is illegal. The petitioner argues that the Court of Special Appeals ignored the clear language of the trial court, and instead viewed the prosecutor\u2019s request that both \u00a7 286(f) and \u00a7 293 be applied <em>in </em>sentencing as dispositive proof that the trial judge did utilize both provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The petitioner argues alternatively that the sentence is illegal under our decision in <em>Gardner. </em>He reasons that a substantial basis for the <em>Gardner </em>decision was the fact that the \u201cdrug kingpin\u201d section, \u00a7 286(g), explicitly referenced, and thus contemplated, enhancement of a sentence imposed thereunder pursuant to \u00a7 293, while \u00a7 286(c) did not. Therefore, as \u00a7 286(f), like the other subsections of \u00a7 286, does not contain that reference, he continues, it is clear in this case, as in <em>Gardner, </em>that the Legislature did not intend that a sentence enhanced pursuant to one of those subsections also be enhanced pursuant to \u00a7 293. Contrary to the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals, therefore, the petitioner submits that the primary basis for the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Gardner </em>was not that both subsections in that case were subsequent offender statutes, but rather that one of them lacked specific reference to \u00a7 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">In response to the petitioner\u2019s arguments, the State contends, as the intermediate appellate court found, that the enhancement of the petitioner\u2019s sentence pursuant to both \u00a7 286(f) and \u00a7 293 was appropriate. First, the State rejects the argument that the trial judge did not apply both sentencing provisions. On the contrary, it asserts that it is clear the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>trial court did so, when, in addition to referencing \u00a7 286(f) specifically, it indicated in the course of the sentencing proceeding, precisely how it enhanced the sentence, by imposing a 28 year sentence, rather than one of 20 years, the maximum allowed for a violation of \u00a7 286(a)(1). <em>See </em>\u00a7 286(b)(1). Section 293, the State points out, provides that the maximum penalty for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute is doubled when the offense is a second or subsequent one. Thus, in the instant case, instead of a maximum of 20 years, the petitioner faced a maximum of 40 years as a result of his prior convictions. The State also notes that the Maryland Sentencing Guidelines range, computed on the basis of the sentence being enhanced pursuant to \u00a7 293, was from 14 to 28 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The State further maintains' that the petitioner\u2019s sentence was properly enhanced pursuant to both sentencing provisions. Unlike the petitioner, it believes that <em>Gardner </em>is distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Gardner, </em>the State insists, both \u00a7 286(c) and \u00a7 293 were triggered by the petitioner\u2019s prior convictions. By contrast, citing <em>Wadlow v. State, </em>335 Md. 122, 132, 642 A.2d 213, 218 (1994), the State continues, \u00a7 286(f) requires that the prosecutor specifically charge and prove, as an additional element of the crime, that the defendant distributed or possessed the quantity of illegal drugs specified in the statute. Thus, the State contends, because \u00a7 293(a) applies at sentencing and is triggered by prior convictions, it is not in conflict with \u00a7 286(f); the statutes simply operate in different ways. Moreover, the State rejects the petitioner\u2019s argument that, in the absence of a reference in \u00a7 286(f) to \u00a7 293, as in the case of \u00a7 286(g), that section may not be applied in combination with \u00a7 293 to enhance a single count of an indictment or information. It maintains that \u201cwithout the specific reference to Section 293 in Section 286(g), the 40-year maximum provided in Section 286(g) might have been construed to obviate Section 293.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The issue before the court is one of statutory construction: we must determine whether the Legislature intended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>sentences enhanced pursuant to \u00a7 286(f) also be enhanced pursuant to \u00a7 293.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5Although we have not had occasion to address this precise issue, we have quite recently addressed a similar one in <em>Gardner, supra. </em>In that case, the Court framed the issue as \u201cwhether a sentence on a single count of an indictment or information may be enhanced pursuant to both ... Article 27, \u00a7 286(c)[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] and \u00a7 293.\u201d 344 Md. at 644, 689 A.2d at 611. The Court held that it could not, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQu\">\u201cBecause both statutes are being applied to a single count, they must be construed together and in context.\u201d <em>Whack, </em>338 Md. at 673, 659 A.2d at 1350 (citing <em>State v. Thompson, </em>332 Md. 1, 7, 629 A.2d 731, 734 (1993))(\u201cwhen we are called upon to interpret two statutes that involve the same subject matter, have a common purpose, and form part of the same system, we read them in pari materia and construe them harmoniously.\u201d); <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 436, 639 A.2d 675, 679 (1994); <em>Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471, 474 (1988); <em>State v. Loscomb, </em>291 Md. 424, 432, 435 A.2d 764, 768 (1981). \u201cFull effect is given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>to each statute to the extent possible, and we will not add or delete words to obtain a meaning not otherwise evident from the statutory language.\u201d <em>Accord, Geico [GEICO] v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 132, 630 A.2d 713, 717 (1993). Moreover, \u00a7 286(c) is but a subsection of \u00a7 286, section (g) of which also addresses sentence enhancements. Because it is imperative that statutory language be interpreted in its full context, it follows that \u00a7 286(e) must \u201cbe read in conjunction with the other subsections of \u00a7 286 so that we may give effect to the whole statute and harmonize all of its provisions.\u201d <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 436, 639 A.2d 675, 678-79 (1994) (citing <em>Williams v. State, </em>329 Md. 1, 15-16, 616 A.2d 1275, 1282 (1992) for the proposition that a court must discern \u201clegislative intent from the entire statutory scheme, as opposed to scrutinizing parts of a statute in isolation.\u201d (emphasis added)). Consequently, \u00a7\u00a7 286(c) and 293(a) must be construed together with \u00a7 286(g).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201cWhen that is done, it is clear that their application in the single count context is not at all clear. This is especially the case when \u00a7 286(g) is considered. Subsection (g)(2)(i) prescribes both the maximum sentence for a drug kingpin committing the acts proscribed\u201440 years imprisonment without parole\u2014and a mandatory minimum sentence\u201420 years imprisonment without parole\u2014to be imposed and not suspended. Subsection (g)(5) expressly authorizes the enhancement of that sentence pursuant to \u00a7 293(a). If the state were correct that the enhancement statutes are clear both in their language and application, inclusion of that provision would have been unnecessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">\u201cNor does enlightenment flow from their legislative histories. As the petitioner points out, there is absolutely nothing, in the history of these statutes that even suggests that the Legislature intended a stacking of enhanced penalties. Section 293(a) was enacted in 1970 and has existed, without change, since that tipie. <em>See </em>Laws of Maryland 1970, ch. 403. The two-time loser provision of \u00a7 286(c) was enacted 12 years later, <em>see </em>Laws of Maryland 1982, ch. 770, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>except for relettering, <em>see </em>Laws of Maryland 1988, ch. 439, has not been changed. As we have seen, only \u00a7 286(g) provides any basis for discerning the intent of the General Assembly on the issue here presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\">\u201cIt is apparent that \u00a7\u00a7 286(c) and 293(a) are highly penal statutes, and, as we have seen, their application to enhance a sentence on a single count is ambiguous. An ambiguous penal statute is subject to the \u201crule of lenity,\u201d which requires that such statutes be strictly construed against the State and in favor of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">\n<em>* * *</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">\u201cFinally, when the Legislature has both wanted to increase the maximum penalty and to impose a mandatory minimum sentence for a second or subsequent offense, it has done so unequivocally, in clear and unambiguous terms____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 649-52, 689 A.2d at 613-15 (some citations and statutory references omitted). This reasoning is equally applicable to the issue sub judice.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The language of \u00a7 286(f), like that of \u00a7 293, <em>Gardner, </em>344 Md. at 648, 689 A.2d at 613, viewed in isolation, is quite clear. And, as in <em>Gardner, </em>both statutes enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence in different ways. Section 286(f), like \u00a7 286(c), prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence, which may not be suspended, but the former applies to a defendant convicted of possessing more than fifty grams of crack cocaine, rather than to one who is a subsequent offender. On the other hand, \u201c[sjection 293 enhances the permissible maximum sentence by permitting the imposition of twice the otherwise allowable sentence for those who are subsequent offenders.\u201d <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 683, 659 A.2d 1347, 1355. When \u00a7 286(f) is read in conjunction with the other subsections of \u00a7 286, including subsection (g), and with \u00a7 293(a), to which subsection (g) explicitly refers, it is clear that its application, and that of \u00a7 293(a), to the same count, as in the case of \u00a7\u00a7 286(c) and 293(a), <em>see Gardner, </em>344 Md. at 649-50, 689 A.2d at 613-14, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>ambiguous and not at all clear. Moreover, the legislative history of \u00a7 286(f), rather than clearing up the ambiguity, actually confirms it.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Subsection (f) was added to \u00a7 286, along with subsection (g), in 1989, when the Legislature enacted \u201cThe Drug Kingpin Act.\u201d <em>See </em>1989 Md. Laws, ch. 287. Although enacted simultaneously, only in \u00a7 286(g) did the legislature specifically authorize the enhancement of the prescribed sentence pursuant to \u00a7 293(a). As we pointed out in <em>Gardner, </em>inclusion of such a provision in \u00a7 286(g)(5) would not have been necessary if \u201cthe enhancement statutes [were] clear both in their language and application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650, 689 A.2d at 614. It follows, therefore, that \u00a7 286(f) is more, not less, ambiguous in this context than was \u00a7 286(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The Court of Special Appeals interpreted the <em>Gardner </em>decision as prohibiting the enhancement of a sentence on a single count twice under two subsequent offender statutes or provisions, arguing, by way of contrast, that \u201c[t]he court here enhanced [the petitioner\u2019s] sentence as a subsequent offender only after the State proved that [the petitioner] possessed more than fifty grams of [crack] cocaine with the intent to distribute it.\u201d The State agrees, but stresses that the proof was required to be, and was, presented at trial. We are not persuaded. As the petitioner points out, the primary basis for this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Gardner </em>was not that \u00a7 286(c) was a subsequent offender statute, but rather the absence of a specific reference in that provision to \u00a7 293. Indeed, although, in this case, we address a different subsection of \u00a7 286, the question to be answered is the same, namely whether the Legislature intended that sentences already enhanced pursuant to a subsection other than subsection (g), be further enhanced by \u00a7 293. The answer in this case, as in <em>Gardner, </em>is simply not clear; considering, the applicable statutes in context leaves a doubt as to whether both were intended to be applied to a single count of an indictment or information simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Section 286(f), like \u00a7 286(c), is a highly penal statute, whose application in conjunction with \u00a7 293(a), another <em>highly </em>penal statute, <em>see Gardner, </em>344 Md. at 651, 689 A.2d at 614, is ambiguous. Consequently, the \u201crule of lenity\u201d applies. Applying the rule of lenity and being cognizant of the <em>Gardner </em>reasoning, it follows that only an enhanced sentence pursuant to \u00a7 286(g)(5) may be further enhanced pursuant to \u00a7 293(a). Accordingly, the same disposition is required in this case as was reached in <em>Gardner, </em>vacation of the judgment and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

Second or subsequent offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">(a) <em>More severe </em>sentence.\u2014Any person convicted of any offense under this subheading is, if the offense is a second or subsequent offense, punishable by a term of imprisonment twice that otherwise authorized____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The \u201cHealth\u2014Controlled Dangerous Substances\u201d subheading encompasses \u00a7\u00a7 276-313, inclusive. Thus, the scope of \u00a7 293 unambiguously extends to \u00a7 286(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Subsection 286(f)(1) provides that if a person commits certain offenses involving specified quantities of controlled dangerous substances, that person will be subject to the penalties provided in subsection 286(f)(3)(i). Subsection 286(f)(3)(i) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">A person convicted of violating paragraph (1) of this subsection is guilty of a felony and shall be sentenced as otherwise provided for in this section, except that it is mandatory upon the court to impose no less than 5 years\u2019 imprisonment, and neither that term of imprisonment nor any part of it may be suspended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Nothing in the plain language of \u00a7 286(f) indicates that \u00a7 293 is inapplicable to a sentence imposed under that subsection. Simply stated, because \u00a7 286(f) is codified under the same subheading as \u00a7 293, the General Assembly has clearly demonstrated that the latter statutory provision may enhance a criminal sentence imposed under \u00a7 286(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">Scott correctly observes that \u00a7 286(f) is an integral component of \u00a7 286, and that all statutory components of \u00a7 286 must be construed in harmony with one another. <em>See Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 436, 639 A.2d 675, 678-79 (1994). Scott also accurately notes that \u00a7 293 is an enhancement provision based on prior criminal history, and that \u00a7 286 already contains three enhancement provisions based on prior criminal history: \u00a7 286(c), the \u201ctwo-time loser\u201d enhancement provision, \u00a7 286(d), the \u201cthree-time loser\u201d enhancement provision, and \u00a7 286(e), the \u201cfour-time loser\u201d enhancement provision. Hence, Scott argues, the framework of \u00a7 286 manifests the legislative intent that a sentence imposed under \u00a7 286 may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>enhanced <em>only </em>by subsection (c), (d), or (e), if such an enhancement is based upon prior criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Scott\u2019s contention does not withstand scrutiny when examined in light of the evolution of \u00a7 286. When \u00a7 286 originally was enacted in 1970, that section contained only two subsections, \u00a7 286(a) and \u00a7 286(b). As this Court observed in <em>Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 654, 705 A.2d 1128, 1131 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aln\">Subsection (a) of \u00a7 286 codifies the offense of possession of a controlled dangerous substance with the intent to distribute that substance, and \u00a7 286(b) provides the garden variety penalty for violating \u00a7 286(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">These two subsections and \u00a7 293 were enacted during the same legislative session. 1970 Maryland Laws ch. 403, at 896-97, 900. Consequently, when \u00a7 293 took effect on July 1, 1970, it unambiguously applied to a sentence imposed under \u00a7 286(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Current subsection (c) of \u00a7 286, the first sentencing enhancement provision of \u00a7 286 based upon prior criminal history, was not enacted until 1982. 1982 Maryland Laws ch. 470, at 3046-18.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Scott argues that \u00a7 293 may not enhance a sentence imposed under either \u00a7 286(a) or \u00a7 286(f); rather, any enhancement based on prior criminal history may be made only under subsection (c), (d), or (e) of \u00a7 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Under Scott\u2019s interpretation, from 1970 until 1982, \u00a7 293 could validly enhance a sentence imposed under \u00a7 286(a). Under that same interpretation, after 1982, \u00a7 293 could no longer be used to enhance a sentence imposed under \u00a7 286(a). Such a result was not expressly contemplated by the plain language of the amendments to \u00a7 286 in 1982, and there is no indication in the legislative history of those amendments which demonstrates any intent to preclude the application of \u00a7 293 to a sentence imposed under \u00a7 286(a). It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that repeal by implication is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>not favored. <em>State v. Harris, </em>327 Md. 32, 39, 607 A.2d 552, 555 (1992). The majority\u2019s reasoning in this ease flatly contradicts this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Scott argues that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gardner v. State, </em>344 Md. 642, 689 A.2d 610 (1997), controls the outcome in this case. Rather than reach a fair, logical result in light of the <em>Gardner </em>holding, the majority\u2019s opinion in this case contorts <em>Gardner </em>and reaches an unsound result. In <em>Gardner, </em>the Court held that \u00a7 286(c) and \u00a7 293 could not be imposed simultaneously to enhance a single criminal count. <em>Id. </em>at 644-45, 689 A.2d at 611. The majority in <em>Gardner </em>relied in part on the fact that another subsection of \u00a7 286, subsection (g)(5), contained specific language authorizing the application of \u00a7 293 to the offense contained in that subsection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">Subsection [286](g)(5) expressly authorizes the enhancement of that sentence pursuant to \u00a7 293(a). If the [S]tate were correct that the enhancement statutes are clear both in their language and application, inclusion of that provision would have been unnecessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 650, 689 A.2d at 614. According to <em>Gardner, </em>the express reference to \u00a7 293 in \u00a7 286(g) led to the inference that by not referring to \u00a7 293 in \u00a7 286(c), the General Assembly did not intend the doubling provisions of \u00a7 293 to apply to \u00a7 286(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">If the reasoning in <em>Gardner </em>were extended to its logical end, the result would be contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent. As noted, the majority in <em>Gardner </em>reasoned that the favorable reference in \u00a7 286(g) to \u00a7 293 necessarily implied that the Legislature did not intend for \u00a7 293 to enhance a sentence simultaneously with \u00a7 286(c). If extended logically, it would follow from this premise that the reference in \u00a7 286(g) to \u00a7 293 necessarily excluded \u00a7 293 from simultaneously enhancing <em>any </em>sentence imposed under any other subsection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>\u00a7 286. Indeed, Scott makes that argument before this Court. It is significant to note, however, that nothing in the plain language or legislative history of \u00a7 286 or \u00a7 293 reflects the intent to exclude all of \u00a7 286, save subsection (g), from the enhancing provisions of \u00a7 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Moreover, logic dictates that the preclusive effect of indiscriminately applying the canon <em>expressio unius est exelusio alterius </em>would extend beyond merely \u00a7 286. By its express terms, \u00a7 293 applies to the entire controlled dangerous substances subheading. The fair extension of the argument Scott makes in this case is that by including a reference to \u00a7 293 in \u00a7 286(g), the drug kingpin subsection, the General Assembly intended to exclude \u00a7 293 from simultaneously enhancing any other statutory provision in <em>the entire controlled dangerous substance subheading. </em>For instance, in this case, Scott\u2019s conviction for importing cocaine into the State of Maryland in violation of \u00a7 286A(a)(2) could not be enhanced by \u00a7 293. Such an interpretation effectively engrafts \u00a7 293 as a separate paragraph under \u00a7 286(g), without any indication of such an intent expressed in the plain language, legislative history, or other surrounding circumstances of either provision. To avoid this unwarranted result, this Court should interpret <em>Gardner </em>to stand for the following proposition: <em>When based upon the same underlying factual predicate (i. e., </em>prior criminal history), to infer an intent that multiple sentencing enhancement provisions in the same statutory scheme will be applied simultaneously to a single count, the statutory language must expressly reflect that intent. Such a principle is consistent with the holding of <em>Gardner </em>and makes sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">In this case, \u00a7 286(f) enhances a sentence based upon the quantity and type of controlled substance involved, while \u00a7 293 enhances a sentence based upon prior criminal history. The underlying factual predicate for these enhancement provisions is distinct. <em>See Wadlow v. State, </em>335 Md. 122, 128-29, 642 A.2d 213, 216 (1994) (\u201cIn Maryland, ... we have generally drawn a distinction between sentence enhancement provisions that depend upon prior conduct of the offender and those that depend upon the circumstances of the offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number><em>Gardner </em>was based on the premise that the General Assembly <em>might </em>have implicitly intended for only one sentencing enhancement provision to apply when multiple enhancement provisions were based upon the same underlying factual predicate, and accordingly, the rule of lenity applied. <em>Gardner, </em>344 Md. at 651-53, 689 A.2d at 614-15. Whereas here, multiple enhancement provisions are based upon different factual predicates, no such danger reasonably exists, absent legislative intent to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the trial court did not err in sentencing Scott to twenty-eight years under \u00a7 286(f) and \u00a7 293. In distinguishing <em>Gardner </em>from the instant case, that court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">Section 286(c), unlike section 286(f), is a subsequent offender provision. In <em>Gardner, </em>the trial court enhanced defendant\u2019s sentence twice: once by the subsequent offender provision of section 286(c), and once by the subsequent offender provision of section 293. In the instant case, however, in order to invoke the mandatory minimum term under section 286(f), the State had to specifically charge and prove that the crime involved a certain quantity of the drugs as set forth in section 286(f). Once the State had proven the amount as an element of the crime, the court could apply the sentencing provisions requiring the five year mandatory minimum. Section 286(c), in contrast, is purely a subsequent offender provision invoked after trial during the sentencing phase, as is section 293. What the Court of Appeals found illegal in <em>Gardner, </em>namely enhancing the sentence on a single count twice under two subsequent offender provisions, did not occur in the instant case. The court here enhanced appellant\u2019s sentence as a subsequent offender only after the State proved that appellant possessed more than fifty grams of cocaine with the intent to distribute it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">(Internal citation omitted).
