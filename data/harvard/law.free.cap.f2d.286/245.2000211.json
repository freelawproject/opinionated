See Showell v. Commissioner, 238 F.2d 148, Showell v. Commissioner, 254 F.2d 461. The Commissioner\u2019s determinations showed a deficiency of $3,946.65 for Jack Showell and of $4,065.69 for Dorothy Showell. The decision of the Tax Court, each time, fixed the deficiencies due from these two petitioners at $3,286.65 and $3,392.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Upon our first review we expressed dissatisfaction with the Tax Court\u2019s findings, particularly as respects a written Exhibit 3 which the Tax Court had apparently credited in part, and stated: \u201cWe have such dissatisfaction with [the findings] that we have determined to send the ease back to the Tax Court to make new findings.\u201d We also held that petitioners\u2019 claim that they should have been allowed to prove their income by \u201cnet worth\u201d proof, was not supported by sufficient foundation or offers of proof. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">Upon the second review, which was of the Tax Court\u2019s decision following our first remand, we disposed of the case as follows: \u201cWe remand the case to be reopened by the Tax Court to receive further evidence. Particularly the authenticity of Exhibit 3 should be a subject of inquiry. It should set aside its findings and decision.\u201d Thereafter the petition for redetermination came on for hearing in the Tax Court pursuant to our remand. Counsel for petitioners was asked if he proposed any additional evidence. He replied in the negative. The respondent Commissioner then produced an expert witness who testified that the entries on Exhibit 3 were not made on the-dates shown for the transactions there indicated, but that a portion of the numerous entries were all written at one time and the remaining portion all at another time; \u2014 in short, that Exhibit 3' was not a document kept in the normal course of bookkeeping business; that it was not a contemporaneous business record. Petitioners cross-examined this-witness but produced no further evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">The Tax Court found that \u201cThe petitioner did not keep regular, adequate and permanent books and records of his wagering transactions.\u201d It determined the-deficiencies to be the same as previously decided. -</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">When we remanded the case \u201cto receive-further evidence\u201d we did not limit or define the scope of such evidence. When no-new evidence was offered by petitioners, and the court in effect rejected the Exhibit 3 as without probative value, there was no evidence upon which the Tax Court could redetermine anything. Under the Tax Court\u2019s Rule 32, adopted pursuant to \u00a7 7453 of Title 26, the burden of proof before the court was on the petitioner. Hence, upon final submission the court had nothing before it which it was willing to credit. The result is that the record last before the Tax Court simply fails to furnish anything to support the petition for redetermination. Since the burden of proof was not met, the decision must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-15\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
