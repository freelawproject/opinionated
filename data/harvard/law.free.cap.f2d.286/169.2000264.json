The plaintiff is administrator of the estate of an eight and one-half year old boy who was instantly killed when run over by the defendant\u2019s automobile. Defendant\u2019s negligence is not now in issue; his appeal is based upon the size of the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">There was evidence before the jury that the boy was both bright and steady. There was evidence of a good and increasing income earned by his father, plus a future opportunity for the boy in a family business.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">The amount awarded is liberal. The trial judge, on whom rests the primary responsibility in such a case, stated that \u201cthe verdict was supported by the evidence and was within the limits in which the jury might properly exercise its fact-finding function.\u201d [185 F.Supp. 75].</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\"> Our authority in such a case is a very limited one. We find no abuse of discretion by the trial judge. The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
