Petitioner Filmore did not waive removal hearing and a hearing upon his removal was had before a United States Commissioner, who made a report to the respondent district judge recommending that a warrant of removal of petitioner to the U. S. District Court, Miami, Florida, be issued (Rule 40(b) (3), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A.).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-22\">From the papers before us, it appears that the District Judge has not yet issued a warrant of removal upon the report of the Commissioner. It further appears that the district judge, upon motion of petitioner, set a hearing for determination, \u201cas to whether the Commissioner\u2019s report shows sufficient ground for issuing a warrant of removal\u201d. As far as the papers before us disclose, such hearing has not been had or concluded and no final order has been entered by the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-23\">Title 28, U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1651(a) authorizes this court to issue such a writ as is here sought where \u201cnecessary or ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>propriate in aid\u201d of its jurisdiction. The extraordinary writs of prohibition and mandamus will be issued by this court only in extreme and unusual cases. Roche v.
