The allegation complains that the district judge unduly restricted the applicant in his interrogatories in a pending litigation and that he acted contrary to what one of his fellow judges had ordered on the same point. We think that this is not a proper case for mandamus. TCF Film Corp. v. Gourley, 3 Cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 711. This Court has said many times that mandamus is not to be taken as a substitute for appeal. E. g., Green v. Murphy, 3 Cir., 1958, 259 F.2d 591. The district judge was acting in a ease which was before him and the action he took was within his authority. If he was wrong the error can be corrected on appeal. The petition will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
