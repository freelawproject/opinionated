The contract here involved is not a collective bargaining agreement between an employer and a labor organization representing its employees. We think that the trial court was correct in reaching the conclusion that collective bargaining contracts between a union and an employer are the only contracts intended to be actionable in a United States District Court under the provisions of section 301(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-26\">In our judgment, United States District Judge Kloeb was right in concluding that he was without jurisdiction in this case. He, therefore, properly dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-27\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the opinion of the District Judge, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-28\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
