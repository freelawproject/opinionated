For all the record reveals, the appellant was left completely uninformed until the judgment of dismissal, filed more than a month later, which stated that the complaint failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. It was at this point, after appellants had made their election, that we know they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>apprised of the fact that this rule was the basis for dismissal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Rule 8(a) (2) requires that a pleading contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Rule 8(e) (1) requires that \u201ceach averment * * * shall be simple, concise, and direct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">It was conceded by the appellee in oral argument, and it appears to us, that at least one claim was stated in the complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, he argues that the dismissal was rendered because the claims as stated were neither short nor plain; and that the averments were not simple, concise, and direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Even if this were the ground for dismissal a conclusion by appellants that it was based on other grounds would have been reasonable. Here the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim was the only common ground used to attack all five causes of action, and the court dismissed all five. The motions to strike and for more definite statements were ordered removed from the calendar. This tends to engender the idea that the district court was not dissatisfied with the form of the complaint, but rather with its substance. Where 12(b) (6), 12 (e), and 12(f) motions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure oppose a complaint and the trial court grants either 12(e), 12(f), or both, the pleader is of course made aware that his error rests in how he stated his claim and not in the fact that he failed to state a claim at all.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But where as here, a motion ostensibly attacking the complaint for failure to state a claim under 12(b) (6) is granted and motions made under provisions of 12 (e) and (f) are removed from the calendar, if the court\u2019s reason for dismissal is the complaint\u2019s lack of brevity and clarity, then the court should inform the pleader of that reason, orally or in its order. The record before us does not show that the appellant was so informed. Without some sufficient statement by the court, a pleader could reasonably conclude that the dismissal was erroneously grounded upon a failure to state a claim, and consequently choose to stand on his complaint rather than amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">The complaint in question is not artfully drawn. Many of the allegations are vague and ambiguous, and other portions of the complaint might well have been deleted in accordance with the motions to strike and make more certain. However, the appellants should have been informed of the reason for dismissal so that an intelligent choice as to amending could have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">The judgment of dismissal is set aside, and the cause remanded to the district court with directions to enter an order fairly apprising the appellants of the ground or grounds for dismissal, and allowing appellants time to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">Appellants have also taken an appeal from the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-17\">\u201cIt Is Ordered that Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Produce is denied at this time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>without prejudice with leave to renew motion at a later date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">This is not a final order and therefore is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The case is remanded to the district court with directions to proceed in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\">. It may be that during the oral argument the court advised appellant why it was dismissing the complaint. But the transcript of the hearing on the motions is not before us and it cannot be assumed that the appellants were made aware of the reason for the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\">. Nor was there a failure to join an indispensable party. In order to be indispensable or necessary, the absent party must have an interest in the controversy. State of Washington v. United States, 9 Cir., 1936, 87 F.2d 421, 427. The corporations which appellee contends should have been joined have no interest in this case. The relief sought is damages for the alleged fraud perpetrated by the appellee on the individual appellants. Tire wrongs complained of are personal to the appellants, and the relief can be granted or denied without any effect on the corporations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b563-19\">.
