Butte, Anaconda &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen, D.C.Mont.1958, 168 F.Supp. 911. Jurisdiction, then and presently, exists because the action arises under the laws of the United States; viz. the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 151-163, and the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional limit in force when the action was originally filed. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. This court has jurisdiction on appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">In late 1957 appellee sought to induce appellants to agree to certain changes in the terms of their employment contracts. Appellee desired that switching crews, which were then composed of five men, be reduced to thre\u00e9 men. When appellants refused to accede to appellee\u2019s demand, appellee, acting under section six of the Railway Labor Act, served upon appellants notices for changes in their contracts (45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 156). The services of the National Mediation Board were- requested. A few months later, however, appellee attempted to withdraw the section six notices, and to terminate the services of the mediation board. Appellee announced that the switching operations, previously conducted by its employees, would, after a forthcoming change in switching yards, be conducted by employees of its parent corporation, the Anaconda Company. Anaconda Company employees are represented by the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">Responding to appellee\u2019s actions, appellant Brotherhoods issued a strike notice, effective March 14,1958. On March 13, appellee obtained from a Montana state court a temporary injunction against the strike; because of the presence of a federal question, however, the case was transferred to United States District Court. The district court concluded that appellee had violated the \u201cstatus quo provisions\u201d of the Railway Labor Act, which preclude alterations in working conditions after intervention by the National Mediation Board. Thus since appellee was acting in violation of the law, it was not entitled to the remedies provided by a court of equity. Accordingly, the trial court dissolved the injunction. This determination was upheld on appeal in a decision rendered by this court on May 18, 1959. 268 F.2d 54, certiorari denied 361 U.S. 864, 80 S.Ct. 124, 4 L.Ed.2d 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">Before oral argument in the appeal just mentioned, the International Union of Mine, Mill &amp; Smelter Workers, and its local, Butte Miners\u2019 Union No. 1, obtained a temporary restraining order from a Montana state court. This restraining order, which is still in effect, prohibits Anaconda Company from giving loading and switching work, now accomplished by members of the Miners\u2019 Union, to members of appellant brotherhoods. Accordingly, a strike by appellants would be futile; appellee cannot restore the status quo so long as its parent is bound by the restraining order in question. To rectify this situation appellants filed a supplemental answer and counterclaim in the federal district court for the District of Montana. The relief sought by appellants is twofold; first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>they request an injunction preventing the Miners\u2019 Union from progressing with their suit in state court or attempting to secure compliance with the temporary restraining order; secondly, they ask for an order requiring appellee to restore the status quo. The district court, however, denied appellants leave to file their supplementary answer and counterclaim. Hence, appellants have taken this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Appellants contend that the original decree beside dissolving the injunction previously obtained by appellee, also determined that appellee had violated the status quo provisions of the Railway Labor Act. Appellee can be forced to restore the status quo, however, only if it is relieved from the restraining order obtained by the Miners\u2019 Union. Thus, appellants contend here, as they did in the court below, that the Miners\u2019 Union must be made a party to this dispute in order to enforce the trial court\u2019s original decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Appellants\u2019 argument overlooks the fact that the trial court in its original decree did not order appellee to restore the status quo. True, the trial court did determine that appellee had violated the Railway Labor Act, but the court made this conclusion only as a logical step on the path to its final decision. And that decision did no more than dissolve the injunction which appellee had originally obtained from a Montana state court. That <em>restoration </em>of the status quo was <em>not </em>an issue in the original proceeding is conclusively shown by an examination of this court\u2019s review of that proceeding. This court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">\u201cOn similar reasoning we agree with the conclusion of the district court that appellant has not maintained the status quo pending completion of the mediation proceedings, as required by section 6 of the Act. This alone is enough to warrant dismissal of appellant\u2019s action for injunctive relief <em>unless the decree sought to be entered would also require restoration of the status quo. </em>Neither party has asked for the latter relief.\u201d 268 F.2d 54, at page 60. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">It thus becomes clear that the error in appellants\u2019 argument stems' from the confusion of two concepts: (1) <em>restorer tion </em>of the status quo, and (2) <em>violation </em>of the status quo provisions of the Railway Labor Act. The former was not an issue in the prior action. The latter was an issue, but its determination was merely an essential preliminary to the court\u2019s final determination. Appellants, then, can be successful in their attempt to bring in the Miners\u2019 Union as a party only if they first convince the court below or this court it should modify the original decree to require appellee to restore the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">The trial court held, however, that appellants could not now ask for such relief. Did the trial court err in this determination ? In our opinion, the trial court was correct in this crucial conclusion, and should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">Appellee contends that nothing in the Rules of Civil Procedure entitles appellants at this late date to reopen and amend the judgment. Rule 59(e), 28 U.S.C.A., provides that a motion to amend the judgment must be served within ten days of the entry of judgment. Appellants apparently concede that an amendment of the judgment cannot now be made. Appellants contend, however, that they are not seeking to amend the judgment. Their aim is merely to enforce an existing decree; and for such purpose a supplementary bill assuredly will lie. Root v. Woolworth, 1893, 150 U.S. 401, 14 S.Ct. 136, 37 L.Ed. 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">The difficulty with this argument is similar to that which infects appellants\u2019 argument in favor of joining the Miners\u2019 Union. The trial court in its original decree did not order any relief <em>which can now be further effectuated </em>by ordering appellee to restore the status quo. The court did nothing more than dissolve the injunction against appellants\u2019 contemplated strike. As a step along the route to this result the court determined that appellee had violated the Railway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Labor Act, but no relief was predicated upon this conclusion other than the dissolution of the injunction. The decree granting that relief is self executing; it cannot be made more effective by any further order or decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">A consideration of the facts of Root v. Woolworth, supra, upon which appellants strongly rely, will demonstrate appellants\u2019 error. In Root a supplemental bill was indeed filed some twenty years after the original decree, but it was a genuine supplemental bill, <em>further effectuating the original decree. </em>The original decree, determining that plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in interest had paramount title to the realty in dispute, required defendant to execute a conveyance to plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in interest. The required conveyance was subsequently executed by a special master. Years later, however, defendant re-entered upon the premises in controversy with the purpose, allegedly, of inducing people to accept leases under him, thereby driving plaintiff to a multiplicity of actions to re-establish his right to the premises. Accordingly, plaintiff requested an injunction to enforce the original decree. The trial court permitted plaintiff\u2019s bill to be filed as a supplemental bill and granted its prayer. In its opinion, affirming the trial court, the United States Supreme Court characterized plaintiff\u2019s bill as supplementary <em>and ancillary </em>in character, <em>effectuating the original decree. </em>The court noted (150 U.S. at page 412, 14 S.Ct. at page 139) that the original decree \u201cnecessarily included and carried with it the right of possession to the premises * *</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Thus in Root the <em>relief </em>granted in the original decree was of such a nature that it could be and was made more effective by further court order. In the instant case, the relief granted \u2014 the dissolution of the injunction \u2014 cannot be and will not be further effectuated by an additional decree ordering appellee to restore the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Appellants contend, however, that the facts, as found by the trial court in the initial action, entitled it to relief it now prays for in its \u201csupplemental pleadings.\u201d Under Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 54(c), the court should enter the relief to which a party is entitled regardless of whether the party has demanded such relief in its pleadings. Granting all that appellants here contend, it would seem that they are tardy in raising these points. If a party, by virtue of Rule 54(c), is entitled to some form of relief beyond that included in the judgment, the time to demand such relief is immediately after the entry of judgment (Rule 59(e)), or at the latest, on appeal. Surely appellants cannot expect to obtain such relief at this late date.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The considerations above presented, in our opinion, are adequate to sustain the trial court\u2019s order. The trial court, however, suggested two additional reasons for denying appellants' motion to file supplemental pleadings. The court pointed out that the occurrences upon which appellants base their claim for restoration of the status quo had transpired before the filing of their answer. Under Rule 15(d), the purpose of supplemental pleadings is to relate events \u201cwhich have happened since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented.\u201d In response to this point appellants assert that a novel occurrence is to be found in the suit by the Miners\u2019 Union against Anaconda Company. This fact, however, relates to the question of whether the Miners\u2019 Union ought to be made a party to this action, and not to the question of whether appellee should have been ordered to restore the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The trial court also pointed out that appellants\u2019 claim for restoration of the status quo is a compulsory counterclaim under Rule 13(a). The \u201crestoration\u201d claim arises out of the same transaction as the claim for an injunction, and it would not require for its adjudication the presence of any third party over whom the court would be unable to acquire jurisdiction. Such a claim must, under Rule 13(a), be included in the original pleading; if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>not, it is lost and cannot later be asserted. Union Paving Co. v. Downer Corp., 9 Cir., 1960, 276 F.2d 468, 470; Hancock Oil Co. v. Universal Oil Products Co., 9 Cir., 1940, 115 F.2d 45, certiorari denied 314 U.S. 666, 62 S.Ct. 127, 86 L.Ed. 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Appellants in response to this argument contend that the facts for their counterclaim were pleaded in the original action; all that was omitted was the prayer for relief, and that under Rule 54(c) this omission is immaterial. This argument has already been disposed of. If appellants did in fact plead and prove facts entitling them to a restoration of the status quo, they should have requested long ago that the judgment be refashioned toward that end. Their request now is too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In view of the foregoing, we believe that there is no merit in appellants\u2019 further contention that Rule 13(f) (omitted counterclaim), applies here. That rule provides that when justice requires, a party may assert an omitted counterclaim by amendment. The interests of justice might be served by permitting appellants to plead now for restoration of the status quo and for an injunction against the Miners\u2019 Union. But this request <em>comes </em>late; and it is no less tardy when it is asserted under the provisions of Rule 13(f). Furthermore, the suggestion which appellants make here is at variance with their contention that they did, in fact, plead the counterclaim in the original action, omitting only to include a prayer for relief. In other words, we do not believe that appellants can claim relief under both Rule 54(c) and Rule 13 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">One minor matter remains to be considered. Appellee contends that certain of appellants\u2019 Specifications of Error are not designated in their Statement of Points on Appeal. This, appellee claims, violates Rule 17, subd. 6 of this court, 28 U.S.C.A.; and accordingly, Specifications of Error numbers one, two, three and five should not be considered by this court</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Appellee cites Greyhound Corp. v. Blakely, 9 Cir., 1958, 262 F.2d 401. This case does not support appellee\u2019s position. Judge Jertberg in Greyhound did say that specifications of error not presented in accordance with Rule 18, subd. 2(d) need not be considered by this court (262 F.2d at page 406), but then went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">\u201cNotwithstanding defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the rule, we will consider the specifications since neither the appellee nor this Court has been misled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Appellee has not asserted that either it or this court has been misled by appellants\u2019 asserted failure to comply with this court\u2019s rules. Hence even if appellants\u2019 specifications of error are not presented in strict compliance with the court\u2019s rules, the court need not but may still consider them. We have chosen so to do. Such consideration, however, leads us to affirm the trial court\u2019s holding.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
