Quittner, Quittner &amp; Stutman, Milford S. Zimmerman, and Zimmerman, Kelly <em>&amp; </em>Thody, hereinafter called the appellants, were appointed as special counsel for the receiver to represent him in contesting the will of Lottie Barry in a proceeding then pending in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pri- or to the appointment by the referee the appellants were informed that their compensation would be contingent upon recovery. Approximately six months later the will contest was settled, and the sum of $15,000 was paid into the bankrupt estate therefrom. The appellants filed a petition in the bankruptcy proceeding asking for the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees on a contingent basis of 33%% of the amount recovered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the same bankruptcy proceeding Bertram S. Harris, attorney for certain petitioning creditors therein, filed a petition asking that he be allowed $3000 attorney\u2019s fees and an additional $5000 for extraordinary services alleged to have been performed by him for the benefit of the estate. The referee, after a hearing, allowed to appellants approximately 25% of the amount recovered, to-wit, $3,767, and allowed Mr. Harris and his associate the sum of $1,250 as fees for representing the petitioning creditors and intervenors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The order providing for attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>neys\u2019 fees to appellants and to Harris was dated November 21, 1957. On November 29, Harris filed a petition for the review of this order. He asserted that he had performed substantial services for the bankrupt estate, that he had been largely instrumental in obtaining a settlement of the will contest, and that he should have had a greater allowance for attorney\u2019s fees. He ended his petition \u00bfor review as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">\u201cWherefore, your Petitioner prays for a review of the said Order of November 21, 1957, by a Judge of the United States District Court, .and that said Order be reversed as to the Attorney\u2019s Fees in the sum of $900.00 allowed to Bertram S. Harris, and to Quittner &amp; Stutman and Zimmerman, Kelly &amp; Thody as Special Counsel; that no fees whatever be awarded to them for the reason that all services rendered by them were solely for the benefit of Bill Barry, a Bankrupt herein, and not for the Creditors, inasmuch as they represented adverse interests;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that if any fee should be awarded to them, a fee of $400.00 would be reasonable for the very little work done by them; and, that an Order be entered herein rendering the fees sought by your Petitioner in his original Petition filed on or about the 10th day of May, 1957.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">When the matter came before the district court on April 15, 1958, the record shows that the following proceedings occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\u201cThe Clerk: The matter of Barry Yao, 624-10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201cMr. Quittner: Ready.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">\u201cMr. Zimmerman: Ready, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">\u201cMr. Harris: Ready, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">\u201cMr. Zimmerman: Your Honor suggested yesterday that he wanted testimony in this proceeding, and I think in the interest of clarifying a few situations to your Honor \u2014 I don\u2019t think there is any objection from either counsel \u2014 it might be better to have a brief statement even though out of order because it is not the Petitioner on the probate matters which gives rise to the bankruptcy situation, so I would respectfully suggest to your Honor if I might take the stand for a very few moments to outline the more or less non-controversial situations which will lead up to the only issues which could be present here\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\">\u201cThe Court: I am not interested, unless you wish to offer evidence as to what services were performed or the reasonable value of them. I am satisfied with the Referee\u2019s findings as to those matters <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but some serious charges were made here by Mr. Harris on the conflict of interest that I feel we should make some inquiry into.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-13\">\u201cAs far as what Mr. Harris did or the receiver I don\u2019t see how he could possibly be allowed any fee for what he did because he was never employed, as was pointed out in the memorandum, or never authorized to act for the receiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-14\">\u201cMr. Zimmerman: I think, your Honor, that a very brief statement on my part from the stand might address itself with help to your Honor on this question of conflict of interest on this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-15\">\u201cThe Court: Very well. Is that satisfactory to you to proceed in that manner, Mr. Harris?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\u201cMr. Harris: That is satisfactory, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Thereafter, Milford S. Zimmerman and Francis F. Quittner testified as witnesses before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">On March 31, 1959, almost one year later, the district judge filed a written order, 172 F.Supp. 375, reversing the referee\u2019s order and denying appellants any fees as special counsel. He reviewed the objections to appellants\u2019 fees that Harris had set forth in his petition for review of the referee\u2019s order and then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201cAlso to be considered by the Court sua sponte, though not raised by the petitioner, are questions lurking throughout the record as to whether Messrs. Quittner and Zimmerman made full and accurate disclosure either (1), in the petition for their employment, of the facts as to the \u2018necessity for employing counsel at all\u2019, as contemplated by General Order 44 * * * or (2), in the petition for their fees, of the facts as to \u2018the value and the extent of the services rendered\u2019, as contemplated by \u00a7 62 sub. d of the Act [11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 102d].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">\u201cHere Messrs. Quittner and Zimmerman failed fully and accurately to disclose the material facts as to the \u2018value and extent\u2019 of their services as special counsel for the receiver, not only seeking fees for services actually rendered prior to their appointment pursuant to General Order 44 * * * but also in seeking to obtain such fees on a claimed \u2018contingent\u2019 basis calling for substantially larger allowance from the bankrupt estate than would otherwise be appropriate * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">On the basis of this finding the district judge ruled that appellants were entitled to no compensation for their services.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">On being informed of the order of the district judge, the appellants promptly filed a motion for a rehearing and reconsideration of the court\u2019s order of March 31, 1959, setting forth among other things the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">\u201c2. That this Court request that Honorable David D. Head, Referee in Bankruptcy, file a supplementary Certificate on Review setting forth the facts as known to said Referee on the issues considered and decided sua sponte by this Court in its said Decision and Order of March 31, 1959.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">\u201c3. That the Court permit these moving parties to introduce evidence in connection with the issues considered and decided sua sponte by this Court in said Decision and Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">\u201c4. That this Court reconsider the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law upon the said issues considered and decided sua sponte, and vacate such of the findings or conclusions which are to the effect that these moving parties made misrepresentations to the Referee in Bankruptcy concerning the value and extent of the services rendered after their employment as special counsel and concerning the contingent basis of the fee petitioned for by them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-17\">\u201c5. That after rehearing and reconsideration of the entire record * * * and such additional evidence as may be introduced upon such rehearing, that this Court (a) amend its findings of fact and conclusions of law so as to determine that these moving parties made no misrepresentations to the Referee in Bankruptcy * * * and (b) amend its Order so as to confirm in its entirety the Order of the Referee of November 21, 1957.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-20\">On June 8, 1959, at the hearing on the motion for a rehearing and reconsideration of the district court\u2019s order, this motion was supported by affidavits of Mr. Quittner, an affidavit of Mr. Zimmerman and an affidavit of Mr. Scheinman, the attorney for the special administrator of the estate of Lottie Barry. The motion was denied by the district court in a written order dated August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>11, 1959, 175 F.Supp. 726. An appeal was taken by appellants to this court from the order of the court dated March 31, 1959, and from the order denying a rehearing dated August 11, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Appellants\u2019 main contention is that the district court based its decision upon a ground not raised in the petition for a review of the referee\u2019s order but rather upon a ground that was brought up upon the court\u2019s own motion. They complain that at no time during the hearing had any party claimed that they had misrepresented to the referee the value and extent of their services and that during the period of almost a' year between that hearing and the order of the court they had no intimation of any kind that this issue was being considered by the court. When on March 31, 1959, the court filed its opinion basing the decision upon a finding that the appellants had falsely represented to the referee the value and extent of their services, they promptly filed a petition for rehearing asking for the right to have the referee file an affidavit setting forth exactly what information they had given to him at the time of their appointment as special counsel. They contended that they could show that in no way had they misrepresented to the referee or to anyone else the value and extent of their services.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We realize that the district judge has a large degree of discretion in determining what, if any, allowance for fees should be granted to attorneys and whether or not to grant a rehearing. However, appellants contend that in denying their applications for fees and a rehearing the court has made findings that they have been guilty of misrepresenting facts to the referee and to the court. They contend that these findings of misrepresentation were made by the court although no such contention was made in the petition for a review. Appellants\u2019 counsel point out that appellants are reputable members of the State Bar of California and that they have in effect been branded as dishonest without having had an opportunity to defend themselves.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\u201cThe purest treasure mortal times afford</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">Is spotless reputation; that away Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Under the circumstances of this case and for the purpose of giving appellants an opportunity to answer the charges made against them, we hold that the denial of appellants\u2019 petition for a rehearing was an abuse of discretion. The orders of the district court are reversed, and the case is remanded for action not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-16\">. It was recognized that if the will contest should be successful substantial funds would be added to the bankrupt estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-17\">. No objections were filed before the referee to appellants\u2019 petition for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-18\">. The referee allowed Mr. Harris compensation only for Ms services as attorney for the petitioning creditors. In so ruling, bis order contained the following language: \u201cMr. Harris petitioned for the allowance to him of $3,000.00 for services as attorney for petitioning creditors and $5,000.00 for extraordinary services rendered for the benefit of the estate. On two separate occasions the receiver-trustee petitioned the court for leave to employ Mr. Harris as attorney for the estate. Both petitions were denied for the reason that Mr. Harris represented parties who asserted interests adverse to the estate. If the receiver-trustee solicited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>and accepted Mr. Harris\u2019 services, he did so without authority. In the one matter in which the estate recovered $15,-000.00 from the estate of Mrs. Barry, the receiver-trustee was represented by competent special counsel and whatever aid Mr. Harris gave in connection with this matter was as a volunteer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b348-17\">. A similar claim that appellants represented adverse interests had been made by Harris before the referee and had been rejected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b348-18\">.
