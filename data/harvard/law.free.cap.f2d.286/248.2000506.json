So much is, for all practical purposes, admitted. But appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>maintains that this activity does not constitute an offense within the statute under which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"> It may be that the transfer of untaxed alcohol from one vehicle to another does not make out a case of \u201cremoval.\u201d See Price v. United States, 5 Cir., 150 F.2d 283; United States v. Perfetti, D.C.E.D.Pa., 91 F.Supp. 909. But the act of placing the whiskey in the trunk of the car, considered in connection with appellant\u2019s flight to avoid apprehension, clearly amounts to \u201cdepositing\u201d and \u201cconcealing\u201d within the intendment of the statute. See Ingram v. United States, 5 Cir., 241 F.2d 708. And proof of any one of the prohibited acts, even though \u201cremoving,\u201d \u201cdepositing\u201d and \u201cconcealing\u201d were charged conjunctively, is sufficient for conviction. Price v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
