The first \u201cOrder\u201d is that of May 5, 1960, which is a statement by the court below to the effect that because the plaintiff has paid the necessary fees for filing his complaint that the court will regard the plaintiff\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>as having been withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-32\">The plaintiff next appeals from an order dated May 13, 1960, which denied plaintiff\u2019s motion dated May 6, 1960, filed May 9, 1960, which is in the nature of a renewal of his motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-33\">Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion to alter or amend the court\u2019s order of May 13, 1960 and this order was denied on May 19, 1960. Notice of appeal was filed on May 23, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-34\">We can perceive no error committed by the court below. Accordingly, the orders appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
