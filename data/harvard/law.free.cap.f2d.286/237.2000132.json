Rev. Code of 1939, \u00a7 102.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Taxpayers argue that (1) because the total accumulations of earnings and profits were in each taxable year less than 70 <em>% </em>of the annual operating expenses for such year, the accumulation was reasonable as a matter of law and (2) because the accumulation by taxpayer Latchis Theatres of Claremont, Inc. was less than $43,000, such accumulation was conclusively reasonable. The petitioners cite no authority to us to support such hard and fast rules in regard to reasonable accumulation under this provision of the 1939 Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute sets forth a standard that is flexible enough to meet varied financial circumstances. We shall not judicially add a proviso that focuses on only one factor of a corporation\u2019s financial situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">Judgment will be entered affirming the decisions of the Tax Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-13\">. 53 Stat. 35 (1939), as amended, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 (1946).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b286-14\">. Congress in the 1954 Internal Revenue Code, \u00a7 535, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 535, provided a credit system which, in effect allowed $60,000 in total accumulations before the corporation would be required to pay taxes on accumulated earnings. 68A Stat. 180 (1954).
