United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019Connell, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28, United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b665-25\">WORLEY, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b665-26\">This is an appeal from the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>of the United States Patent Office dismissing an opposition by registrant, appellant here, to an application of applicant, appellee here, for registration of the letter \u201cB\u201d in a diamond-shaped border design as a trademark for \u201ctubing and couplings,\u201d subsequently restricted by amendment to \u201csmall diameter tubing and couplings to be incorporated in centralized lubricating equipment for machine tools, automotive vehicles and the like.\u201d Use since April 15, 1953, is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Registrant bases its opposition on its two registrations of a substantially similar \u201cB\u201d in a diamond-shaped border design, the first registered in 1910 for \u201cmetal pipes and tubes,\u201d and the other registered in 1953 for \u201cmetal pipes, tubes easing and couplings therefor.\u201d Use of the mark on pipes and tubing since .1870 is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">A stipulation of facts was submitted \u2018by the parties. The facts on behalf of \u00a1registrant show that from 1947 to 1957 registrant and its predecessors \u201csold a yearly average of over 1,243,000 tons of pipes, tubes, casing and couplings\u201d bearing its trademark for \u201cnumerous piping uses in industry and construction\u201d and that a substantial portion of its tubular products \u201care sold for use in petroleum drilling, producing and refining operations.\u201d An advertisement of registrant\u2019s predecessor, published in 1900, submitted with the stipulated facts shows tubing ranging in sizes from 1 to 30 inches in diameter. Other exhibits of more recent date show registrant\u2019s mark applied to sizes from 4% to 20 inches in diameter.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In the stipulated facts on behalf of applicant, it is stated that the tubing sold under its mark is \u201cflexible tubing less than <em>y\u00b1\" </em>in diameter and is installed in centralized lubricating equipment for machine tools and other machinery to conduct lubricant in small quantities from a central pump to distributed bearings of the machinery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">There is no dispute as to the similarity of the marks or registrant\u2019s priority. The sole issue is whether concurrent use of the instant marks on the respective goods of the parties would likely result in confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The board held that even though the products of both parties fall within the general category of tubing, there was no likelihood of purchaser confusion since they are used for different purposes, and sold through different channels of trade under different circumstances to different types of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">We are unable to agree that the record supports that conclusion. There is nothing in the application, including the intended use recited therein, to distinguish applicant\u2019s goods from the pipes, tubes, casing and couplings covered by registrant\u2019s registration. It is clear that registrant\u2019s tubing, as enumerated in its registrations, could have many sizes and uses, including those described by applicant for its goods. While there is some evidence indicating that registrant uses its mark primarily on pipes and tubing for oil well drilling and production, which apparently would not include flexible tubing less than <em>yy' </em>in diameter of the kind to which applicant applies its marks, it is the description of the goods enumerated in the registration that is controlling. Where, as here, an opposer, relying on its registration, introduces additional evidence relating to use of its mark, it is not necessarily limited to the uses shown by that evidence, but may rely on the presumption that the registered mark has been used on all the goods encompassed by the registration. General Shoe Corp. v. Lerner Bros. Mfg. Co., Inc., 254 F.2d 154, 45 CCPA 872. Accordingly, we are of the opinion the board erred in dismissing the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
