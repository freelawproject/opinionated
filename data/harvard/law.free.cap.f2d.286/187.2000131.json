United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019CONNELL, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28, U.S.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b235-24\">SMITH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b235-25\">The single issue here is whether Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1052(d) ) supports the refusal of the examiner, affirmed by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, to register applicant\u2019s mark \u201cDurafilm\u201d for \u201claminated and/or extrusion-coated translucent or transparent packaging films,\u201d over prior registration No. 564,274 of the trademark \u201cDurofoil\u201d for \u201cwrapping material, namely, paper laminated to a metallic foil and transparent film material laminated to a metallic foil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-26\">Appellant urges that the refusal to register its mark is not proper and should be reversed because:</p>\n<p id=\"b235-27\">1. The goods are different;</p>\n<p id=\"b235-28\">2. The marks are different; and</p>\n<p id=\"b235-29\">3. The goods are sold to discriminating purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>While there may be a technical difference between the \u201cpackaging films\u201d recited in the application and the \u201cwrapping material\u201d recited in the reference, this difference is of no legal significance in the resolution of the issue here. Applicant supplies plastic films which are used in various ways in the packaging industry. The specimen submitted with the application to register its mark further identifies appellant as being \u201cconverters \u2014 printers\u2014laminators of films and foils.\u201d It appears, therefore, that appellant offers to supply either films or foils as may be requested by its customers and that both films and foils are used by appellant\u2019s customers in packaging their goods for resale to the public. In addition, applicant advertises laminated aluminum foil and paper as an \u201couter-wrap\u201d for boxes used in the packaging industry. This \u201couterwrap\u201d product appears to be a \u201cwrapping material\u201d as this term is used in the cited registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the marks presently are being used on goods which the packaging industry considers to be technically different is predicated solely upon an assumption that \u201cwrapping material\u201d in the packaging industry is a different material than is a \u201cpackaging film.\u201d There is no evidence of record to support this argument. Even if such evidence were before us, this fact is not determinative of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u201cFilms,\u201d \u201cfoils,\u201d and \u201cwrapping materials\u201d are related goods as shown by appellant\u2019s specimen label and by appellant\u2019s advertising cited by the examiner. We are therefore unwilling, in the absence of definite evidence of the registrant\u2019s intent to so limit the term, to assign a technically restricted meaning to the term \u201cwrapping material.\u201d The owner of the prior registered mark has the right to use his mark on such closely related goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Similarity of the products of appellant and of registrant is of greater legal significance in applying Section 2(d) than are the possible semantic differences urged upon us by appellant. Section 2(d) requires us to determine not whether the goods are identical but only whether applicant\u2019s mark so resembles the prior mark as to be likely when applied to its goods to cause confusion, or mistake, or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the marks \u201cDurafilm\u201d and \u201cDurofoil\u201d are different is predicated upon dictum found in our decision in The May Department Stores Co. v. Schloss Bros. &amp; Co., Inc., 234 F.2d 879, 43 CCPA 980. Relying upon this, dictum, appellant urges that the prefixes \u201cDuro\u201d and \u201cDura\u201d are common, descriptive terms without trademark significance. A sufficient answer to this argument is that the court in the May case found no confusing similarity in the marks \u201cDuro-Style Fabrics\u201d and \u201cDurosheen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">It is an elemental proposition that the marks must be considered in their entireties. Sears, Roebuck and Co. v. Hofman, 258 F.2d 953, 46 CCPA 708; Meyer Chemical Co. v. Anahist Co., Inc. (Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical Co., Assignee, substituted). 263 F.2d 344, 46 CCPA 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">WTiile it may be necessary to dissect marks as was done in the May case, supra, in analyzing specific similarities and differences of the marks, the determination of the issue here requires, as it did in the May case, a comparison of the entire marks. Appellant\u2019s entire mark \u201cDurafilm\u201d when applied to its goods so resembles the registered mark \u201cDurofoil\u201d that confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers is likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">In so holding, we have given consideration to and reject appellant\u2019s argument that since the goods are sold to the packaging industry the sales are made to discriminating purchasers. Even such a discriminating purchaser might well assume that the names \u201cDurafilm\u201d and] \u201cDurofoil\u201d were trademarks on companion products, i. e., the \u201cfilms\u201d and \u201cfoils\u201d of a single producer.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">It was the purpose of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act to prevent registration of a mark such as that here in issue which so resembles a previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>registered mark as to be likely, when applied to the goods of applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
