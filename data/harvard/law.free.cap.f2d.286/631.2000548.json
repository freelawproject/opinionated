(Cooper), on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter of the counterclaim. Because the question presented on appeal is whether Great Lakes\u2019 counterclaim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of a claim asserted by Cooper a detailed analysis of the pleadings is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-21\">On May 12, 1959, Great Lakes filed an amended complaint naming Cooper as defendant. Jurisdiction was allegedly based on diversity. The allegations fall roughly into three groups. First, it was alleged that Howard Cooper and Joseph Herbert had been employed by Great Lakes for periods of approximately four and two years, as foreman and supervisor, respectively and that they left Great Lakes\u2019 employ taking with them certain information relating to the flexible rubber tubing manufactured by Great Lakes, and lists disclosing Great Lakes\u2019 customers; that shortly thereafter they, with others, founded Cooper; that Cooper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>competed for and obtained customers that were, until then, customers of Great Lakes; and, that Cooper\u2019s \u201coffering to sell, and manufacturing and selling flexible tubing made and offered for sale with utilization of knowledge and information acquired [by Howard Cooper and Joseph Herbert] while these men were in a fiduciary relationship with plaintiff\u201d constituted \u201cacts of unfair competition and unfair business practices\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Second, it was alleged that Great Lakes manufactures flexible tubing covered by patents held by Fred T. and Robert E. Roberts; that Great Lakes is a licensee of the Roberts; that Cooper, after failing to obtain a similar license, submitted bids to the United States Army and Air Force, customers of Great Lakes, offering to manufacture and s\u00e9ll flexible rubber tubing of a type, the manufacture and sale of which would constitute Cooper an \u201cinfringer\u201d of the Roberts\u2019 patents; that Cooper, as low bidder, was awarded several contracts by the <em>Government; </em>that Cooper was enabled to underbid Great Lakes because unlike Great Lakes it was not paying royalties as a licensee under the Roberts\u2019 patents; and, that by reason of Cooper\u2019s operation as an \u201cunlicensed infringer\u201d it \u201cis and has been in an unfair competitive position\u201d relative to Great Lakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Third, it was alleged that Cooper implied to customers of Great Lakes that the quality of the tubing manufactured by Great Lakes was inferior; that Cooper represented to the United States Air Force that no validly patented ideas, processes or inventions held by others would be utilized in fulfilling its contracts for flexible tubing, that their representations were false; and, that these acts have damaged and imminently threaten Great Lakes\u2019 business operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Great Lakes referred to various contracts with the United States Army and Air Force which it alleged it had failed to obtain but which Cooper did obtain, and further specified an Air Force contract on which it was then being underbid by Cooper and which it would not obtain if Cooper\u2019s acts of \u201cunfair competition\u201d were not enjoined. Great Lakes asked for relief in the form of an injunction, an accounting for profits and an award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">On June 23, 1959, Cooper filed an answer to the amended complaint and a counterclaim which asserted that Great Lakes, Fred T. and Robert E. Roberts, the R. E. Darling Company, which like Great Lakes is a licensee of the Roberts, and various unnamed companies and individuals \u201chave been and still are * *' conspiring together and attempting both, individually and in concert to restrain, and monopolize interstate commerce\u201d in. violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2. The-conspiracy was alleged to include, without limitation, the making of false repre- \u2022 sentations to certain of Cooper\u2019s material. suppliers that they were guilty of contributory infringement when the conspirators knew that the supplied items, were staple articles of commerce and. could not be the basis of such liability..</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The counterclaim also alleged, and this, is of prime importance in the instant, case, \u201cthe bringing of a series of unjustified lawsuits by the conspirators in. bad faith and without color of right with. the sole object of harassing and preventing defendant [Cooper] from competing in the manufacture and sale of flexible hose and thus eliminating defendant as a competitor, including this action [i. e.,\u201e the action brought by the filing of the amended complaint by Great Lakes] * * * to prevent defendant from seeking the patronage of its principal customer, the United States, [and] an action brought in another court against the United States Secretary of Defense by-Fred T. and Robert E. Roberts to prevent the Secretary from buying defendant\u2019s hose, and a patent infringement suit. brought against defendant in * * *[the court below] by Fred T. and Robert. E. Roberts to prevent defendant from. manufacturing flexible hose and a temporary restraining order obtained therein, both the action and the restraining order * * * being in violation of 28. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1498 which forbids infringement actions and injunctive restraints against government contractors * The counterclaim asked treble damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">On July 2, 1959, Cooper moved to dismiss Great Lakes\u2019 amended complaint \u2022on the ground that there was no diversity \u2022of citizenship between the parties. By \u2022order dated December 9, 1959, the court .granted Cooper\u2019s motion to dismiss. Juxisdiction of Cooper\u2019s counterclaim was .\u25a0retained on the ground that it had an independent basis of jurisdiction in that \u2022it asserted a claim arising under the laws \u2022of the United States. No appeal was taken from that order and no question regarding it has been raised on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">On December 28, 1959, Great Lakes \u25a0filed an answer and a counterclaim to 'Cooper\u2019s counterclaim. Great Lakes\u2019 \u2022counterclaim repeated in substance the .allegations of its amended complaint. The counterclaim is distinguishable from \u2022the amended complaint only in that it is more specific and in that it alleges further that Cooper, with knowledge of the .amounts of royalties required to be paid by Great Lakes under the Roberts patients, has underbid Great Lakes on various contracts offered by agencies of the United States by approximately the .amount of the royalties required to be paid by Great Lakes to the Roberts; that Herbert and Cooper had induced \u201ckey\u201d \u2022employees of Great Lakes to leave it and to become employed by Cooper; and that Cooper\u2019s charges in the court below were baseless and untrue and have resulted in \u2022damaging Great Lakes unfairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">On June 6, 1960, Cooper moved to dismiss the Great Lakes counterclaim on the ground that the court below lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter. In opposition to this motion Great Lakes contended that the court had ancillary juris\u2022diction of its counterclaim as a compulsory counterclaim arising out of the same transaction and occurrences that were the subject matter of Cooper\u2019s claim arising under the Federal antitrust laws. On May 5, 1960, the court granted Cooper\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that Great Lakes\u2019 counterclaim was not a compulsory counterclaim. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">A federal court has ancillary jurisdiction of the subject matter of a counterclaim if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of an opposing party\u2019s claim of which the court has jurisdiction. Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, 1926, 270 U.S. 593, 46 S.Ct. 367, 70 L.Ed. 750; 3 Moore, Fed.Practice, pp. 39-41 (2d ed. 1948). Similarly, a counterclaim that arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of an opposing party\u2019s claim is a \u201ccompulsory counterclaim\u201d within the meaning of Rule 13(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It is stated frequently that the determination of ancillary jurisdiction of a counterclaim in a federal court must turn on whether the counterclaim is compulsory within the meaning of Rule 13(a). Such a statement of the law relating to ancillary jurisdiction of counterclaims is not intended to suggest that Rule 13(a) extends the jurisdiction of the federal courts to entertain counterclaims for the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure cannot expand the jurisdiction of the United States courts. What is meant is that the issue of the existence of ancillary jurisdiction and the issue as to whether a counterclaim is compulsory are to be answered by the same test. It is not a coincidence that the same considerations that determine whether a counterclaim is compulsory decide also whether the court has ancillary jurisdiction to adjudicate it. The tests are the same because Rule 13(a) and the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction are designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>abolish the same evil, viz., piecemeal litigation in the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">We have indicated that a counterclaim is compulsory if it bears a \u201clogical relationship\u201d to an opposing party's claim. Zion v. Sentry Safety Control Corp., 3 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 31. See also United Artists Corp. v. Masterpiece Productions, Inc., 2 Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d 213, 216. The phrase \u201clogical relationship\u201d is given meaning by the purpose of the rule which it was designed to implement. Thus, a counterclaim is logically related to the opposing party\u2019s claim where separate trials on each of their respective claims would involve a substantial duplication of effort and time by the parties and the courts. Where multiple claims involve many of the same factual issues, or the same factual and legal issues, or where they are offshoots of the same basic controversy between the parties, fairness and considerations of convenience and of economy require that the counter-claimant be permitted to maintain his cause of action. Indeed the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>compels the counterclaimant to assert his claim in the same suit for it would be barred if asserted separately, subsequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Cooper alleges that the claims originally asserted in Great Lakes\u2019 amended complaint,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> reiterated in substance in its counterclaim, are \u201cunjustified\u201d and were brought in \u201cbad faith and without color of right with the sole object of harassing and preventing defendant [Cooper] from competing in the manufacture and sale of flexible hose.\u201d These are the only allegations set out by Cooper\u2019s counterclaim which demonstrate a relationship within the purview of Rule 13(a) to Great Lakes\u2019 amended complaint or counterclaim. But that they do demonstrate a relationship is unquestionable. It is clear that a determination that. Cooper\u2019s claims that the claims asserted in Great Lakes\u2019 amended complaint and reiterated in substance in its counterclaim are harassing will entail an extensive airing of the facts and the law relating to Great Lakes\u2019 counterclaim. It follows that the court below was in error in. dismissing Great Lakes\u2019 counterclaim on the ground that it was permissive. We-hold that Great Lakes\u2019 counterclaim was a compulsory one within the meaning of Rule 13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">We point out that we express no opinion as to whether any of the pleadings, in the present case, whether those of Cooper or those of Great Lakes, state-claims upon which relief can be granted. Only the question of jurisdiction is raised' on this appeal. There can be no doubt, that the court below possesses the power, the jurisdiction, to ascertain whether or not causes of action are stated by the-respective parties. Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 1959, 358-U.S. 354, 359, 79 S.Ct. 468, 3 L.Ed.2d 368. The issues of whether or not the respective parties have stated causes of action and their nature will be before the-court below and can be decided on remand after briefing and argument. If an appeal be taken from the ensuing decision this court will have the benefit of the views of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">The judgment will be reversed and the cause will be remanded with the direction to proceed in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\">. The court below did not direct the entry of final judgment upon the counterclaim as specified by Rule 54(b), Fed.RulesCiv.Proc., 28 U.S.C., i. e., upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay. Since, however, the court\u2019s order was one \u201crefusing\u201d an injunction, this court has jurisdiction of the appeal pursuant to Section 1292(a) (1), 28 U.S.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-6\">. The amended complaint was dismissed by the court below as we have stated at an earlier point in this opinion but none the less it is one of the operative facts on which Cooper rests its allegations of harassment and is pertinent on that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
