N. L. R. B., 107 U.S.App.D.C. 188, 275 F.2d 646, certiorari granted 363 U.S. 837, 80 S.Ct. 1610, 4 L.Ed.2d 1723. Cf. N. L. R. B. v. Mountain Pacific Chapter, 9 Cir., 270 F.2d 425. If we thought the facts were as strong here as in Teamsters, supra, we recognize we should withhold decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
