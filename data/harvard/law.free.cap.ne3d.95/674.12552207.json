(\"LexisNexis\"), for lack of personal jurisdiction. Moreau-Davila also appeals from the trial court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of LexisNexis. For the reasons outlined below, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Course of Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On April 27, 2016, LexisNexis, a corporation with a principal place of business in Montgomery County, Ohio, filed a breach of contract action against Rachel Moreau-Davila, an attorney from San Antonio, Texas, who at all relevant times operated as a law office named Moreau-Davila &amp; Guenther. The contract at issue is a Subscription Agreement entered into by the parties on January 29, 2015, whereby Moreau-Davila agreed to pay LexisNexis for its online research services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In its complaint, LexisNexis alleged that although it substantially performed its obligations under the Subscription Agreement, Moreau-Davila breached her obligations by failing to make payments as provided in the agreement. As a result of the breach, LexisNexis alleged that Moreau-Davila owed $10,571.28 in unpaid monthly installment payments plus interest and resulting attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Moreau-Davila initially responded to the complaint by filing a Civ.R. 12(B)(2) motion to dismiss on grounds that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over her. The trial court, however, overruled the motion, finding it could exercise personal jurisdiction under Ohio's long-arm statute since the breach of contract claim arose out of a business transaction that took place in Ohio. The trial court also found that Moreau-Davila purposefully established minimum contacts in Ohio by entering into a contract with an Ohio business. The trial court further found that it was permitted to exercise personal jurisdiction pursuant to a forum selection clause in the Subscription Agreement, which provided the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Claims and controversies involving the following will not be subject to arbitration and the parties agree to exclusive\n   jurisdiction in federal or state courts located in Montgomery County, Ohio: * * * (c) non-payment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After the trial court overruled Moreau-Davila's motion to dismiss, on July 22, 2016, LexisNexis filed a motion for summary judgment that included various evidentiary materials and affidavits supporting its breach of contract claim and its request for damages. Following the submission of LexisNexis's motion, the trial court issued a briefing order that advised Moreau-Davila her opposing memorandum was due on August 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Prior to that deadline, on August 19, 2016, Moreau-Davila filed a motion for an extension of time to respond to LexisNexis' motion for summary judgment on grounds that she had been preparing for three criminal jury trials. The trial court granted Moreau-Davila's request, and extended the filing deadline to September 12, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Approximately one week after that deadline had passed, on September 21, 2016, Moreau-Davila filed multiple notices advising the court that she had issued discovery requests, interrogatories, and requests for admissions to LexisNexis. The following day, Moreau-Davila filed her memorandum opposing LexisNexis' motion for summary judgment. Moreau-Davila's memorandum included no supporting evidentiary materials and generally alleged that summary judgment was improper because a genuine issue of material fact existed as to her alleged indebtedness. Specifically, Moreau-Davila claimed that she was not responsible for the alleged debt because a representative of LexisNexis had advised her that she could cancel the Subscription Agreement upon the dissolution of her law firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} After considering the submitted evidence, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of LexisNexis and ordered Moreau-Davila to pay LexisNexis $10,571.28 in unpaid installment payments, plus 15% interest, and $2,227 in attorney fees. Moreau-Davila now appeals from that decision and from the trial court's decision denying her motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, raising two assignments of error for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    First Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Moreau-Davila's First Assignment of Error is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE COURT BELOW ERRED IN OVERRULING DEFENDANT-APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Under her First Assignment of Error, Moreau-Davila contends that the trial court erred in overruling her Civ.R. 12(B)(2) motion to dismiss LexisNexis's breach of contract action for want of personal jurisdiction. In support of her argument, Moreau-Davila claims that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction under Ohio's long-arm statute because she did not transact business in Ohio as contemplated by the statute. Moreau-Davila also claims that she did not have sufficient minimum contacts with Ohio for the trial court to exercise personal jurisdiction within the bounds of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} As a preliminary matter, we note that \"[p]ersonal jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Enquip Technologies Group, Inc. v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In support of its motion for summary judgment, LexisNexis submitted the following documentation: (1) a copy of the Subscription Agreement and addendums signed by Moreau-Davila on January 29, 2015; (2) the Terms and Conditions of Use and Price Schedule for LexisNexis's services that were incorporated by reference in the Subscription Agreement; and (3) LexisNexis's Account Statement and Invoice Summary for Moreau-Davila showing an outstanding balance of $389.63 for unpaid monthly installment payments and $10,181.65 for accelerated monthly installment payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In addition, LexisNexis submitted an affidavit signed by its U.S. Collections Manager, Robert Berry. In the affidavit, Berry averred to the authenticity of the documentation provided in support of LexisNexis's motion for summary judgment and to the total amount of Moreau-Davila's debt to LexisNexis, $10,571.28. LexisNexis also submitted an affidavit signed by its attorney, averring that the company had incurred attorney fees and court costs in the amount of $2,227 for this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 35} In reviewing the Subscription Agreement provided by LexisNexis, we find that paragraphs LA 3.3 and LPA 3.1 of the agreement clearly and unambiguously indicate that LexisNexis would provide Moreau-Davila with an initial complementary period of online research services until March 27, 2015. On that date, Moreau-Davila was then required to make increasing monthly installment payments to LexisNexis until January 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Paragraph 7.6 of the Subscription Agreement contains an acceleration clause providing that: \"if any charge not the subject of legitimate dispute should remain unpaid for more than 75 days after becoming due, then [LexisNexis] reserves the right to require each remaining unpaid Monthly Installment for the Committed Term to become immediately due and payable to [LexisNexis].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 37} The Account Statement provided by LexisNexis indicates that Moreau-Davila stopped making the agreed-upon monthly installment payments on May 31, 2015, and that as of February 9, 2016, she owed $389.63 for the missed payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 38} The Invoice Summary provided by LexisNexis indicates that Moreau-Davila's remaining minimum monthly installment payments owed between July 1, 2015 and January 27, 2018, were accelerated on February 2, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement. The accelerated amount in the Invoice Summary is $10,181.65, making Moreau-Davila's total debt $10,571.28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Section III of LexisNexis' Price Schedule indicates that amounts which have not been paid within 30 days after the invoice date are \"subject to a late payment charge at a rate equal to 15% per annum (or if less, the maximum rate permitted under applicable law).\" The Price Schedule also indicates that if Moreau-Davila fails to pay charges when due, she \"will be liable for all costs of collection incurred by [LexisNexis], including, without limitation, collection agency fees, reasonable attorney's fees, and court costs.\" Again, as previously noted, LexisNexis's attorney submitted an affidavit averring that the company had expended $2,227 in attorney fees resulting from Moreau-Davila's nonpayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 40} In response to all the documentation and information submitted by LexisNexis, Moreau-Davila claims summary judgment is inappropriate because a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding her indebtedness, which she claims is overstated and false. In making this argument, Moreau-Davila did not allege or provide any evidentiary materials showing that she had paid LexisNexis or that LexisNexis had failed to perform its obligations under the Subscription Agreement. Instead, Moreau-Davila maintained that she was not responsible for the alleged debt because, at some undisclosed point in time, she had canceled the Subscription Agreement upon the dissolution of her law office, Moreau-Davila &amp; Guenther.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 41} We note that there is a provision in the addendum of the Subscription Agreement providing that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Subscriber may terminate this Agreement in the event of its complete dissolution by providing [LexisNexis] written notice of its dissolution including a copy of the Certification of Dissolution filed in its state o[f] incorporation or, for sole proprietors, other evidence reasonably satisfactory to [LexisNexis] and which supports that Subscriber is no longer operating a law practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Although this provision permits termination of the Subscription Agreement, Moreau-Davila has failed to state when, or provide any evidence showing that she actually ceased operating as Moreau-Davila &amp; Guenther. Nor did Moreau-Davila provide any evidentiary materials demonstrating that she notified LexisNexis in writing that she had ceased operating her law firm as required by the terms of the Subscription Agreement. Moreau-Davila also did not provide any details or evidence showing when and how she allegedly went about cancelling the Subscription Agreement. Accordingly, there is nothing in the record, not even a sworn affidavit, supporting Moreau-Davila's assertion that she was not responsible for the debt because she had canceled the Subscription Agreement with LexisNexis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 43} In opposing summary judgment, Moreau-Davila also challenges the validity of the acceleration clause in the Subscription Agreement; yet, she provides no basis for why the clause should not be enforced. \" 'By agreeing to an acceleration clause, the parties in this case have avoided the operation of the general rule that nonpayment on an installment loan does not constitute a breach of the entire contract.

In opposing LexisNexis' motion for summary judgment, Moreau-Davila did not refute or provide any evidence contradicting LexisNexis's Account Statement and Invoice Summary showing that she was in arrears between May 2015 and February 2016, which is well over 75 days.

Three days before that deadline, Moreau-Davila filed a motion requesting an extension of time to submit her memorandum on grounds that she had been preparing for three criminal jury trials. The trial court granted the motion and changed the filing deadline to September 12, 2016. Thereafter, Moreau-Davila did not issue discovery requests to LexisNexis until September 21, 2016, nine days after her opposing memorandum was due. Then, without requesting any further extension of time, Moreau-Davila filed her opposing memorandum ten days late on September 22, 2016. Although Moreau-Davila argued in her memorandum that summary judgment was premature because discovery was pending, she never requested another extension of time nor filed a motion and affidavit under Civ.R. 56(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 55} If Moreau-Davila believed that she needed a continuance to develop the evidentiary materials she needed to respond to LexisNexis's motion for summary judgment, she should have applied for a continuance under Civ.R. 56(F). Because\n   Moreau-Davila did not seek relief under Civ.R. 56(F), she cannot not use the lack of discovery responses as a basis for reversing the trial court's summary judgment ruling on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Clark County Solid Waste Mgt.

This is especially true in this case, as Moreau-Davila did not issue her discovery requests until after the filing deadline for her opposing memorandum had passed. Therefore, she cannot rely on her own delay in issuing discovery requests as a basis for postponing the trial court's summary judgment ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    4.

However, not only did Moreau-Davila fail to ever move to have her firm joined as a party to the action, but the record indicates that Moreau-Davila admitted that she was simply doing business under the name \"Moreau-Davila &amp; Guenther,\" as she consistently referred to herself in the pleadings as \"Rachel Moreau-Davila d/b/a Moreau-Davila &amp; Guenther.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 57} As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Auer v.
