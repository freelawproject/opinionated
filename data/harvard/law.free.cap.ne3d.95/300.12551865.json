We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiff, Christian Cardona, was a passenger in a vehicle owned and operated by his mother and insured by Encompass. When she slowed to make a turn, the vehicle was struck from the rear by another vehicle which left the scene. The plaintiff's mother followed the other vehicle, and the plaintiff recorded its registration number, which he observed on the license plate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The plaintiff reported the accident, and a review of the Registry of Motor Vehicles database established that the plate number was for a 2010 Honda owned by Stephanie Carnevale, and insured by Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate). The plaintiff made an insurance claim against Carnevale for his injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident. Allstate investigated the accident and denied the plaintiff's claim by informing the plaintiff that Allstate's insured, Carnevale, \"was not responsible for the accident\" because she denied \"ever being in an accid[en]t with [the plaintiff] at this location.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiff then sought uninsured motorist benefits (UM benefits) from Encompass, asserting that because Allstate had denied the claim, he was entitled to UM benefits as the victim of a \"hit-and-run\" accident. When Encompass denied the claim, the plaintiff filed this action seeking arbitration of his uninsured motorist claim pursuant to the Encompass insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Encompass filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff filed a cross motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A Superior Court judge allowed Encompass's motion and denied the plaintiff's motion. Judgment entered for Encompass, and the plaintiff appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   . \"We review a grant of summary judgment de novo to determine 'whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Juliano\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272388\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/527/#p529\">\n    461 Mass. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 529-530 (2012), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Augat, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut.

This rule of resolving ambiguities in a policy against the insurer, however, is inapplicable where the language of the contract is that of the standard policy and is, therefore, prescribed by statute and controlled by the Division of Insurance.

The plaintiff contends that he is entitled to UM benefits under the Encompass policy because (1) he is the victim of a hit-and-run motor vehicle, and (2) the operator of that vehicle has not been identified. We disagree. Under the statutory scheme, the 2010 Honda is properly characterized as an insured motor vehicle, which precludes UM benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The policy language at issue here, \"Part 3. Bodily Injury Caused By An Uninsured Auto,\" states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Sometimes an owner or operator of an auto legally responsible for an accident is uninsured. Some accidents involve unidentified hit-and-run autos. Under this Part, we will pay damages for bodily injury to people injured or killed in certain accidents caused by uninsured or hit-and-run autos. We will pay only if the injured person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of the uninsured or hit-and-run auto. We will pay for hit-and-run accidents only if the owner or operator causing the accident cannot be identified.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff highlights the last sentence in this paragraph, and contends that, because the operator of the 2010 Honda has not been identified, UM benefits are triggered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, we are not permitted to read the policy language in a vacuum. The policy is controlled by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, and thus, we must look to that statute for guidance. See\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The statute says, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"No policy shall be issued or delivered in the commonwealth with respect to a motor vehicle ... unless such policy provides coverage in amounts or limits prescribed for bodily injury or death for a liability policy under this chapter ... for the protection of persons issued thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles ... and hit-and-run motor vehicles because of bodily injury....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L(1), as appearing in St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 46. The Supreme Judicial Court has held that as a predicate for bringing a claim for UM benefits under this language, the motor vehicle responsible for the accident must be uninsured. See\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Safety Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"47302\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/439/309/#p313\">\n    439 Mass. at 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ordinarily, hit-and-run accidents involve an offending vehicle that fled the scene without being identified and, therefore, is considered uninsured under the standard policy. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Gabriel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Premier Ins. Co. of Mass.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2822740\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/1026/#p1026\">\n    445 Mass. 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1026 (2006).

Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 316 (noting that hit-and-run vehicles are unidentified by \"nature\"). Here, by contrast, the responsible vehicle has been identified as the 2010 Honda owned by Carnevale and insured by Allstate. Thus, the vehicle is not an \"unidentified hit-and-run auto,\" as contemplated in the standard policy, but rather it is an insured motor vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, UM benefits are not triggered under the statutory scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 313.
