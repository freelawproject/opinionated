The parties raise multiple issues, but we find one dispositive-whether Father was contributorily negligent in his son's death. Finding that he was, and that as a result both parents are barred from recovering\n   from these governmental entities, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [2] On September 15, 2014, Father was at the family home with his son, Kinser, and Kyra, the parents' seven-year-old daughter; Mother was at work. Father worked from home in his garage and usually had Kinser secured in a play area in the garage while he worked. On the afternoon in question, Father intended to do some work that might have been dangerous for Kinser had he been in the garage. Therefore, after Kyra came home from school, Father removed Kinser from the garage and took him into the house, leaving him there with Kyra. Father left the house and garage doors open so that he could maintain a line of sight and hear what the children were doing; he also physically checked on the children approximately every ten minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [3] At some point that evening, about ten minutes after his previous check of the children, Father went into the house to check on them again. Kinser was not in the play area. Father ran through the house looking for Kinser for about one and one-half minutes. He then went outside, where he found Kinser floating in the family's swimming pool, unresponsive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [4] Father took Kinser out of the water and called 911, which is operated by the Sheriff's Department. During the call, Father repeatedly requested guidance for conducting CPR on his son. He was not given any guidance until approximately three minutes into the call and it is alleged that the guidance he was ultimately given was faulty. The Fire Department was dispatched to the scene. Firefighters and paramedics employed by the Fire Department arrived at the home and continued CPR, remaining onsite for about seven minutes before transporting Kinser to a hospital. The parents claim that the treatment provided by the Fire Department employees was negligent. Kinser was later pronounced dead at the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [5] On January 7, 2015, the parents provided a Tort Claim notice to the Fire Department and the Sheriff's Department under the Indiana Tort Claim Act (ITCA). The Tort Claim notice listed Mother and Father as \"parents and best friends\" of Kinser and \"demand[ed] compensation commensurate with the child's damages.\" Appellants' App. Vol. III p. 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [6] On September 8, 2015, the parents filed a complaint against the Fire Department and the Sheriff's Department, raising the following claims sounding in negligence: (1) failure to train emergency operators or inadequate training and supervision against the Sheriff's Department; (2) failure to follow protocol against both defendants; (3) negligence against both defendants; and (4) negligent infliction of emotional distress against both defendants. Appellants' App. Vol. VII p. 107-112.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [7] On June 8, 2016, the Sheriff's Department filed a motion for summary judgment, and on January 31, 2017, the Fire Department filed a motion for summary judgment. The parents opposed both motions. Following briefing and a hearing, the trial court granted both summary judgment motions on July 28, 2017. Among other things, the trial court found that the parents' own contributory negligence barred their recovery. The parents now appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Discussion and Decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [8] Our standard of review on summary judgment is well established:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of making a prima facie showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\n   matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

Once these two requirements are met by the moving party, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to show the existence of a genuine issue by setting forth specifically designated facts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7103956\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/980/277/#p285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Any doubt as to any facts or inferences to be drawn therefrom must be resolved in favor of the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7103956\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/980/277/#p285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Summary judgment should be granted only if the evidence sanctioned by Indiana Trial Rule 56(C) shows there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party deserves judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Freidline v.

But we find one to be dispositive: whether the parents' own contributory negligence operates as a bar to their recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [10] As our Supreme Court has noted, \"[i]n 1986, the General Assembly altered Indiana's common law by adopting comparative fault as the general rule for negligence actions.\"\n   <em>\n    McSwane v.

The legislature specifically excluded certain claims from this alteration, including tort claims against governmental entities or public employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-51-2-2\">\n    Ind.

For such claims, \"[a] plaintiff's contributory negligence operates as a complete bar to recovery.\"\n   <em>\n    McSwane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7236299,7236389\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/916/906/\">\n    916 N.E.2d at 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under contributory negligence, \"a claimant whose own negligence was even slightly causal is barred from recovery.

While this is undeniably true, it is also inapposite.

Parent and Child \u00a7 46 ). In the case before us, although the parents correctly point out that there are multiple issues of fact that are in dispute, the following facts are undisputed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Father is Kinser's parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 At the time of Kinser's death, Father was the only adult custodian present in the home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Father put fifteen-month-old Kinser inside the house with seven-year-old Kyra while Father remained out in the garage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Father did not ensure that the children had no access to the family's swimming pool.

As such, he is barred from any recovery on these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [13] As to Mother, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has considered whether (under Indiana law) one parent's contributory negligence leading to a child's injuries operates as a bar to recovery by the other parent.\n   <em>\n    Gillam v.
