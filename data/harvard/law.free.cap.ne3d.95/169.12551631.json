Lafayette Police Officer Matthew Meeks attempted to stop VanWienen's vehicle for failure to have a license plate light. VanWienen did not stop the vehicle for approximately four blocks, and Officer Meeks could see the passenger, Yoakum, making \"furtive\" movements in the car. Tr. Vol. II p. 32. As soon as the vehicle stopped, Yoakum opened the passenger door, and Officer Meeks yelled at him to get back inside the vehicle. When another officer arrived, they ordered Yoakum to get out of the vehicle, and he refused. The officers removed Yoakum from the vehicle and found \"spice\" on the passenger's seat, on the passenger floorboard, and on Yoakum's pants. The officers also found a ripped plastic baggie containing \"spice\" and a glass pipe behind the passenger seat that tested positive for\n   methamphetamine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. VanWienen was arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [4] The State charged Yoakum with Class A misdemeanor possession of a synthetic drug or synthetic drug lookalike substance and Class C misdemeanor possession of paraphernalia. At his jury trial, Yoakum testified that the drugs belonged to VanWienen, not him. Specifically, he testified, \"[N]one of the drugs that were found in the car belonged to me.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101. During closing arguments, Yoakum's attorney again argued that the drugs and pipe belonged to VanWienen. His attorney also stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Also with respect to the spice one thing I found kind of disturbing I wrote it down as soon as heard it because I couldn't believe it that any type of plant material and any type of chemical can be essentially illegal in spice which I find kind of disturbing; I don't dispute that this is spice in this case it just disputes the fact that of who had possession of that spice, certainly it was possessing paraphernalia and so that's why we ask you to come back with a verdict of not guilty[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119. The jury found Yoakum guilty as charged. The trial court sentenced him to concurrent sentences of 365 days for the Class A misdemeanor conviction and sixty days for the Class C misdemeanor conviction. Yoakum now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Vagueness\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [5] Yoakum argues that Indiana Code Section 35-48-4-11.5, which criminalizes possession of a synthetic drug or synthetic drug lookalike substance, and Indiana Code Section 35-31.5-2-321.5, which defines a synthetic drug lookalike substance, are unconstitutionally vague. However, as the State points out, Yoakum \"does not make any argument that Section 35-48-4-11.5 is unconstitutionally vague in and of itself.\" Appellee's Br. p. 17. Rather, Yoakum argues only that the definition in Indiana Code Section 35-31.5-2-321.5 is \"unconstitutionally vague, thereby creating a derivative problem\" for Indiana Code Section 35-48-4-11.5.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [6] Whether a statute is unconstitutional is a question of law and is reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

Although Yoakum raises both prongs, most of his argument seems to focus on the second prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [7] Yoakum did not raise this issue to the trial court. \"Generally, the failure to file a proper motion to dismiss raising the Constitutional challenge waives the issue on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Payne v.

However, whether the substance found in VanWienen's vehicle was spice was not at issue during this trial. Yoakum admitted that the drugs found in the vehicle were spice. The only issue here was whether the drugs belonged to Yoakum or VanWienen. Applied to the precise circumstances of this case, the statute is not void for vagueness. Yoakum has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the statute is unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

He testified that he knew from experience and the smell that the substance was spice because he quickly got a headache, which he usually gets from exposure to the chemicals in spice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He testified that spice is a \"synthetic marijuana\" and that it has a \"bitter chemically smell\" that is distinct from marijuana.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [14] At the trial, Yoakum also testified and claimed that the drugs belonged to VanWienen, not him.

They further testified that the substance's appearance and smell was consistent with spice and that some of it was packaged in a ripped baggie. During his testimony, Yoakum did not dispute that the substance was spice, and during closing argument, his attorney did not dispute that it was spice. We conclude that the State presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Yoakum knowingly or intentionally possessed a synthetic drug lookalike substance.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7218707\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/926/1023/#p1025\">\n    926 N.E.2d 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1025 (Ind. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   [19] The trial court here imposed a one-year sentence for Yoakum's Class A misdemeanor conviction and a concurrent sixty-day sentence for the Class C misdemeanor conviction. Under Indiana Code Section 35-50-3-2, a person convicted of a Class A misdemeanor \"shall be imprisoned for a fixed term of not more than one (1) year....\" Indiana Code Section 35-50-3-4 provides for a fixed term of not more than sixty days for a Class C misdemeanor conviction. Yoakum argues that he inappropriately received the maximum sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [20] Regarding the nature of the offense, Yoakum argues that he was found with a small amount of the \"leafy substance.\" Appellant's Br. p. 18. The State presented evidence that Yoakum possessed spice and a pipe that field-tested positive for methamphetamine. When he attempted to stop the vehicle, the officer saw Yoakum moving around in the passenger seat. In the vehicle, officers found a ripped baggie containing a small amount of spice, and spice was scattered on the passenger seat and floorboard. The officers also found spice sticking to Yoakum's pants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   [21] As for Yoakum's character, fifty-four-year-old Yoakum has amassed a substantial criminal history. He has five prior felony convictions for operating while intoxicated, dealing marijuana, maintaining a common nuisance, conspiracy to deal cocaine, and escape. He also has seven misdemeanor convictions for operating while intoxicated, battery (three times), public intoxication, and disorderly conduct. Yoakum argues that the vast majority of his criminal offenses were committed decades before the instant offense. However, his probation was revoked four times since 2005, and he has failed to take advantage of multiple substance abuse treatment opportunities that were provided to him at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   [22] We acknowledge that Yoakum's offense is not egregious. However, his criminal history and failure to correct his behavior certainly justified the sentence imposed by the trial court. Given Yoakum's criminal history, we cannot say that the one-year sentence is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   [23] Yoakum has failed to demonstrate that the synthetic drug lookalike substance statutes are unconstitutionally vague as applied in this case. The evidence is sufficient to sustain his conviction for Class A misdemeanor possession of a synthetic drug or synthetic drug lookalike substance, and we cannot say that his sentence is inappropriate. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   [24] Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Najam, J., and Mathias, J., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
