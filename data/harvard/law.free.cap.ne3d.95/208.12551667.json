On July 28, 2015, Appellees Jane and Gary Jones filed suit against a number of parties, including DLC Landscape and Snow Removal, Inc. (\"DLC Landscape\"), alleging that Jane was injured when she slipped and fell on a patch of ice outside of a grocery store in February of 2014. Argonaut first learned of Jane's fall on February 1, 2016, when the insurance company representing two of the parties sued by Jane and Gary contacted Argonaut and demanded a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [2] On August 17, 2016, Argonaut filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling as to whether DLC Landscape was an insured under DLC Services's insurance policy. Argonaut filed a motion for summary judgment on the issue of coverage. This interlocutory appeal follows the trial court's denial of Argonaut's motion for summary judgment. Because we conclude that Argonaut was entitled to summary judgment on the question of coverage, we reverse the trial court's order and remand to the trial court with instructions for the trial court to enter summary judgment in favor of Argonaut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [3] The facts, as alleged before the trial court, provide as follows: Jane was injured on February 15, 2014, when she slipped and fell on a patch of ice in a grocery store parking lot. Thereafter, on July 28, 2015, Jane and Gary initiated a lawsuit (\"the Jones lawsuit\") against Appellees Wiseway Super Food Center, Inc. (\"Wiseway\"); Gateway Arthur, Inc.; Emmes Realty Services, LLC (\"Emmes\"); and DLC Landscape (collectively \"the Jones lawsuit Defendants\"), alleging that as a result of her fall on February 15, 2014, Jane suffered injuries which were caused by their negligence. Jane and Gary further alleged that Wiseway owns and operates the grocery store in question, Gateway Arthur owns the shopping center where the grocery store is located, Emmes is the management company for the shopping center where the grocery store is located, and DLC Landscape is the snow removal company responsible for clearing the shopping center's parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [4] Again, at all times relevant to the underlying matter, Argonaut provided insurance coverage for DLC Services. Argonaut first learned of Jane's fall, her alleged injuries, and the Jones lawsuit on February 1, 2016, when representatives of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, which represented both Gateway Arthur and Emmes, contacted Argonaut and demanded a defense. After being informed of the Jones lawsuit, Argonaut initiated a declaratory judgment action against DLC Services. In this action, Argonaut sought a ruling as to whether DLC Landscape was an insured under DLC Services's insurance policy. On November 17, 2016, the trial court consolidated Argonaut's declaratory judgment action and the Jones lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [5] Argonaut subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that no genuine issue of material fact remains as to the issue of coverage because (1) the parties to the Jones lawsuit are not insureds under DLC Services's insurance policy and (2) DLC Services did not comply with the policy's notice and cooperation provisions. Following briefing and arguments by the parties, the trial court denied Argonaut's motion for summary judgment and certified its order for interlocutory appeal. On June 30, 2017, we accepted jurisdiction over the case and this interlocutory appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Discussion and Decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [6] Argonaut contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment. In raising this contention, Argonaut claims that it was entitled to summary judgment for the following reasons: (1) DLC Services failed to provide it with timely notice of the alleged occurrence, (2) DLC Services failed to cooperate with the investigation into the alleged occurrence, and (3) DCL Landscaping &amp; Snow Removal, Gateway Arthur, and Emmes are not insureds under the insurance contract at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I.

Unreasonable Delay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [13] Our first task to determine whether the notice of the incident and the Jones lawsuit received by Argonaut was unreasonably delayed. Jane was allegedly injured on February 15, 2014, when she slipped and fell on a patch of ice in the parking lot of a shopping center operated by Gateway Arthur and Emmes. Subsequently, Jane and Gary filed the Jones lawsuit on July 28, 2015. Argonaut's insured, DLC Services, never notified Argonaut of either Jane's fall or the Jones lawsuit. In fact, Argonaut was not notified of either Jane's fall or of the Jones lawsuit until February 1, 2016, when representatives of Gateway Arthur's and Emmes's insurance company notified Argonaut. Stated differently, Argonaut was not notified of Jane's fall and alleged injuries for nearly two years after the fall occurred and nearly six months after the Jones lawsuit was filed. These delays in providing notice of Jane's fall and alleged injuries to Argonaut are unreasonable as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See generally,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11032176\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/463/257/#p265\">\n    463 N.E.2d at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ordering that summary judgment be entered in favor of an insurance company after the insured failed to give the insurer notice of the accident giving rise to liability six months after the occurrence and ten days after the lawsuit was filed);\n   <em>\n    Askren Hub\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11490626\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/721/270/#p277\">\n    721 N.E.2d at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing that a delay of six months before notifying the insurer of an \"occurrence\" constitutes unreasonable notice). Because we conclude that Argonaut did not receive timely notice of Jane's fall and alleged injuries, we must next consider whether Argonaut was prejudiced by the unreasonable delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Prejudice\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [14] The next question is whether Argonaut suffered prejudice as a result of the delay. Consistent with the above-discussed authority, we presume that Argonaut suffered prejudice from the delayed notice unless and until Gateway Arthur and Emmes come forward with evidence to rebut this presumption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11032176\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/463/257/#p265\">\n    463 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   265 ;\n   <em>\n    Ind.

As to notice, Gateway Arthur and Emmes argued during summary judgment proceedings that \"investigation of [Jane's] claim by the other insurers and defendants in the case has thus far more than adequately protected any separate interests Argonaut had; all relevant evidence has been preserved to the extent possible, and the depositions in this case remain to be taken.\" Appellant's App. Vol. II, p. 204. Gateway Arthur and Emmes, however, did not designate any evidence to support these arguments. In addition, Gateway Arthur and Emmes did not designate any other evidence to rebut the presumption of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [15] In addition, assuming that other entities had the opportunity to complete an investigation into Jane's claims soon, if not immediately, after the date of Jane's fall, Argonaut was not given the opportunity to do so because it was not timely notified of the incident. The lack of timely notice resulted in a presumption of prejudice which Gateway Arthur and Emmes failed to adequately rebut. We therefore conclude that no issue of material fact remains and summary judgment should have been granted in Argonaut's favor because none of the claimed insureds complied with the notice provisions contained within the insurance policy in question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand to the trial court with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of Argonaut on the question of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [16] The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the matter remanded with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   May, J., and Barnes, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Because we decide that Argonaut was entitled to summary judgment on the question of coverage because of a failure to provide timely notice of the \"occurrence\" and the Jones lawsuit, we need not consider whether coverage existed on any of the other theories argued by the parties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
