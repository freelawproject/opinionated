The cases involve Teal's physical assault of a woman and subsequent threats he made to her while awaiting trial. Following a bench trial before the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Teal was convicted in both cases. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The following evidence was offered at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Teal and the victim, \"S.C.,\" met in 2011. After they met, the victim began renting a \"fixer-upper\" home from Teal's aunt in Lambertville, Michigan. Teal lived down the street and was supposed to be renovating the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The victim operated an internet-based business out of her home, and Teal worked for the business sporadically. Sometime in 2012, their relationship became romantic, but it was troubled from the start.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The victim described one aberrant act after another by Teal: that he would come over, uninvited, ostensibly to work, but would instead watch her; that he twice broke into her house at night, and one time she awoke to find him crawling on her floor; that he hacked into her Facebook and Verizon accounts, making it look as though she was sending messages to other people; that he installed spyware on her devices so that he could track her whereabouts; that he would show up at places shortly after she did and then refuse to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In the summer of 2013, the victim said that Teal began \"full blown terrorizing\" her, which included \"hitting,\" \"smacking\" and \"shoving\" the victim. Teal also tracked a male friend of the victim's; he frequently called the victim a \"whore.\" He blackmailed her, telling her that he \"would destroy\" her by revealing personal information\n   about her to her parents. The victim reported Teal's behavior to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Teal's increasingly violent behavior caused the victim to move to an apartment in Toledo, Ohio. On December 18, 2013, Teal went, uninvited, to the victim's home. The victim testified that she repeatedly told him to leave. At one point, Teal advanced toward her, and she pushed him away and spat in his face. Teal then punched the victim in the face, causing her to spin and fall to the floor. Teal took the victim's cell phone and keys and fled the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Within minutes, Teal returned, at which point the victim activated the recorder on her phone. An 11 minute audiotape was received as an exhibit and played for the court. It memorialized what occurred next:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The victim can be heard crying, pleading and yelling. The audio reveals that the victim told Teal to \"get out\" 10 times; to \"just go\" 13 times; \"I don't want you touching me\" 7 times; and \"please get off of me\" 6 times. Teal can be heard saying \"sh h h h h\" during many of these pleas. The victim testified that she was held down on the couch, unable to move except to turn her head. At some point, the victim bit and slapped Teal. She also told him that he was a \"failure and a loser.\" At that point, Teal punched her with both of his closed fists, \"over and over again, and again and again\" as the victim begged him to stop. The victim bled profusely and threw up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} When the beating was over, Teal can be heard saying, repeatedly, \"Tonight I am going to die\" and \"I'm going to kill myself tonight,\" which the victim took as a sign that he was going to kill her and then commit suicide. Instead, Teal left and drove away. The victim was treated for a broken nose and a cut near her eye, which resulted in a scar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On January 2, 2014, a Lucas County, Ohio grand jury indicted Teal on one count of felonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1)(D), a felony of the second degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Teal fled out of state, but returned after Christmas. Despite a \"no contact order,\" prohibiting him from having any contact with the victim, Teal continued to communicate with her via Skype, Facebook, text and phone. Teal told her that she did not need to cooperate with the prosecution and threatened to \"destroy her\" if she did. Teal proposed marriage, offered to pay her, and showed her homes for sale to convince her to move in with him. Teal sent the victim an audio recording in which he told his children that he was going to have to go away for a long time. Again, he threatened to divulge personal information about the victim in an effort to hurt her business and personal relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On June 24, 2015, Teal was indicted in a second case, for one count of menacing by stalking, in violation of R.C. 2903.211(A)(1)(B)(2)(E), a felony of the fourth degree and one count of intimidation of attorney, victim or witness in a criminal case, in violation of R.C. 2921.04(B), a felony of the third degree. The cases were consolidated, and a bench trial was held in September of 2015. The trial court found Teal guilty of felonious assault and intimidation. It sentenced him to serve 6 years and 24 months, as to the respective convictions. The court found him not guilty of menacing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Teal was appointed appellate counsel and asserts six assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1. The trial court erred to the prejudice of Appellant by improperly allowing\n   Evid.R. 404(B) evidence to be introduced by the state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   2. Appellant received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 10 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   3. The trial court committed error to the prejudice of Appellant by imposing the costs of prosecution without consideration of Appellant's present or future ability to pay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   4. The trial court did not comply with the directives of R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 in sentencing Appellant to eight years in the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   5. The trial court abused its discretion and erred to the prejudice of Appellant by not convicting Appellant of aggravated assault, the inferior degree offense of felonious assault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   6. The trial court's verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence presented at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Evidence of \"Prior Bad Acts\" Under Evid.R. 404(B)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In his first assignment of error, Teal argues that the trial court erred in allowing the state to introduce testimony from three witnesses: Teal's former wife, an ex-girlfriend, and the ex-girlfriend's daughter. They testified about two incidents, both in 2008, when Teal broke into their respective homes, with a knife/box cutter, caused mayhem, and then threatened suicide. Teal argues that the testimony was impermissible evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts, in contravention of Evid.R. 404(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"The admission of such [other-acts] evidence lies within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a reviewing court should not disturb evidentiary decisions in the absence of an abuse of discretion that created material prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

As set forth in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , in considering other acts evidence, trial courts should conduct a three-step analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The first step is to consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without\n   the evidence. Evid.R. 401. The next step is to consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in conformity therewith or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B). The third step is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 403.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The state offered the testimony of three witnesses: Teal's ex-wife, \"T.T.,\" Teal's ex-girlfriend, (\"L.E.\"), and the girlfriend's daughter (\"J.K.\"). Specifically, T.T. testified that, after their divorce, Teal broke into her home and hid in the shower with a knife. He came within two to three feet of T.T., but did not cut her. Teal did, however, cut himself in a failed suicide attempt. T.T. also testified that Teal choked her father, causing her father's face to turn blue. He also violated a \"no-contact\" order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 20} An ex-girlfriend's daughter, J.K., described an incident, following her mother's break-up from Teal. She discovered Teal hiding in a guest bedroom closet at night. He gained access to the home by breaking a window, and when discovered, he shoved J.K. out of the way, causing J.K. to fall, as Teal \"tried to get her\" mother. Teal was ordered to have \"no contact\" with L.E., which he violated in person and by phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Teal was charged and convicted following both home invasions, and records from those criminal cases were received into evidence. The records show that Teal was sentenced to prison on January 28, 2009, as to two counts of home invasion, third degree and one count of fleeing and eluding a police officer, fourth degree by the 38th Circuit Court in Monroe, Michigan. He was released onto parole on September 9, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Teal argues that the testimony was \"unrelated\" to the charges in the instant case and was too remote in time. He argues that, even if relevant, the probative value of the testimony was substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice and therefore it should have been excluded by the court under Evid.R. 403(A). He adds that, without such testimony, \"the remaining evidence [against him] is primarily the victim's testimony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The state counters that the evidence was offered for the purpose of demonstrating Teal's history of violence, an element of the menacing by stalking charge. Pursuant to R.C. 2903.211(A)(1), the state was required to show that Teal, \"by engaging in a pattern of conduct,\" knowingly caused the victim to believe that he would cause her physical harm or mental distress. To elevate the menacing by stalking offense to a fourth-degree felony, the state was required to show that Teal had a \"history of violence toward the victim or any other person or a history of other violent acts toward the victim\n   <em>\n    or any other person\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2903.211(B)(2)(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We agree with the state that the testimony was admissible for the purpose of demonstrating Teal's history of violent acts; it was not inadmissible character evidence under Evid.R. 404(B).\n   <em>\n    State v.

We find that the record supports the trial court's determination. Teal is currently 48 years old, with plenty of working years remaining once he is released from prison. Also, Teal holds a Class A commercial driver's license and has extensive remodeling and information technology (\"IT\") skills, making him employable in a variety of fields. At the September 28, 2015 sentencing hearing, Teal's attorney represented to the court that he had a job \"waiting for him,\" such that if fines or costs were imposed, Teal \"will have the capacity to get that done.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 42} We find that there was evidence in the record to support the court's conclusion that Teal has, or will have, the ability\n   to pay the costs of confinement and appointed counsel.

He argues, however, that the lower court failed to consider the victim's intoxication and provocation as being contributory factors, which Teal argues, should be considered mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.12(C).

This is because the trier of fact is in the best position to \"view the witnesses and observe the credibility of the proffered testimony.\" (Quotation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 22.

In addition, there were medical records, other recordings, phone calls, photos, text messages, Facebook posts and screenshots. Appellant immediately fled after the felonious assault and apologized to the victim, both of which demonstrate his consciousness of guilt. Teal also never denied that he caused the victim serious physical harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 60} As to the intimidation charge, Teal sent text messages in which he attempted to persuade the victim not to cooperate with the prosecution. On the one hand, he offered her money, sent her gifts, proposed marriage, and offered to buy her a house, while on the other hand he threatened\n   to ruin her business and family relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the verdict, and that the trial court did not lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice. We find that the verdict is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Teal's sixth assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Teal is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Mark L.
