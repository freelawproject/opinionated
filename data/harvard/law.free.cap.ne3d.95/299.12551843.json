L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, to annul the decision of the zoning board of appeals (board) for the town of Charlton (town), which granted variances to Joseph and Molly Lloyd for a retaining wall and a catwalk on their property (parcel). On cross motions for summary judgment, the motion judge allowed the Lloyds' motion and denied the plaintiff's motion. On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the motion judge erred because the board's decision is invalid on its face. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . Following construction of the Lloyds' home on the parcel, the plaintiff (whose property abuts the parcel) discovered that their newly constructed retaining wall encroached upon the five-foot sideyard setback requirement of the town's zoning by-law. The plaintiff complained to the board and, in response, the Lloyds petitioned the board, requesting a variance for the retaining wall, which also served as a parking area. The Lloyds further requested a variance from the thirty-foot frontyard setback requirement in order to construct a catwalk from the home to the retaining wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The board viewed the parcel and held a public hearing. Following the hearing, the board voted unanimously to grant the Lloyds' petition, and issued findings, which are discussed further\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

With regard to the first and the second required statutory findings, the board set forth the words of the statute and then stated that the retaining wall and the catwalk \"cannot be built without a [v]ariance because of the location on [the] property,\" that \"a variance is needed,\" and that \"it will be in complete conformity with the neighborhood.\" In addition to being vague to the point of having virtually no meaning, none of these explanations relates to the \"soil condition, shape or topography\" of the parcel or any unique aspects of the parcel that do not \"affect[ ] generally the zoning district\" of the parcel, as required by the first statutory prerequisite; and none relates to any hardship to the Lloyds, as required by the second statutory prerequisite. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10. With regard to the fourth required finding, the board merely stated that the variance will not derogate from the purpose of the zoning by-law because it \"will address the needs of the home owner.\" By definition, a variance sought by a homeowner will address his or her stated need. However, satisfying the needs of the homeowner is not a finding that the variance will not derogate from the purpose of the by-law. Absent further explanation, this finding was insufficient. The board's findings on these three statutory requirements constitute no more than a \"bare recital of the statutory conditions\" and, thus, are legally deficient.\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).

In an appeal from a decision of a zoning board of appeals, the burden of proof is always on the party seeking the variance, here the Lloyds. Thus, when a variance has been denied, the party seeking the variance has the burden to show that the board denied the variance on a \"legally untenable ground ... or because the decision was arbitrary and capricious,\"\n    <em>\n     Geryk\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Zoning Appeals Bd. of Easthampton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960082\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/8/683/#p684\">\n     8 Mass.
