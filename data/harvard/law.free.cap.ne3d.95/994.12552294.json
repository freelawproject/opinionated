Gordon, appeals from his convictions in the\n   Summit County Court of Common Pleas. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} A rash of break-ins and thefts troubled several local businesses beginning in November of 2015. Property was vandalized and destroyed while scrap metal and a Mazda3 sedan were stolen. Some of the scrap metal was identified at a local scrap yard as being sold by a man who had used the identification of Mr. Uzodinma Onuora and had driven the stolen Mazda3. On Christmas Day of 2015, a police officer recognized the stolen Mazda3 in a parking lot and arrested Mr. Gordon as the sole occupant of the vehicle. He was indicted on charges of receiving stolen property and possession of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} More break-ins at businesses occurred in March and April of 2016, where property was damaged and scrap metal was stolen. Some of the more unique pieces of stolen scrap metal were identified at a local scrap yard and had been sold there by Mr. Ronald Roatsey. Mr. Roatsey told police that he had been paid by a man named \"L\" to sell scrap metal there for him on several occasions. The police tracked \"L\" to his girlfriend's apartment complex and knocked on the door, but no one answered. Mr. Gordon peeked out the back door, but slammed it shut once he saw an officer outside. He attempted to hide in another resident's apartment, but the resident soon led police inside to find Mr. Gordon. As he attempted to escape through a window, Mr. Gordon struggled with an officer and the window glass shattered. He was handcuffed and arrested. The police found Mr. Gordon's identification in his wallet and a detective recognized the name as that of the individual charged in the stolen Mazda3 case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} A supplemental indictment was filed and, following a jury trial, Mr. Gordon was found guilty of receiving stolen property, to wit: the Mazda3, obstructing official business, identity fraud, and two counts of receiving stolen property, to wit: special purchase articles. The jury found him not guilty of nine other charges. The possession of marijuana charge was tried to the court and Mr. Gordon was found guilty of that offense. He was sentenced to a total of fifty-nine months in prison. No fine was imposed for possession of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Mr. Gordon now appeals from his convictions and raises four assignments of error for this Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR ONE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT FOUND MR.

R.C. 2913.51(C). If the stolen property is a special purchase article, e.g., scrap metal, the offense is a felony of the fifth degree. R.C. 2913.51(D). \"A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\" R.C. 2901.22(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The State presented evidence, if believed, that Mr. Gordon received or retained the Mazda3 either knowing or having reasonable cause to believe it was stolen. The owner of American Glass &amp; Construction testified that, over the long Thanksgiving weekend in 2015, someone broke into his warehouse, vandalized it, and stole scrap metal and his Mazda3 along with its keys. The vehicle's license plate number was GMC-6455.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The owner of United Salvage testified that a man using the identification of Mr. Uzodinma Onuora had been selling scrap metal to the business since May of 2015 and never arrived in a vehicle until December 23, 2015. On that day, the man arrived in a Mazda3 to sell scrap metal. An employee took down the vehicle's license plate number of GMC-6455. The employee picked Mr. Gordon out of a photo array in April of 2016 and was 100% sure that Mr. Gordon was the man driving the Mazda3 on December 23rd. The employee also identified Mr. Gordon in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Akron police officer David Zelenka reviews stolen vehicle lists daily and testified that he was on patrol on Christmas Day of 2015 when he saw the stolen Mazda3 parked in a CVS parking lot. The officer positioned himself behind the vehicle and ordered the sole occupant, Mr. Gordon, out of the vehicle at gunpoint. As Mr. Gordon slowly went to the ground, the officer saw Mr. Gordon throw something, later determined to be the stolen vehicle's keys, under a car parked next to the Mazda3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Mr. Gordon told the officer that a few days ago at a nearby Rally's he paid a younger, black male nicknamed Boogie $250.00 to rent the car for a couple of weeks. He stated that he did not know Boogie's real name or address, but Boogie was in his 20's, slim, with short hair, no facial hair, and no tattoos. He said Boogie could be found on Hazel Street, which Officer Zelenka testified is a long street that \"runs pretty far.\" Mr. Gordon said he did not have any way to contact Boogie, but told the officer that there was an understanding that they would \"[run] into each other.\" Officer Zelenka testified that\n   while talking to Mr. Gordon, \"I got the general sense that he wasn't going to give me specifics.\" The actual owner of the vehicle testified that he had never met Mr. Gordon before and that neither Mr. Gordon nor anyone else had permission to use his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Mr. Gordon argues that the State introduced no evidence indicating that he knew or should have known the Mazda3 was stolen. However, \"[p]ossession of recently stolen property, if not\n   <em>\n    satisfactorily\n   </em>\n   explained, is ordinarily a circumstance from which a jury may reasonably infer and find, in the light of the surrounding circumstances shown by the case, that the person in possession knew that the property had been stolen.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    State v. Warren\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.

We conclude that a jury could have reasonably found that Mr. Gordon either knew or had reasonable cause to believe that the car was stolen given his explanation of how he obtained possession of the car.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. White\n   </em>\n   , 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2002-07-161,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003-Ohio-2011\">\n    2003-Ohio-2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%201908117\">\n    2003 WL 1908117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13-15 (affirming appellant's conviction for receiving stolen property where he claimed he did not know the car was stolen and had rented it for $20.00 from a man in the neighborhood nicknamed \"Slick\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The State also presented evidence, if believed, that Mr. Gordon received, retained, or disposed of scrap metal belonging to World Metal. The owner of World Metal testified that over $100,000.00 in damage was done and scrap metal was stolen from his business during many break-ins throughout March and April of 2016. One morning, the owner interrupted the thief, but he ran and hid before the owner or police could find him. The owner found tools, equipment, and scrap metal stashed by the thief, which someone secretly retrieved later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The owner also had two other encounters with an individual or individuals on World Metal's property. He saw a person wearing a brown hoodie pulled tight around his head walking inside of a fenced storage area and confronted him. The man said he was \"just cutting through[,]\" jumped a fence, and ran away. An hour or so later, the owner saw either the same individual or another individual walking on the sidewalk and studying the fence line. The man stopped by an area of the chain link fence that had been cut beforehand and reached down to pick up a bag of scrap metal that had been stashed there. When confronted by the owner, the man fled. The owner tried but was unable to identify the man in the brown hoodie in three separate photo arrays. However, he testified that when Mr. Gordon walked by him in the courthouse that morning, he immediately recognized him as the second individual who tried to retrieve the bag of stolen scrap metal that was stashed by the cut fence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Mr. Gordon argues that at no time was he identified as possessing any stolen scrap metal or selling it to PSC Metals. However, the State did not proceed at trial on a theory that Mr. Gordon sold scrap metal directly to PSC Metals. The State proceeded on the theory that Mr. Gordon paid Mr. Ronald Roatsey to sell stolen scrap metal to PSC Metals for him on multiple occasions. \"The identity of a perpetrator must be proved by the State beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 28192,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-635\">\n    2017-Ohio-635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20710251\">\n    2017 WL 710251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7. \"[I]dentity may be established through direct or circumstantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20710251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Mr. Roatsey identified Mr. Gordon in court and testified that he met Mr. Gordon on March 30, 2016. Mr. Gordon\n   identified himself as \"L\" and asked Mr. Roatsey if he had an ID and would like to make $10-$15. Mr. Gordon had a city trash can full of scrap metal and asked Mr. Roatsey to turn it in for him at a scrap yard. Mr. Roatsey testified that he and Mr. Gordon went to PSC Metals together and Mr. Roatsey sold Mr. Gordon's scrap metal for him. He sold more scrap metal for Mr. Gordon on multiple occasions thereafter for $10-$15 each time and Mr. Gordon sometimes accompanied him to the scrap yard. Mr. Roatsey identified Mr. Gordon in two surveillance pictures taken at PSC Metals as the man standing near him wearing a gray hoodie with red and black stripes on both March 30, 2016, and April 1, 2016. The owner of World Metal was able to identify unique copper bars that were stolen from transformers at World Metal and sold to PSC Metals by Mr. Roatsey. We conclude that a jury could have reasonably found that Mr. Gordon possessed stolen scrap metal and paid Mr. Roatsey to sell his stolen scrap metal to PSC Metals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Obstructing Official Business\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Mr. Gordon was convicted of obstructing official business under R.C. 2921.31(A), which states \"[n]o person, without privilege to do so and with purpose to prevent, obstruct, or delay the performance by a public official of any authorized act within the public official's official capacity, shall do any act that hampers or impedes a public official in the performance of the public official's lawful duties.\" \"If a violation of this section creates a risk of physical harm to any person, obstructing official business is a felony of the fifth degree.\" R.C. 2921.31(B). \"A person acts purposely when it is the person's specific intention to cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is the offender's specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature.\" R.C. 2901.22(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The State presented evidence, if believed, that Mr. Gordon purposely prevented, obstructed, or delayed the police officers' investigation by attempting to flee from them, which hampered or impeded their duties and created a risk of physical harm to people in the area. After talking to Mr. Roatsey, police officers tracked \"L\" to a nearby Burger King. Officer Douglas Matson testified that officers reviewed surveillance video at the restaurant, obtained a picture of \"L,\" and learned that the suspect's girlfriend lived in an apartment complex on East Buchtel Avenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Detective Bassett testified that he knocked on the apartment door and identified himself. Detective Bassett, Detective Welser, and Officer Bodnar all testified that they heard movement inside and could see shadows of movement in the large gap underneath the door. While they knocked on the front door, Officer Matson went around to the back of the apartment complex. He testified that Mr. Gordon peeked out the back door and looked around. The officer recognized Mr. Gordon as \"L\" from the Burger King surveillance video. Mr. Gordon was wearing the same coat that \"L\" wore in the Burger King surveillance video, which Officer Mason described as \"darker * * * [with] red-I don't want to say pin-striping, but it kind of reminds me of Spider[-]man. It wasn't real blatantly clear until you got up close to it and see exactly the design.\" Once Mr. Gordon saw the officer, he slammed the door shut and went back inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The resident of another apartment in the building testified that Mr. Gordon knocked on his door in a panic and said, \"Help me. Hide me.\" The moment the resident opened his door, Mr. Gordon quickly brushed by him into the apartment\n   without permission. Officer Matson testified that the resident came outside and told him that the guy they were looking for just knocked on his door. He told police, \"I opened the door. He just rushed right past me and into my apartment. He's in there. Can you go get him? I don't want him in my apartment.\" Officer Matson testified that running into someone else's private apartment puts people at risk of bodily harm. He further testified that he had a little bit of hesitation going into the apartment after Mr. Gordon because he didn't know what was going on inside or if someone was possibly armed and going to ambush him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Officer Matson entered the resident's apartment and intercepted Mr. Gordon as he tried to flee through a bedroom window. The officer testified that he \"yelled for him to come back in, get back in\" and Mr. Gordon did not comply. \"The affirmative act of running from an officer impedes or hinders the performance of an officer's lawful duty.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The window glass shattered during a brief struggle between the two men before the officer arrested Mr. Gordon and handcuffed him.

Officer Matson testified that the window glass shattered during his struggle with Mr. Gordon. Mr. Gordon argues that there is no evidence that he intended to shatter the window glass or that anyone was harmed or put in harm's way because of the broken glass. However, whether the broken window was intended or accidental during his attempted flight is inconsequential, as is whether anyone actually suffered physical harm. The State was only required to present evidence that Mr. Gordon's actions created a\n   <em>\n    risk\n   </em>\n   of physical harm to any person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The owner of United Salvage testified that the owner of Eckard Baldwin funeral home identified some scrap metal at United Salvage in December of 2015 as property that had been stolen from the funeral home. United Salvage's records showed that an individual using the identification of Mr. Onuora had sold the stolen scrap metal to United Salvage and had been selling scrap metal there using Mr. Onuora's identification since May of 2015. On December 23, 2015, the man using Mr. Onuora's ID showed up to sell scrap metal in a Mazda3 with the license plate number GMC-6455. The employee identified Mr. Gordon in a photo array in April of 2016 and was 100% sure that Mr. Gordon was the man driving the Mazda3 on December 23rd. He also identified Mr. Gordon in court. Mr. Gordon was arrested by police two days later as the sole occupant of the Mazda3 and told police he had rented it a few days ago. Detective Bassett testified that initial charges against Mr. Onuora were soon dropped because police determined that Mr. Onuora was not in Ohio in December of 2015. We conclude that a jury could have reasonably found that Mr. Gordon used Mr. Onuora's identification to sell scrap metal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Altogether, after reviewing the evidence contained in the record in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that the State satisfied its burden of production and presented sufficient evidence for the case to go to the jury.

As Mr. Gordon could have argued any inaccuracy in the amount in his direct appeal or in a motion for jail-time credit, he has not shown how he has been prejudiced and we therefore decline to notice any plain error here.
