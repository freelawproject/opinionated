David and Brenda Nager (sometimes referred to as homeowners) brought a nine-count complaint against James J. Shiels, Jr., doing business as Shiels General Contracting (Shiels); James Dodd; and his company Dodd Woodworking, Inc. (Woodworking).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a four-day, jury-waived trial, a judge found, largely on agreed facts, in favor of the homeowners on their legal claims related to a radiant floor heating system. Although the judge found in favor of the Nagers on part of their G. L. c. 142A claims, she awarded no damages. The judge rejected the Nagers' G. L. c. 93A claims as well as their principal claims related to the custom kitchen cabinets fabricated and installed by Dodd and Woodworking. Ruling on the Nagers' motion to amend the judgment, the judge made additional findings regarding the wine storage room and denied the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This timely appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We begin by noting that most of the issues raised are not properly before us. The judge based her findings of fact on all the evidence. The Nagers, however, have presented us with only limited excerpts from the trial transcript and what they deemed the relevant trial exhibits. In light of these record inadequacies, we are unable to assess any evidentiary insufficiency arguments. See\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1040734\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/39/81/#p83\">\n    39 Mass. App. Ct. 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83-84 (1995). The judge's factual findings must stand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    R.M. Packer Co\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Marmik, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6779782\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/88/654/\">\n    88 Mass. App. Ct. 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 655 n.2 (2015). Were we to reach the merits, we would conclude that the Nagers have not demonstrated clear error in any findings. See\n   <em>\n    Millennium Equity Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mahlowitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668956\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/456/627/#p636\">\n    456 Mass. 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636-637 (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The judge's rulings of law and conduct at trial are open to review. See\n   <em>\n    Central Ceilings, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Suffolk Constr. Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20231\">\n    91 Mass. App. Ct. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235 (2017). We discern no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   First, the judge did not err by questioning Shiels directly at the trial. Given the Nagers' theory of liability, the judge properly inquired about the percentage fees, if any, Shiels received from Woodworking and from his acknowledged subcontractors. The evidence was relevant to the existence of a subcontractor relationship, a central issue in the case. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hassey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1035588\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/40/806/#p810\">\n    40 Mass. App. Ct. 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 810 (1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In light of the judge's unassailable subsidiary findings and credibility assessments, the Nagers cannot demonstrate error in the judge's conclusion that the Nagers did not prove fraud in the inducement and violations of G. L. c. 142A, \u00a7 17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Notwithstanding the Nagers' success on some of their common-law claims, the judge was not required to find Shiels liable under G. L. c. 93A. The judge found that Shiels genuinely attempted in good faith to resolve the Nagers' problems, and that \"[t]here was absolutely no evidence\" that he engaged in any unfair or deceptive conduct. Although a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing may constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice for purposes of c. 93A, the judge could properly have found that the evidence supporting the breach here did not constitute a violation of G. L. c. 93A. See\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts Employers Ins. Exch\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Propac-Mass., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"826155\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/420/39/#p43\">\n    420 Mass. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43 (1995). The judge was also warranted in rejecting the Nagers' claim that Shiels's minor breach of warranty was a per se violation of c. 93A. See\n   <em>\n    Klairmont\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gainsboro Restaurant, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275295\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/165/#p176\">\n    465 Mass. 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 176-177 (2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hylas Yachts, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263583\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/31/#p49\">\n    872 F.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49-50 (1st Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Shiels's failure to respond to the demand letter does not change the result we reach. At its heart, this case concerned a garden-variety contract dispute. \"[A] good faith dispute as to whether money is owed, or performance of some kind is due, is not the stuff of which a c. 93A claim is made.\"\n   <em>\n    Duclersaint\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Federal Natl. Mort. Assn\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310284\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/809/#p814\">\n    427 Mass. 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 814 (1998).
