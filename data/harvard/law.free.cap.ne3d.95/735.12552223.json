Young [\"Young\"] appeals her OVI and Possession of Drug Abuse Instruments convictions after a jury trial in the Mount Vernon, Knox County, Ohio Municipal Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In the early morning of September 29, 2016, Young encountered Brian Daniel, a security officer at Knox Community Hospital, which is located in the City of Mount Vernon, Ohio. Mr. Daniel received a report of a van with two women inside in a restricted area of the hospital parking lot. Mr. Daniel spoke with Young and then watched her drive away. Based on his concerns from their interaction, he contacted the Mount Vernon Police Department about Young.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} A short time later, officers from the police department found Young blocking the drive-thru lane at Long John Silver's restaurant on Coshocton Avenue in the City of Mount Vernon. Young acted strangely, smelled of alcohol, and appeared to be under the influence of a stimulant. Young admitted to drinking beer, and the police found an opened beer in her vehicle. Officer Jessica Butler asked her to perform field sobriety tests, and Young performed them poorly. Butler arrested Young for OVI. Young requested a breath test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} During a search of Young's person, Butler located crushed pills, which Young identified as Ritalin, a stimulant. Before towing Ms. Young's vehicle from the drive-thru area, Officer Zach Miller conducted an administrative inventory of the vehicle. He found, syringes, a glass pipe with white residue and a glass bowl with white residue, in a bag with a prescription pill bottle belonging to Young.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Officer Butler transported Young to the Knox County Jail. At the jail, Butler read the BMV 2255 to Young and then requested a urine sample. Young declined to provide a urine sample, and she was incarcerated. Upon being placed in the holding cell, Young told the officers that she would take the urine test; however, no test was given to Young. (T. at 190).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Young was charged with Operating A Motor Vehicle Under the Influence of Alcohol and/or a Drug of Abuse a violation of \u00a7 333.01(a)(1)(A) of the Codified\n   Ordinances of the City of Mount Vernon Ohio, Operating A Motor Vehicle Under the Influence of Alcohol and/or a Drug of Abuse and Refusing A Requested Chemical Test, After being Convicted of OVI within the Past Twenty Years a violation of \u00a7 333.01(a)(2) of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Mount Vernon Ohio; Expired Plates a violation of \u00a7 335.10(a) of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Mount Vernon Ohio; Possession of Drug Abuse Instruments a violation of \u00a7 513.04(a) of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Mount Vernon Ohio; Possession of Drug Paraphernalia a violation of \u00a7 513.12(a) of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Mount Vernon Ohio; and Possession of an Open Container of Alcohol in a Motor Vehicle a violation of \u00a7 529.07(b)(4) of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Mount Vernon Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} At trial Young testified that she had admitted to the officers that she had taken her prescribed Ritalin at least nine hours previously, and had taken a sip of alcohol perhaps eight hours before the stop. When the officer asked her to do field sobriety tests, Young told the officer that she could not do them, but did not elaborate. Young explained at trial that she had many problems with her feet that create an inability to balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The trial court dismissed the expired plates charge upon a Rule 29 motion at the end of the state's presentation of evidence. A jury found Young guilty of operating a vehicle while intoxicated under both sections, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of drug abuse instruments, and the court found Young guilty of the minor misdemeanor open container charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court sentenced Young to fifty days incarceration on the drug abuse instruments conviction, thirty days on the drug paraphernalia conviction (both with credit for thirty-five days already served, both sentences to be served concurrently), and $25 and costs on the open container conviction. The trial court merged the two operating a vehicle while intoxicated charges, and sentenced Young to a $700 fine, one hundred eighty days in jail with thirty five days credit concurrent to the other sentences and one hundred thirty days suspended, a two year license suspension with limited driving privileges, ninety days impoundment of Young's vehicle, and two years of probation, including terms such as attendance at AA or MA meetings, an alcohol and drug assessment, and random drug and alcohol screens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Assignments of error,\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Young presents two assignments of error for our review,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"I.

Weight of the evidence concerns \"the inclination of the greater amount of credible evidence, offered in a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.
