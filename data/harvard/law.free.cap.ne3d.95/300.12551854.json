We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The judgment rests on the trial judge's construction of an agreement which states that the Nicolis will convey to the defendants an easement allowing them to construct and maintain a retaining wall along the rear of their property, and will arrange for another neighbor to execute a similar easement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In exchange, the agreement provides for the Nicolis' purchase of a thirty by forty foot portion of the defendants' lot (the parcel) that would square off the Nicolis' \"L-shaped\" lot. The agreement provided that transfer would depend on whether it would adversely affect drainage resulting from the defendants' proposed expansion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   As observed by the trial judge, the agreement was not well drafted. It provides no purchase price for the parcel to be conveyed, and no closing date. The location of the parcel is not precisely defined, and the description of the parcel does not conform to the parties' apparent intent. In addition, the agreement incorrectly identifies the owner of the parcel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and incorrectly identifies the managing director of Century Box as its \"president.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendants assert that because the written agreement fails to set forth several essential elements of the parties' agreement with reasonable certainty, it does not satisfy the Statute of Frauds and is unenforceable. The argument is unavailing. Because the Nicolis fulfilled their obligations under the agreement by delivering the required easement over their property and arranging for the conveyance of a similar easement over their neighbor's property, their performance \"takes the case out of the operation of the [S]tatute [of Frauds].\"\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Townsend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2042475\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/42/483/#p485\">\n    1 Met. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 485 (1840).

Testimony at trial supported the judge's finding that the defendants knew the easements delivered by the Nicolis were consideration for the transfer of the parcel. This is corroborated by the purchase and sale agreement drafted by the defendants for a reduced parcel, where the defendants included the nominal price of $1.00. Further, the judge properly did not credit the defendants' claims that they did not know what land was to be conveyed. That the description of the parcel's size in the agreement was different from the size of the parcel on the ground is immaterial where the evidence at trial permitted a conclusion that the parties intended to \"square off\" the Nicolis' property. The description of the parcel was sufficient for the parties to understand the location of the land to be conveyed.

App. Ct. 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 484 (1991), imposed a practical solution rather than voiding the agreement of the parties; to have done otherwise would have been unjust to the Nicolis, who had fully performed their obligations, but could not be made whole again since they had already conveyed the easements to the defendants. Additionally, the defendants' construction of the retaining wall and expanded facility was something the judge could consider in crafting a remedy without imposing an undue burden on the defendants-who cannot complain, as the agreement has been modified to their advantage-rather than requiring restoration of the status quo ante. \"It should always be borne in mind that, in a suit for specific performance, it is the function of the court to do full and complete justice without requiring any additional and unnecessary litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1418698\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/30/479/#p484\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1418698\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/30/479/#p484\">\n    . at 484-485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from 5A Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1137, at 97-98 (1964).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The defendants needed the easements in order to expand the manufacturing facility operating on their property.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Although the agreement was executed by Century Box and not by the land owner, 37 Chase Street Realty Trust, testimony was given and the defendants agree that both entities are treated as one for these purposes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Since the defendants drafted the agreement, any ambiguity in the agreement is resolved against them.
