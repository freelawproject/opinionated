He also appeals from an order denying his motion to withdraw guilty pleas in a subsequent case, arguing that the pleas were not voluntary and intelligent and that plea counsel was ineffective in failing to inform him that he could appeal the earlier probation violation order. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . In 2012, the defendant was charged with, and in 2013 he pleaded guilty to, four counts of violating an order pursuant to G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7 (209A order or no-contact order). The order required no contact with the plaintiff-grandmother or with her juvenile granddaughter (the defendant's step-daughter) Ann,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the defendant stay away from the home where the grandmother, Ann, and Ann's mother (the defendant's wife) all lived. The judge sentenced the defendant to two years committed in the house of correction on counts one to three, and three years of probation on the fourth count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   As conditions of probation, the defendant was required to \"abide by 209A\" and \"to stay away [from] and have no contact [with] the named victim,\" Ann. Defense counsel sought to clarify the import of the 209A order, given that it did not bar him from contacting his wife, who lived at the same address. In response, the judge verified with the defendant that his wife had a cellular telephone and then instructed him, \"Don't call the house phone. Don't call where you think someone else who is on the restraining order could possibly answer. If someone picks up her cell phone, I mean, that's a different story.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2015, the defendant was served with a notice of probation violation, alleging a failure to abide by G. L. c. 209A and a violation of the existing 209A order, and a criminal complaint alleging two violations of the same 209A order. At the probation violation hearing, the judge, who had been the sentencing judge at the defendant's 2013 hearing, heard Ann testify that on a recent evening at approximately 11:45 P.M. , she answered the house telephone and recognized the defendant's voice. The defendant \"said hello and asked me if I was [Ann], and I said yes.... He [also] asked me if my mother was home.\" The judge credited Ann's testimony, rejected the defendant's argument that his contact with Ann was merely incidental to his attempt to reach his wife, and found that the contact was \"an intentional act.\" The judge further found the defendant in violation of probation, revoked his probation, and sentenced him to two and one-half years in the house of correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defense counsel, who was also counsel in the pending criminal matter, then asked the judge whether he was willing to impose sentences on the new charges that would be concurrent with the probation violation sentence just imposed, stating that \"[i]t's better than going to trial and getting from and after.\" The Commonwealth stated that it had intended to recommend from-and-after time. The judge expressed his inclination to impose concurrent sentences but postponed the pleas until the defendant was in \"the right frame of mind.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At a subsequent hearing, a second judge engaged in a plea colloquy, the adequacy of which the defendant does not challenge, and then accepted the defendant's guilty pleas to the two counts of violating the 209A order. For each offense the judge imposed a two and one-half year sentence in the house of correction, to be served concurrently with the probation violation sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2016, represented by new counsel, the defendant obtained leave from a single justice of this court to file an untimely notice of appeal from the order finding him in violation of probation. The defendant also moved to withdraw his guilty pleas to the 2015 charges. As grounds, he asserted that the pleas were not made voluntarily and intelligently, due to counsel's failure to inform him of his right to appeal from the probation violation finding, and resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion was heard and denied by the same judge who had presided over the 2013 pleas and sentencing hearing and the 2015 probation revocation hearing. The defendant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Probation violation\n   </em>\n   .

They involved 209A orders that did not prohibit a defendant from contacting his children by telephone at the home of a protected parent; i.e., they permitted contact that could not be achieved without risk of incidental contact with the parent.

Here, the judge was entitled to reject the defendant's claim of unavoidable incidental contact, where he could communicate with Ann's mother, who had a cell phone, without risk of contact with Ann herself. Nor was the judge required to credit counsel's argument\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that, because the defendant called at 11:45 P.M. , he \"could not reasonably have been expected to know[ ] that the protected person would be present.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Raymond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"987552\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/54/488/#p493\">\n    54 Mass.

The defendant knew that Ann lived at the home, and, contrary to counsel's argument, it is not unreasonable to think that Ann, being thirteen years old, might be awake, or awakened, to answer the house telephone at that hour, particularly where the defendant had the no-risk option of calling his wife's cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In evaluating counsel's proffered explanation for the call, compare\n   <em>\n    Leger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1011158\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/52/232/#p238\">\n    52 Mass.

He argues that when he pleaded guilty to the 2015 criminal charges, his lack of knowledge that he could appeal the related probation violation finding, coupled with his later being informed of that right, constituted \"external circumstances or information\" that made his pleas involuntary.
