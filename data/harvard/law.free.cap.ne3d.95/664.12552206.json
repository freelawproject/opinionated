Quinn argues that his resulting conviction should be vacated because the trial court erred by overruling challenges for cause he directed at two prospective jurors. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled the challenges for cause, and therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} A jury found Quinn guilty as charged on March 25, 2014, at the conclusion of a two-day trial. At his disposition hearing, held on March 26, 2014, the trial court merged the two kidnapping offenses with the abduction offense for purposes of sentencing, and the State elected to proceed on one of the kidnapping offenses. The court sentenced Quinn to serve consecutive terms of three years' imprisonment for each of the charges of domestic violence; 11 years for the merged charge of kidnapping; and three years for the charge of intimidation of a victim, for a total sentence of 20 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Quinn appealed his conviction, and in\n   <em>\n    State v.

On April 12, 2016, Quinn filed an application to re-open his appeal based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, faulting counsel for failing to present arguments concerning the trial court's rulings on the challenges for cause he raised during voir dire. We granted Quinn's application to re-open on May 11, 2016. Although we appointed counsel to represent Quinn for this appeal, he elected instead to represent himself and filed a motion on October 3, 2016 for leave to proceed pro se. We sustained Quinn's motion on October 20, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

He also expressed his understanding that the State bore the burden of proof, attested to his belief in the principle that a criminal defendant should be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and disclaimed having any preconceived opinions about Quinn's guilt or innocence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57-58, 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Quinn argues, even so, that the Locksmith \"could not [have been] fair and impartial because he stated he could not,\" citing to our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Leavell\n   </em>\n   , for that matter, lends no support to Quinn's argument. In\n   <em>\n    Leavell\n   </em>\n   , when a prospective juror challenged for cause was asked whether he could give the defendant a fair trial, the juror twice answered that he did not think he could.\n   <em>\n    Leavell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1989%20WL%2033104\">\n    1989 WL 33104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1-2.

According to Quinn, the State \"knew, or should have known[,] that [the] Deputy * * * was involved in [his] case,\" but neither the State nor the Deputy himself disclosed as much to the trial court during voir dire. Appellant's Br. 5-6. Quinn posits that the alleged failure to disclose \"constitutes prosecutorial misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.

As a result, we \"limited [this re-opened appeal] to the issue[s] regarding * * * potential error[s] in the jury selection process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Quinn's second assignment of error is consequently overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 15} For his third assignment of error, Quinn contends that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   DEPUTY [* * *], THE DEPUTY INVOLVED IN THE APPELLANTS [SIC] CASE, KNEW BOTH THE LEAD DETECTIVE AND BOTH PROSECUTORS IN THE APPELLANTS [SIC] TRIAL.

With that possibility raised, however, Quinn bore the burden to pose questions sufficient to demonstrate that the Deputy lacked impartiality-whether on the basis of involvement with the case, interaction with the prosecuting attorneys and officers of the Springfield Police Department, or both. Quinn argues that a \"law enforcement officer who asserts that he is 'familiar' with the defendant [is] essentially stating that he had dealt with [the defendant] before in his professional capacity,\" yet in the absence of any specific information about the nature of such familiarity, other explanations are equally as likely. Appellant's Br. 7. For example, the officer might be personally acquainted with the defendant or might have interviewed the defendant as a witness in the course of an unrelated matter. Quinn's counsel did not question the Deputy or otherwise attempt to establish that the Deputy would be unable to remain impartial, meaning that Quinn did not satisfy his burden to demonstrate, through questioning, that the Deputy would be unsuitable for service on his jury. On the record before us, then, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Quinn's challenge for cause to the Deputy. Quinn's third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 19} We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling Quinn's challenges for cause to the service of the Locksmith and the Deputy as jurors. The judgment of the trial court is therefore affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Before the State filed its brief, and without requesting leave, Quinn submitted an amendment to his initial brief on December 5, 2016, setting forth four additional assignments of error. We decline to address these additional assignments of error individually because they are merely redundant expressions of the second and third assignments of error that Quinn raises in his initial brief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    In our decision granting Quinn's application to re-open this appeal, we stated that the \"reopening is limited to the issue regarding a potential error in the jury selection process,\" referring to the trial court's decision to overrule Quinn's challenge for cause to a deputy with the Clark County Sheriff's Department. Decision &amp; Entry 3-4, May 11, 2016. Quinn had also raised the trial court's decision overruling his challenge to the Locksmith in his application to re-open, though we did not refer to this latter issue when we re-opened the appeal. Construing our decision in light of Quinn's application, we find that the omission of any reference to the issue concerning the Locksmith was inadvertent, and that our decision was intended to accept not only the issue concerning the Clark County Sheriff's Deputy, but the issue concerning the Locksmith, as well. The State has addressed both of these issues in its appellee's brief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-73\">\n   HALL, P.J., concurring.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 20} I fully agree with the analysis and conclusions of the majority opinion. I write separately to express my belief that, on this record, even if two jurors harbored a preference to believe the testimony of police officers that preference was harmless and insufficient to create reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 21} At trial, the defense in this domestic dispute between mother and son challenged mother's credibility. Her story that her son abducted her, threatened and attacked her, and threatened to make her jump off a roadside bridge was corroborated by photographs of her face, head and arm, photos from their house, and the testimony of a lay witness in the Wal-Mart parking lot from whom she sought refuge. The defense did not offer any witnesses with contrary evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The credibility of any of the police officers was never in question. Four officers testified. None of them were present at the time of any abduction, assault, or intimidation, and none of their testimony introduced any elements of the various offenses. Officer Ronnie Terry was dispatched in regard to the initial incident at the victim's home on a \"[d]omestic dispute between mother and son.\" (T. 88). He testified mother was visibly shaken, but he observed no visible injury, a fact the defense inquired about and highlighted. He took her statement and photographs. Officer Josh Clark also had responded to the home. He too saw no visible injury to mother although he agreed she was \"nervous, scared, and hesitant at first.\" (T. 102). He saw no damage to the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Again the defense did not question Clark's credibility but rather inquired about the lack of injury or damage and relied upon the accuracy of his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Several hours later, Officer Paul Herald was dispatched to the Wal-Mart parking lot on a report of a woman assaulted. He said she had a \"large lump above her left eye, swelling, [and] bruising.\" (T. 115). He took multiple pictures of her face, forehead, and eyelid, which were shown and described to the jury and were introduced into evidence. He also testified about the subsequent pictures, taken at mother's home, which demonstrated damage to her bedroom door and which also were introduced into evidence. Through Herald, the defense introduced several additional pictures from inside the house, suggesting the presence of drug activity. The only criticism of his investigation was his failure to search for or to locate the bridge where son demanded she jump to see if there was any evidence at that location. The credibility of Herald was not at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The last police witness, Detective James Byron, testified about the chain of custody of the Wal-Mart surveillance video, which he retrieved from the store. He was not questioned by the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Finally, in closing argument, the defense made no reference to any issue about the credibility of any police officers. Indeed, most of the evidence that the defense used to denigrate the credibility of the victim was the evidence supplied by the police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In my opinion, the record demonstrates there was never a question about the credibility of the police officers, who were not present and did not directly testify about the assault, kidnapping, or intimidation. They did not testify to any element of the offenses for which the defendant was convicted. Accordingly, the contention that a juror might give a police officer more credibility than a lay person is of no consequence here and does not raise prejudicial error.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

He stated he would both have a \"tendency to believe\" law enforcement officers, and \"would believe\" an officer who said he witnessed \"something happen.\" When specifically asked if his interactions with law enforcement would keep him from being a fair and impartial juror, Juror # 5 responded, \"I believe them more than I believe regular people.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In response to Quinn's challenge for cause regarding Juror # 5, the prosecutor responded, \"I think it's pretty clear from [the juror's] answers that he does have faith in law enforcement and would tend to believe law enforcement, but I think he also said that he could be a fair and impartial juror and if there was evidence that contradicted any police officer's statement, he would look at the evidence and make his decision accordingly.\" The court overruled the challenge for cause, and Quinn exercised a peremptory challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The record does not reflect that Juror # 5 ever said he could be fair and impartial. To the contrary, Juror # 5 stated that if an officer's testimony \"conflicted with another witness,\" he would \"have the tendency to believe the police officer first.\" Juror # 5 stated that he had no \"preconceived [notions about the defendant's innocence],\" but he repeatedly indicated he \"would have a tendency to believe\" law enforcement officers over others. In short, Juror # 5's answers reflected an unequivocal lack of impartiality in how he would assess the credibility of witness-police officers versus other witnesses. Further, R.C. 2313.17(D) provides that \"[t]he validity of the challenge [for cause] shall * * * be sustained if the court has any doubt as to the juror's being entirely unbiased.\" The trial court could not have reasonably been without doubt that Juror # 5's answers reflected that he could be a fair and impartial juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Juror # 11 was a deputy sheriff in Clark County for 15 years and knew both assistant prosecutors and the Springfield Police Department officers who testified. When asked if he \"had any discussions with anyone who is involved with this case about this case,\" the juror said he was \"not sure exactly which case it is. I am familiar with the defendant though.\" No additional questions were asked of Juror # 11. The trial court summarily overruled a challenge for cause, and Quinn exercised a peremptory challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Whether the trial court abused its discretion in failing to disqualify Juror\n   # 11 for cause is a closer question. There was no definite answer whether Juror # 11 had discussions about Quinn's case with the officers involved, and neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel asked follow-up questions to explore whether the deputy sheriff would give deference to the witness-police officers, how the deputy sheriff was \"familiar\" with Quinn, whether the deputy sheriff's familiarity with the prosecutors would affect his ability to sit as a fair and impartial juror, and whether the deputy sheriff believed he could be fair and impartial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Nevertheless, Juror # 11's responses reflected that he was a member of law enforcement, knew the prosecutors and the State's representative (Detective Byron), and was \"familiar with the defendant.\" His statement that he was \"familiar with the defendant\" in response to the inquiry about police and this case implied that his familiarity arose from Quinn's involvement with the criminal justice system. Given Juror # 11's employment and his familiarity with both the prosecutors and Quinn in the criminal justice context, I would conclude that the trial court should have granted Quinn's challenge for cause as to Juror # 11, as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The lack of impartiality evinced by the prospective jurors is not a criticism of them individually; we all have implicit and explicit biases and these jurors directly and honestly answered the questions put to them. Such attitudes do not dissolve in a general acquiescence to a conclusory question about whether a juror understands the presumption of innocence or can be fair and impartial. I would find the decision not to grant the challenges for cause to be not guided by reason (unreasonable), without adequate defining principles (arbitrary), as well as unconscionable (affronting the sense of justice or reasonableness). Accordingly, I would reverse Quinn's conviction and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    One court has attributed the continued use of the term to the fact that \"most appellate judges suffer from misocainea.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.
