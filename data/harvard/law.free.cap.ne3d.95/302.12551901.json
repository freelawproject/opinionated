The suspect was described as a Hispanic male wearing black pants, a black-hooded sweatshirt, a black baseball hat, black gloves, Air-Jordan type sneakers, and silver chains around his neck. Trooper Sean Healy of the Massachusetts State Police approached a man who matched the CI's description. As Trooper Healy approached, the suspect grabbed his waist area and then fled on foot. Soon after, the defendant was detained and identified by Trooper Healy as the man who had fled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After the defendant was in police custody, a civilian witness named Julio Solano approached Worcester police Officer Danny Diaz to inquire whether the police were looking for someone. Solano said that he saw a man hiding behind cars as a police cruiser drove by and that he was willing to look at the suspect in custody to try to identify him. Solano believed that he would recognize the individual if he saw him again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Officer Diaz radioed Trooper Healy to bring the defendant to Solano. The defendant stood next to the police car in a spotlight. There were between six and seven police officers in the area, but only two uniformed officers were within a few feet and on each side of the defendant. Solano did not see handcuffs on the defendant. Solano saw the defendant from thirteen feet away and stated that the defendant was the individual he saw acting suspiciously moments earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant asserts that Solano's showup identification was unnecessarily suggestive and therefore should have been suppressed. The defendant also maintains that there was no good reason for Solano's identification because Trooper Healy had already identified the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Showup identifications are generally disfavored because of their inherently suggestive nature.

See Massachusetts Superior Court Criminal Practice Jury Instructions \u00a7\u00a7 6.2, 6.2.1 (Mass. Cont. Legal Educ. 2d ed. 2013). In fact, the judge went beyond the model instruction by telling the jury, \"You may also take into account that people of all races and ethnicities may have greater difficulty in accurately identifying members of a different race or a different ethnicity.\" The judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to give the requested instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Closing argument\n   </em>\n   . The defendant contends that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the Commonwealth's witnesses' credibility, misstated evidence, and attacked the defendant's character. The defendant did not object to the closing argument at trial. Consequently, we review for error, and if any, for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.

App. Ct. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235 (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant contends that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the Commonwealth witnesses when he said, \"I would suggest there's no evidence whatsoever that any of these individuals who testified before you came in with an agenda or a bias to lie.\" The prosecutor was permitted to use the language \"I would suggest\" to \"avoid expressing [his] personal belief about the witness's truthfulness.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Molle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"626956\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/56/621/#p631\">\n    56 Mass.

The defendant focused the majority of his closing argument on the lack of reliability in the eyewitness identifications. \"Because the defendant raised the issue of credibility of the three eyewitnesses' testimony, it was not improper for the prosecutor to comment on the consistency of their accounts; he did not vouch for their credibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Guy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"411793\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/441/96/#p113\">\n    441 Mass. 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113 (2004). Moreover, the prosecutor preceded the comment with \"[Y]ou determine credibility\" and ended with \"You evaluate it,\" giving further, proper context to his remarks. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Koumaris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1346410\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/440/405/#p414\">\n    440 Mass. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (2003) ( \"[C]losing arguments must be viewed in the context of the entire argument, and in light of the judge's instructions to the jury and the evidence at trial\" [quotations omitted] );\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carriere\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144738\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/1/#p19\">\n    470 Mass. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 19 (2014) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Likewise, the prosecutor did not improperly attack the character of the defendant when he referenced the defendant's \"criminal mind.\" In context, the prosecutor's argument referred to the defendant's efforts to flee and to create an alibi. The argument was permissible because it was based on reasonable inferences that a jury could draw from the evidence. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462655\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/15/#p31\">\n    476 Mass. 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31-33 (2016) (use of the term \"criminal mind\" in closing argument permissible because \"[t]he jury also reasonably could have inferred that the defendant's actions after the [crime] were a conscious attempt to cover his tracks, ... [and] to establish an alibi\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, the defendant argues that the prosecutor misstated evidence and referred to matters that had been excluded when he stated: \"And when [Trooper Healy] looks at this defendant, he's able to positively identify him as the person he saw running with what he believed to be a firearm hidden on his person. That's what Trooper Healy's testimony is.\" On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Trooper Healy if he followed the suspect over the fence and Trooper Healy replied, \"No, because I thought he had a weapon.\" The prosecutor was allowed to argue facts in evidence as to Trooper Healy's belief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency\n   </em>\n   . The defendant maintains the trial judge erred in denying his motion for required findings of not guilty because the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove that the defendant was the suspect that fled from the police and that the defendant possessed the firearm in question. We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether \"any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p677\">\n    378 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677 (1979).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Trooper Healy identified the defendant as the individual he saw flee.

Trooper Healy and Officer Foley testified that the suspect grasped at a heavy object in his waistband before he ran. The jury could infer that the defendant was hiding a firearm in his waistband. In addition, the defendant fled from the police and jumped a fence. On the opposite side of the fence-in the exact location that Officer Foley saw the defendant jump-a silver pistol was recovered. A rational jury could infer that the firearm either fell from the defendant's waistband or that he discarded it while fleeing the police.

However, \"in reviewing a judge's ruling on a motion to suppress, an appellate court 'may not rely on the facts as developed at trial' even where the testimony differed materially from that given at trial.\"\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Gonzalez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308578\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/410/#p416\">\n     469 Mass. 410\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 416 (2014), quoting from\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Deramo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1178202\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/436/40/#p43\">\n     436 Mass. 40\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 43 (2002).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Officer Foley testified that he did not see the defendant's face when he fled because he was focused on the defendant grasping at something heavy in his waistband.

Trooper Healy also gave varying accounts of how much of the defendant's face he saw. It was up to the jury to assess the weight to give to the eyewitness testimony.
