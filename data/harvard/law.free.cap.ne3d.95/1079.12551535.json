A Walmart employee asked McKee to produce a receipt, but McKee refused and exited the store. An off-duty South Euclid police officer working as a security guard for Walmart followed McKee to the parking lot, stopped him, and instructed him to produce his receipt. Maintaining that he had no legal obligation to do so, McKee again refused to show his receipt. The security guard called for police assistance. Two officers responded and asked McKee to identify himself. He refused, causing the officers to place him under arrest. McKee then relented, identified himself, and showed the police his ID and receipt, at which point the police released him without charge. In response to McKee's citizen complaint about the incident, the police sought an opinion from the city law director, who concluded that the police officers acted appropriately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} McKee brought this action against defendants Brian Shamblin and Patrick Delahanty (the police officers who responded to Walmart); James Wilson (a police lieutenant who wrote an internal report about the incident); Kevin Nietert (the chief of police who asked the law director for a legal opinion on the conduct of the officers); Michael Lograsso (the city law director); and the city of South Euclid (\"city\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   McKee asserted the following claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1.

Shamblin was privileged when making the arrest and the court properly dismissed this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The cause of action for false arrest was premised on McKee's allegation that he had been wrongly arrested for refusing to disclose personal information on request in violation of R.C. 2921.29(A).

A person complies with R.C. 2921.29(A) by verbally disclosing the person's name, address, or date of birth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Nevertheless, the complaint alleges facts showing that McKee refused to provide any identifying information upon the officer's request. The complaint contains the following allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   75. Apparently knowing that he didn't have a legal right to search Plaintiff's backpack or force Plaintiff to do so, Shamblin paused and thought for a moment, and then said \"okay, do you have ID on you?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   76. Plaintiff said \"um ...\", thought for a moment, and then truthfully responded, \"yeah, it's in here,\" pointing at the same pocket of his backpack where his Walmart receipt was, \"I have my\" and was about to state that it was his college ID when Shamblin interrupted and said \"can you pull that out then, please?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   77. Plaintiff said \"no thank you,\" because he knew that there was no legal requirement to search his own backpack and provide an ID card to a police officer upon demand, the ID card was in the same pocket as his receipt which he didn't want to provide, he did not wish to reveal the identity of his college to Shamblin, he disliked being interrupted by Shamblin, disagreed with Shamblin's authoritarian, corporate supremacist beliefs, disliked Shamblin's attitude in general, dislikes living in a \"papers please\" society, and feels that government demands to show ID cards without good cause are insulting, as they treat the individual like property of the government rather than an inherently free person, and are a means of conditioning the public to submit to government authority, willingly giving the government whatever information it demands. Plaintiff was legally knowledgeable and knew that compliance with the request for written ID was obviously voluntary. R.C. 2921.29(A) clearly didn't apply because nobody had requested the statutorily specified information; the only request was for Plaintiff to conduct a search of his own backpack and present an item which contained some information specified by R.C. 2921.29(A) (his name), but also information beyond that required by R.C. 2921.29(A), specifically, the name of the college that Plaintiff attends. If there was any misunderstanding about what type of ID card Plaintiff was carrying (due to Shamblin's interruption), a state-issued ID card would also contain significant information beyond that required by R.C. 2921.29(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   78. McCann said \"you're refusing to show who you are?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   79. Before Plaintiff could reply to explain that he would give the information specified by R.C. 2921.29(A) if requested, but that he didn't want to show written identification, in fact, while McCann was still talking, Shamblin said \"okay, so you're not gonna identify yourself ...\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   80. Even though the obligation to disclose personal information was never triggered, as soon as Plaintiff heard Shamblin say this, Plaintiff began to give the information specified in R.C. 2921.29(A), to be absolutely certain that Shambling [sic] and McCann couldn't twist the facts and claim that Plaintiff refused to identify himself: \"I'm Edward McKee.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   81. Shamblin gave Plaintiff absolutely no time to verbally state his personal information, instead continuing: \"that means you're under arrest!\" Plaintiff spoke the word \"Edward\" at the same time that Shamblin spoke the word \"under\", which shows that Plaintiff immediately started giving his personal information (even though it had never been requested) as soon as Shamblin suggested that Plaintiff was refusing to identify himself ... not when Plaintiff was threatened with arrest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 21} McKee states that Shamblin's question, \"do you have ID on you,\" was a request to produce a physical identification card. While this interpretation is a logical one, it is not the only one. The allegations in the complaint make it clear that McKee understood Shamblin's request as one for identifying information. McKee proved this point when he alleged that he stated his name once Shamblin announced that he was placing McKee under arrest because \"you're not gonna identify yourself[.]\" This shows McKee understood that Shamblin's request for \"ID\" was a request for McKee to identify himself.

This allegation showed that McKee understood that Shamblin suspected that McKee's refusal to allow store personnel to verify his purchases could have been to hide a potential theft. As it happened, McKee paid for his purchases.

In addition, he was not the only customer in the store-the complaint alleged that there was a \"long line\" of customers waiting at the exit to have their receipts checked by store personnel, and some of the those customers were presumably waiting in line with him at checkout. Finally, the complaint failed to identify the purchases that McKee wished to keep from the public. While there may be an argument that some products are of such a personal nature that a purchaser might desire to keep their identity private, there is nothing from the face of the complaint to show that the items McKee purchased were of such a personal nature that discretion dictated that publication would be offensive or objectionable to the reasonable person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The invasion of privacy claim against Delahanty presents a different question.

McKee specifically alleged that the security guard's \"actions show that she considered her actions as being in the scope of her employment as a private security guard enforcing store policy, not in the scope of her employment as a South Euclid police officer.\" Complaint at \u00b6 45. In fact, McKee specifically alleged in the eleventh cause of action that the security guard's actions \"were taken in the course of her employment by Security Hut, and Security Hut is vicariously liable for her actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6243.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 50} With respect to Shamblin, Delahanty, Wilson, and Nietert, we acknowledge that their qualified immunity \"is no shield to the employer's liability for acts under the doctrine of respondeat superior.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Nevertheless, McKee framed their conduct under the eleventh cause of action as \"part of that city's proprietary functions of 'Providing Retail Security' and 'Supervising Retail Security[.]' \" Complaint at \u00b6 245. There are no facts pleaded to show that Shamblin, Delahanty, Wilson, and Nietert were engaged in the proprietary function of providing retail security. The facts pleaded in the complaint leave no doubt that Shamblin, Delahanty, Wilson, and Nietert were engaged in governmental functions relating to a police department-only the security guard was engaged in providing retail security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   D.

As pleaded, the twelfth count of the complaint is nothing more than a respondeat superior cause of action, where ratification of an employee's actions is required to show that the employer adopted acts committed by an employee who was acting outside the scope of employment.\n   <em>\n    Riotte v.

The complaint claimed that Shamblin was acting outside the scope of his employment\n   and was, in essence, providing \"retail security\" because he was \"enforcing the policy of a private business and/or his opinions about merchants' rights.\" Complaint at \u00b6 207. We rejected this argument in our discussion of the third cause of action and apply that same conclusion here: the complaint shows that Shamblin arrested McKee for an alleged violation of a law requiring a person to give identifying information. That was an act fully within the course and scope of Shamblin's duties as a police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 53} The security guard was not acting in the course and scope of her employment as a city police officer at the time the events giving rise to the complaint occurred. A principal ratifies the unauthorized act of his agent if the \"principal, with full knowledge of the facts, conducts himself in a way which manifests his intention to approve an earlier act performed by his agent which did not bind him.\"\n   <em>\n    Karat Gold Imports, Inc. v.

The complaint alleged that the city misconstrued and misrepresented evidence shown on the body camera video to justify the security guard's actions, but the city gained no benefit from doing so. Absent ratification, the security guard's conduct was not attributable to the city and thus not actionable against it. The complaint shows only that the city investigated the incident and rejected McKee's assertion that the security guard needed probable cause to stop him. This conclusion did not approve her actions; it merely found that she acted justifiably by stopping McKee on suspicion of shoplifting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   EILEEN A.
