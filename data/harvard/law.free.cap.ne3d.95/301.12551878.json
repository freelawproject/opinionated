Mark Zaplin, the initial defendant, became the holder of two notes, each in the sum of $450,000, that were secured by two mortgages on two pieces of real estate in Brookline. On or about October 30, 2012, Matthew Haney, the manager of Hubbardston, LLC, contacted Zaplin to inquire whether he was interested in selling the notes and mortgages (collectively \"notes and mortgages\"). Haney then sent Zaplin an offer to purchase the notes and mortgages by electronic mail message (e-mail). The proposed purchase price was $1,175,000 with the closing date of November 30, 2012. On November 16, 2012, Zaplin sent an e-mail to Haney asking him to incorporate the following provision: \"Time is of the essence. No extension unless signed in writing by both of us.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On the morning of November 30, 2012, Haney telephoned Zaplin to ask for a $100,000 reduction in the purchase price because \"the notes only included two and a half years of accrued interest.\" Zaplin declined, and the closing did not go forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the Superior Court judge erred in allowing Zaplin's motion for summary judgment, contending that issues of material fact exist whether a contract existed between the parties and that even if one did exist, there was (1) a breach of contract; (2) a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (3) a violation of G. L. c. 93A. \"We review a grant of summary judgment de novo to determine 'whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Juliano\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272388\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/527/#p529\">\n    461 Mass. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 529-530 (2012), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Augat, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut.

Here, because Zaplin provided that \"time is of the essence\" and neither party executed the contract by the agreed-upon closing date of November 30, 2012, any obligations that the parties had to one another were extinguished.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Devine\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams Bros., Inc. of Marshfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3950162\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/4/816/#p816\">\n    4 Mass.

See\n   <em>\n    Weiler\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    PortfolioScope, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308184\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/75/#p82\">\n    469 Mass. 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 82 (2014) (\"The covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in every contract\") (quotation omitted). Finally, the plaintiff failed to allege any conduct of the defendant that was unfair or deceptive, which would support a violation of G. L. c. 93A. \"[O]rdinary ... dispute[s] without conduct that was unethical, immoral, oppressive, or unscrupulous\" do not indicate unfairness.\n   <em>\n    Duclersaint\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Federal Natl.

However, even if the plaintiff had established a breach of contract, something more is required to constitute a violation of G. L. c. 93A.\n   <em>\n    Madan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Royal Indem.

The judge further found that Haney was required to accept the counteroffer in order for a contract to be formed. Haney maintains that, to the extent there was a counteroffer, he accepted it verbally over the telephone. The judge concluded that even if Haney did accept the counteroffer, the failure to close by the November 30, 2012, deadline extinguished any obligation the parties had to each other.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    The plaintiff argues that the \"time of the essence\" provision was waived because of the continued conduct of the parties.

There was no continued conduct between the parties, as communications between them ceased until five days after the closing date, on December 4, 2012, when Haney's attorney telephoned Zaplin's attorney asking to buy the notes and mortgages as previously agreed upon.
