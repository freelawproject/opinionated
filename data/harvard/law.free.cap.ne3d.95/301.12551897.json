L. c. 275, \u00a7 2. The Commonwealth appeals from an order allowing the defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . \"Our review of the judge's order of dismissal is confined to the four corners of the application for complaint, which in this case is essentially the ... incident report.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ilya I\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145101\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/625/#p626\">\n    470 Mass. 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 626 (2015). The complaint application stated that the defendant was arrested in the Pittsfield Division of the District Court Department for nonpayment of child support. He was removed from the court room and taken to the lock-up area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   While court Officer Thomas Francesconi was conducting the intake process, the defendant suddenly became very angry. The defendant told Francesconi, \"If this ruins my life, I'm coming back here with a machine gun.\" Francesconi completed the intake process, and another court officer walked the defendant to his cell. On the way, the defendant reiterated, \"I'm serious, if this ruins my life, I'm coming back here with a vengeance.\" The defendant was placed in a cell without further incident and later transferred to the house of correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"In reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint, the judge must decide whether the complaint application contains 'sufficient evidence to establish the identity of the accused ... and probable cause to arrest him.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Humberto H\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223855\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/466/562/#p565\">\n    466 Mass. 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565 (2013), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"900724\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/385/160/#p163\">\n    385 Mass. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163 (1982).

Whether the complaint application establishes probable cause is a question of law; thus, \"we review the motion judge's ... determination de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Humberto H\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223855\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/466/562/#p565\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223855\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/466/562/#p565\">\n    at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Long\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669857\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/454/542/#p555\">\n    454 Mass. 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 555 (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \"What is a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178344\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/705/#p707\">\n    394 U.S. 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707 (1969). General Laws c. 275, \u00a7 2, does not define the term \"threat,\" but \"its elements have been held to 'include an expression of intention to inflict a crime on another and an ability to do so in circumstances that would justify apprehension on the part of the recipient of the threat.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troy T\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"987557\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/54/520/#p524\">\n    54 Mass.

The defendant's words may be construed as menacing, but \"[m]enacing words alone, even those that express a threat to commit a crime, do not constitute an offense under G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Furst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"626918\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/56/283/#p284\">\n    56 Mass.

He did not target the court officers, and they were not frightened or apprehensive after his outbursts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Commonwealth suggests that a threat to the occupants of the court house can be inferred from the defendant's statements. \"[L]anguage properly may be understood and treated as a threat even in the absence of an explicit statement of an intention to harm the victim as long as circumstances support the victim's fearful or apprehensive response.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chou\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343609\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/229/#p234\">\n    433 Mass. 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 234 (2001). Examining the defendant's words \"in the context of the actions and demeanor which accompanied them,\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Elliffe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"480256\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/47/580/#p582\">\n    47 Mass. App. Ct. 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 582 (1999), the only reasonable inference is that the defendant's outbursts were an expression of anger over his arrest rather than a true threat directed at any particular person.

Moreover, \"[i]n analyzing a putative threat, we eschew a technical parsing of the words used and instead consider the entire context in which a statement is made, including the defendant's actions and demeanor at the time.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Meier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"626947\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/56/278/#p280\">\n    56 Mass.

Nonetheless, the defendant's statements considered in context cannot reasonably be understood to threaten any particular person or property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Given the recent highly publicized shootings across the nation, we take judicial notice of actual and potential violence in our court houses.
