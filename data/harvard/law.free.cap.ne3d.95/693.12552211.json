We find no merit in Chateau's two assignments of error, and we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Facts and Procedure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Chateau filed a complaint against Fifth Third alleging negligence, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty, relating to the issuance of an insurance policy in 2007. Clifford and his business partner, Joseph Fiore, formed and operated Chateau. In July 2007, Clifford and Fiore on behalf of Chateau engaged Fifth Third to broker life insurance policies for them. Chateau alleged that the parties had intended for these policies to be key man insurance for the purpose of providing funds to the company in the event of their deaths. It further alleged that the operating\n   agreement for Chateau required the proceeds of the life insurance policies to be distributed between the surviving spouse of the deceased member and Chateau.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} According to Chateau, Fifth Third failed to follow Clifford and Fiore's instructions and mishandled the application process. That failure caused the issuance of a $2 million life insurance policy as an individual policy on Fiore's life with Fiore as the owner and his wife, Mary Fiore, as the sole beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The life insurance policy was issued on September 28, 2007. The last document related to the policy was an \"amendment to application\" dated October 7, 2007. In that document, Fiore confirmed the terms of the life insurance policy, including naming himself as the owner and his wife as the sole beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Fiore died on February 13, 2012. Under the terms of the life insurance policy, the entire $2 million in proceeds went to Mary Fiore. Chateau contends that if the policy had been issued as key man insurance as the parties had intended, Mary Fiore would have received half of the proceeds and Chateau would have received the other half.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Fifth Third filed a motion for summary judgment. In support of its motion, it filed the record of a previous lawsuit in Warren County, Ohio between Chateau and Mary Fiore involving numerous claims and counterclaims. One claim involved Chateau's assertion that it should have received half of the proceeds of Fiore's life insurance policy under the terms of its operating agreement. The court in that case granted summary judgment in favor of Mary Fiore based on the language of the operating agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The trial court rejected Fifth Third's argument that the issue of the parties' intent was barred by collateral estoppel because it had been decided in the previous case in Warren County. But the court found that the complaint was filed outside the six-year statute of limitations for the breach-of-contract claim and the four-year statute of limitations for the negligence claims because the cause of action accrued in October 2007 at the latest. Therefore, the complaint was time-barred. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In its first assignment of error, Chateau contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Fifth Third on its claim for breach of contract. It argues that the cause of action did not accrue until it suffered actual damage as a result of the breach. Thus, the cause of action accrued in February 2012, when the insurance proceeds from the policy on Fiore's life were paid entirely to Mary Fiore, rather than half to Chateau and half to Mary Fiore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In its second assignment of error, Chateau contends that the trial court erred in granting Fifth Third's motion for summary judgment on its claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. Again, it contends that the cause of action did not accrue until it incurred actual damage at the time of Fiore's death in February 2012. We address these assignments together. We find no merit in Chateau's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

The court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Having reviewed\n   <em>\n    Flagstar\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the Ohio Supreme Court therein implicitly overruled\n   <em>\n    Kunz\n   </em>\n   with regard to the application of the delayed-damages rule in cases of professional negligence governed by R.C. 2305.09. In\n   <em>\n    Kunz\n   </em>\n   itself, the majority characterized a negligent-procurement claim against an insurance agent as one alleging negligent performance of \"professional services.\" In\n   <em>\n    Flagstar\n   </em>\n   , the Ohio Supreme Court explicitly stated that \"[a] cause of action for professional negligence accrues when the act is committed.\" It also foreclosed application of a discovery or delayed-damages rule in cases involving professional negligence governed by R.C. 2305.09. In so doing, it rejected the notion that the statute of limitations should not run \"where damages may be delayed until some point in the future[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the facts of\n   <em>\n    Flagstar\n   </em>\n   involved an appraiser's professional negligence, we see no principled reason why an insurance agent's professional negligence should be treated differently. Therefore relying on\n   <em>\n    Flagstar\n   </em>\n   (and\n   <em>\n    Investors REIT One\n   </em>\n   ), we hold that the statute of limitations began to run on [the plaintiff's] negligent-procurement claim when she obtained her insurance policy. Because she filed her negligent-procurement claim against [the insurance agent] more than four years after that date, the trial court properly dismissed the claim as time-barred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Auckerman\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.

We held that the cause of action accrued at the time of the alleged negligent act and that neither the discovery rule nor the delayed-damages rule applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We noted that the Supreme Court had explicitly rejected the application of the discovery rule in\n   <em>\n    Investors REIT One\n   </em>\n   .

We went on to state that \"[r]egardless of its validity or support in the common law of torts, the delayed-damage theory cannot, we believe, be used to circumvent the clear holding of\n   <em>\n    REIT One\n   </em>\n   by resurrecting the discovery rule in a different\n   analytical guise.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110-111,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=655%20N.E.2d%20189\">\n    655 N.E.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V.

Therefore, the cause of action accrued at the latest in October 2007 when the alleged negligence occurred. Because Chateau's complaint was not filed within the four-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.09(D), its claims for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract were time-barred. Fifth Third was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the trial court did not err in granting its motion for summary judgment. Consequently, we overrule Chateau's first and second assignments of error and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Cunningham, P.J., and Zayas, J., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
