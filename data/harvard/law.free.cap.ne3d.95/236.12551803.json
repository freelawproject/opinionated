The single justice here was of the view that the earlier order merely denied a request for the transmittal of the record, and did not necessarily deny an actual reinstatement of the direct appeal. We think that is too narrow a reading of the earlier order.

This court affirmed Hall's convictions after his direct appeal. See\n      <em>\n       Commonwealth\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Hall\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"309459\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/369/715/\">\n       369 Mass. 715\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=343%20N.E.2d%20388\">\n       343 N.E.2d 388\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (1976). White's direct appeal was never properly perfected, however, although he did at various times make efforts toward that end, sometimes pro se and sometimes represented by counsel. Among other things, his counsel filed a petition with a single justice of this court for late filing of an assignment of errors and late entry of the appeal in October, 1974, which was allowed. But it appears that the appeal was never actually entered, and that no further action was taken to prosecute the appeal for an additional eighteen years when, in October, 1992, White, through new counsel, filed a motion in the county court seeking an order directing the Superior Court clerk to transmit the record to this court so that he could pursue his direct appeal. The Commonwealth opposed the motion, which a single justice ultimately denied after a hearing, in 1994.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      Then, in July, 2014, White filed, again with a single justice, a pro se motion for leave to file a late notice of appeal, and, in September, 2014, a pro se petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, to reinstate his direct appeal. Counsel was appointed to represent White on these matters, and, after further proceedings\n     and a hearing, the single justice eventually allowed White's petition to reinstate his direct appeal in December, 2016. She also allowed his motions to file a late notice of appeal and to appoint appellate counsel for purposes of the reinstated direct appeal. Finally, she ordered the Superior Court to assemble the record from the underlying prosecution and to make it available to this\n     court for determination of the reinstated appeal.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      The Commonwealth now appeals from the judgment of the single justice reinstating the direct appeal and from her related orders. We reverse.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      We agree with the basic premise of the single justice's decision, i.e., that if the defendant was deprived of his right to pursue a direct appeal as a result of the ineffective assistance of his trial or appellate counsel in failing to preserve and perfect that right, then he is entitled to a remedy.

We disagree with the single justice, however, as to her choice of the appropriate remedy in these circumstances. The single justice was of the view that reinstating the direct appeal-such that the issues would be considered in the first instance by this court pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E -was the best course. We agree with the Commonwealth that White has a constitutionally adequate alternative that better fits these circumstances. Specifically, he can file a motion for a new trial in the Superior Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim.

Rule 30 (b) does not contain a time limitation, but its application permits examination of the claimed errors to determine whether the defendant was deprived of any constitutionally protected rights by his failure to appeal. If the judge denies the motion for a new trial, then the defendant may appeal that denial and thus obtain appellate review of any issue that would have afforded the defendant relief had his appeal been timely filed. Limiting a defendant to the postconviction remedy contained in rule 30 (b), coupled with the right of appellate review of an adverse ruling thereon, does\n     not violate the defendant's due process rights.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      Although the\n      <em>\n       Cowie\n      </em>\n      case did not involve a conviction of murder in the first degree, the same general reasoning applies here. The fact that this is a case involving murder in the first degree murder and that White, had his right to a direct appeal not been lost, would have been entitled to plenary review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, does, however, require us to add certain protections to ensure that this procedure affords him a truly adequate substitute for a direct appeal.

The appeal in that case had been timely noticed and entered in the appellate court, but it was dismissed for failure to prosecute after the defendant's appellate counsel failed to file a brief.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20N.E.2d%2067\">\n        Id\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20N.E.2d%2067\">\n       . at 183\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20N.E.2d%2067\">\n       680 N.E.2d 67\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .

We ordered that new counsel be appointed for him, and we gave him two choices. We stated that the defendant \"may wish to press his claims by prosecuting the appeal ... or by a motion for a new trial if his claims might better be developed in such a setting, or both.\"\n      <em>\n       Frank\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"274493\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/425/182/\">\n       425 Mass. at 185\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20N.E.2d%2067\">\n       680 N.E.2d 67\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . The\n      <em>\n       Frank\n      </em>\n      case does not stand for the proposition that a defendant will\n      <em>\n       always\n      </em>\n      have the option of proceeding with a reinstated direct appeal. It is simply an illustration of one circumstance where the reinstatement of a direct appeal would be appropriate. The period of time between the defendant's lost appeal and our decision in that case was relatively short-three years; the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel resulting in the loss of his direct appeal was \"credible\" and \"unrebutted,\" the Commonwealth itself having described his counsel's neglect as \"indefensible\"; and the defendant had already attempted to pursue a remedial motion for a new trial but had been rebuffed.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20N.E.2d%2067\">\n        Id\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20N.E.2d%2067\">\n       . at 182-183\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20N.E.2d%2067\">\n       680 N.E.2d 67\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-18\">\n      Here, by contrast, the length of time that has passed since White's trial (and the loss of his right to a direct appeal) is much longer-forty-five years. Moreover, it has not yet been definitively adjudicated that White's loss of his direct appeal was in fact due to any ineffective assistance of his counsel.\n      <footnotemark>\n       2\n      </footnotemark>\n      And finally, White has not yet\n     attempted to rectify the situation through a motion for\n     a new trial. The better course in these circumstances is for White to proceed in the first instance by a motion for a new trial in the trial court. This approach has several advantages over a reinstated direct appeal in the first instance. First, it will allow for a full development of the factual record as to any claims that White wishes to pursue, including his claim that the loss of his right to an appeal was due to the ineffective assistance of counsel. Second, it will permit the trial court judge to make a definitive ruling on the ineffectiveness claim. Third, it will permit the parties and the judge to hone legal issues that are now more than forty-five years old. Finally, it will permit the parties to litigate in the trial court in the first instance the questions that may arise as to what law will apply where the relevant law may have changed since the time of White's convictions.\n      <footnotemark>\n       3\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-19\">\n      Requiring White to proceed in this fashion, rather than simply reinstating his direct appeal, will not violate his rights or prejudice him in any way provided we impose certain protections for his benefit. First, assuming the trial court judge determines that the lost direct appeal was in fact a consequence of ineffective assistance of counsel-and not a choice by White-White must be permitted to raise all claims that he could have raised in a direct appeal, and the judge will be required to consider each of his claims on the substantive merits, just as we would have done in a direct appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Second, if the motion for a new trial is denied, White must have an unfettered right to appeal from that ruling; he will not be required to obtain leave to appeal from a single justice under the gatekeeper provision (i.e., the last sentence) of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. That provision applies only to motions that are filed \"in the superior court\n      <em>\n       after rescript\n      </em>\n      \" (emphasis added).\n      <footnotemark>\n       4\n      </footnotemark>\n      G.

Finally, the defendant will at that time receive the benefit of our plenary review of the case, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, just as he would have on a direct appeal.
