We reverse the trial court's decision to the extent it affirmed the commission's decision and dismiss the commission's discrimination determination against Helen in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In September 2008, Helen and Gary Grybosky received two letters notifying them of housing discrimination charges relating to a rental property they owned and managed in Conneaut, Ohio. The facts resulting in the charges are spelled out in a related appeal arising from Grybosky's declaratory judgment action and civil rights claims against certain Ohio Civil Rights Commission employees and the Ohio Attorney General.\n   <em>\n    Grybosky v. Ohio Civil Rights Commission\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2010-A-0047,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-6843\">\n    2011-Ohio-6843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206938434\">\n    2011 WL 6938434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Following a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge found Helen and Gary Grybosky's practices regarding households with children and regarding people with disabilities violated R.C. 4112.02(H). Upon review of the ALJ's decision, the commission adopted the ALJ's liability report and recommendations, but modified its damages recommendation. The commission ordered the Gryboskys to cease and desist from all discriminatory practices and ordered them to pay the complainant's actual out-of-pocket damages, the attorney general's attorney fees and travel costs, and the attorney fees and travel costs incurred by the complainant, the Fair Housing Resource Center (FHRC). The Gryboskys were also order to complete no less than four hours of training on Ohio's anti-discriminatory fair housing laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The Gryboskys appealed to the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas, and the court of common pleas modified the decision of the Civil Rights Commission in part and affirmed it in part. It dismissed the commission's decision against Gary in its entirety. Helen asserts four assigned errors on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} \"[1.] The trial court committed prejudicial error in failing to dismiss all charges against Appellant/Respondent for the reason that the charging instruments were not under oath as required by ORC 4112.05(B)(1) as a jurisdictional prerequisite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} \"[2.] The trial court committed prejudicial error in concluding that the Civil Rights Commission made a sufficient effort to eliminate the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion as required by R.C. 4112.05(B)(5) before filing a formal complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} \"[3.] The trial court committed prejudicial error in finding that FHRC sustained any actual damages sufficient to provide standing to pursue the charges in this case and the resulting award of actual damages to FHRC and attorney fees to the Ohio Attorney General.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"[4.] The trial court committed prejudicial error in finding that the Ohio fair housing statutes, ORC 4112 et al., are constitutional on their face and as applied to Appellant/Respondent and all other landlords.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Helen first argues that all charges against her should be dismissed because the charging instruments were not under oath as required by R.C. 4112.05(B)(1). The original charging documents were submitted on U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development complaint forms that included a preprinted declaration stating, \"I declare under penalty of perjury that I have read this complaint (including any attachments) and that it is true and correct\" next to the signature line, which were signed by Patricia Kidd on August 30, 2008. The forms do not include a statement that the complaint or charges therein were made under oath or that Kidd had been sworn and subscribed and that she swore to the truth of the matters asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Helen argues here, as she did to the commission and trial court, that the Ohio Civil Rights Commission lacked jurisdiction to hear the disability claims against her because the charging documents do not satisfy the R.C. 4112.05(B)(1) oath requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The trial court considered this issue and held that the oath requirement is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to the commission's jurisdiction over cases alleging housing discrimination under R.C. 4112.02(H). We disagree and find that a plain reading of R.C. 4112.05 dictates the results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The applicable version of R.C. 4112.05(B)(1) states in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"Any person may file a charge with the commission alleging that another person has engaged or is engaging in an unlawful discriminatory practice. * * * In the case of a charge alleging an unlawful discriminatory practice described in division (H) of section 4112.02 of the Revised Code,\n   <em>\n    the charge shall be in writing and under oath\n   </em>\n   and shall be filed with the commission within one year after the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice was committed.\" (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4112.09 provides for who may administer the requisite oaths, and states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} \"The executive director, administrative law judge, compliance officer, each field investigator, field coordinator, mediator, regional director, and supervisor of the Ohio civil rights commission, and any person appointed and commissioned as a notary public in this state, with respect to matters relating to official duties, may administer oaths, take affidavits, and acknowledgements, and attest the execution of any instrument in writing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In opposition, appellees first argue that the proceedings against the Gryboskys were not subject to the oath requirement because the charges against them arose via the commission's independent investigation under R.C. 4112.05(B)(2), which is not subject to the oath requirement. We disagree. The applicable version of R.C. 4112.05(B)(2) states in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"The commission also may conduct, upon its own initiative and\n   <em>\n    independent of the filing of any charges\n   </em>\n   , a preliminary investigation relating to any of the unlawful discriminatory practices described in division (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (I), or (J) of section 4112.02 or in section 4112.021 or 4112.022 of the Revised Code.\" (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4112.05(B)(2) does not apply to housing discrimination claims because these claims are identified in R.C. 4112.02(H), and subsection H is conspicuously absent from R.C. 4112.05(B)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Notwithstanding, appellees claim that its charges against the Gryboskys satisfy the applicable section of the Ohio Administrative Code, i.e., Ohio Adm. Code 4112-3-01(B)(2), and that its noncompliance with the oath requirement in\n   R.C. 4112.05(B)(1) is a technicality that is not jurisdictional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 18} As appellees contend, Ohio Adm. Code 4112-3-01(B)(2) does not require the charges to be made under oath and instead only requires that housing discrimination charges shall be \"signed and affirmed by the complainant\" and state, \"I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 19} \"Administrative rules are designed to accomplish the ends sought by the legislation that has been enacted by the General Assembly.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Like\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ackman\n   </em>\n   considered an argument that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the federal claim based on the plaintiff's alleged failure to first pursue his claim under state law consistent with 29 U.S.C.A. 633(b), which states in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 34} \"(b) Limitation of Federal action upon commencement of State proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 35} \"In the case of an alleged unlawful practice occurring in a State which has a law prohibiting discrimination in employment because of age and establishing or authorizing a State authority to grant or seek relief from such discriminatory practice, no suit may be brought under section 626 of this title before the expiration of sixty days after proceedings have been commenced under the State law, unless such proceedings have been earlier terminated:\n   <em>\n    * * * If any requirement for the commencement of such proceedings is imposed by a State authority other than a requirement of the filing of a written and signed statement of the facts upon which the proceeding is based, the proceeding shall be deemed to have been commenced for the purposes of this subsection at the time such statement is sent by registered mail to the appropriate State authority.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The\n   <em>\n    Ackman\n   </em>\n   court applied 29 U.S.C. 633(b) and held that regardless of whether a plaintiff properly invoked the jurisdiction of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission and complied with the \"niceties\" of state law, \"a letter to the OCRC accompanied by a copy of an EEOC charge constitutes commencement of state proceedings for purposes of the ADEA.\"\n   <em>\n    Ackman,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676965\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/589/768/\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 770.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Thus, we disagree with the Eighth District's decision in\n   <em>\n    GMS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , which is based on cases that did not determine or discuss the issue before us.
