Defendant-appellee is the State of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 30, 2001, the Stark County Grand Jury indicted appellant with two counts of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), felonies of the first degree, and two counts of gross sexual imposition, in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4), felonies of the third degree. At his October 19, 2001 arraignment, appellant plead not guilty to the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant married M.G. [hereinafter the mother] in 1992. Together they had two children, J.G. born June 4, 1992, and D.G., born May 19, 1994. In December 1996, appellant and the mother legally dissolved their marriage and appellant was designated the residential parent. Appellant remained the residential parent until July 1999, when the mother obtained custody of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May, 1999, approximately ten months after the mother obtained custody of the children, D.G. spontaneously revealed that his father had sexually abused him to the babysitter. The babysitter had just turned thirteen years old, and babysat the children on occasion. D.G.'s revelation so shocked the babysitter she did not immediately tell the mother. However, one week later, the babysitter told the mother what D.G. had said.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The mother immediately contacted the police. Canton Police Detective James Armstrong met with the mother on May 9, 2000, along with Diana Ivan, a case worker from the Department of Human Services. Ms. Ivan interviewed the children and made arrangements for the children to be examined at the Akron Children's Hospital CARE Center. Detective Armstrong also contacted appellant, but appellant chose not to speak to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the CARE Center, nurse-practitioner Donna Abbott, and social worker, Sherry Roberts, interviewed the mother without the children present. Ms. Roberts took each child to a private interview room to obtain a physical history from each child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the time of the J.G.'s interview, she was seven years old and in the second grade. Ms. Roberts noted she acted reluctant and embarrassed. J.G. knew she was there to discuss what her father had done, but she was unable to say the words. Instead, J.G. asked if she could write the words. J.G. wrote that her father \"got on top\" of her and \"was wiggling\" and that \"he made [her] take [her] clothes off.\" Then J.G. began verbally engaging in conversation with Ms. Roberts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When J.G. was unable to say certain words, such as \"peepee\" she would write the word on the paper or point to the words that had been written. J.G. told the social worker her father had performed oral sex on her, and that she had been made to perform oral sex on him. J.G. also explained her father had manually and genitally stimulated her genital area. Further, J.G. indicated her father used \"red stuff\" to rub on her genital area to make it hurt less. She further explained appellant \"peed\" white stuff on her stomach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   J.G. told Ms. Roberts this abuse occurred every time she and D.G. slept with appellant in his bed. She indicated these events happened at night with the exception of one occasion, and she further indicated she and her brother did not sleep with appellant that often. J.G. explained that D.G. was asleep when her father would behave in this fashion toward her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ms. Roberts also attempted to talk to D.G. However, D.G. explained he could not discuss the situation. Ms. Roberts ended the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Donna Abbott performed a physical exam and noted no physical findings of abuse to either J.G. or D.G. Ms. Abbott also testified the lack of physical findings\n   was consistent with the type of abuse reported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Prior to trial, on December 5, 2001, the trial court conducted an in-camera voir dire of D.G. and J.G. to determine their competency to testify at trial. After talking to both children, the trial court found each child competent to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the same hearing, the trial court also discussed a pretrial issue raised by the parties. In 1995, J.G. told her grandmother appellant had sexually abused her. DHS became involved in the investigation and conducted an interview with all interested parties, and conducted a physical examination of J.G. After the investigation, DHS concluded the allegations were \"unsubstantiated.\" Therefore, no criminal charges were pursued. December 5, 2001 Hearing Transcript at 48-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Appellant wanted to cross-examine the mother on this issue arguing the allegations of sexual misconduct in 1995, impugned the mother's credibility because they were \"unsubstantiated.\" Tr. at 50. After reviewing case law submitted by the parties, the trial court determined the incident was collateral. The trial court explained if it could be demonstrated the victim of abuse had lied, the victim would be subject to cross-examination pursuant to Evid. R. 608(B). However, because the prior allegations had been found to be merely unsubstantiated (as opposed to being established as false), the trial court found the rape shield law applied to prevent further interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defense counsel clearly indicated it had no intention of cross-examining the child. Rather, appellant sought only to advance the theory the mother and her mother were involved in a plan or scheme to bring about the current charges against his client. Tr. at 53. The trial court indicated it would not permit appellant to attack the mother's credibility at trial with the 1995 allegations. Apparently J.G.'s physical examination had revealed irritation in the vaginal area, no recantation by the child, and no evidence indicating anyone had lied about anything. Accordingly, the trial court excluded the introduction of such evidence. The matter proceeded to trial on December 6, 2001. To the extent the testimony of the witnesses at trial becomes necessary, it will be addressed in the specific assignments of error herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After hearing all of the evidence, the jury found appellant guilty on all charges. The trial court conducted a sentencing hearing on December 10, 2001. In a December 13, 2001 Judgment Entry, the trial court sentenced appellant to serve ten years for each rape count and five years for each gross sexual imposition count. Further, the trial court ordered the rape charges be served consecutively, and the gross sexual imposition charges be served concurrently to each other and the rape charges. It is from this judgment entry appellant prosecutes this appeal, assigning the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"I.

Appellant claims these statements violated his right to due process, and were admitted in contravention of Evid. R. 803.4 and/or Evid. R. 801(D)(1)(C). We find the statements were properly admitted under Evid. R. 803.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, we will not disturb a trial court's evidentiary ruling unless we find said ruling to be an abuse of discretion; i.e. unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment.\n   <em>\n    State v. Adams\n   </em>\n   (1980),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1804294\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/62/151/#p157\">\n    62 Ohio St.2d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=404%20N.E.2d%20144\">\n    404 N.E.2d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Evid. R. 803.4 provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"(4) Statements for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"Statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Appellant first argues J.G.'s statements to the social worker were not for the purposes of medical diagnosis, and therefore, Evid. R. 803.4 does not apply. Specifically, appellant maintains there was no medical diagnosis made at the hospital and no treatment was given to J.G. Appellant argues J.G. knew she was there to talk about her father and was sent there by the State in an attempt to use the medical diagnosis loophole for corroborating evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We find the examinations were for the purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment. The fact the hospital did not diagnose or immediately treat J.G. for any acute medical condition does not negate the fact the interview was conducted for a diagnostic purpose. After a physical examination, the medical records indicated a lack of physical findings. However, Nurse-practitioner Abbott testified no physical findings were expected due to the length of time which had elapsed between the abuse and the examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Accordingly, we do not find the trial court abused it discretion in permitting Ms. Roberts to testify with respect to the statements J.G. made to Ms. Roberts for the purpose of medical diagnosis.

Specifically, appellant claims when a child states he lies a lot, is only seven years old, and lacks short term memory, the trial court errs in permitting a child to testify. We disagree both with appellant's characterization and with his conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The competency of a witness to testify at trial is governed by Evid. R. 601, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"Every person is competent to be a witness except:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"(A) Those of unsound mind, and children under ten years of age, who appear incapable of receiving just impressions of the facts and transactions respecting which they are examined, or of relating them truly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

In demonstrating an abuse of discretion, appellant must show more than error of law or judgment, he must show the trial court's attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant contends this statement indicated D.G. lacked an appreciation\n   of his responsibility to be truthful. Further, appellant points to D.G.'s inability to answer questions about where he had gone to school the previous year and when school would start to demonstrate his lack of short term memory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We have reviewed the entire voir dire testimony of D.G. as contained in Vol. I of the trial transcripts on pages 7-25. After our review of this section, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's determination D.G. was competent to testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Appellant first pointed to D.G.'s inability to answer questions about his school. However, the portion of the transcript upon which appellant relies was quoted out of context, and in an incomplete fashion. The entire quote is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"THE COURT: Now, what grade are you in there?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"[D.G.]: Second.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"THE COURT: Second grade. And how long have you been going to Fairmount?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \"[D.G.]: Ah, six weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \"THE COURT: Okay.

Yes.\" Tr. at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   After completing voir dire, D.G., the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"THE COURT: The young man, [D.G.], presented himself today in front of the Court. He was appropriately dressed-in a pair of cords, I think, and a shirt. He was, his hygiene looked to be more than satisfactory, his hair was neatly-or I guess as neatly combed for the kid as it could be. He, ah, came into the courtroom unhesistantly, if that's a word, came over to the table and sat down. He appeared to be in good spirits, appeared to be aware of his surroundings * * *.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \"I asked him who the people were at the table. As the record will indicate, he knew who they were. You know, I think he understood each person's role.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \"I don't disagree with Mr. Dionisio on the sense that he, he was not very good as to time, as to when he got out of school, but he knew he had to be in school at 7:20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"Ah, he was aware that he went to the same school last year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \"I think some of the questions I asked, probably any judge asks confuses kids on occasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \"But he certainly, he knew the subject matters that he was taking, he knew that he took math, he knew he took cursive, which I think is a good word for a second grader. He lives with his sister, mother, crosses the street with his friends. He's aware of when he has to go, when he has to come.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \"I think he answered appropriately in relationship to and the difference between telling the truth and not telling the truth. He understands that you get in trouble when you tell a lie. It's better to tell the truth. That's not fair to other people if you tell a lie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \"You know, I would give him maybe a C as to the date things, but I would give him better grades as to everything else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \"I think the issues that Mr. Dionisio raises may go more to, to the credibility of this witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \"I think, really, to be honest with you, the telling point to me was the young man says he lies. I said, Have you ever lied before, and he says, Yes, I lie a lot. And to me that's an awareness that the young man knows the difference and I think the issue of credibility, that's an issue of credibility. And I'm going to find that D.G. is competent to testify on tomorrow based upon what I heard and saw here today.\" Tr. at 28-30. (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, appellant contends D.G. testified about events which may have happened when he was only two years old in 1996. Therefore, appellant contends D.G.'s lack of memory is even more important. We disagree with appellant's contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The indictment specified the crimes against D.G. took place in 1998-1999. Counts one and three of the indictment, relating to J.G., were alleged to have taken place between 1996-1999. Because D.G. did not testify about the rape or gross sexual imposition of his sister, we find this argument without merit. D.G. testified about incidents which took place when he was four and five years old. D.G. reported these incidents to his babysitter approximately one year later, when he was approximately six years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We find the trial court's voir dire of D.G. indicated D.G. may had some problems remembering events in the recent past. However, we agree with the trial court, especially in light of the fact D.G.'s memory was not wholly deficient, that this was an issue of credibility for the trier of fact. We also agree with the trial court the fact D.G. admitted he lied a lot not only demonstrated his candor and his willingness to tell the truth, but demonstrated that D.G. knew the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's determination D.G. was competent to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Appellant's second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In appellant's third assignment of error, he maintains his due process rights were violated when the prosecutor submitted evidence in violation of his right to remain silent, and then emphasized the same error by attacking his invocation of this right during her closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   We acknowledge the law within the Ohio district courts of appeal is split on the issue of whether pre-arrest, pre-Miranda silence implicates the assurance from the State such silence will not be used punitively in violation of a defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. The United States Supreme Court has not addressed whether the use of pre-arrest, pre-Miranda silence by the state as substantive evidence of guilt violates the fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. While numerous federal circuits have considered the issue, they have not agreed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuits holding pre-arrest, pre-Miranda silence inadmissible to prove guilt have based their conclusions on the fact the right to remain silent is not derived from Miranda, but from the Fifth Amendment; that the right attaches before\n   the commencement of formal adversary proceedings; and that the right is not limited to persons in custody or charged with a crime.

Perhaps more importantly, use of a defendant's prearrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt substantially impairs the 'sense of fair play' underlying the privilege.

However, another reason to foreclose the use of prearrest silence in the state's case-in-chief is to discourage improper police tactics. To hold otherwise could encourage a delay in reading Miranda warnings so officers could preserve the opportunity to use the defendant's pre-arrest silence as evidence of guilt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant asserts this very argument in his brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Ohio Supreme Court has not explicitly addressed the issue of whether pre-arrest, pre-Miranda silence can be used in the state's case-in-chief.

A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   After reviewing appellant's assignment of error, it appears appellant sets forth six areas in which he claims his trial counsel was ineffective. Appellant claims his trial counsel failed to object at key points, failed to cross examine D.G. on the issue of credibility, failed to move for a mistrial because of prosecutorial misconduct, failed to move for a mistrial for\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   violations, and failure to ask for a curative instruction for such\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   violations, failed to move for a mistrial with regarded to the prosecutor's statement appellant was a \"perpetrator\", and failed to inform the jury one of the victims was an admitted liar. We will address each of appellant's contentions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   First, appellant claims his trial counsel failed to object during the prosecutor's opening statement when she stated defendant had taken away the \"innocence of D.G. and J.G.\" Appellant claims this same remark was repeated without objection in the closing argument. We do not find this comment improper. Accordingly, this portion of appellant's fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Appellant next claims his trial counsel failed to examine D.G. with reference to his credibility despite the fact D.G. admitted he \"lies a lot.\" Appellant further maintains his trial counsel failed to mention the fact D.G. lied a lot to the jury in opening statement, failed to question D.G. about the matter on cross examination during trial, and therefore was unable to argue the fact D.G. was a liar during his closing argument. Appellant also claims his trial counsel failed to object to the prosecutor's questions about D.G. testifying to the truthfulness of individual, irrelevant facts. In so doing, appellant claimed the prosecutor was vouching for the credibility of D.G. and J.G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   We note appellant has failed to reference any specific portion of the record to demonstrate this error. Notwithstanding this fact, we have reviewed the entire record and find no error with regard to any potential failure to object. In fact, after reading appellant's trial counsel's cross examination of D.G., we find it was effective. It clearly demonstrated D.G.'s lack of memory, and highlighted the fact D.G. failed to tell a number of trusted people about his father's conduct, even when presented with the opportunity to share the information privately. We further find the cross-examination was effective in that it impeached D.G.'s credibility without running the risk of alienating the jury. As set forth in our analysis of appellant's second assignment, we find it was a sound trial strategy not to examine D.G. on his propensity to lie. In light of the testimony D.G. had just given, detailing the abuse he suffered, we find it was sound trial strategy to choose to impeach D.G.'s credibility on issues of memory and his decision not to tell trusted family members about the\n   abuse, as opposed to attacking him as a liar. To do so would have risked evoking sympathy for the victim, thereby alienating the jury. Accordingly, this portion of appellant's assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Appellant also asserts his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move for a mistrial based upon prosecutorial misconduct. Again, appellant does not specify what prosecutorial misconduct this argument is based upon, and for that reason alone, we could decline to address the issue. However, in light of the fact that we found no prosecutorial misconduct in the statements previously advanced in appellant's brief, we cannot find appellant's trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move for a mistrial based upon such statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Next, appellant contends his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move for a mistrial on the basis of the prosecutor's improper use of his right to remain silent. However, as discussed above, because appellant received a curative instruction, we can find no prejudice from his trial counsel's failure to object and/or move for a mistrial on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Further, appellant contends his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move for a mistrial because the prosecutor at one point referred to him as \"a perpetrator.\" We agree with appellant this was an improper comment, but our review of the record indicates it was an isolated reference. While appellant's trial counsel should have objected, we can find no reasonable probability the outcome of the trial would be different had such an objection taken place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Finally, appellant claims his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to argue during closing argument that D.G. was an admitted liar. For the same reasons set forth above, we disagree appellant's trial counsel was ineffective for this reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Appellant's fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   In appellant's sixth assignment of error, he maintains it was error to admit the medical records of J.G. and D.G. which included unredacted hearsay statements. Appellant contends these prejudicial statements were introduced in violation of Evid. R. 807. Although the record is not clear where or when, it is clear the trial court and counsel redacted various parts of the medical records. On page 372 of the trial transcript, the trial court admitted the medical records without objection from the defense. However, the trial court permitted both sides to go through the medical records and clip those parts of the records to which they objected. The trial court stated it would rule on those objections after the parties marked the records. On page 506 of the transcript, there is a statement that the exhibits were taken back to the jury room at 12:25 p.m., approximately one hour after jury deliberations had begun. No other objections were lodged on the record relative to the introduction of these exhibits. Accordingly, we review this assignment under the plain error standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   While we agree with appellant some of the statements contained in the medical records were irrelevant and potentially prejudicial, we cannot find the admission of such statements rose to the level of plain error. After reviewing the testimony of the children detailing how and when their father abused them, we cannot find the statements contained within the medical records could sway the jury into creating a manifest injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Accordingly, appellant's sixth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   In appellant's seventh assignment of error, he maintains the cumulative effect of his first through six assignments of error resulted in denial of his right to a fair trial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   We have reviewed each of these assignments of error and will not re-address them here. Further, in light of the fact that we have found no error thus far, we do not find the cumulative effect of no error can amount to the denial of the right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Appellant's seventh assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   VIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   In appellant's eighth assignment of error, he maintains the trial court erred in imposing maximum, consecutive sentences on the rape charges where the trial court failed to list the factors contained in R.C. 2929.14(C), and imposing consecutive sentences pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(E)(4). We agree in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The imposition of a maximum sentence is governed by R.C. 2929.14(C). The statute states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   \"(C) Except as provided in division (G) of this section or in Chapter 2925. of the Revised Code, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a felony may impose the longest prison term authorized for the offense pursuant to division (A) of this section only upon offenders who committed the worst forms of the offense, upon offenders who pose the greatest likelihood of committing future crimes, upon certain major drug offenders under division (D)(3) of this section, and upon certain repeat violent offenders in accordance with division (D)(2) of this section.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The imposition of consecutive sentences is governed by R.C. 2929.14(E). The statute states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   \"(4) If multiple prison terms are imposed on an offender for convictions of multiple offenses, the court may require the offender to serve the prison terms consecutively if the court finds that the consecutive service is necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender and that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public, and if the court also finds any of the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   \"(a) The offender committed one or more of the multiple offenses while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing, was under a sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was under post-release control for a prior offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   \"(b) At least two of the multiple offenses were committed as part of one or more courses of conduct, and the harm caused by two or more of the multiple offenses so committed was so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   \"(c) The offender's history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   R.C. 2929.19, the statute which governs the sentencing hearing, also requires the trial court state its reasons to support the finding(s) used to justify the imposition of a maximum or consecutive sentences.

I believe for D.G. it was a two-year course of conduct. In addition to the acts which were detailed in the State's presentation of the case, there was also acts of physical violence perpetrated by this Defendant against those children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   \"The relationship between you, Mr. Graber, and your children is, of course, the most sacred of relationship between any two humans. In this Court's opinion to give you the shortest term of prison available would certainly demean the course of your conduct. Also, the acts you committed on them and the relationship of their biological father to them, by giving you the shortest range would demean that conduct, but more importantly, it would not adequately protect the public from other people such as yourself who would make a decision to prey on young children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   \"So the Court finds to give you the shortest prison term would not adequately protect the public. The Court further finds under 2929.14 (C) the Defendant committed the two worst forms of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   \"I don't believe that there is any question but that you committed the most serious and most worst form of this particular offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   \"The next issue is whether or not the Court is justified in sentencing you to the shortest or longer range in the classification. Under 2929.14 (C) I am (untranslated steno) would in a sense say that a father is permitted to rape all of his children for as long as he wishes under any condition he chooses and only be punished for one general rape. I find that type of logic to be inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   \"To be honest with you, Mr. Graber, I am getting tired of sentencing fathers and mothers who perpetrate offenses against the most defenseless persons of our society. And for you to commit these acts on each of those children separately for this period of time leaves me no alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   \"Your time to ask for mercy may have been about 15, 10 years ago when you realized the conduct you were engaged in was totally unacceptable and yet you made a conscious decision to perpetrate that kind of conduct. You made a conscious decision to ruin your young children. They will not forget what you did. Make no bones about it. They will remember what you've done for years to come and they're going to have to deal with this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   \"Therefore, based upon the guidelines the Court has indicated, in Count One, rape with regards to J.G., the Court will order that you serve a period of ten years in the appropriate state institution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   \"In regards to Count Three, gross sexual imposition, I will merge with Count One and order you to serve a period of five years in the appropriate state institution, but I will run that concurrently with Count One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   \"In regards to Count Two, rape, I'll order you to serve a period of ten years in the appropriate state institution. I'll run Count Four, gross sexual imposition, as\n   merged and order you to serve five years concurrent with Count Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   \"The ten years is based on the age of the children, the type of facts presented and based upon the guidelines (untranslated steno).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   \"Mr. Dionisio, is there any evidence you wish to submit at this time?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   \"MR. DIONISIO: No, Your Honor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   \"THE COURT: State of Ohio?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   \"MS. REED: Your Honor, the State has nothing further to add.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   \"THE COURT: I think there were victim impact statements, but the Court did not review those prior to trial, therefore, in reviewing the following (untranslated steno). This Defendant is the biological father of the children and in fact I'm not sure what his age is at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   \"MR. DIONISIO: Thirty-seven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   \"THE COURT: If you went back to 1996, he'd be in his 30s. The Court understands he has no prior criminal record. The age of the victims were tender years, three and four years old, a little older. (Untranslated steno.) About his own children. There was no evidence at all that he sought any type of counseling whatsoever. There is no evidence that Mr. Graber suffers from any mental illness or disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   \"And I find it certainly was a demonstrated pattern of abuse with multiple victims. I also find that he displayed and/or threatened cruelty in regards to these acts and the Court finds there was no other evidence to mitigate any of the findings the Court has found.\" Tr. at 528-533.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Further, in its December 13, 2001 Judgment Entry, the trial court stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   \"The Court finds pursuant to Revised Code Section 2929.14(B) that the shortest prison term will demean the seriousness of the defendant's conduct and the shortest prison term will not adequately protect the public for future crime by the defendant or others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   \"Pursuant to Revised Code Section 2929.14(E), the Court finds for the reasons stated on the record that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the defendant and not disproportionate to the seriousness of the defendant's conduct and the danger the defendant poses to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   \"Therefore, the sentences are to be served consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   \"The Court also finds that a maximum basic prison term is inadequate to protect the public because one or more applicable factors under Revised Code Section 2929.12 indicating a defendant is more likely to commit future crimes outweigh any applicable factors indicating that a defendant is less likely to commit future crimes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   The trial court made the requisite findings for the imposition of greater than the minimum term pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B), and the court's decision to impose the maximum prison term for each rape count pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C) was also supported by the appropriate findings and reasons. While the trial court made the requisite findings under R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), it did not make the additional finding required in R.C. 2929.14(E)(4)(a)(b) or (c), and therefore, also failed to state all of the required reasons for the imposition of a consecutive sentence. We note the reasons stated by the trial court in support of the maximum sentences would have supported a finding of consecutive sentences pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(E)(4)(b), however the trial court was required to make such findings before imposing consecutive sentences. Accordingly, this portion of appellant's eighth assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   The December 13, 2001 Judgment Entry of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part as to appellant's convictions but reversed in part as to appellant's sentence. This matter is remanded to the trial court for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Farmer, J. and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Edwards, J., concur\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    Appellant's brief quotes in the transcript only up to this point.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    <em>\n     State v.
