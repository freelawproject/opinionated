Young appeals from his conviction for gambling in violation of Ohio's gaming statute. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On November 12, 2015, Young was charged with six counts of gambling in violation of R.C. 3772.99(E)(5) in Counts 9 through 14 and eight counts of gambling in violation of R.C. 3772.99(E)(7) in Counts 15 through 22, along with a codefendant, Lonnie L. Bridges, who was charged with five counts of gambling in violation of R.C. 3772.99(E)(5) in Counts 1 through 5 and three counts of gambling in violation of R.C. 3772.99(E)(7) in Counts 6 through 8. Both Young and Bridges rejected the state's offer of a plea, as a \"packaged deal,\" and the matter was scheduled for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Prior to trial, both defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, stating that the statutes at issue are unconstitutionally vague as applied to the defendants' dice sliding. Defendants contended that the statutes violate due process because they fail to provide sufficient warning of the proscribed conduct, i.e. they fail to define a proper \"roll.\" The court denied the defendants' motions to dismiss, and the matter proceeded to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At the close of the evidence, the defendants moved for Crim.R. 29 dismissal, which the court denied. At this time,\n   the defendants renewed their motion to dismiss based upon the constitutionality of the statute, which the court also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The jury then returned a guilty verdict as to both Young and Bridges on all respective counts. The court determined the counts do not merge, and it sentenced Young to five years community control. The court found the defendants jointly and severally liable to the casino for restitution in the amount of $39,342. Young and Bridges filed respective appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Evidence at Trial\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On July 25, 2015, Young, Bridges, and a third unidentified male companion entered the Horseshoe Casino in Cleveland, Ohio, and gambled at the craps table designated as number 502. While gambling at table 502, the three men cumulatively won over $39,000, including $18,465 on their final roll. Jennifer Trnavsky, the table supervisor at the time, became suspicious of the dice rolls being thrown by the men because the rolls appeared to be too low to the table and \"didn't have any air under them.\" After Bridges threw the final winning roll, Trnavsky alerted her supervisor and casino surveillance because she was concerned the men might be sliding the dice. The three men left the table immediately after the payout. Trnavsky testified that the men left the table in the middle of a roll, which was unusual because \"whoever was shooting the dice was shooting well.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The actions of Young, Bridges, and their unidentified compatriot were brought to the attention of Agent Jason Slarb from the Ohio Casino Control Commission, a state regulatory authority that oversees the operation of the casinos in Ohio. Agent Slarb is a state law enforcement officer who is posted inside the casino and investigates alleged gaming-related crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Slarb described the technique of \"sliding dice\" as preemptively setting the dice to the number on which you want them to come to a stop and then throwing them in a manner such that they only spin horizontally, with the desired number on top throughout the entire roll. Executed correctly, the die does not rotate vertically or \"tumble\" but rather lands on the craps table and spins or \"slides\" to a stop with the desired number showing. This technique requires skill, and when executed successfully, the individual throwing the dice is able to spin the dice such that they result in the desired numbers for the thrower to win his wager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Sliding the dice, even when the thrower is only partially successful in that one die spins and the other tumbles, drastically alters the element of chance in the game of craps because certain outcomes are eliminated and the odds of the desired outcome being produced are increased. When the thrower is completely successful in that he is able to spin both dice simultaneously, the thrower will have assured himself a winning wager through his manipulation of the dice. The walls of the craps table operate to force dice to tumble, and a correct roll is required to strike the walls to ensure unpredictability. However, the testimony at trial established that table operators rarely call a \"no roll\" when the thrower fails to strike the walls. A dice slider aims for the dice to come to a stop short of the wall so as to ensure that the spun die does not tumble as a result of striking the wall. Even when a dice slider is only partially successful in that only one of the two dice slides as intended, other gamblers at the table can be harmed in that certain dice outcomes upon which they have wagered are rendered unobtainable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Slarb presented surveillance video of 26 different throws executed by Young, Bridges, and their compatriot at table 502. Of the 26 throws presented to\n   the jury, six of the throws appear to represent legitimate throws where the dice tumbled and/or intentionally struck the walls of the craps table, generating a truly random result. Agent Slarb testified that it was a common practice for dice sliders to mix legitimate throws into their pattern to mask their sliding attempts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The remaining 20 throws were attempted slides of the dice with varying success. Of those 20 throws, Young threw six times, Bridges threw four times, and their compatriot threw ten times. Slarb testified that the three men were all constantly betting together based on each other's rolls at the table. The relevant bets were placed on specific outcomes such as \"hard sixes\" or \"hard eights,\" which required the dice outcome to be double threes or double fours, respectively. Michael DePinto, a game shift manager at the casino, also testified that in his review of the surveillance footage, the men would only place such bets when one of the three of them was rolling the dice as opposed to when an unaffiliated gambler at the table was rolling. In each of the 20 throws, the surveillance video reflected, at a minimum, an attempt to slide one or both of the dice on a number consistent with the specific wagers the men had placed on the table.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Agent Slarb testified that physical positioning of a player at the craps table is an important component to dice sliding. The ideal dice sliding location at the table is directly to the left of the \"stick person\" because the stick person is responsible for watching the roll of the dice. When positioned directly to the stick person's left, the thrower is able to shorten the length of the table that the dice must travel, reducing the time for the stick person to view the dice. The surveillance video revealed that Young, Bridges, and their compatriot repeatedly exchanged positions with one another to ensure that whichever of the three was throwing, that person would always throw from the ideal dice-sliding position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In addition to showing the sliding rather than tumbling of the dice across the table, the surveillance footage also reflected the three men repeatedly and meticulously preparing the dice for their intended throw. When the stick man would use the stick to drag the dice to one of the men for them to pick up and throw, the thrower would routinely pick out a die that was already pre-positioned with the desired number showing or manipulate the dice on the table with his hand until they turned to such number. Only then would the thrower pick up the dice and begin his attempt to slide. Barry Ledbetter, a surveillance supervisor at the casino, testified that this type of manipulation changes the outcome, \"the whole mathematics of the game.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Finally, Agent Slarb and Horseshoe casino personnel detailed distractionary techniques employed by the three men to occupy the attention of the table's dealers during the throws and to minimize the opportunity of the dealers to view the sliding of the dice. These techniques included throwing in late wagers with chips and unnecessarily forcing the dealers to conduct cash transactions during rolls despite the ready availability of chips. The men also gave the dealers tips in the form of bets placed on their rolls, which Agent Slarb identified as a technique used when a dice slider is concerned he might be detected and wants the dealer to ignore his sliding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Ledbetter testified that the three men operated as a dice-sliding \"team.\" The team works together to distract the dealer, the stick person, and the box person at the table. Ledbetter explained how the three men worked together simultaneously-positioning themselves advantageously, manipulating\n   the dice to show a certain number, and making late buy-ins with cash-to create confusion at the table in order to successfully slide the dice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Assignments of Error\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I. The trial court erred by denying appellant's motion to dismiss because the statutes resulting in appellant's charges and convictions are unconstitutional.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   II. Appellant's constitutional rights to due process and notice were violated by a lack of specificity in the indictment because it charged him with multiple, similar offenses over a period of time without sufficient differentiation among the counts of misconduct and appellant's convictions were the result of plain error or the ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   III. The court erred by denying appellant's motion in limine to exclude irrelevant and other acts evidence, by admitting irrelevant and other acts evidence over appellant's objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   IV. Appellant was denied a fair trial where an in-court identification was impermissibly suggestive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   V. Appellant's convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and the trial court erred by denying his motion for acquittal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   VI. The convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   VII. The trial court erred by ordering restitution without determining the amount that was actually owed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   VIII. The trial court erred by failing to merge all allied offenses of similar import and by imposing separate sentences for allied offenses which violated appellant's state and federal rights to due process and protections against double jeopardy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Constitutionality of R.C. 3772.99\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In his first assignment of error, Young challenges the constitutionality of Ohio's gaming statute. Specifically, Young contends that R.C. 3772.99(E)(5) and 3772.99(E)(7) are unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 17} A statute is unconstitutionally vague if the statute \" 'fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute.' \"\n   <em>\n    Solon v.

The dice slider was convicted of cheating at gaming in violation of Nevada's gaming statutes, Nev.Rev.Stat. 465.070(7) and 465.083. Skipper challenged his conviction, arguing that the statutes are unconstitutionally vague because they fail to alert the average dice player that dice sliding constitutes a criminal act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8557626\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/110/1031/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Nev.Rev.Stat. 465.070(7), entitled \"Fraudulent Acts,\" makes it unlawful \"[t]o manipulate, with the intent to cheat, any component of a gaming device in a manner contrary to the designed and normal operational purpose for the component, * * * with knowledge that the manipulation affects the outcome of the game or with knowledge of any event that affects the outcome of the game.\" Nev.Rev.Stat. 465.083 makes it unlawful to \"cheat\" at any gambling game. Nevada's gaming statute defined \"cheating\" as \"[altering] the elements of chance, method of selection or criteria,\" which determine either \"the result of a game\" or \"the amount or frequency of payment in a game.\" Nev.Rev.Stat. 465.015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The Nevada Supreme Court stated that dice sliding uses\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   a methodology of play that is based upon a purposefully orchestrated combination of factors designed to change the nature of play through affirmative acts of cheating and deception.

That court also found that the statute was not vague because the average person would understand that manipulation of the dice in order to affect the outcome of the game constituted cheating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Similarly, Ohio's gambling statute proscribes conduct that includes making a wager \"after acquiring knowledge that is not available to all players and concerns the outcome of the casino game\" and \"claim[ing], collect [ing], tak[ing], or attempt[ing] to claim, collect, or take money\" from a casino game with the \"intent to defraud.\" Just as in\n   <em>\n    Skipper\n   </em>\n   , Young, Bridges, and their compatriot manipulated the dice and used each other as distractions to the dealers in order to alter the outcome of the game. Unbeknownst to other players at table 502, Young, Bridges, and the third person had knowingly and purposefully manipulated the dice in such a manner that the other players' chances at winning were either greatly decreased or eliminated entirely. When Young was not attempting to manipulate the dice himself, he was placing bets on his compatriots' rolls in an attempt to benefit from their dice sliding. The evidence shows that Young would only bet on certain outcomes, such as \"hard eights\" and \"hard sixes,\" and he would only place his bets when one of the three men was rolling the dice, because he knew in advance what outcome the men were attempting to achieve by sliding the dice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 31} We, too, find that a person of average intelligence who plays the game of craps would have no difficulty understanding that such action-dice sliding and using distractions to avoid being caught-is \"acquiring knowledge that is not available to all players and concerns the outcome of the casino game\" and placing wagers on a predetermined roll is \"claim[ing], collect[ing], tak[ing], or attempt[ing] to claim, collect, or take money\" in a casino game with the \"intent to defraud.\" We therefore do not find R.C. 3772.99(E)(5) and 3772.99(E)(7) unconstitutionally vague as applied to Young's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Specificity in the Indictment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Young's second assignment of error challenges the specificity of the indictment. Young was charged in the indictment with six counts of gambling in violation of R.C. 3772.99(E)(5) and eight counts of gambling in violation of R.C. 3772.99(E)(7). He contends that because the indictment charged him with multiple, similar offenses over a period of time without sufficient differentiation of the counts, his constitutional rights to due process and notice were violated. Young argues that his conviction as a result of the unspecified indictment was plain error. In the alternative, he argues ineffective assistance of counsel for the failure to object to the form of the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Young's trial counsel did not object to the form of the indictment.

This case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   , however, because the evidence presented at trial, through Agent Slarb's testimony and the video of Young's gameplay at the craps table, provided sufficient differentiation among the counts. Slarb presented 20 distinct video surveillance clips of 20 different throws that were executed either by Young, Bridges, or the third unidentified male who were working in tandem to slide dice at table 502. Each video represents a violation of R.C. 3772.99(E)(5) and/or 3772.99(E)(7), depending on who was throwing the dice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Slarb identified the specific conduct in each of the videos that demonstrated how the three men, working together, either attempt to slide dice, successfully slide dice, or act to distract the dealer by throwing cash on the table for a late buy-in. Six of these video clips show Young attempting to slide the dice. And all of the videos show Young, Bridges, and/or their compatriot placing bets only when one of the three men was rolling the dice, as well as attempting to collect, or collecting, their winnings, which was dependent upon the success of the dice slide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Because we find the evidence presented sufficiently differentiated the counts contained in Young's indictment, we find no error. Young's second assignment of error is therefore overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Other Acts Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 46} In his third assignment of error, Young contends the trial court erred by allowing the state to introduce the testimony of Andrew Ford. Ford was a surveillance supervisor for the French Lick Casino in Indiana in 2008. Ford testified that on January 7, 2008, a stick person alerted surveillance to a patron, later identified as Young, who was attempting to slide the dice at the craps table. Ford explained that he observed Young place a bet on \"hard eights\" along with a \"hopping hard eight\" bet and set the dice on the number four before throwing the dice. Ford also explained that instead of rolling the dice in the air, Young \"would twist them and slide [the dice] across the table forward to turn, but not roll, and stay on the same number, and they would come up short of the wall.\" Ford testified that he observed this conduct approximately four times. Ford stated that the shooter was always placing bets on the \"hard eight,\" which was a 9 to 1 wager, as well as the \"hot eight,\" which is a 30 to 1 wager, and he would place a $25 \"dealer tote bet\" that the dealer gets if the shooter wins. Ford also testified that the rules of craps are the same in every state. Young argues that this evidence was offered solely to prove that he acted in conformity with his past conduct in attempting to cheat at a casino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Young also contends that the court erred in allowing the testimony of Thomas Miller, a gaming agent for the Ohio Casino Control Commission. Miller testified concerning Bridges's attempted dice slide on a craps table at the Hollywood Columbus Casino in Columbus in 2014. Young argues that he was prejudiced by evidence that related solely to his codefendant, Bridges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Evid.R. 404(B), \"other acts,\" provides that evidence of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.\" Such evidence may, however, be admissible to prove \"motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20519324\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Similarly, R.C. 2945.59, which provides certain exceptions to the common law regarding the admission of evidence of other acts of wrongdoing, provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [i]n any criminal case in which the defendant's motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant's scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant's scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state introduced evidence of Ford's testimony for a relevant and legitimate purpose under Evid.R. 404(B) -to establish Young's knowledge of how to play the game of craps and to demonstrate the absence of mistake in Young's conduct at the craps table. Secondly, the trial court mitigated any potential prejudice by providing a limiting jury instruction concerning the testimony of both witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23, citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Prior to Ford's testimony, the trial court advised the jury that some evidence is admitted for limited purposes and should not be considered to prove the character of the defendant or that he acted in conformity with that character; rather, that evidence can only be considered for the purposes of deciding whether it proves the absence of a mistake, knowledge, or the defendant's motive or intent. The trial court also specifically instructed the jury to consider Ford's testimony only as it applies to Young, if at all, and to consider Miller's testimony only as it applies to Bridges if at all. We presume the jury follows a trial judge's curative instructions.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 53} However, even if the record could be construed to constitute a violation of Evid.R. 404(B), we find any error in the admission of Ford's and Miller's testimony to be harmless pursuant to Crim.R. 52(A).\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the state presented the live Skype testimony of Andrew Ford, from the French Lick Casino in Indiana. As discussed in the previous assignment of error, Ford testified concerning Young's conduct at the Indiana casino in 2008 relating to Young's knowledge of the game of craps. We found no error in the trial court permitting Ford's testimony under Evid.R. 404(B). Ford's testimony was admitted for the sole purpose of demonstrating that Young knew how to play craps and to demonstrate absence of mistake in Young's conduct at the craps table.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 58} In the course of this testimony, Ford explained how the casino identified Young through a facial recognition program as the player at the craps table \"doing short rolls.\" Ford stated that the casino used this program to match faces in a database of people who have cheated at casinos previously. Ford testified that through the use of the facial recognition program, he connected the face in the surveillance video of the Indiana casino on January 7, 2008, to the name \"Kenneth Deshawn Young.\" When asked if he could identify Young, Ford replied that he could. Because Ford's testifying via Skype presented certain technical challenges concerning Ford's ability to see who was in the courtroom, the court directed the defendants to stand in front of the screen, where Ford could see them. Ford immediately identified Young, in the courtroom, as the individual at the Indiana casino in 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 59} This identification, however, serves to support Ford's testimony under Evid.R. 404(B) and confirm that the defendant, Young, was in fact, the person Ford knew from the Indiana casino (or that Ford knew what Young looked like). Ford's identification of Young was not offered for the purpose of identifying Young as the individual sliding dice at the Horseshoe Casino in Cleveland on July 25, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Moreover, Young has failed to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by the allegedly suggestive identification. Upon entering the Horseshoe Casino in July 2015, Young presented his driver's license for identification purposes to casino security. Agent Slarb testified that this identification was placed on a \"podium camera\" and he was therefore able to identify Young through casino surveillance. Agent Slarb also identified Young in the courtroom as one of the three men sliding dice at table 502.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 61} We therefore find the trial court did not err in permitting the Evid.R. 404(B) identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Young's fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Sufficiency and Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 63} In his fifth and sixth assignments of error, Young contends that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 64} When assessing a challenge of sufficiency of the evidence, a reviewing court examines the evidence admitted\n   at trial and determines whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    State v.

He also argues the fact that he and Bridges provided identification upon entering the casino, when it is not required,\n   demonstrates a lack of intent to defraud the casino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 69} As previously discussed, R.C. 3772.99(E) prohibits an individual from placing a wager \"on the outcome of a casino game after acquiring knowledge that is not available to all players and concerns the outcome of the casino game that is the subject of the wager\" and \"claim[ing], collect[ing], tak[ing], or attempt[ing] to collect\" money from a casino game \"with the intent to defraud.\" R.C. 3772.99(E)(5) and (7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 70} The state presented the testimony of Agent Slarb, who explained Young's conduct, along with the conduct of Young's companions, at the craps table. The video surveillance identified 20 of the 26 rolls at table 502 as attempts to slide or successful slides. Slarb testified that even if only one of the dice tumbles, and the other dice remains fixed to the number set by the slider, the attempt is still a violation because it greatly decreases, or eliminates entirely, the chances of others betting at the table who do not have the advanced knowledge of the fixed number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 71} The video clips depict the three men alternately presetting one or both dice to a fixed number-either a three or a four-before releasing them in a manner that ensured that one or both of the dice would spin, or slide, across the table, rather than tumble, and remain fixed on that particular number. Slarb testified that the slide was evidenced by the lack of shadow under the dice. Jennifer Trnavsky testified that there was no \"air\" under the dice. Six of these video clips show Young attempting to slide the dice. As explained by Slarb, all of the videos show Young, Bridges, and/or their compatriot placing bets only when one of the three men was rolling the dice, as well as attempting to collect, or collecting, their winnings (which was dependent upon the success of the dice slide) on these mutually beneficial rolls. The evidence also demonstrated that the three men repeatedly exchanged positions with one another to ensure that whichever of the three was throwing, that person would always throw from the ideal dice sliding position, which was to the left of the stick person. Slarb also testified that the men consistently worked together, with one of the men attempting the slide while the other men used distractionary tactics to confuse the dealer or distract his or her attention from the slider's manipulation of the dice, especially through late cash buy-ins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Although it is true that casino personnel failed to detect the trio's dice sliding until codefendant Bridges's final roll when they won $18,465 and the table supervisor, Jennifer Trnavsky, alerted surveillance, the fact that Young and his companions were skilled at manipulating the dice and hiding their manipulation of the dice does not undermine the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the state. The dice sliding in this case is very difficult to detect with the naked eye in real time, which is evidenced by the casino employees' failure to do so. However, with the benefit of frame-by-frame analysis of the surveillance footage, the dice sliding efforts of the three men become very obvious. Repeatedly, Young and his companions can be seen loading up bets on a very specific outcome of the dice-often double threes-and only when one of them is throwing the dice. A hindsight review of the surveillance footage leaves no ambiguity in what the men were attempting to, and did, in fact, accomplish. And Slarb's description of the activity occurring at table 502 was necessary and proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 73} Young's argument that he and Bridges provided identification upon entering the casino is evidence that they had no intention to defraud the casino is without\n   merit. The surveillance supervisor testified that the casino requests identification of any individual entering the casino who appear to be under 30 years of age. It is likely that casino security requested identification from Young, and Young had no say in the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 74} In light of the foregoing, we find the state provided sufficient evidence to support Young's convictions for placing a wager on the outcome of a casino game after acquiring knowledge that is not available to all players that concerns the outcome of the game and his convictions for claiming, collecting, or attempting to claim or collect money from a casino game with the intent to defraud. And for the reasons outlined above, we also find the conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The purposeful attempt to surreptitiously alter the element of chance in the craps game in favor of Young and his companions, whether by manipulating the dice or participating in the scheme by distracting the dealers and placing wagers, was easily discernible from the surveillance video. The jury did not lose its way in convicting Young.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 75} Young's fifth and sixth assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Restitution\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 76} Young challenges the court's order of restitution in his seventh assignment of error. He contends that the court erred by ordering restitution that was not supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 77} We note, initially, that Young failed to object to the order of restitution or the amount of restitution ordered at sentencing.

Depinto testified that the casino's surveillance team conducted an in-depth review of the video footage of the night of July 25, 2015. The team reviewed each individual roll at the craps table from the three individuals allegedly involved in the dice-sliding operation to determine the exact amount of monetary loss to the casino, and the director of surveillance determined the total amount of loss to the casino resulting from all of the rolls combined was $39,342. Depinto testified that this amount included the payouts for all three individuals who were under surveillance for dice sliding on the evening of July 25. Depinto explained that because the three men worked together, the losses from all of the men were combined. Moreover, during the trial, Depinto testified that he, along with the surveillance team, reviewed the surveillance footage of the dice sliding and the attempted slides and they determined that during the final six rolls alone the payout was $35,022.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 82} Upon review, we find no abuse of discretion.
