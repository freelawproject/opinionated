This is his appeal from a judgment in the Superior Court dismissing his civil action brought under G. L. c. 30A in which he sought judicial review of the denial of his grievance (no. 83733) as well as monetary damages. In October, 2011, a correction officer seized from the plaintiff nineteen books of postage stamps, each book containing ten stamps, as contraband and issued a disciplinary report (no. 238446).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As required, the prison held the stamps for the next three years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In September, 2015, the stamps not yet having been returned, the plaintiff filed a grievance demanding \"the amount owed me; that is, the 19 books or the $83.09.\" The plaintiff's grievance was denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff's administrative appeal likewise was denied by the defendant and the plaintiff filed in Superior Court the present action under G. L. c. 30A in January, 2016. The property department at the prison returned five stamp books to the plaintiff, see note 1,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , in July, 2016; the remaining fourteen books were, at the plaintiff's request, picked up by a member of the plaintiff's family. After the stamps had been returned, the defendant successfully moved to have the action dismissed as moot. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Because the defendant returned all the stamps seized, either to the plaintiff or, at the plaintiff's request, to the plaintiff's family, the plaintiff already has \"obtained all the relief to which he could be entitled, and he no longer has a cognizable interest in whether the [decision denying his grievance] was lawfully issued.\"\n   <em>\n    Quinn\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gjoni\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456690\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/89/408/#p414\">\n    89 Mass.

We pause only to consider the plaintiff's argument that the action remains live because he demanded a declaration, money damages, and court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Because the plaintiff \"challenges an administrative decision relating to his particular case,\" that is, a decision denying his grievance, he properly sought review under G.
