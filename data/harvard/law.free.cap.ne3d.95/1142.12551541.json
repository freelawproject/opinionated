Russell appeals from the July 27, 2016 denial of his \"Motion for Declaratory Judgments.\" We hereby affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Russell was convicted, after a jury trial, of rape, gross sexual imposition, pandering obscenity involving a minor, and sexual battery. This court affirmed his conviction and 75-year sentence on September 21, 2012.\n   <em>\n    State v. Russell\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist. Clark No. 2011-CA-10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-4316\">\n    2012-Ohio-4316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204328657\">\n    2012 WL 4328657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Russell filed his motion on May 4, 2015, seeking a declaratory judgment from the trial court that two prosecuting attorneys involved in his trial committed prosecutorial misconduct. Russell's motion provides in part: \"These judgments are needed as evidence to restore the right to State-level appeal and as legal tools to assist in pursuing other remedies lawfully available to the Movant. No actual relief from judgment is being requested, only answers to the controversy of legality of the activities related to the questions presented.\" Specifically, the motion presented the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \u2022 Did David Andrew Wilson conduct an inflammatory opening outside the lawful parameters of Ohio Criminal Rule 24(A) ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 Did David Andrew Wilson establish the proper foundational parameters for presenting the testimony of Dr. Jim Duffee?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Does the expert testimony of Erica Moore, presented by David Andrew Wilson fall within the legal parameters of admissibility?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Does the confession sited in the Appeal Response by Lisa Fannin actually exist for the purposes of appellate review?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Did David Andrew Wilson remain within the legal and professional parameters of his office when presenting the State's Closing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Multiple portions of the trial transcript are attached to the motion. The conclusion of the motion provides: \"The Court is asked to note, however, that the issues in this motion involve additional questions outside the sphere of the appellate process. Lastly, it is asked that the\n   Honorable Richard J. O'Neill recuse [sic] from this issue as he presided over the actions of 2009-CR-0873.\" The trial court denied Russell's motion without analysis, finding it \"not well taken.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Russell asserts two assignments of error herein. His first assignment of error is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT FAILED TO RULE ON A CLEAR CONTROVERSY AS REQUIRED UNDER O.R.C. \u00a7 2721.01 ETC[.] AND THEREBY FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE CLEAR-ON-THE-RECORD ERRORS PRESENTED BY MR. RUSSELL CONCERNING THE CONDUCT OF DAVID ANDREW WILSON AND LISA FANNIN IN REGARD TO 2009-CR-0873 AND THE SUBSEQUENT APPEAL 2011-CA-0010.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Russell directs our attention to several sections of his trial transcript which he asserts demonstrate prosecutorial misconduct. Russell asserts as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Russell, in his motion for declaratory judgment, clearly showed errors of law related to 2009-CR-0873 and requested the Clark County Court of Common Pleas to declare where appropriate the actions of the named Respondents outside the law thereby granting Mr. Russell tools needed to pursue remedies of law. His appellate counsel failed him by not bringing these errors to the attention of the Appellate Court and due to the unlawful nature of the legal library at LeCI [sic] could not raise in time a motion to reopen due to this ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, Mr. Russell needs a court to recognize the unlawfulness detailed above to produce a tool for use in the reopening of rights to present these issues previously denied due to issues outside of his control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The State's response will likely include details of the charges against him, including the time of his sentence and other defamatory statements. Please note the declaratory judgment is a tool meant to restore the right to challenge the lawfulness of the trial which resulted in that conviction. While the conviction does have a strong presumption of correctness, the existence of the conviction should not be in and of itself evidence used to block the efforts to fight the conviction, be it direct challenges or sufficient lawful evidence (including the clearly cajoled statements given to police) to demonstrate a crime was even committed. Furthermore, he is college educated with two honors degrees and an [sic] Veteran who honorably served this nation during a time of war, defending the Constitution which was ignored by David Andrew Wilson during this procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The State responds that \"declaratory judgments may not be used to collaterally attac[k] [Russell's] convictions\" or as a means of appellate review. We agree with the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} R.C. 2721.03 provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   * * * [A]ny person whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a constitutional provision, statute, rule as defined in section 119.01 of the Revised Code, municipal ordinance, township resolution, contract, or franchise may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument, constitutional provision, statute, rule, ordinance, resolution, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations under it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 9} \"A common pleas court generally has the power under the Declaratory Judgments Act to 'declare rights, status, and other legal relations,' and its\n   'declaration has the effect of a final judgment or decree.'

Declaratory judgment is a civil remedy typically invoked at the outset of a civil case.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 11} We conclude that Russell's claims of prosecutorial misconduct are the proper subject of a direct appeal (and barred by res judicata), and that his motion for declaratory judgment is accordingly not within the spirit of R.C. 2721.03. Russell's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Russell's second assignment of error is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   JUDGE RICHARD O'NEILL SHOULD HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM THE ISSUE WHEN IT WAS CLEAR THE QUESTIONS PRESENTED DID REFLECT POORLY ON HIS GATE-KEEPING ABILITIES AS JUDGE IN 2009-CR-0873.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} According to Russell, \"Mr. O'Neill should have shown judicial prudence by either giving an honest hearing of the motion or removing himself from the issue when it was clear he could not give it a fair hearing.\" Russell asserts that the \"judgment entry from the Court of Common Pleas is a clear manifestation of judicial cowardice, an unwillingness for a member of the court to pass judgment on a Prosecutor that may in turn reflect poorly on his ability to control his court and ensure the rights of people brought before\n   him are protected.\" Russell appears to suggest that the trial court's entry is not a final, appealable order since it does not contain findings of fact and conclusions of law, relying in part on\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Russell asserts that if \"this court believes the judgment entry does not demonstrate a final appealable order, Mr. Russell ask this court, if possible, to not remand it back to the Clark County Court of Common Pleas or at least remove Judge O'Neill from the duty of making the ruling.\" The State responds that Russell failed to comply with R.C. 2701.03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} We initially note that Russell's reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mapson\n   </em>\n   is misplaced; those cases involve a trial court's failure to provide findings of fact and conclusions of law in denying a timely petition for post-conviction relief, as required by R.C. 2953.21(H). Russell was not entitled to findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the trial court's entry is a final appealable order in the absence thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} As this Court has noted, \" '[t]he disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy.' * * *.
