Moran, appeals from an order of a single justice of this court, acting on an information filed by the Board of Bar Overseers (board), suspending him from the practice of law for nine months. We vacate the order and remand the case for the entry of an order suspending the respondent from the practice of law for fifteen months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . Bar counsel filed an amended five-count petition for discipline with the board alleging multiple acts of misconduct in connection with the respondent's handling of the affairs of two elderly clients, both of whom are now deceased. Two counts alleged that the respondent charged excessive fees;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that he failed to inform his clients of fees for services rendered and fee withdrawals;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that he held\n   the clients' funds in nontrust accounts;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that he drafted testamentary instruments for both clients that included substantial testamentary gifts to himself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two other counts concerned the respondent's conduct as executor for the same clients' estates. They alleged that the respondent failed to render diligent and competent services;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   that he charged and collected excessive fees;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   that he failed to hold estate funds in segregated\n   interest-bearing accounts;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   that he negotiated and withdrew estate funds before his appointment as executor;\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that he intentionally misrepresented, under oath, the amount of estate assets in a probate court filing for one estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fifth count charged misconduct in connection with trust accounts and trust funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The respondent answered and asserted certain facts in mitigation. See S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 8 (3), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=453%20Mass.%201310\">\n    453 Mass. 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (\"[a]verments in the petition are admitted when not denied in the answer\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A hearing committee of the board conducted an evidentiary hearing and determined that bar counsel had proved, with limited exceptions, the petition's allegations. A majority of the committee recommended that the respondent be publicly reprimanded; a dissenting member found additional facts supporting violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.8 (c),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=426%20Mass.%201338\">\n    426 Mass. 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) (substantial testamentary gifts), and recommended a greater sanction. Both the respondent and bar counsel appealed to the board. The board adopted the dissenting hearing committee member's factual findings concerning the additional misconduct, and the hearing committee's findings as to remaining misconduct and the factors in aggravation. It voted to recommend that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for nine months, as well as that a reinstatement hearing be required on any petition for reinstatement. It also recommended that the respondent be permitted to apply for reinstatement after six months of suspension. The board filed a corresponding information in the county court. After a hearing, a single justice considered and discussed at length each of the respondent's contentions. She ordered that the respondent be suspended for a period of nine months, with the additional requirement of a reinstatement hearing. The respondent appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the evidence of misconduct\n   </em>\n   . The single justice reviewed the record establishing the misconduct charged in the petition, accepted the hearing committee's role as the \"sole judge of the credibility of the testimony presented at the hearing,\" S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 8 (5) (a), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=453%20Mass.%201310\">\n    453 Mass. 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009), and determined that the board's findings concerning the respondent's misconduct were supported by substantial evidence. See\n   <em>\n    Matter of Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5685100\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/452/1010/#p1011\">\n    452 Mass. 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1011,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=893%20N.E.2d%20783\">\n    893 N.E.2d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). On appeal,\n   \"[w]e review the single justice's decision (on issues other than the initial choice of a sanction at the disciplinary stage) to determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion or clear error of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Weiss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174266\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/1001/#p1002\">\n    474 Mass. 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1002,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20N.E.3d%201024\">\n    46 N.E.3d 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). There was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    General claims of error\n   </em>\n   . The respondent does not mount a substantial challenge on appeal to the weight of the evidence supporting the most serious charges of misconduct found by the board. He contends generally that the hearing committee and the board improperly relied on the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct, S.J.C. Rule 3:07,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=426%20Mass.%201303\">\n    426 Mass. 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), because the rules themselves were not offered in evidence at the hearing, and the hearing committee did not notify the parties that it would take notice of them, pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (5). As the single justice recognized, however, \u00a7 11 (5) pertains to judicially noticed\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   , not rules of court concerning attorney discipline. The board and its hearing committee may take notice of the disciplinary\n   rules as a matter of course. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Assessors of Boston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"520518\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/344/268/#p269\">\n    344 Mass. 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=182%20N.E.2d%20138\">\n    182 N.E.2d 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1962) (in Appellate Tax Board proceedings, \"[t]he rules of the board are necessarily before it in all the cases which it hears\"); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 202 (2018) (judicial notice of law, including Massachusetts statutes, common law, rules of court, and codified regulations); M.S. Brodin &amp; M. Avery, Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 2.8.1, at 54 (2018), and cases cited (general or public law of Commonwealth judicially noticed without request).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   There was likewise no error in the hearing committee's and the board's reliance on the respondent's answer to the amended petition for discipline. Under applicable rules, admissions contained in a pleading are considered established, and there is no additional requirement that the pleading itself be introduced in evidence. See S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 8 (3) (a), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=453%20Mass.%201310\">\n    453 Mass. 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (averments in petition for discipline are deemed admitted if not denied in answer); Rule 3.15(d) of the Rules of the Board of Bar Overseers (2009) (same). Cf. Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 611 note on binding admissions, at 134 (2018), and cases cited (statement of fact or declaration in pleading is binding admission and relieves opposing party of need to present evidence on issue); Mass. R. App. P. 8 (a), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20Mass.%20932\">\n    378 Mass. 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979) (record on appeal includes pleadings); 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(10)(k) (1998) (record of adjudicatory proceedings includes pleadings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The respondent's remaining arguments primarily focus on three issues related to the board's determination that he charged or collected clearly excessive fees. See Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.5, as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=459%20Mass.%201301\">\n    459 Mass. 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (lawyer shall not \"charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee\"). As we discuss below, none of those claims has merit. Moreover, from a disciplinary perspective, they are also largely beside the point because of the other very serious misconduct charged and found by the board, the consequences of which are more severe than those associated with charging a clearly excessive fee. We therefore address the more serious allegations of misconduct first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    False statement\n   </em>\n   . In connection with his representation of one client, the respondent filed an estate inventory with the probate court, which he signed under oath, that knowingly misrepresented estate assets.\n   <em>\n    Matter of Neitlich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902498\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/413/416/#p422\">\n    413 Mass. 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 422-423,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=597%20N.E.2d%20425\">\n    597 N.E.2d 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) (knowing misrepresentation to court concerning terms of pending transaction warranted one-year suspension). As the board observed, the respondent's misrepresentation\n   effectively obscured from the probate court's review certain payments that he either had made or expected to make, including payments to himself. This conduct violated Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.3 (a) (1), and 8.4 (c), (d), and (h),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=426%20Mass.%201383\">\n    426 Mass. 1383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Testamentary gifts\n   </em>\n   . Over the course of years, the respondent prepared a series of wills and durable powers of attorney for these clients, neither of whom he was related to by blood or marriage. The final durable power of attorney for each client appointed the respondent as attorney-in-fact, and each will nominated him as the executor. Each will bequeathed all of the client's tangible personal property to the respondent, and included a request that the respondent distribute the items as the client might subsequently indicate. One will also made specific bequests to individuals and charities. By preparing testamentary instruments for two clients providing for substantial testamentary gifts to\n   himself, the respondent violated Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.8 (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Matter of Wainwright\n   </em>\n   , 28 Mass. Att'y Discipline Rep. 883, 883 (2012) (public reprimand). The rule strictly proscribes such gifts, even in the absence of undue influence, overreaching, fraud, or misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=426%20Mass.%201383\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=426%20Mass.%201383\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Lack of diligence\n   </em>\n   . The hearing committee's findings amply support its conclusion that the respondent engaged in lengthy delays in settling both estates. By failing to marshal and liquidate estate assets promptly, resulting in unnecessary expense and escheat of some assets, failing to file timely estate inventories, and delaying distribution of estate assets for years, while simultaneously failing to complete probate of the estates, the respondent's conduct violated Mass.

Prof. C. 1.2 (a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=426%20Mass.%201310\">\n    426 Mass. 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) (failure to seek client's lawful objectives); Mass.

See\n   <em>\n    Matter of Bottomly\n   </em>\n   , 2 Mass. Att'y Discipline Rep. 19, 22 (1980) (beneficiaries harmed by lawyer's delay in making restitution; six month suspension warranted). See also\n   <em>\n    Matter of Munroe\n   </em>\n   , 26 Mass. Att'y Discipline Rep. 385 (2010);\n   <em>\n    Matter of Reardon\n   </em>\n   , 22 Mass. Att'y Discipline Rep. 640, 646 (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Trust account violations\n   </em>\n   . The amended petition for discipline charged the respondent with numerous client trust account and accounting violations. The respondent failed to hold personal funds of his clients, and funds belonging to their estates, in trust accounts, in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.15 (b) (1), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20Mass.%201338\">\n    440 Mass. 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n   <em>\n    Admonition No. 05-20\n   </em>\n   , 21 Mass. Att'y Discipline Rep. 712 (2005). He failed to disclose to his clients the payments he made to himself, in violation of Mass. R. Prof. 1.15 (d), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20Mass.%201338\">\n    440 Mass. 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), and failed to keep required trust account records. The respondent did not dispute the majority of these charges, and the hearing committee found the respondent had violated the applicable rules. Together, these violations would ordinarily support a public reprimand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   See\n   <em>\n    Matter of Beatrice\n   </em>\n   , 23 Mass. Att'y Discipline Rep. 31 (2007);\n   <em>\n    Matter of Soforenko\n   </em>\n   , 22 Mass. Att'y Discipline Rep. 732 (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   f.\n   <em>\n    Excessive fees\n   </em>\n   . As stated, the respondent's primary focus is on three issues related to the board's determination that he charged or collected clearly excessive fees. See Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.5. The single justice correctly concluded that there was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Spreadsheets\n   </em>\n   . First, the respondent contends that the hearing committee erred in permitting the use of certain spreadsheets that had been prepared as \"chalks\" by bar counsel at the hearing. The spreadsheets summarized approximately 750 pages of the respondent's handwritten notes describing the services he performed for both clients over the course of many years, and classified the services into various categories. Although the respondent contends that the\n   choice to classify certain tasks as either legal or nonlegal impermissibly interjected bar counsel's opinion into the chalk, the handwritten notes themselves were admitted in evidence and the hearing committee conducted its own review of them. In these circumstances, the single justice concluded that the hearing committee did not abuse its discretion in permitting the use of the spreadsheets as chalks, and the respondent failed to demonstrate prejudicial error in that regard. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Greenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3850977\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/339/557/#p581\">\n    339 Mass. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 581-582,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20N.E.2d%20181\">\n    160 N.E.2d 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959) (\"judge could properly find that concise schedules demonstrating the transactions would be helpful to the jury). See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 1006 (2018) (\"proponent may use a summary, chart, or the like to prove the content of voluminous writings or records that cannot be conveniently examined in court\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Expert witness\n   </em>\n   . Second, the respondent contends that the hearing committee erred in qualifying a witness as an expert at the hearing, and that there was an inadequate factual basis for his opinion. The hearing committee's findings establish, however, that the witness has many years of experience in numerous aspects of probate law, and previously has been qualified and testified as an expert in bar discipline cases. The respondent has not demonstrated that the committee abused its discretion in qualifying the witness as an expert or in crediting his testimony. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mahoney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885519\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/406/843/#p852\">\n    406 Mass. 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 852,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=550%20N.E.2d%201380\">\n    550 N.E.2d 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (tribunal has broad discretion to qualify an expert witness, and its determination \"will not be upset on appeal if any reasonable basis appears for it\"). Likewise, the respondent failed to demonstrate that there was an inadequate factual basis for the expert's opinion as to the unreasonableness of the respondent's fees. While the expert did not review all 750 pages of the respondent's handwritten notes, he testified that he verified and cross-checked a sufficient portion of the materials to satisfy himself as to the accuracy of the spreadsheets. Moreover, the hearing committee conducted its own review of the respondent's records and notes. The committee was therefore within\n   its discretion in admitting the expert's testimony in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   iii.\n   <em>\n    Due process\n   </em>\n   . Third, the respondent complains that the hearing committee failed to give him a full and fair hearing because, he contends, it unfairly limited his testimony and prohibited him from relying on the approximately 750 pages of handwritten notes during his testimony. The single justice correctly rejected both points. Although nine days initially were allocated for the hearing, the hearing committee indicated that more would be scheduled if necessary. The respondent concedes that he did not exhaust the initial time allotment, and he does not suggest anything he would have done differently if additional time had been scheduled. With respect to reliance on the notes, the committee specifically instructed that it would permit the respondent to refer to them \"for a particular point to be made,\" which he in fact did. \"The respondent was afforded notice and the opportunity to be heard, to present evidence, and to challenge evidence\n   against him. He has had the opportunity to appeal to a panel of the board, the board, a single justice, and the full court.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Eisenhauer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369489\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/426/448/#p454\">\n    426 Mass. 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 454,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20N.E.2d%20783\">\n    689 N.E.2d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11193059,11193189,11192710,11192838,11192743,11193290,11193420,11192942,11192783,11193360,11193137,11192987,11192893,11192670\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/919/\">\n    524 U.S. 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20S.%20Ct.%202303\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=141%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20162\">\n    141 L.Ed.2d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). The single justice did not err in concluding that the respondent was not denied a full and fair hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A final observation: even if the board's characterization of some of the particular services rendered by the respondent as legal or nonlegal may be debatable, much of it is not. There can be no denying, for example, that services such as snow shoveling, moving and house cleaning, shopping, and making funeral arrangements are not legal services. See\n   <em>\n    Matter of Eisenhauer\n   </em>\n   , 426 Mass. at 452,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20N.E.2d%20783\">\n    689 N.E.2d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (expert testimony not required to prove ethical violation of rule proscribing charging excessive fees). The evidence established that the respondent charged for these and other nonlegal services as if they were legal services, in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.5 (lawyer shall not \"charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee\"). A \"lawyer may not bill nonlawyer services at lawyer rates, no matter who performs them.\" E.J.

The hearing committee considered in mitigation that the respondent's \"actions were not engineered to deprive [clients] of their property or to take advantage of them but rather to provide for them and give them a sense of peace in their last days, which they would not have received anywhere else or from anyone else.\" The committee therefore recommended \"a downward departure of the appropriate sanction based on his providing personal services to these two elderly women.\" It also considered the extensive and detailed client notes the respondent maintained, as well as that he did not conceal his actions. While we acknowledge\n   these considerations, they are not the type of \"special\" factors that we consider in mitigation of misconduct. Although the respondent evidently provided necessary personal services for his clients, he also charged and collected excessive fees for performing them and did not provide appropriate notice to them. In addition, keeping detailed client records and cooperating with bar counsel in an investigation are actions that are to be expected of attorneys, not factors to be weighed in mitigation of sanction. Finally, although the respondent corrected the misrepresentation to the probate court after bar counsel raised the issue, the fact remains that the misrepresentation was intentional. \"As an officer of the court, an attorney ... is bound to uphold the integrity of that system by being truthful to the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Neitlich\n   </em>\n   , 413 Mass. at 423,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=597%20N.E.2d%20425\">\n    597 N.E.2d 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Lastly, at least as of the time of the board's decision, the respondent had not refunded or repaid excessive fees received from the clients or their estates.\n    <em>\n     Matter of Eisenhauer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Disposition\n    </em>\n    . The court system depends on the integrity of attorneys who appear before it. Considering the substantial misconduct in this case, including intentional misrepresentation to the probate court, charging and collecting clearly excessive fees, lack of diligence in the probate of two estates, as well as the other substantial violations of the rules of professional conduct, together with the aggravating factors discussed above, we conclude that a term suspension of fifteen months is appropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <em>\n     So ordered\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
