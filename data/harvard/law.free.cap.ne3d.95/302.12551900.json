L. c. 258E. Because the plaintiff failed to show that the defendant engaged in conduct that meets the definition of harassment, we vacate the harassment order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The defendant contends that her communications to the plaintiff neither constituted three acts of wilful and malicious conduct, nor were they sent with the requisite intent to cause fear, intimidation, abuse, or property damage. In reviewing the issuance of a c. 258E order, we \"scrutinize without deference the propriety of the legal criteria employed by the trial judge and the manner in which those criteria were applied to the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    C.O.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    M.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1183102\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/442/648/#p655\">\n    442 Mass. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 655 (2004), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Boucher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"201296\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/438/274/#p276\">\n    438 Mass. 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 276 (2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The definition of harassment\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   applies to speech only if it falls outside the protections of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, either by consisting of \"fighting words\" or \"true threats.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Borowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273190\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/415/#p422\">\n    461 Mass. 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 422 (2012).

The plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant committed each of the three acts with the requisite intent.

The first consisted of the single word, \"Goodbye.\" About one week later the defendant sent two short communications to the plaintiff within ten minutes. One communication said, \"I'm really sorry for being so negative that day. Okay okay okay. I won't ever be like that again. I'm sorry.\" The next said, \"God knows I'm sorry. Don't hate me please. lol.\" These messages were not communicated face-to-face, and even if we were to assume that fighting words may be delivered electronically, these communications do not contain any language that could be construed as an insult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant also sent electronic communications to a number of the plaintiff's female friends, all of which included essentially the same message: \"Let [the plaintiff] know that I just went to the Boston police [department] in Dorchester and filed a rape report. Thanks.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   These messages do not qualify as fighting words because they were sent to third parties and not communicated face-to-face to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \" 'True threats' encompass statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273190\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/415/#p422\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273190\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/415/#p422\">\n    at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Virginia\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=583%20U.S.%20343\">\n    583 U.S. 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 359 (2003). \"Intimidation\" qualifies as a true threat \"where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273190\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/415/#p422\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273190\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/415/#p422\">\n    at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=583%20U.S.%20343\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=583%20U.S.%20343\">\n    at 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike fighting words, true threats can be communicated through intermediaries if the defendant intends for the threat to reach the victim.

Saying \"goodbye\" and apologizing are not threats. The defendant's messages to the plaintiff's female friends show nothing more than an intent to deliver a message to the plaintiff that the defendant intended to file or had already filed criminal charges against him. See\n   <em>\n    Gassman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461184\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/90/1/#p9\">\n    90 Mass.

None of these statements threatened violence or demonstrated an intent to place the plaintiff in fear of bodily harm. The defendant may well have intended to harm the plaintiff's reputation, but speech intended to cause \"a fear of economic loss, of unfavorable publicity, or of defeat at the ballot box\" cannot be prohibited as civil harassment.\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 427.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff may have sincerely feared the defendant.
