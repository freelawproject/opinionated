Brown, appeals from a judgment entry of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas finding him guilty of one count of aggravated robbery, one count of tampering with evidence, and one count of having a weapon while under disability. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} By indictment filed October 27, 2015, plaintiff-appellee, State of Ohio, charged Brown with one count of aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01, a first-degree felony; one count of tampering with evidence in violation of R.C. 2921.12, a third-degree felony; and one count of having a weapon while under disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13, a third-degree felony. The aggravated robbery charge contained an accompanying three-year firearm specification pursuant to R.C. 2941.145(A), and the tampering with evidence charge contained an accompanying one-year firearm specification pursuant to R.C. 2941.141(A). Brown entered a plea of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The matter proceeded to a jury trial on the aggravated robbery and tampering with evidence charges, and Brown elected to have a bench trial for the having a weapon while under disability charge. At the trial commencing August 8, 2016, Maurice Moxley testified that during the early morning hours of October 18, 2015 he walked outside of his girlfriend's house to the driveway where he had parked his girlfriend's car, intending to go to a grocery store. Moxley testified that when he approached the car, he saw a man in the front seat. Moxley said he was startled, and he testified the man then opened up the car door, pointed a gun at Moxley, and told Moxley to empty his pockets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Moxley, who is a concealed carry permit holder, testified that as he went to empty his pockets, his shirt lifted, exposing his holster on his right hip. At that point, Moxley said the man in the car fired one shot from his gun and then started running away. Moxley testified he yelled at the man to stop and then Moxley fired his own gun. The man then jumped the fence and Moxley fired his gun again. At that point, Moxley said his girlfriend came outside and he told her to call the police. When the police arrived, Moxley gave a description of the man who had been inside the car. Police apprehended Brown a\n   short time later, and Moxley and his girlfriend identified Brown as the man who had been inside the car with the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Chalice Corvi, Moxley's girlfriend, testified that around 1:30 a.m. on October 18, 2015, she heard Moxley unlock the car using the key fob and then heard some arguing. Corvi said she then heard one gunshot followed by two more gunshots, so she ran to the door and saw Moxley chasing Brown. Corvi then called 911 and talked to the police when they arrived. After a short time, Corvi said the police drove her and Moxley in separate cars to the location where police had apprehended Brown a short distance away. Corvi testified she identified Brown to police as the man she had seen in the altercation with Moxley. When the police allowed Corvi to look at her vehicle after they arrested Brown, Corvi said \"[e]verything was out of order\" and a cell phone that had a cracked screen was missing from the car. (Aug. 8, 2016 Tr. Vol. 1 at 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Officer James Watkins of the Columbus Division of Police testified that on October 18, 2015 he responded to a police dispatch of a robbery at 4828 Heaton Road. When he arrived on the scene, Officer Watkins said Moxley gave him a description of the suspect and said the suspect had fired a black revolver before fleeing. Officer Watkins also said that Moxley informed him immediately upon his arrival that he was a concealed carry permit holder and that he had his firearm on him, so Officer Watkins instructed Moxley not to reach for his firearm. Moxley told Officer Watkins he had fired his own weapon at the suspect. Once he had a description of the suspect, Officer Watkins \"aired it\" across the police radio channel and the other officers responding began patrolling the area looking for someone who matched the description. (Tr. Vol. 1 at 110.) A short time later, another officer, Officer Josh Wright, radioed to say he had a possible suspect. Officer Watkins and another officer drove Moxley and Corvi to the second location where both identified Brown as the man from the altercation. Officer Watkins testified that the reason he transported Moxley and Corvi separately was so that neither could influence the other in making the identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Police arrested Brown and transported him to police headquarters for an interview, swabbing his hands as part of that process. When police apprehended Brown, they did not find a firearm on his person. Laboratory tests at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation found gunpowder residue present on Brown's hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Detective Todd Cress of the Columbus Division of Police conducted the interview with Brown, and the state played a video recording of Detective Cress' interview with Brown at trial. During the interview, Brown initially denied being anywhere near Moxley's home. Brown then said the homeowner fired gunshots in his direction because he was near the property. Eventually, Brown admitted to being inside the vehicle, but he denied taking any property and denied being in possession of a firearm. However, when police arrested Brown, they found a cell phone with a cracked screen on his person that was the same cell phone Corvi had described as missing from the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} As part of the investigation, Brown voluntarily submitted to a polygraph examination. Timothy Errington, a trooper with the Ohio State Highway Patrol, conducted the polygraph examination on the question \"[d]id you point a gun at that man before he shot at you?\" (Aug. 9, 2016 Tr. Vol. 2 at 265.) It was Trooper Errington's conclusion that Brown was not being truthful when he stated he did not have a\n   gun in his possession when he was inside Moxley's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The parties stipulated to Brown's \"prior conviction\" in state's exhibit No. 76, which was a juvenile adjudication determining Brown to be a delinquent minor for having committed robbery. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts on both the aggravated robbery charge with specification and the tampering with evidence charge with specification. The trial court found Brown guilty on the having a weapon while under disability charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On August 24, 2016, prior to sentencing, Brown filed a motion for new trial claiming the state withheld material impeachment evidence. More specifically, Brown alleged in his motion that in June 2016, Moxley was convicted of receiving stolen property, a fifth-degree felony, and that the state failed to disclose Moxley's conviction to the defense. In a September 21, 2016 entry, the trial court denied Brown's motion for new trial, concluding the undisclosed evidence was not material to Brown's guilt and that impeaching Moxley's testimony with this evidence would not have created a reasonable probability of a different result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Following an October 6, 2016 sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced Brown to three years on the aggravated robbery conviction plus three years on the accompanying firearm specification; nine months on the tampering with evidence conviction plus one year on the accompanying firearm specification; and nine months on the having a weapon while under disability conviction. The trial court ordered the sentences to run concurrently but noted the firearm specifications are mandatory and thus would be consecutive to the other sentences, resulting in an aggregate prison term of seven years. The trial court journalized Brown's convictions and sentence in an October 7, 2016 judgment entry. Brown timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Brown assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [1.] The trial court erred and deprived appellant of due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article One Section Ten of the Ohio Constitution by finding him guilty of aggravated robbery; tampering with evidence and having weapons under disability as those verdicts were not supported by sufficient evidence and were also against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [2.] The trial court committed plain error by failing to properly instruct the jury on the use of the polygraph examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [3.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant by denying his motion for a new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. First Assignment of Error-Sufficient Evidence and Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In his first assignment of error, Brown argues his convictions are not supported by sufficient evidence and that the convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. However, while the caption of his first assignment of error asserts all of his convictions are against both the sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence, the body of his first assignment of error only presents an argument related to the sufficiency of the evidence with regard to the having a weapon while under disability conviction and an argument related to the manifest weight of the evidence with regard to the aggravated robbery and tampering with evidence convictions. Thus, we limit our review to whether sufficient\n   evidence supports Brown's conviction of having a weapon while under disability and whether the manifest weight of the evidence supports his convictions of aggravated robbery and tampering with evidence. App.R. 12(A)(2) (\"[t]he court may disregard an assignment of error presented for review if the party raising it fails to identify in the record the error on which the assignment of error is based or fails to argue the assignment separately in the brief, as required under App.R. 16(A)\");\n   <em>\n    State v.

Brown asserts this was the state's only evidence used to establish a legal disability that would prevent Brown from possessing a weapon. On appeal, Brown argues the Supreme Court of Ohio's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Hand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280351\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/149/94/\">\n    149 Ohio St.3d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280351\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/149/94/\">\n    2016-Ohio-5504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20N.E.3d%20448\">\n    73 N.E.3d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , prevents the trial court from using a juvenile adjudication as an element of the offense of having a weapon while under disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court determined it is a violation of due process to consider a juvenile adjudication as the equivalent of an adult conviction in order to enhance a penalty for a later crime.\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37-38. In its decision, the Supreme Court determined R.C. 2901.08(A) is unconstitutional, which provided that a prior \"adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile traffic offender is a conviction for a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining the offense with which the person should be charged and, if the person is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 9. In so holding, the Supreme Court reasoned that because a juvenile adjudication, unlike an adult conviction, does not involve the right to a trial by jury, \"a juvenile adjudication is not a conviction of a crime and should not be treated as one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 38. We note, however, that\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   did not address R.C. 2923.13, the having a weapon while under disability statute at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Brown does not present his own constitutional challenge to R.C. 2923.13(A)(2). Contrary to the dissent's assertion that Brown presented a constitutional challenge to the statute, when read in context, Brown's reference to due process clearly relates to his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an argument we address fully below. Brown does not raise a separate argument related to the\n   facial or as applied constitutionality of the having a weapon while under disability statute, a wholly distinct issue and one Brown should have raised in the trial court had he intended to argue it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State v. Golden\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 13AP-927,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-2148\">\n    2014-Ohio-2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202156780\">\n    2014 WL 2156780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11 (\"[f]ailure to raise the issue of the constitutionality of a statute or its application at the trial court level generally constitutes waiver of that issue and need not be heard for the first time on appeal\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Instead of presenting his own constitutional challenge to R.C. 2923.13(A)(2), Brown argues the logic of\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   should extend to his case and prevent the court from considering his prior juvenile adjudication as part of his having a weapon while under disability conviction. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 21} We note, as the state does, that while\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   considered R.C. 2901.08(A) and the use of a prior juvenile adjudication to increase the degree or penalty of an offense, R.C. 2923.13(A)(2), at issue here, treats a prior juvenile adjudication as an element of the offense. Looking at the language of the having a weapon while under disability statute, R.C. 2923.13(A)(2) presents alternative elements to establish the offense: either a prior juvenile adjudication\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   a prior conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, from the plain language of the statute, it cannot be said that R.C. 2923.13(A)(2) treats a prior juvenile adjudication as an adult conviction because it separately considers both juvenile adjudications and adult convictions. We conclude, therefore, that\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   does not apply to R.C. 2923.13(A)(2). Our resolution of this issue is in accordance with other appellate districts that have considered the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist.

In its decision denying Brown's motion for new trial, the trial court noted that Moxley was convicted in Delaware County in late June 2016, several weeks before he testified in Brown's criminal case, of fifth-degree felony receiving stolen property. Neither the state nor Brown knew of Moxley's conviction until after the jury returned its verdict in Brown's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 38} The state responded to Brown's motion for new trial by relaying a conversation prosecutors had with defense counsel in which the state admitted it had not yet run a records check for Moxley and informally asked Corvi whether she knew of any criminal record Moxley may have. When Corvi said Moxley did not have a criminal record, the state offered to run a records check on both Corvi and Moxley but defense counsel stated such action would not be necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 39} The state asserts the trial court did not abuse its discretion because Brown fails to demonstrate the evidence of Moxley's criminal record is something that could not have been discovered prior to trial with the exercise of reasonable diligence. We agree. The state gave Brown the option of running a complete records check and Brown declined. Moreover, though we agree with Brown that the state was in error by not running the records check in the first instance pursuant to Brown's discovery request, we nonetheless find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Brown's motion for new trial because the evidence of Moxley's criminal record would not disclose a strong probability that the outcome will change.

The statute treats a defendant's previous conviction for a violent offense, or a delinquency adjudication of what would have been a violent offense if committed by an adult, as two alternatives to prove the same element of the offense. However, only the first alternative-actual conviction-results from a constitutionally sound process that affords a defendant all the rights to which he is entitled under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. Thus, Brown's conviction under the other element, which requires only a delinquency adjudication resulting from a process that did not include the right to a jury trial, violated his right to due process. In the juvenile court, no \"jury test[ed] the elements of that offense,\" and, under\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   , it cannot be treated as a prior conviction to support an offense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 57} The majority asserts that\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   does not control because the statute it invalidated, R.C. 2901.08(A), uses the fact of a defendant's juvenile adjudication to increase an offense level or penalty, while \" R.C. 2923.13(A)(2), at issue here, treats a prior juvenile adjudication as an element of the offense.\" (Majority Decision at \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 58} But this is precisely the point. Constitutionally, there is no distinction between facts that enhance punishment and the facts that prove an element of the crime. The United States Supreme Court stated this unequivocally in\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   when explaining\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   : \"In\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   , we held that a fact is by definition an element of the offense and must be submitted to the jury if it increases the punishment above what is otherwise legally prescribed.\"\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   at 2158.\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   as well states that \"facts that expose a defendant to a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed were by definition 'elements' of a separate legal offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 483,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p490\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , fn. 10. The equivalency is sound, as it merely emphasizes the foundational principle that every element of a crime must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Gaudin\n   </em>\n   at 510,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564227\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/506/#p510\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is this principle that served as the basis for the holding in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   , and, by extension,\n   <em>\n    Hand.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Because every element must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the burden on the state to convict a defendant for robbery is not equivalent to, and is much heavier than, what it must prove to secure an adjudication of delinquency against a minor. R.C. 2901.08, the statute invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   , and R.C. 2923.13(A)(2), the weapons while under disability statute, both equate convictions and delinquency adjudications. In both statutes, they are interchangeable means of achieving each statute's end: for R.C. 2901.08, increasing an offense level or penalty; and, for R.C. 2923.13(A)(2), defining an element of the offense. Thus, the majority\n   is incorrect when it asserts that \"it cannot be said that R.C. 2923.13(A)(2) treats a prior juvenile adjudication as an adult conviction because it separately considers both juvenile adjudications and adult convictions.\" (Majority Decision at \u00b6 21.) The opposite is true. The statute equates one with the other, as either one proves the same element of the offense. This equivalency is what\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   held violated principles of due process because only one of the alternatives-a conviction-is subject to the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36-37. And, although the statute provides various alternatives for proving the offense, \"[i]n all other scenarios, the status of disability is conduct which occurs as an adult. The juvenile vs. adult conduct distinction is critical to the constitutional analysis, particularly under the Ohio Constitution as noted in\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Boyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549311\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/92/213/\">\n    2017-Ohio-4199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549311\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/92/213/\">\n    92 N.E.3d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18 (J. Donovan, dissenting.) Rather than engaging with the constitutional issues raised by Brown's appeal, the majority ducks the issue by performing a limited exercise in statutory interpretation that, in essence, concludes that\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   does not control because it involved a different statute. Simply put,\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   has rendered R.C. 2923.13(A)(2) unconstitutional with respect to the use of juvenile adjudications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 60} While I concur with the majority in part, I respectfully dissent from its decision to overrule the first assignment of error in its entirety. For the foregoing reasons, I would overrule it in part, as Brown's prior juvenile adjudication is legally insufficient to prove an element of the offense of having a weapon while under disability under R.C. 2923.13(A)(2).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
