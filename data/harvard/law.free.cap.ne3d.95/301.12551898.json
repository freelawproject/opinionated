Letteri (wife) appeals from a judgment of divorce nisi entered by the Probate and Family Court, challenging the judge's decision to exclude the pension of Stephen A.

We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The parties were married in August, 1987, and lived in Florida for the majority of their marriage. Both parties worked outside the home throughout the marriage and shared the household and child-rearing responsibilities for their three children. In January, 2012, the parties moved to Massachusetts following the husband's retirement from the Tampa Police Department. The parties separated in October, 2014. The parties' minor son, who was sixteen years old and in high school, continued to reside primarily with the husband.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In April, 2015, the husband filed a complaint for divorce, and a two-day trial was held in April, 2016. At the time of the trial, the husband was fifty-four years old and unemployed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   while the wife was fifty-three years old and working full-time as a registered nurse, earning a gross weekly income of $1,170. The central contested issues at the trial were (1) the husband's ability to work, and (2) the division of the parties' retirement assets, consisting of the husband's pension (which was in payout status and was providing him with weekly income of $1,098), the wife's pension (which would eventually provide her with monthly income of approximately $910 at age sixty-five), and the wife's two 403(b) accounts (having a combined value of approximately $184,809 at the time of the trial).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On May 27, 2016, the judge entered a judgment of divorce nisi, which (1) required the wife to pay weekly child support to the husband of $185; (2) divided the total balance of the wife's 403(b) accounts equally between the parties; and (3) allowed the wife to retain her modest pension. The judge excluded the husband's pension from the asset division, instead treating it \"as a stream of income\" for the purpose of calculating child support. The judge also found the husband capable of working and attributed an annual income to him of $35,000. The present appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The wife argues that the judge erred in treating the husband's pension as a stream of income, rather than dividing it as a marital asset pursuant G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, because the treatment resulted in an inequitable financial award to the wife. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"[A] judge has considerable discretion in making an equitable division of property\" under \u00a7 34,\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Massa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286787\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/431/619/#p631\">\n    431 Mass. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (2000), and \"[a] division of marital property which is supported by findings as to the required factors [under \u00a7 34 ] will not be disturbed on appeal unless 'plainly wrong and excessive.' \"\n   <em>\n    Passemato\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Passemato\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310345\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/52/#p57\">\n    427 Mass. 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57 (1998), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Heins\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ledis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890257\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/477/#p481\">\n    422 Mass. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 481 (1996). \"However, '[c]onsiderable as the trial judge's discretion may be in weighing these factors [under \u00a7 34 ], it is not unbounded ....

The judgment leaves the husband with a net weekly surplus of $741 after deducting his reported expenses from his net income (including the attributed income and child support order),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   whereas the wife has a weekly shortfall of $320 after decreasing her income by expenses (including the child support order).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In essence, while the judge purported to make \"an exactly equal division of the assets, the financial arrangement as a whole shows that the evenhanded treatment was illusory,\" because only the husband is capable of maintaining his standard of living after the divorce.\n   <em>\n    Grubert\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1154575\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/20/811/#p817\">\n    20 Mass.

Moreover, the judge did not find, nor does the record reflect, a material disparity in the parties' respective opportunities for the \"future acquisition of capital assets and income.\" G.

However, the judge made no findings concerning this hypothetical alimony obligation, including, but not limited to, the husband's need for alimony. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 53(\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ) (\"the amount of alimony should generally not exceed the recipient's need or [thirty] to [thirty-five] per cent of the difference between the parties' gross incomes established at the time of the order being issued\");\n   <em>\n    Zaleski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zaleski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308885\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/230/#p242\">\n    469 Mass. 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242-243 (2014). Based on the record before us, it appears unlikely that the husband would be able to demonstrate a need for alimony if his pension were included in the asset division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the judge's findings \"do not lead logically to\" the uneven \"assignment of marital assets.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4003240\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/29/921/#p921\">\n    29 Mass.
