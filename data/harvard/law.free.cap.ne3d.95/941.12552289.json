On appeal, Emad contends that the trial court erred in its determinations regarding whether certain assets were marital or nonmarital. Emad also argues that: the trial court issued a Decree insufficient to reconcile the division of the marital estate; the trial court issued an erroneous $400,000 distributive award to Arlet; and the trial court unconstitutionally placed restrictions on Emad's ability to distribute money and assets out of the country. In her cross-appeal, Arlet contends that the trial court erred by failing to equitably divide the parties' 2014 joint tax return. For the reasons that follow, the trial court's judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Facts and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Emad and Arlet, both of whom were born and raised in Egypt, were married in Queens, New York on January 30, 2005. Two children were born as issue of their marriage. On February 19, 2014, Emad initiated the instant matter by filing a Complaint for Divorce versus Arlet. Arlet filed her Answer and a Counter-Claim for Divorce on March 6, 2014 and temporary orders of custody, child support, and spousal support were issued to Arlet by the trial court on March 31, 2014 and May 1, 2014. (Doc. Nos. 21, 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On July 22, 2014, Arlet filed a motion to compel discovery, which the trial court granted on July 24, 2014. Additionally, the trial court ordered Emad to comply with discovery and provide discovery (to Arlet) by August 21, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On August 22, 2014, Arlet filed a motion for contempt, asserting that Emad: (1) refused to pay spousal support; (2) refused to pay the cost of the childrens' tuition; and (3) refused to pay for the lawn care expenses of the marital home, all of which were previously ordered by the trial court. On October 7, 2014, an Agreed Judgment Entry was filed with the trial court resolving the contempt action. However, Arlet filed a second Motion for Contempt on November 12, 2014, for Emad's failure to pay spousal support, and a Motion to Impose Sanctions for Emad's discovery non-compliance. On December 24, 2014 the trial court granted Arlet's motions, finding that Emad had not complied with discovery, had not paid his spousal support obligations, had not paid his children's tuition obligations, and had failed to pay certain bills related to the marital residence. (Doc. No. 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On May 1, 2015, Arlet filed another Motion to Impose Sanctions versus Emad. The motion also requested that the trial court rule on Emad's failure to purge his previous contempt citation. On May 12, 2015 the trial court issued its Judgment Entry finding Emad in contempt and that he had failed to purge his prior contempt findings. The trial court ordered Emad to serve twenty (20) days in jail, which was suspended on the condition that he pay Arlet's trial counsel two thousand dollars ($2,000) prior to May 15, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On May 22, 2015, Arlet filed a motion to join a third party defendant in this case, Mousa Investments, LLC, which\n   the trial court granted on May 27, 2016. Arlet filed an additional request to join a third-party defendant, Michael Mousa, Emad's brother, which the trial court granted on June 1, 2015. Ultimately, Arlet filed cross-claims against Mousa Investments, LLC and Michael Mousa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On June 9, 2015, Arlet filed a motion to compel Emad to permit her expert to value his business, OB/GYN Women's Health Center, LLC. Thereafter, on August 6, 2015, Arlet filed a motion to join OB/GYN Women's Health Center, LLC, as a party, which was granted by the trial court. Arlet then filed a cross-claim against OB/GYN Women's Health Center, LLC in the trial court and another contempt action (versus Emad) on August 12, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On August 25, 2015, the trial court ordered Emad to: (1) provide discovery to defense counsel; (2) be physically present at OB/GYN Women's Health Center, LLC, on August 27, 2015 (to permit Arlet's expert to evaluate the business); and (3) pay the children's tuition each month in a timely manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Nevertheless, Arlet filed her fifth motion for contempt (versus Emad) in the trial court on September 23, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The parties divorce case proceeded to a contested hearing on October 20, 21, 22, 29, and 30, 2015, followed by written summations and closing arguments that were submitted to the trial court after the conclusion of the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On November 18, 2015, Arlet filed her sixth motion for contempt versus Emad.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    {\u00b6 12} On May 12, 2016, the trial court issued a Decree of Divorce, granting Emad and Arlet a divorce on the grounds of incompatibility. The trial court also awarded Arlet judgments against third party defendants, Mousa Investments, LLC, Michael Mousa, and OB/GYN Women's Health Center, LLC. However, the trial court issued an Amended Judgment Entry-Decree of Divorce on August 19, 2016, followed by a Second Amended Judgment Entry Decree of Divorce (\"Decree\"), which was filed on August 31, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 237, 238).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    {\u00b6 13} From the trial court's Second Amended Decree Emad filed his appeal, asserting the following assignments of error:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      EMAD'S ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO.

In response, Arlet contends that the trial court\n    <em>\n     did\n    </em>\n    divide the gold and silver, directing us to page 11 of the Decree which states as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    The parties waived their right to have the household goods and furnishings appraised.

And, by ordering that each party keep the \"personal property\" in their respective possession, the trial court awarded the gold and silver to Emad and divided the property accordingly. In other words, Arlet does not dispute that Emad should receive the gold and silver in the amount of $35,693.32. (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 20).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    {\u00b6 28} We agree with Arlet and find that the trial court awarded the gold and silver to Emad in its final decree by ordering that each party keep the \"personal property\" in their respective possession. Since Emad never disclosed the existence of the gold and silver (to Arlet) and because he purchased it during the marriage, such gold and silver was in his \"possession\" for purposes of this argument. Thus, we find that the trial court awarded the gold and silver to Emad, free and clear of Arlet's claims in the \"personal property\" division of assets. Accordingly, we overrule Emad's gold and silver argument in his second assignment of error.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <em>\n     Marital/Nonmarital Property Argument\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    {\u00b6 29} Under this assignment, Emad further contends that the Decree fails to identify whether some assets are marital or nonmarital, and directs us to pages 17-19 of the Decree that details various financial transactions between Emad and his parents. After listing the transactions, (between Emad and his parents) the trial court determined that such amounted to financial misconduct pursuant to R.C. 3105.171(E).

(Doc. No. 238 at 23). Further, the trial court determined that it considered Emad and Arlet's marital and separate property, including any other assets, debts, income and expenses, and determined that the net marital estate was $1,272,588. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). With such determination, the trial court found that one-third of the net estate was $419,954.00. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). However, as we have determined in Emad's first assignment of error, we cannot reconcile the trial court's determination of the net marital estate from the information set forth in the Decree. Per\n    R.C. 3105.171(E)(5), the trial court needs to determine the net marital estate and the total undisclosed and diverted assets before issuing a financial misconduct award. Because we are, on review, unable to determine how the trial court calculated the net marital estate and the total undisclosed and diverted assets, we are unable to review this assignment of error. Thus, as we have done above, we sustain this assignment for the limited purpose of remanding this to the trial court to re-issue its decree and clarify its distributive award.

No. 238 at 7-10).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    {\u00b6 42} Despite the fact that Arlet introduced expert testimony of the value of OB/GYN Women's Health Center, LLC business, the final Decree is silent as to the business's value. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    10/22/2015 Tr., Vol. III, at 878-79; Def. Ex. ZZ. Arlet's expert witness, Bryan C. Daulton, valued Emad's OB/GYN Women's Health Center, LLC at $145,000 and submitted his valuation report to the trial court indicating the same.) Further, the Decree is also silent as to whether the trial court chose a different valuation of the business despite the lack of expert testimony to the contrary. Thus, we cannot address this assignment of error without clearer information from the trial court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    {\u00b6 43} Accordingly, we sustain Emad's tenth assignment of error but take no position on Emad's argument related to \"double dipping\" and/or whether the award was appropriate and reasonable. Consistent with our decision in the above assignments of error, our remand of this matter is solely for the trial court to clarify its decree in a manner for us to conduct our appellate review.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Emad's Assignment of Error No. XIII\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    {\u00b6 44} In his thirteenth assignment of error, Emad asserts that the Decree bans him from \"distribut[ing] money and other assets out of the Country or to friends and relatives\" forever. Specifically, Emad asserts that the trial court effectively placed a lifetime ban on his ability to distribute his assets, in violation of his federal and state constitutional guarantees. We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    {\u00b6 45} As an initial matter, we find that Emad, in presenting this assignment of error to the Court, misinterprets the trial court's final decree on this issue. Specifically, the trial court order at issue states as follows: \"It is further\n    <strong>\n     ORDERED\n    </strong>\n    that Plaintiff shall not distribute money and other assets out of the Country or to friends and relatives\n    <em>\n     except as Ordered herein\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     Emphasis added.\n    </em>\n    (Doc. No. 238 at 30). Emad's presentation of this assignment of error does not comply with the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure. App.R. 16(A)(7) states: \"(A) Brief of the Appellant. The appellant shall include in its brief, under the headings and in the order indicated, all of the following: [a]n argument containing the contentions of the appellant with respect to each assignment of error presented for review and the reasons in support of the contentions, with citations to the authorities, statutes,\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    parts of the record on which appellant relies. The argument may be preceded by a summary.\" Emphasis added. App.R. 16(A)(7).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    {\u00b6 46} While Emad directs this Court to constitutional provisions and the portion of the Decree containing the alleged error, Emad directs this Court to absolutely no legal authority to support his argument. \"The law is clear that '[a]n appellant must demonstrate each assigned error through an argument supported by citations to legal authority and facts in the record.' \"\n    <em>\n     Home S. &amp; L. Co. of Youngstown v. Avery Place, L.L.C.,\n    </em>\n    10th Dist.

Furthermore, \" '[i]f an appellant neglects to advance such an argument, a court of appeals may disregard the assignment of error.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=939%20N.E.2d%20891\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    quoting\n    <em>\n     Ford Motor\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 23, citing App.R. 12(A)(2). Because Emad directs this court to no legal authority to support this assignment, we accordingly overrule this assignment of error.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    {\u00b6 47} Having reviewed the arguments, the briefs, and the record in this case, we find error prejudicial to Appellant in the particulars assigned and argued. We sustain Emad's first, second, third, and tenth assignments of error, only to the extent for this matter to be remanded to the trial court for it to clarify its Decree with a better understanding of the classification of assets, division of property, distributive award, and award of spousal support. Further, we overrule Emad's thirteenth assignment of error, and moot Emad's third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth assignments of error. We also sustain Arlet's cross-assignment of error for the limited purpose of determining the classification and division of the parties' 2014 joint tax return, contingent upon our stated instructions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    {\u00b6 48} The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Marion County, Family Division is therefore affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Judgment Affirmed in Part, Reversed in Part, and Cause Remanded\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    PRESTON, P.J. and WILLAMOWSKI, J., concur.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-134\">\n     Unfortunately, our appellate review is also made more difficult by the fact that the trial court transposes Plaintiff and Defendant throughout the Decree numerous times, and cites incorrect code sections as its statutory authority.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
