On appeal, he claims there was insufficient evidence to support one of his convictions, that G.

In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the touching of the victim's chest occurred a short time after the defendant placed a blanket over the victim's lap, reached under the blanket, touched the victim's thighs, and rubbed the victim's vagina over her clothes. In these circumstances, the fact finder was justified in concluding that the defendant's conduct was sexual in nature, \"violative of social and behavioral expectations,\" and \"fundamentally offensive to contemporary moral values,\" which, regardless of the victim's development, our \"sense of society would regard as immodest, immoral and improper.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1606238\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/42/313/#p314\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1606238\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/42/313/#p314\">\n    at 314-315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Vagueness\n   </em>\n   . The defendant also claims that G.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As a starting point, we note that this claim has not been preserved for appellate review. An as-applied vagueness challenge must be preserved in a motion for a required finding of not guilty after the Commonwealth has presented its evidence. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Figueroa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3849450\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/251/#p266\">\n    83 Mass.

That did not occur here. As a result, we review only to determine whether any error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.

However, indecent assault and battery is not limited to the touching of any specific body part. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vazquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658829\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/65/305/#p306\">\n    65 Mass. App. Ct. at 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, as stated above, \u00a7 13B prohibits a touching that, when \"judged by the normative standard of societal mores, ... is violative of social and behavioral expectations ... in a manner which is fundamentally offensive to contemporary moral values and which the common sense of society would regard as immodest, immoral and improper.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lavigne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1606238\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/42/313/#p314\">\n    42 Mass. App. Ct. at 314-315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Moreover, a statute is not vague simply because \"it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"896081\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/395/302/#p304\">\n    395 Mass. 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (1985), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Orlando\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"320446\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/371/732/#p734\">\n    371 Mass. 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734 (1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because a person of average intelligence can be expected to understand that touching a nine year old victim's thigh and vagina, and then touching her chest, would constitute indecent assault and battery, \u00a7 13B gives fair warning. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1221140\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/62/622/#p627\">\n    62 Mass.

Finally, for the first time on appeal, the defendant claims his prosecution violated the Equal Rights Amendment because G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, punishes the touching of a female's breast, but does not punish an equivalent touching of the male chest area. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Article 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments to the Constitution, provides in part: \"Equality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of sex, race, color, creed or national origin.\" Under the Equal Rights Amendment, \"classifications on the basis of sex are subject to a degree of constitutional scrutiny 'at least as strict as the scrutiny required by the Fourteenth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] for racial classifications.' \"\n   <em>\n    Attorney Gen\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Assn.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337368\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/342/#p354\">\n    378 Mass. 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 354 (1979), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871389\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/374/5/#p21\">\n    374 Mass. 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 21 (1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The fundamental flaw in the defendant's claim is that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, makes no classification based on gender.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute protects both male and female children from being victims of an indecent assault. An additional flaw in the defendant's claim is that neither the statute nor the case law enumerates or catalogues areas of the body on which an intentional and unprivileged touching would necessarily be deemed indecent. In fact, we have held that \"[t]he touching in question need not be restricted to the list of anatomical parts and areas referred to in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mosby\n   </em>\n   , [30 Mass.
