In all four objections, the judge declined to find a pattern, and, thus, did not seek an explanation from the Commonwealth for its use of these peremptory challenges. The question on remand is whether the judge, in light of the subsequent holdings in\n   <em>\n    Oberle\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , abused his discretion in finding that the defendant had not made a prima facie showing that the Commonwealth's peremptory challenges were improper.

A peremptory challenge on the basis of membership in a constitutionally protected group, such as gender, is prohibited.\n   <em>\n    Soares\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"334144\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/377/461/#p486\">\n    377 Mass. at 488-489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Given the relative ease with which a party can make the necessary prima facie showing, we have urged judges to think long and hard before they decide to require no explanation ... for [a] challenge.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451908\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/307/\">\n    477 Mass. at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We need not look further than the defendant's objection to the Commonwealth's peremptory challenge to juror no. 100, a male. The codefendant, joined by the defendant, objected, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Your Honor, respectfully I now will object on the basis of, as I expressed at the beginning of this selection, that we had a limited number of males on the jury. We had twenty-four that were seen in the group, and some forty-eight women, and this is now the fifth male of the twenty-four, and perhaps as I said the panel is becoming an all-female jury. Respectfully, your Honor, I challenge on the basis that this was done, the challenge was made on the basis of this witness's sex.... [L]ooking at the nature of the case, we've got a female victim and African-American defendant, a female Caucasian victim, and clearly there's an issue of this becoming an all-female jury, because the Commonwealth has the ability to challenge every single male.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the time of the Commonwealth's peremptory challenge to juror no. 100, there were forty-seven women and sixteen men that were called for an individual voir dire. After the judge excused jurors for a variety of reasons, there were twenty-five women and seven men left for the parties to challenge. Although the Commonwealth used five of its peremptory challenges on women and another five on men, the percentage of men that the Commonwealth challenged was more than triple the percentage of women challenged. At this point, the Commonwealth had used its peremptory challenges on roughly twenty percent of the women and roughly seventy-one percent of the men.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The record does show that the judge was presented with a venire consisting of significantly fewer males than females. See\n   <em>\n    Soares\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"334144\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/377/461/#p486\">\n    377 Mass. at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record also shows that the Commonwealth voluntarily gave gender-neutral explanations for its challenging of two of the males. However, in addition to the Commonwealth using its peremptory challenges on five out of the seven remaining men, the jurors seated at the time of the defendant's objection concerning juror no. 100 consisted of five women and no men, and therefore the defendant would have, at that point in time, made the necessary prima facie showing. The judge was thus required to ask the Commonwealth for a gender-neutral reason for challenging juror no. 100. See\n   <em>\n    Oberle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462694\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/539/\">\n    476 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   546-547 ;\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451908\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/307/\">\n    477 Mass. at 325-326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is irrelevant, under this required procedure, that, subsequent to such a showing, the defendant challenged the next male, without explanation, or that the final composition of the jury consisted of nine females and seven males and that five of the females were white, three were Hispanic, and one was black. Of the males, four were white and three were black.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n   . In light of the foregoing analysis, the defendant made a prima facie showing of discrimination in his objection to the Commonwealth's use of a peremptory challenge to juror no. 100; pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Oberle\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , the judge abused his discretion in finding otherwise and not seeking an explanation from the Commonwealth.
