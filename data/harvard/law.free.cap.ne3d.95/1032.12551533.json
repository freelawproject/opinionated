Dueck (\"Dueck\"), Todd Gilmore (\"Gilmore\"), Nancy Binder (\"Binder\"), and William R. Keller (\"Keller,\" collectively \"appellants\") appeal the trial court's grant of summary judgment in a declaratory judgment action, interpreting a trust agreement in favor of defendants-appellees Clifton Park Trust Trustees (\"Trustees\") and The Clifton Club Company (\"Clifton Club\"). This is a consolidated appeal. In\n   <em>\n    Dueck v. Clifton Club Co.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103888, appellant Dennis F. Butler states that his interests are aligned with the appellants, and that he adopts the arguments asserted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a thorough review\n   of the record, we find that the nonresident members of the Clifton Club are not beneficiaries of the Trust and, as a result, have no legal rights. The matter is reversed and remanded as instructed herein for a hearing on the amount of sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellants are lot owners in the Clifton Park Allotment in Lakewood, Ohio (\"Clifton Park\"), a residential area owned and developed in the 1800s by the Clifton Park Association (\"Clifton Park Association\"), predecessors in interest to the Clifton Park Land &amp; Improvement Company (\"Land Company\"). In 1912, the Land Company placed the Clifton Park private park and beach area (collectively the \"Beach\") into a trust (\"Trust\") for the use and enjoyment of all Clifton Park lot owners, vesting lot owners with the legal status of Trust beneficiaries (\"Beneficiaries\"). The Clifton Club, a social club operating in Clifton Park since 1902, is a members-only establishment. Membership is open to the lot owner Beneficiaries, as well as nonresidents of Clifton Park (\"Club Members\"). While the Clifton Club's membership is comprised of both resident lot owners and nonresidents, the focus of this case is whether Club Members, due to their status as Club Members, are Beneficiaries under the Trust and entitled to Beach access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Several months after the creation of the Trust, the Clifton Club succeeded the Land Company as owners to sublots 38, 39, 40, and 41 (the \"Club Lots\") in Clifton Park. Over the years, the Clifton Club membership has grown, creating crowded beach conditions. As a result, appellants seek a declaration that the Club Members are not lot owners; therefore, (1) they are not Beneficiaries of the Trust, and (2) they do not have the same legal rights as the lot owner Beneficiaries to access the Beach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. History and Formation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Clifton Park Association began development of Clifton Park in 1893 with the vision of establishing an exclusive residential community in a beach and park setting for the use and enjoyment of the Clifton Park lot owners. The 1897 deeds issued by Clifton Park Association to shareholders and founders William Starkweather and Henry Coffinberry included covenants and restrictions establishing that the beach and park areas were intended to be for the exclusive use of Clifton Park lot owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Upon Starkweather's death in 1899, the remaining parcels in Clifton Park were conveyed from Clifton Park Association to the Land Company, constituting approximately 143.23 acres of land. The deed provides that it is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [M]ade and accepted subject to the covenants of The Clifton Park Association in the certain deeds, to [Starkweather] and [Coffinberry] above named as to conveyances of said premises thereafter to be made and the grantee assumes and agrees to [illegible word] form to and abide by said covenants in like manner and with like effect as if the same had been entered into by it as the grantor named in said conveyances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The deed dictates that the lots be used exclusively for private residences, and the \"covenants, agreements and provisions shall run with the land for a period of fifty (50) years from the date hereof,\" excepting property sold for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [S]tables, canal slips, boat houses casinos or clubhouses, ice houses or bathing houses for the use of the owners of the\n   lots in said allotment, and that portion lying along Rocky River and bordering on the lake, known as the Flat Land, being a triangular piece not subdivided into separate lots, and containing about twenty (20) acres, more or less.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Club Lease\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Defendant-appellee the Clifton Club was incorporated in 1902 as a for-profit corporation, formed for the purpose of building a clubhouse and to operate as a social club. The Clifton Club initially leased the Club Lots from the Land Company from 1902-1912 (\"Club Lease\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The Club Lease provisions include: (1) lots are to be used solely for a social club or private residence; (2) any residence erected shall not cost less than $12,000; (3) minimum required lot frontage; (4) a requirement that all other lot deeds or leases will contain similar restrictions that run with the land, for a period of 50 years; and (5) that the Land Company will convey the fee interest:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [I]n the reserved and dedicated for park purposes * * * to a Board of Trustees of not less than three members who shall be property owners in said allotment with power to perpetuate said Board of Trustees and with power to hold said property for the use and benefit of persons owning land in said allotment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The Club Lease includes a purchase option:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [T]he first party will also give, grant and make to second party without further consideration and for same period of time a lease of a certain strip of land upon the Easterly bank of Rocky River for a boat house, and also a strip of land for the purpose of a stable, together with the right to use the approaches to the same. The location and size of the last three pieces of property to be hereafter agreed upon between the parties hereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Club Lease limits Clifton Club membership to 250 members unless the Land Company or its successors give consent to increase membership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Trust Deed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In March 1912, the Land Company conveyed the private beach and park to five trustees (\"Trustees\") via a trust deed (\"Trust Deed\"). The Trust Deed references the Beach for the sole use and benefit of all the owners of sub lots, or parts of lots, in the Clifton Park Allotment. * * * (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [B]eing the parts and parcels of land in the grantor's said allotment, or lying adjacent thereto,\n   <em>\n    which have been reserved for the use and benefit of the owners of land in said allotment\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   To have and to hold the premises aforesaid, with the appurtenances thereunto belonging, unto the said grantees and their successors in trust and assigns, and the survivors or survivor thereof, and the heirs of such survivor, so that neither said grantor, nor its successors, nor any other person claiming title through or under it, shall or will hereafter claim or demand any right or title to the premises, or any part thereof, but they and every one of them shall be by these presents excluded and forever barred, in trust, nevertheless,\n   <em>\n    for the sole use and benefit of all the owners of sub lots, or parts of lots, in the Clifton Park Allotment\n   </em>\n   * * * and the heirs, representatives successors or assigns, of such owners subject to the terms, conditions and regulations herein contained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The Trust Deed directs that the Trustees hold the Beach in trust for the\n   \"common use of all of the [Clifton Park] lot owners, and their successors in title, and members of their households.\" Appellants are lot owners and are, therefore, Beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The Trust Deed also states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [T]he Trustees are directed to collect funds for maintenance, snow removal and other repairs to the Property, including the \"bathing pavilion,\" and \"establish regulations for the use of, and provide for proper policing of * * * parks and bathing pavilion and generally maintain all of said property in good order and condition for the use of lot owners in said allotment, as the same is now maintained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Pursuant to the Trust Deed, the Trustees collect an annual assessment from the Beneficiaries for the \"care of the lands and buildings in the hands of the trustees, and their necessary expenses in carrying out their duties.\" The assessment also applied to \"several sub lots reserved to the Company in the deeds of conveyance for the same,\" which would include the Club Lots that were subject to the Club Lease at the time of the Trust Deed conveyance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Club Deed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 13} By deed dated July 1912, the Clifton Club received title to the Club Lots (\"Club Deed\"). In addition to the ownership transfer, the Club Deed conveys:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [T]he right to use in common with other owners of the land in said allotment, all portions of said allotment which shall by the Grantor be devoted to the purposes of park or park spaces for the exclusive use and benefit of such lot owners but such use of the parks and of any pavilion or bath or boat houses as may be erected thereon by the said company for the benefit of owners of property in said allotment, shall be subject to such rules and regulations as may be established by said Company to provide for the taxes and expenses of the maintenance and preservation of the same, and the proportionate part of such taxes and expenses shall be chargeable to the lot herein conveyed and shall be a lien upon said lot to secure its payment. * * * [T]he grantee will not sell or allow to be sold on said premises any liquor, whether spirituous, vinous or fermented, or use said premises or cause or permit the same to be used for any business purposes whatsoever, or for any purpose [other] than that of a private residence or social club. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Finally, the Club Deed referenced the future creation of the Trust, though it had, in fact, been created several months prior:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   The said grantor further covenants with the said grantee that it will, before the period of its corporate existence or any renewal or renewals thereof expires, convey the fee in the land reserved for park purposes in the allotment of The Clifton Park Land and Improvement Company, as shown by plat thereof made and on file in the office of the Secretary of the Company, to a Board of Trustees of not less than three members who shall be property owners in said allotment, subject to such rules and regulations in regard to the use thereof as hereinbefore provided, and for that purpose the said Trustees shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the Company as to use, maintenance, repairs, improvements, and for all purposes whatsoever.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Current Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The Club Members and Beneficiaries have enjoyed use of the Beach over the years. The only portion of the Trust property at issue is the Beach and the legal right of the Club Members, the Club\n   Members who are not resident lot owners, to use the Beach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 16} There is no dispute between the parties that the Clifton Club is a direct Beneficiary as a successor lot owner. It is also undisputed that, beginning in 1942 and thereafter, the Clifton Club has made annual payments to the Trustees for the use of the Beach by the Club Members, based on various formulas determined by the Trustees. There is no disagreement that the Trustees have been vested with the power to enter into agreements with the Clifton Club regarding the formula for, and amount of, the payments. In fact, the Clifton Club states it has been making annual payments of $12,000 to $112,300 per year for the past 30 years, an amount greater than the assessment fee formula set forth in the Trust for parcel owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 17} By 2011, overcrowding of the Beach and related parking became an issue. A number of Beneficiaries requested that the Trustees implement regulations to reduce use of the Beach by the Club Members. Appellants discovered at a December 2011 meeting with the Trustees that the Trustees were not sure whether they had the authority to limit the number of Club Members accessing the Beach. The Trustees elected to address the issue by promulgating rules (\"Beach Rules\") governing use of the Beach by both Beneficiaries and Club Members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The Clifton Club issued a letter to the Trustees on December 1, 2011, protesting the Beach Rules. The Clifton Club argued that the Beach Rules were \"discriminatory\" and placed \"unilateral restrictions\" on the Club Members. The letter warned that, \"we believe the [Clifton] Park Trustees have breached their fiduciary responsibility to represent all Beach members fairly and without discrimination.\" Appellants state they were not informed of the existence of the letter warning of the breach until the pending action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In February 2012, appellants Dueck and Butler met with two Trustees requesting pursuit of an action to determine the scope of the Club Members' legal right of Beach access. Dueck also states that he and other Beneficiaries were informed, during a March 2012 meeting with the Trustees, that the Trustees had obtained a legal opinion regarding Club Members Beach access rights. Dueck requested that Trustee Drumm obtain an independent expert opinion regarding the legal source of the Club Members' Beach access rights, for which Dueck offered to pay half of the cost. The offer was rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 20} On April 27, 2012, Dueck and several other lot owners asked the Trustees to provide them with a copy of the legal memorandum obtained by the Trustees. The document was not provided. The Trustees stated at a subsequent meeting with the Beneficiaries that, if any Beneficiary had further issues to resolve, they should take the matter to court, because the Trustees were no longer going to communicate with the Beneficiaries on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The Clifton Club and Trustees posit that the Club Members have the same legal right to use the Beach as the Beneficiaries pursuant to the Trust Deed and Club Deed. Appellants agree that the Club Members have the right to use the Beach with the permission of the Trustees, but deny that they are direct Beneficiaries, and further state that neither the language,\n   nor the history, supported the position of the Clifton Club and Trustees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The lot owners filed a declaratory action to determine Trust rights, on June 2, 2012, appellants initiated the current action against the Clifton Club in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, requesting that the trial court declare that the Club Members are not Beneficiaries and, as a result, have no legal entitlement to use the Beach. Appellants also sought a determination that any grant to use the Beach contained in the Club Deed is null and void. The declaratory action did not request that Club Members be barred from using the Beach on the negotiated fee basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The Clifton Club filed a motion to dismiss under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), 12(B)(7), and 19(A), and the Declaratory Judgment Act (R.C. Chapter 2721). Arguments included that the Trustees and fellow lot owners were necessary parties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The Plaintiffs purport to adjudicate the rights of non-parties with legally protectable interests. The Clifton Park Trustees hold title to Clifton Beach, the only land at issue in this case, and they owe fiduciary obligations to all Clifton Park beneficiary lot owners. To the extent the Court permits this action to survive Civ. R. 12(B)(6), the Trustees and the Plaintiffs' fellow beneficiary-Clifton Park residents are Civ.R. 19 necessary parties needed for just adjudication. Likewise, R.C. 2721.12 mandates that the absence of these necessary parties constitutes a jurisdictional defect that prevents a declaratory judgment action from proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Clifton Club did not argue, however, that the Club Members were also necessary parties due to their \"legally protectable\" interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The Trustees filed an amicus brief supporting the Clifton Club's argument that the Trustees and lot owners were necessary parties, and echoing the Clifton Club's position that the Club Members were legally entitled to use the Beach. The trial court determined that the Trustees and all lot owner Beneficiaries were necessary parties and required joinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellants distributed a letter to residents explaining the trial court's decision to include the lot owners and Trustees in the action. The Trustees also issued a notice to residents and Club Members, refuting a number of representations contained in appellants' letter. The Trustees assured the recipients that they had not chosen sides in the matter, and advised that \"[t]here are implications for each lot owner's financial, insurance and homeowner's circumstances\" as a result of the lawsuit by appellants. The Trustees' notice referred recipients to the Trustees' website to review \"FAQ's\" addressing the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On April 24, 2013, appellants filed a first amended complaint adding the Trustees and remaining Beneficiaries as parties. The first amended complaint requested that the trial court declare:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   a) that the members of the Clifton Club who are not sublot owners are not beneficiaries under the Deed of Trust,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   b) the members of the Clifton Club who are not sublot owners have no legal right to use Trust property (including the Beach), and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   c) the provision of the Clifton Club Deed dated July 1, 1912 allowing use of Trust property by the members of the Clifton Club who are not sublot owners (including the Beach) in contradiction to the then-existing Deed of Trust is null and void.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The first amended complaint requested, alternatively, the \"court enter an order defining the rights of and relationship between the plaintiffs and the Club Members as to the use of the Trust property, including the Beach.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 27} On October 31, 2014, appellants filed a motion to remove the Trustees for breaching the duty of impartiality, before and during the suit, by siding with the Clifton Club on Beach access and by refusing access to Trust documents. The Trustees responded that their actions were justified by their interpretation of the Trust. The motion to remove the Trustees was denied without opinion on August 24, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellants also filed a motion with the court on June 25, 2015, requesting that the Trustees pay appellants' attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 5810.04. The trial court denied the motion without opinion on August 24, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 29} On September 1, 2015, the Trustees filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that there were no genuine issues of material fact that: (1) the Clifton Club, as a lot owner, is a Beneficiary with a legal right to use the Beach; and (2) the Trustees have the legal power to regulate the use of the Beach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Appellants responded that the undisputed issues identified by the Trustees in their motion were not, in fact, the material issues in the case. The question before the court was not whether the Clifton Club, as a lot owner, was a Beneficiary of the Trust. The question before the court was whether the Clifton Club's right to use the Beach as a Beneficiary extended as an enforceable, legal right to the Club Members. In other words, were the Club Members defined Beneficiaries?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The trial court granted summary judgment. The court determined that parole evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   was not required to interpret the Trust, and that the \"principal issue in this case is whether\" the Club Members \"have a right to use\" the Beach. The trial court explained that the Clifton Club, as a lot owner, is a Beneficiary \"bound by the Trustees' regulation of Trust property.\" While finding that the Trust Deed stands alone for interpretation purposes, the trial court cited the portions of the Club Deed, and the Club Lease, to support its findings as to the Land Company's intent in forming the Trust. The trial court rejected appellants' argument that the Land Company could not grant a greater right to use the Beach via the Club Deed, because the Land Company no longer had authority over the Beach, which had already been placed in Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The trial court took judicial notice of dicta from\n   <em>\n    Wallace v. Clifton Land Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993761\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/92/349/\">\n    92 Ohio St. 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20N.E.%20940\">\n    110 N.E. 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1915), for the premise that the Clifton Club membership has never been restricted to lot owners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 359,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20N.E.%20940\">\n    110 N.E. 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court concluded that it was \"illogical to reason\" that the rights of the Clifton Club as lot owners to \"use\" the Beach did not vest the same \"privilege\" in its members, finding there is nothing in the Trust Deed\n   to suggest that the resident Club Members could have access, but the nonresident Members could not. Since the Clifton Club has been in existence since 1902, the trial court held that it does not make sense to think that the Land Company conveyed the Beach without intending that the Club Members have access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Based on the foregoing, the trial court determined that, due to the status of the Clifton Club as a Beneficiary, \"the Clifton Club, and through it, all of its members, has a legal right to use Trust property, including the beach, subject to the regulations and restrictions as set forth in the Trust Deed and Club Deed.\" The Trustees' motion for summary judgment was granted. This appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Appellants present three assignments of error: (1) the trial court erred in granting the Trustees' motion for summary judgment, relying on appellees' extrinsic evidence while ignoring the extrinsic evidence of appellants; (2) the trial court erred in refusing to remove the Trustees after the Trustees failed to provide documents to appellants during discovery as required by the Trust Code; and (3) the trial court erred in denying appellants' motion for attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 35} We begin with appellants' first assigned error, that the trial court erred in granting the motion.

The trial court capsulized the issue to be whether the Club Members \"have a right to use\" the Beach under the Trust Deed. The trial court concluded that the only way the Clifton Club could exercise its rights to access the Beach was through the members, and that the documents and history supported that the Club Members \"had the right\" to use the Beach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Appellants have consistently argued that the Club Members do not have a \"legal right\" to use the Beach, but that the right is by permission and subject to regulations by the Trustees.

At the time of creation, the Land Company held title to the Club Lots, which were then subject to the Club Lease.

A factor the\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   court considered in finding the existence of the easement based on the totality of the circumstances, was the members' belief that their access entitlement was due to the club membership, and not as individuals, so that the usage could be imputed to the club.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 420,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=418%20A.2d%2070\">\n    418 A.2d 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The Trustees' cited cases support the proposition that the Club Members possess a permissive or derivative right due to the Clifton Club's status as a Beneficiary.

However, it is clear by the terms of the Trust Deed that the Clifton Club's rights as a Beneficiary are also to be protected, to the extent they comport with the settlors' intent that the conveyance was \"for the sole use and benefit of all of the owners of sublots, or parts of lots, in the Clifton Park Allotment.\" Therefore, we determine that extrinsic evidence is required to determine the settlor's intent regarding the scope of the Clifton Club's use of the Beach, including the Trustees' historical interpretation and administration of the rights accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 59} The Club Lease capped Clifton Club membership at 250 Club Members. The Club Lease, Trust Deed, and Club Deed indicate an intent that the Clifton Club, as lessees and successor lot owners, have access to the Beach, but that such access was subject to the rules and regulations implemented by the Trustees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Records prior to 1942 were destroyed in a fire at the Clifton Club. However, subsequent Clifton Club and Trustee meeting minutes confirm that the Trustees made an annual determination on the amount that the Clifton Club was to pay to allow the members access to the Beach. Various formulas were implemented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Over the years, the meeting minutes of the Trustees as well as the Clifton Club's board of directors document the understanding that use of the Beach by the Club Members was regulated by the Trustees. On June 29, 1942, the Clifton Club unanimously adopted a resolution designating a committee to investigate the legal authority and right of the Trustees to enter into an agreement with the Clifton Club regulating use of the Beach by the Club Members, and to advise the Trustees that the Clifton Club \"authorized a call to each member * * * for one quarter of the annual dues\" to be paid to the Trustees for \"full use of all facilities of the beach in common with, and to the same extent as lot owners in Clifton Park.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   {\u00b6 62} At the July 8, 1942 Clifton Club board meeting, the Clifton Club committee read for the record a letter to the Clifton Club from the Trustees acknowledging the acceptance of the Clifton Club's proposal to the Trustees for payment by the Club Members to access the Beach. The minutes further reflect that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   The letter expressly stated that \"neither this letter nor any action taken, or to be taken, hereunder shall impair or affect either your rights or the rights of our beneficiaries or of us with respect to any of such questions, nor shall it or any such action constitute a precedent for a future year.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The call was approved by the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   {\u00b6 63} The Clifton Club determined at the August 7, 1947 meeting that, in 1948 and thereafter, it would pay the Trustees\n   for operation and maintenance of the Beach:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   [A] certain share of the expenses incurred in the particular year in the operation and maintenance of said Beach: which share to be that fraction of the total of such expenses for the particular year that the number of Club members entitled to use the Beach bears to the total of (1) the number of such members, and (2) the number of sublots in Clifton Park. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   [S]uch arrangement shall continue unless the same shall be terminated or changed by the affirmative vote of a majority of either the stockholders or of the members of this Club present, in person or by proxy, at a meeting called for such purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   {\u00b6 64} The annual payments continued. A January 19, 1963 letter authored Trustee Clayton Quintrell, Esq., printed on his law firm's letterhead, is addressed to his fellow Trustees, and discusses the Club Members' access to the Beach. The Clifton Club suggested that the Club Members pay the Trustees directly for Beach access to avoid a 20 percent tax assessed upon Clifton Club dues. In pertinent part, Quintrell opines:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   Even if the 20 percent tax could be avoided, the Trustees might be compelled to charge the Club members a 10 percent admissions tax.\n   <em>\n    The lot owners\n   </em>\n   of course pay no admissions tax because they\n   <em>\n    are using their own property\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Club members, as such do not have any property interest in the beach\n   </em>\n   . For example,\n   <em>\n    they are not responsible for and have never contributed toward payment of the taxes upon the beach property\n   </em>\n   . The resolution which was passed at the special meeting of the members and stockholders of the [Clifton] Club made it\n   <em>\n    perfectly clear that this was a permissive use afforded to the Club [M]embers\n   </em>\n   , terminable at any time by the Club [M]embers themselves upon short notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   Consequently, even if the 20 percent could be avoided, a 10 percent admissions tax might be required to be collected and paid by the Trustees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Notes by Clifton Club director Smith memorialize a May 4, 1970 meeting between Clifton Club personnel and Trustees. At that meeting, Trustee Hartford stated the Club Members had no rights \"under the land deed\" and that the rights were reserved to the lot owners. The parties agree that the fee arrangement has been in place for the past 70 years, and that the Clifton Club has paid a mutually agreed upon annual maintenance assessment for the Beach at a higher rate than the formula set forth in the Trust Deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Recitation of the foregoing events serves to confirm a historical understanding by the Trustees and Clifton Club that the Club Members' right to access the Beach is permissive, and that the Trustees have full authority to regulate Beach access. The Club Lease, capping the membership number subject to the settlors' consent, confirms that the Clifton Club's use, even as a direct Beneficiary, is not unfettered, particularly since the purpose of the Trust is to allow the lot owners to enjoy the Beach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   {\u00b6 67} We conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the Club Members have a \"right\" to use the Beach. However, in response to the declaration explicitly requested by appellants, we find that the Club Members have no legal right of access as Beneficiaries. Access by the Club Members is by permission and regulation of the Trustees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Breach of Fiduciary Duties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Appellants argue in their second assigned error that the trial court erred in denying their motion to remove the Trustees. It is asserted that the Trustees breached their fiduciary duties by advocating against the owner Beneficiaries on behalf of the Clifton Club and the Club Members, and denying appellants the right to access Trust documents upon reasonable request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   {\u00b6 69} It is axiomatic that a trustee has a fiduciary duty to a trust beneficiary.

Even more alarming is the implied threat to engage in further discriminatory actions in the future if the Park Trustees deem it appropriate after what amounts to a 13-week trial run next summer. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   Clearly, you gave preference to the input from a dissident group of Park residents, with only a portion of residents participating, should not have been sufficient to impose restrictions of the magnitude involved. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   Let me reiterate, in the Trust Deed under the heading \"Duties of Trustees,\" the Trustees are obligated to carry out their role \"for the common use of all the lot owners in the Clifton Park allotment.\" Not some owners, not just vocal and irritated lot owners, but \"all\" lot owners. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   [G]iven the importance and gravity of the issues involved, we must formally object to these rules and request that you consider other modifications between now and the 2012 beach season to address the issue of overcrowding without treating The Clifton Club unfairly. As we have consistently communicated, we are ready, willing and able to work with you on a cooperative basis to deal with the underlying issues and are open to discussing all options, including a voluntary reduction of our membership.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Legal Memorandum of Clifton Club Beach Access\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   {\u00b6 81} On May 9, 2012, the Trustees secured a legal analysis on the question of Club Members' access to the Beach, involving review of the Club Lease, Trust Deed, and Club Deed, seeking an assessment of the legal rights of Club Members to access the Beach. The analysis determined that the Clifton Club and its members \"have rights to access the beach\" pursuant to the Trust Deed and Club Deed, and that the historical use of the Beach supports the conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Trustees Notice to Clifton Park Owners and Club Members\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   {\u00b6 82} The notice issued by the Trustees to Clifton Park residents and Club Members references an April 19, 2013 letter issued to the residents by the appellants. The appellants' letter advises residents that the declaratory judgment action is still pending, but that the court requires that all owners and the Trustees be added as parties to the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   {\u00b6 83} The Trustees' notice states the 2012 Beach rules had been effective at alleviating overcrowding, but the appellants continue to pursue the lawsuit. While appellants' letter states the lot owners are\n   not required to file a response to the suit, the Trustees' notice advises the lot owners that they have a duty to respond to the summons and complaint by law, and suggests that each owner seek legal counsel for advice. The notice also provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   A ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could cause a substantial and significant increase in the lot owners' assessments if the Clifton Club were to be banned from having beach access and the Clifton Club discontinued its substantial contribution to the Trust annual expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   {\u00b6 84} The Trustees also explain that they \"have not chosen sides in this matter,\" and that they petitioned the court to include them as a party because of their fiduciary duty to administer the Beach. Notice recipients were referred to the Trustees' website for additional information in the form of \"FAQs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   {\u00b6 85} Excerpts from the FAQ are also contained in the notice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Beneficiaries\n   </em>\n   . The beneficiaries of the Clifton Park Trust are the owners of the lots in Clifton Park. Clifton Club is a lot owner and thus is a beneficiary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Access and Use\n   </em>\n   . Annually before the beginning of the summer season the Trustees publish and distribute to the beneficiaries \"Clifton Beach Rules\" that regulate access to and use of the beach and its facilities. As an example, for 2012 the Trustees established new rules for behavior at and access to the beach in response to issues raised by beneficiaries about overcrowding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Control\n   </em>\n   . The Clifton Park Trustees control access to the privately-owned Beach by maintaining security guards at the entrance to the beach to check visitors and issuing a limited number of vehicle stickers to lot owners and permitted Club Members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Club Members\n   </em>\n   . The Clifton Club, which owns four lots, is a beneficiary of the Trust. The 1902 lease of the lots to the Clifton Club and the 1912 deed conveying title to the lots to the Clifton Club provides the Clifton Club with beach access rights that they have been exercising for over one hundred years. In recognition of this right, the Clifton Club annually contributes a significant amount of money to the Trust for its operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Limit of Club Members\n   </em>\n   . The Trustees establish the number of Club Members who can access the beach. For the 2012 season the Trustees limited the Clifton Club beach access to 224 members (the Clifton Club has more than 224 members but only 224 were permitted to have beach access). Even if the number of Club Members grew to an \"unlimited\" number, the Trustees can and will reasonably limit the number of Club Members with beach access.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   {\u00b6 86} The notice concludes that the current Beach access protocol comports with historical practices and the Trust Deed. Finally, the Trustees explain that they began their amicus brief, filed in response to the declaratory complaint, with the phrase, \"[t]his dispute does not belong in court,\" stating they believe the historical methodology continues to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   {\u00b6 87} Cases cited by appellants generally hold that \"in a dispute between two parties claiming to be beneficiaries, a trustee may not advocate for either side or assume the validity of either side's position.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   <em>\n    Matter of Duke,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1183228\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/305/408/\">\n    305 N.J.Super. 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1183228\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/305/408/\">\n    702 A.2d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1024 (1995) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Cudahy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8675839\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/26/153/\">\n    26 Wis.2d 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20N.W.2d%20882\">\n    131 N.W.2d 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1965)\n   <em>\n    ;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.

The ST petitioned the court to approve distribution of residual estate assets involving securities. The ST was also an owner of a company that received a portion of the distribution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   {\u00b6 95} The court turned its attention to the impartiality analysis under R.C. 5808.03.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.

It is beyond dispute that the Trustees are subject to a duty of impartiality, and that the cited evidence may be construed as a breach of that duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   {\u00b6 97} In 2011, the Trustees were aware that the Beneficiaries were disturbed about overcrowding of the Beach, and several meetings were held with some of the Beneficiaries, including appellants, to discuss the problem. The question arose as to whether the Trustees had the legal right to regulate the Clifton Club's use of the Beach. Also in December 2011, the Clifton Club took issue with the Beach Rules circulated by the Trustees. The Clifton Club asserted that the rules disproportionately benefitted the vocal lot owner Beneficiaries and detrimentally impacted the Clifton Club. The Clifton Club also stated the rules constituted a breach of the Trustees' fiduciary duties, but said they were willing to work with the Trustees to resolve the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   {\u00b6 98} At the time of the 2011-2012 over-crowding issue, the Trustees were aware that the interests of the Clifton Club and lot owner Beneficiaries were in conflict. According to the Trustees' website, a printout of which is in the record, the Trustees \"were compelled to seek counsel of attorneys\" when \"some residents threatened to legally challenge the 100 year practices of the Trustees with respect to the relationship with the Clifton Club.\" On May 9, 2012, a legal memorandum was issued to the Trustees opining that the Clifton Club and Club Members have the \"legal right to access\" the Beach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   {\u00b6 99} Appellants' request to see the legal memorandum was denied by the Trustees. The Trustees also refused to seek a judicial interpretation of the Trust rights, resulting in the filing of the instant action on June 2, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   {\u00b6 100} The Trustees' amicus brief was filed in support of the Clifton Club's motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustees argued: (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   they were necessary parties as title owners to the Beach; and (2) as fiduciaries of the Trust, and pursuant to the express terms thereof, they were charged with the duty to hold the Beach for \"the use and benefit of all of the owners.\" R.C. 5808.09,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   5808.01,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 5808.11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   {\u00b6 101} The Trustees proffer that there is no ambiguity in the Trust Deed that the declaratory matter was moot because recent regulations had alleviated the Beach crowding issue. \"For over 100 years it has been clear pursuant to the 'Trust Deed' \" that all lot owners, including the Clifton Club, have a right to use the Beach, and that \"this includes the members of the\" Clifton Club.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   {\u00b6 102} The Trustees' position has supported that of the Clifton Club, though assertedly offered to protect the Beach. There is also the issuance of the 2013 letter to residents and Club Members addressing the notice circulated by appellants emphasizing that the Club Members had the right to access the Beach per the Trust Deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   {\u00b6 103} At this point, the Trustees arguably crossed the fine line between the duty to defend the Trust and the duty of impartiality as between beneficiaries. At the time appellants requested that the Trustees file an action to declare the legal rights to Beach access, the Trustees could have petitioned the court for direction regarding interpretation of the Trust Deed pursuant to R.C. 5802.01, UTC 201.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   {\u00b6 125} We determine that the lot owners are the sole legal beneficiaries of the Trust. The Clifton Club is a lot owner and thus a beneficiary. The Trust Deed is the sole conveyor of legal rights to the beneficiaries. The Club Deed transferred title to the Club Lots. The Club Deed did not, and could not, convey any greater rights to the Trust property than those that are set forth in the Trust Deed, because title to, and control of, the Trust property was vested solely in the Trustees via the Trust Deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   {\u00b6 126} The Club Members are not equal or direct Beneficiaries of the Trust. The Club Members' have a permissive right to access the Beach as regulated by the Trustees pursuant to the Trust Deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   {\u00b6 127} The Trustees breached the duties of impartiality, and to inform and report to appellants as Beneficiaries. The Trustees are ordered to compensate the appellants for reasonable attorney fees, costs, and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   {\u00b6 128} This case is reversed and remanded to the trial court to enter judgment for appellants in accordance with this court's findings, and to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the reasonable amount of attorney fees, costs, and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   MARY J.

GALLAGHER, P.J., DISSENTING:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   {\u00b6 129} I concur with the majority's resolution of appellant's first assignment of error. I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority's finding in appellant's second assignment of error that the Trustees breached their duty of impartiality. I further dissent from the majority's conclusion that appellants are entitled to reasonable attorney fees, costs, and expenses as a result of the Trustees alleged breach of their duty to \"promptly respond to a beneficiaries request for information related to the administration of the trust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   {\u00b6 130} Regarding the merits of appellant's declaratory judgment action, I agree with the majority's finding that the Club Members are not beneficiaries under the\n   Trust Deed and, therefore, have no legal right to access the subject beach. Logically, the trial court raised several persuasive arguments concerning the nature of the Clifton Club and its relationship with its members. As the court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-291\">\n   It is illogical to reason that the [Clifton] Club, as a lot owner, has a right to use common land deeded to it, but that its members would not also have this privilege. What is a club without its members? A building, a simple structure, cannot enjoy a beach. People can. And for what reason would someone be a Club [M]ember if they could not enjoy the legal benefits provided to the [Clifton] Club; in fact, that is the only reason a person would become a member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   {\u00b6 131} However, while I recognize the trial court's position, our independent review of the relevant trust and the express language used therein requires us to find to the contrary. The trust simply does not contain any language from which this court can reasonably conclude that the members of the Clifton Club share the same legal rights as the Clifton Club itself. Accordingly, the trial court erred in awarding summary judgment in favor of the appellees. It is my hope that, on remand, the parties negotiate a fair and equitable agreement that would grant members of the Clifton Club access to the beach on a permissive basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   {\u00b6 132} With respect to appellant's motion to remove the trustees, I respectfully dissent from the majority's conclusion that the Trustees breached their duty of impartiality by \"taking sides\" with the Clifton Club throughout this case. In my view, the Trustees' actions were not predicated on the \"taking of sides,\" but were motivated by their obligation to defend and uphold the purpose of the Trust Deed in accordance with the information and legal opinions they had in front of them at the time this action was initiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   {\u00b6 133} Nevertheless, even if the Trustees were operating in good faith, they were not relieved of their duty to inform, report, and promptly respond pursuant to R.C. 5808.13. With that said, I concede that the evidence submitted in this matter demonstrates that the Trustees may have breached their fiduciary duty to promptly respond by initially denying appellants' access to certain trust-related information upon a reasonable request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   {\u00b6 134} From this record, however, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the Trustees' inaction harmed the appellants. The majority states that the Trustees conduct \"impeded equal access to necessary information for an equitable resolution, thus causing injury.\" After careful consideration, I cannot say the Trustees' conduct in this case prevented an equitable resolution of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   {\u00b6 135} Here, the record reflects that the Trustees provided appellants with over 12,000 pages of copied Trust documents \"via disc\" in the course of discovery. To the extent appellants argue that the Trustees breached their fiduciary duties to the Beneficiaries by failing to grant access to materials that were alleged by the Trustees to be privileged, I note that this issue was adequately addressed and resolved by the trial court following appellant's April 2015 motion to compel discovery. The Trustees were ordered to produce the original trust documents for inspection and were required to produce three of the eight trust documents addressed in appellants' motion to compel. There is nothing in this record to suggest the Trustees did not comply with the trial court's August 2015 discovery order. Moreover, appellants do not appeal from the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   {\u00b6 136} In short, it is my belief that the appellants were furnished with the necessary\n   information to protect their interests in this case-the precise goal of R.C. 5808.13. Under these circumstances, I do not believe the pillars of justice and equity require the Trustees to pay reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
