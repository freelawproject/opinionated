Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, ProMedica Memorial Hospital (\"ProMedica\"), appeals the judgment of the Sandusky County Court of\n   Common Pleas granting appellee's, Sharon Taylor, motion for summary judgment, thereby entitling her to workers' compensation benefits for a fracture to her right femur sustained as a result of a fall that occurred on April 22, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On April 22, 2015, appellee, a ProMedica employee, arrived on the ProMedica campus approximately 15 minutes before her scheduled shift and parked in a designated employee parking lot. As appellee walked from the parking lot to the HealthLink building where she worked, she stepped off a sidewalk and walked down a grassy slope. A five to six inch high curb separated the grassy area from a parking lot in front of the HealthLink building. As appellee stepped from the curb to the parking lot, she fell forward and struck her right knee on the parking lot pavement. Appellee originally reported that her fall occurred while attempting to adjust her coat after a gust of wind blew the coat up and she stepped off a curb onto the parking lot. After returning to the scene of the fall and observing a damaged curb where she stepped down onto the parking lot, she testified in her deposition that the broken curb caused her fall. ProMedica contends that a gust of wind caused appellee's fall. As a direct and proximate cause of her fall, appellee sustained a fracture of her right femur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On August 19, 2015, the District Hearing Officer of the Industrial Commission of Ohio granted appellee workers' compensation benefits. ProMedica appealed the decision. Following a hearing, the staff hearing officer affirmed the order granting benefits. Subsequently, the Industrial Commission of Ohio rejected ProMedica's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On November 23, 2015, ProMedica filed its notice of appeal in the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas. On December 16, 2015, appellee filed her complaint with the trial court, in which she alleged that her fall occurred in the course of, and arose out of, her employment with ProMedica. Motions for summary judgment were filed by both parties in November 2016. On December 23, 2016, the trial court filed its decision granting appellee's motion and denying ProMedica's motion. Subsequently, ProMedica filed a timely notice of appeal, and this case was placed on this court's accelerated docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On appeal, appellant assigns the following error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court erred in this workers' compensation case by granting the motion for summary judgment of Appellee Sharon Taylor * * *, because it misapplied the test to determine causal connection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As in the present case,\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   involved an injury sustained on the employment premises, traveling between the building and parking lot. Having found the employee in\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   was injured on the premises, the coming and going rule was not considered. In addition, the Tenth District found the coming and going rule, expressed in\n   <em>\n    MTD Prods.\n   </em>\n   , inapplicable to an employee's injury sustained on the employment premises.\n   <em>\n    Phelps v.

Appellee arrived at her workplace approximately 15 minutes before her scheduled shift and sustained her injury while traveling from a designated employee parking lot to the building where she worked. Notably, appellee was not engaged in any activity or errand other than traversing to work on a regular route. Although there is testimony that appellee walked along a \"shortcut\" route to the building as opposed to a route with sidewalks, the route taken was one commonly used by appellee and others as a more direct route to reach the HealthLink building. Appellee was required to travel from the employee parking lot to the HealthLink building prior to the start of her shift. Hence, under the facts and circumstances of this case, we find the coming and going rule inapplicable to appellee's injury sustained on ProMedica's premises. Therefore, any exceptions to this general rule are irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Since the parties have stipulated appellee was in the course of her employment when her injury occurred, the central issue of this case is whether appellee's injury arose out of employment. Therefore, we consider whether there is a sufficient causal connection between appellee's injury and her employment. ProMedica contends that the trial court should have considered the totality of the circumstances analysis in determining whether there is sufficient causal connection between appellee's injury and employment to determine the arising under prong of the statute. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} \"The proper way to analyze workers' compensation claims, * * *, is to apply the 'in the course of' and 'arising\n   out of' tests described in\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, including the totality-of-the-circumstances tests for causation described in\n   <em>\n    Lord\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ruckman\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Friebel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202554\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/142/425/\">\n    142 Ohio St.3d 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-4531\">\n    2014-Ohio-4531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20N.E.3d%20413\">\n    32 N.E.3d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 28. Therefore, our analysis of whether appellee is entitled to workers' compensation benefits further requires us to consider the totality of the circumstances factors set out in\n   <em>\n    Lord\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   to determine if her injury arose out of employment. As noted above, the factors include: \"(1) the proximity of the scene of the accident to the place of employment, (2) the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident, and (3) the benefit the employer received from the injured employee's presence at the scene of the accident.\"\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1422606\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/49/275/#p277\">\n    49 Ohio St.3d at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=551%20N.E.2d%201271\">\n    551 N.E.2d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Lord\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6712252\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/66/441/\">\n    66 Ohio St.2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=423%20N.E.2d%2096\">\n    423 N.E.2d 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Having established that appellee's injury occurred on the employment premises, appellee satisfies the first factor. The second factor considers the degree of control ProMedica had over the scene of the accident. In\n   <em>\n    Phelps\n   </em>\n   , the court held that the first two factors of the totality of the circumstances analysis were satisfied because the employee was injured on the employer's premises.\n   <em>\n    Phelps\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. Franklin No. 09AP-1118,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-2423\">\n    2010-Ohio-2423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202171631\">\n    2010 WL 2171631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 10. Although appellee's injury also occurred on the employer's premises, we will further evaluate the second factor of the totality of the circumstances test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 23} While there is some dispute as to the exact cause of appellee's fall, it is undisputed that the injury occurred on ProMedica's premises while stepping down from a curb onto a parking lot. ProMedica does not argue that the cause of the fall is due to idiopathic reasons. In fact, the record supports that the fall was accidental. However, the record shows that appellee put forth different causes of the fall. First, appellee asserted that the wind caused her fall. Upon further reflection, appellee testified that her fall was caused by a damaged curb. She explained to the staff hearing officer that the quick progression of the events led to this discrepancy. ProMedica, therefore, contends that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the cause of the fall. If the wind caused appellee's fall, ProMedica argues appellee's injury is non-compensable because it had no control of the wind. Appellee contends she is entitled to workers' compensation benefits regardless of whether the wind or curb caused her fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} While ProMedica argues that it cannot control the wind, ProMedica does control the employment premises where the injury was sustained. The record in this case shows that the sidewalk from the parking area to the entrance of the HealthLink building contained safety paint and cones alerting pedestrians to potential sidewalk hazards. Appellee chose to leave the sidewalk and take the \"shortcut\" down the grassy slope that led to the scene of the accident. The record further demonstrates that it is fairly common for appellee and other people to take this alternate route to the HealthLink building. While employees were periodically reminded at staff meetings to stay on the sidewalk, it is reasonable that people would avoid a sidewalk hazard or take a shortcut both of which were under ProMedica's control. ProMedica had the ability to fix any sidewalk hazards and ensure a common shortcut route could safely be traversed without stepping onto a curb. Thus, irrespective of the cause of the fall, ProMedica had control of the routes to the HealthLink building and scene of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Lastly, under the third factor we consider the benefit to ProMedica from appellee's presence at the scene of\n   the accident. It has been held that \"an employee arriving to begin his day's work is not yet performing any service for the benefit of his employer.\"\n   <em>\n    MTD Prods\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1708821\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/61/66/#p68\">\n    61 Ohio St.3d at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=572%20N.E.2d%20661\">\n    572 N.E.2d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [a]n employee need not be engaged in the actual performance of work for his employer at the time of the injury to be entitled to workers' compensation benefits.

Appellee was not deviating from the normal course of her employment activities nor engaged in personal business. She was engaged in an activity consistent with and necessary to begin her day's work. If it were not for the fact that appellee was reporting for work, she would not have been present on the ProMedica campus. Hence, we conclude ProMedica received at least some benefit from appellee's timely presence on the employment premises to begin her scheduled shift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Thus, we find appellee meets all three totality of the circumstances factors. Even if we were to conclude that all of the factors were not met, however, establishing that one or more factors are not met does not preclude a finding that the employee's injury arose out of employment.\n   <em>\n    Friebel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202554\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/142/425/\">\n    142 Ohio St.3d 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-4531\">\n    2014-Ohio-4531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20N.E.3d%20413\">\n    32 N.E.3d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 14. Therefore, whether the injury was caused by the wind, as posited by ProMedica, or the damaged curb, the facts support a sufficient causal connection between the injury and appellee's employment under the totality of the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Accordingly, we find that appellee meets both the \"in the course of\" and \"arising out of\" prongs of R.C. 4123.01(C). In arriving at our decision, we are mindful that Ohio workers' compensation claims should be \"liberally construed in favor of employees.\" R.C. 4123.95. We stress that this case should not be interpreted broadly, as cases involving workers' compensation claims are inherently fact-specific. Indeed, our review of the case law cited by the parties in this action presents a breadth of jurisprudence that is not always harmonious, especially as to the interpretation and application of the coming and going rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Having concluded that appellee's injury was sustained in the course of, and arising out of, her employment, we conclude that she is entitled to receive workers' compensation benefits.

Therefore, ProMedica's sole assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.
