We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   A motion under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20754\">\n    365 Mass. 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint. See\n   <em>\n    Greenleaf Arms Realty Trust I, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Boston Fund, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3898621\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/81/282/#p288\">\n    81 Mass. App. Ct. 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 288 (2012). In testing sufficiency, we take as true all factual allegations of the complaint and draw any reasonable inferences therefrom in Schwartz's favor. See\n   <em>\n    Dartmouth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Greater New Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272961\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/366/#p374\">\n    461 Mass. 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 374 (2012). After conducting the required de novo review here, we conclude that the claims were either barred on procedural grounds or that the factual allegations of the complaint failed to plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272961\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/366/#p374\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272961\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/366/#p374\">\n    . at 373-374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Count one alleges \"wrongful suspension under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A,\" against \"the defendants.\" That statutory section does not provide a right of action; it establishes a limitations period for certain types of actions. Schwartz does not identify the basis of his legal claim. The factual allegations, untethered to any recognized statutory or common-law claim, are inadequate to plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In count two, Schwartz alleges that he was subjected to retaliation in violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 187, the Massachusetts medical provider whistleblower statute, for raising numerous concerns about threats to patient safety at Arbour. See\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    UHS of Westwood Pembroke, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275889\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/72/539/#p540\">\n    72 Mass. App. Ct. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540-541 (2008). The discrete acts of retaliation alleged include the suspension of Schwartz's clinical privileges on May 31, 2013, and the publication of false reports and documents about Schwartz to the government in September, 2013. Filed in the Superior Court on May 27, 2016, these particular whistleblower claims are time barred. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 187(\n   <em>\n    d\n   </em>\n   ) (two-year limitations period). See also\n   <em>\n    Sawyer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kindred Healthcare, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123281\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/186/118/#p126\">\n    186 F. Supp. 3d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126-127 (D. Mass. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Schwartz's remaining whistleblower claims alleged in count two are based on the defendants' \"collusion\" with the Board of Registration in Medicine (board), their improper involvement in the board's investigation and its case presentation at the May, 2016, public hearings, and their \"continuing ongoing active involvement in actions against Dr. Schwartz's medical license.\" As noted in Schwartz's complaint, the whistleblower statute defines \"[r]etaliatory action\" as \"the discharge, suspension, demotion, harassment, denial of a promotion or layoff or other adverse action taken against a health care provider affecting the terms and conditions of employment.\" G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 187(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ), inserted by St. 1999, c. 127, \u00a7 146. Schwartz resigned in June, 2013. The defendants' improper conduct in 2016 and their ongoing tortious conduct could not affect \"the terms and conditions of [Schwartz's] employment.\" As matter of law, none of this complained-of conduct falls within the statutory definition of retaliatory action that could form the basis of an actionable whistleblower claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In counts three and four of his complaint, Schwartz purported to assert claims for violations of Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. (Title VII), and G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Schwartz failed to state claims for relief under these statutes. Schwartz correctly points out that in certain circumstances, employers may be held liable under these statutory sections for postemployment retaliation. See\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shell Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595510\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/337/#p346\">\n    519 U.S. 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346 (1997) ;\n   <em>\n    Psy-Ed Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270954\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/697/#p708\">\n    459 Mass. 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 708-709 (2011). The fatal flaw in Schwartz's complaint is the absence of any allegation that he engaged in any activity, or exercised any right, protected by these statutes. See\n   <em>\n    Fantini\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Salem State College\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383751\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/22/#p32\">\n    557 F.3d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32 (1st Cir. 2009) ;\n   <em>\n    Psy-Ed Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270954\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/697/#p708\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270954\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/697/#p708\">\n    at 706-707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Verdrager\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky &amp; Popeo, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173392\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/382/#p405\">\n    474 Mass. 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 405-406 (2016). Schwartz's patient advocacy, while perhaps admirable, was not protected conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Even if Schwartz properly served defendants Arbour and Universal Health Services Foundation, Inc., he conceded that the claims against these defendants were identical to those asserted against the other defendants. For the reasons stated previously, these claims failed as matter of law and were properly dismissed under rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The balance of Schwartz's undeveloped arguments are deemed waived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270854\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/361/#p392\">\n    459 Mass. 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392 (2011).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The judge did not commit any procedural error. Where no exhibits were attached to the complaint, the judge could properly have confined his analysis to its four corners. Even if the judge considered the exhibits submitted with Schwartz's opposition memorandum, the motions were properly decided under rule 12(b)(6). See\n    <em>\n     Schaer\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Brandeis Univ.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285288\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/432/474/#p477\">\n     432 Mass. 474\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 477 (2000).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The employment antidiscrimination statute recognizes two types of retaliation claims.
