For the following reasons, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On October 6, 1999, N.J. was found guilty on a plea of no contest to one count of failing to comply with housing code while permitting occupancy of a dwelling, in violation of Columbus City Code 4509.01, a third-degree misdemeanor, in case No. 1999ERB-074213.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On May 1, 2006, N.J. pled guilty to one count of a pattern of corrupt activity, in violation of R.C. 2923.32, a third-degree felony, and two counts of receiving stolen property, in violation of R.C. 2913.51, both fifth-degree felonies, in case No. 05CR-2827.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On October 15, 2012, N.J. was found guilty on a plea of no contest to one count of selling liquor to a minor, in violation of R.C. 4301.69, a first-degree misdemeanor, in case No. 2012CRB-025317.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On June 21, 2016, N.J. filed an application to seal the record of his three felony convictions in case No. 05CR-2827. The state filed objections to the application to seal on July 28, 2016. The state argued that N.J. did not qualify as an eligible offender because (1) the court had discretion to consider the three felony convictions as a single conviction and, regardless, (2) there were two other misdemeanor convictions. The trial court held a hearing on the matter on October 19, 2016. At the hearing, in response to the state's objection, N.J. argued the court should consider (1) the 2012 change in the law to expand the definition of persons who might expunge or seal their records, and (2) the fact that the determination that a housing code violation constituted an offense was a judicial determination, not a statutory determination. The court granted N.J. leave to file a supplemental memorandum to further address the state's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On November 21, 2016, N.J. filed a memorandum in response to the state's objections. N.J. asked the court to (1) consider his three felony convictions as one, (2) disregard the Second District's decision in\n   <em>\n    Dayton v.

The state filed a reply to N.J.'s memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On January 18, 2017, the court held another hearing. At the hearing, N.J. stated that the convictions prevented him from obtaining state issued permits, including a permit from the Ohio Lottery Commission and the State Liquor Control Commission. He further stated that a sealing of the record would help him get his own business, improve his income, and support his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On January 27, 2017, without explanation as to N.J.'s eligibility, the court granted the request to seal the record pursuant to R.C. 2953.32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In Ohio, \"expungement\" remains a common colloquialism used to describe the process of sealing criminal records pursuant to statutory authority.\n   <em>\n    Pariag\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In its sole assignment of error, the state argues the trial court erred when it granted N.J.'s application to seal his record because he was not an \"eligible offender\" under R.C. 2953.31(A). Pursuant to R.C. 2953.32(A)(1), only an \"eligible offender\" may apply to have the records of a conviction sealed. R.C. 2953.31(A) defines the term \"eligible offender\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Eligible offender\" means anyone who has been convicted of an offense in this state or any other jurisdiction and who has\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [1] not more than one felony conviction,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [2] not more than two misdemeanor convictions, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [3] not more than one felony conviction and one misdemeanor conviction in this state or any other jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} N.J. does not meet the first criteria of having not more than one felony conviction or the second criteria of having not more than two misdemeanor convictions. Therefore, we must consider whether N.J. meets the third criteria of having not more than one felony conviction and one misdemeanor conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} For purposes of this discussion, and without deciding the same,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   we will\n   assume that N.J.'s three convictions in case No. 05CR-2827 count as one conviction. If this were the case, N.J. would meet the first part of the criteria in that he would be considered to not have more than one felony conviction. The second part of the third criteria, however, requires that he have not more than one misdemeanor conviction. N.J. has two misdemeanor convictions, one third-degree misdemeanor for violating the Columbus housing code and one first-degree misdemeanor for selling liquor to a minor. N.J. encouraged the trial court to disregard the housing code violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} It is true that R.C. 2953.31(A) excepts many types of convictions from consideration in determining eligibility for record sealing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   For purposes of, and except as otherwise provided in, this division, a conviction for a minor misdemeanor, for a violation of any section in Chapter 4507., 4510., 4511., 4513., or 4549. of the Revised Code, or for a violation of a municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to any section in those chapters is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   a conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 16} These exceptions do not, however, include housing code violations pursuant to state law or any other jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Recently, the Supreme Court of Ohio construed the exceptions outlined in R.C. 2953.31(A). In\n   <em>\n    State v. J.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280543\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/148/113/\">\n    148 Ohio St.3d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280543\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/148/113/\">\n    2016-Ohio-2803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20N.E.3d%20642\">\n    69 N.E.3d 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court rejected the defendant-applicant's argument that his fourth-degree misdemeanor conviction for failure to register a motor vehicle under R.C. 4503.11(A) did not count as a conviction when determining an applicant's eligible offender status for record sealing purposes. The court noted that the exceptions outlined in R.C. 2953.31(A) at that time did not include fourth-degree misdemeanor convictions for violating R.C. 4503.11(A), and held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The language of R.C. 2953.31(A) clearly and unambiguously provides that a fourth-degree-misdemeanor conviction for failure to register a motor vehicle under R.C. 4503.11(A) is a conviction for purposes of determining a person's status as an eligible offender. And when a statute's language is clear, we neither interpret it nor construe it. * * * Instead we apply the statute as written.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Furthermore, consistent with the Supreme Court's reading of R.C. 2953.31(A), we observe that R.C. 2935.01(D) defines \"offense\" as including \"felonies, misdemeanors, and violations and ordinances of municipal corporations and other public bodies authorized by law to adopt penal\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   regulations [except where the context specifically indicates otherwise].\" The Second District in\n   <em>\n    Sheibenberger\n   </em>\n   relied on R.C. 2935.01(D) in holding that \"housing violations are 'offenses' for purposes of determining whether an individual is a 'first offender.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 534,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20N.E.2d%20841\">\n    685 N.E.2d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We agree with the Second District that the housing code violation at issue in this case is an offense for purposes of determining whether an individual is an eligible offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Accordingly, taking into consideration the Supreme Court's recent construction of the exceptions in R.C. 2953.31(A) and the statutory definition of offense at R.C. 2935.01(D), we find the trial court erred in granting N.J.'s application to seal the record of his three felonies in case No. 05CR-2827. The state's sole assignment is error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Based on the foregoing, the state's sole assignment of error is sustained. As such, we reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment reversed and cause remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   KLATT and SADLER, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    R.C. 2953.31(A) continues to explain as follows: \"When two or more convictions result from or are connected with the same act or result from offenses committed at the same time, they shall be counted as one conviction. When two or three convictions result from the same indictment, information, or complaint, from the same plea of guilty, or from the same official proceeding, and result from related criminal acts that were committed within a three-month period but do not result from the same act or from offenses committed at the same time, they shall be counted as one conviction, provided that a court may decide as provided in division (C)(1)(a) of section 2953.32 of the Revised Code that it is not in the public interest for the two or three convictions to be counted as one conviction.\" The trial court did not determine whether N.J.'s three felony convictions result from or are connected with the same act or result from offenses committed at the same time; therefore, we decline to consider the same. Furthermore, it is not necessary for us to determine as explained above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The Columbus City Code 4509.99 provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    (A) Whoever violates any provision of this Housing Code is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned for not more than one hundred eighty (180) days or both.
