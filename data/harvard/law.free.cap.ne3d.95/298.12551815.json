A Superior Court judge ordered summary judgment for the MBTA, reasoning that the platform where the injury occurred was a \"way\" within the meaning of G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 15, and that the plaintiff had not served the MBTA with notice of his injuries within thirty days as required by G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 18. On appeal, the plaintiff assigns error to the judge's conclusion that the platform is a way. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We summarize the undisputed summary judgment record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See\n   <em>\n    Augat, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895508\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/410/117/#p120\">\n    410 Mass. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120 (1991). The platform\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   is located in the middle of Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, on land reserved to the MBTA pursuant to St. 1894, c. 234. It is a six-foot-wide paved walkway that runs parallel to Commonwealth Avenue's outbound traffic lanes, between Commonwealth Avenue and the MBTA green line \"T\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   tracks. The paved area has two parts: a four-foot-wide plain asphalt surface, level with the top of the granite curb that separates the platform from the automobile lanes, and a two-foot-wide, raised, yellow \"landing strip\" bordering the track area. The platform begins at the intersection of Commonwealth Avenue and Babcock Street, and continues for some length before terminating at a part of the median consisting of grass and dirt. A fence separates the platform and tracks from counterparts on the inbound side of Commonwealth Avenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On May 5, 2013, the plaintiff (then a Boston police officer) ran along the platform toward Babcock Street in pursuit of two suspected robbers. He stepped in a depression in the pavement, tripped, and fell, severing his left patellar tendon. He first informed the MBTA of this accident over five months later, on October 23, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

The standard for granting or denying a motion for summary judgment is well established: we determine \"whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Augat, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Section 15 provides the exclusive remedy for \"bodily injury or damage ...

The sole issue before us is whether the Babcock Street station platform is a \"way\" within the meaning of \u00a7 15. If it is a way, then the plaintiff was required to provide the MBTA notice of his claim within thirty days. See \u00a7 18. It is undisputed that he did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The interpretation of the statutory term \"way\" as applied to undisputed facts is a matter reserved for the court.

In this case, the term is not defined in the statute or the case law interpreting it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we give the term its \"usual and accepted meaning[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    St. Louis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801901\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/350/#p355\">\n    473 Mass. 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355 (2015).

Only a curb and higher grade separate the platform walkway from the adjacent roadways. A pedestrian can walk from the sidewalk, onto and across Commonwealth Avenue, and onto and along the platform. Indeed, the plaintiff did exactly that.
