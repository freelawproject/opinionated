L. c. 258E. At an ex parte hearing held that day, a District Court judge denied the plaintiff's request for an order, but marked the matter up for a hearing after notice. At the scheduled hearing held a week later, the plaintiff attended, but the defendant did not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A second judge heard the plaintiff's testimony and engaged with her on whether a harassment order was a good fit for her particular situation, or whether instead she should hire a lawyer to explore other options. In the end, the judge issued the requested order, announcing: \"You seem desperate. I'll issue an order, but I am going to tell you now, you know, you should be talking to a lawyer, okay?\" On appeal, the defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the order. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In her affidavit and testimony, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was harassing her in a variety of ways. These included: providing false reports about her to the police, a school, and the Department of Children and Families, causing noise through banging on the ceiling, and taking photographs of her and her granddaughter even after she asked her to stop. According to the plaintiff, such actions caused her to be frightened of the defendant, an allegation that the judge appears to have accepted. Nevertheless, fear alone is not enough to make out a claim for a harassment prevention order. Rather, under the applicable provision in the statute, G. L. c. 258E, \u00a7 1, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant \"wilfully and maliciously committed three separate acts that were intended to cause her fear, intimidation, abuse, or damage to property, and that, 'considered together, did in fact cause fear, intimidation, abuse, or damage to property.' \"\n   <em>\n    C.E.R\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    P.C\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20124\">\n    91 Mass. App. Ct. 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126 (2017), quoting from\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Borowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273190\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/415/\">\n    461 Mass. 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 426 &amp; n.8 (2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The transcript of the hearing suggests that the judge issued the harassment prevention order because the plaintiff \"seem[ed] desperate,\" not because he had concluded that she had met her burden of proving three acts that qualified as \"harassment\" under the statute. In any event, in our view, the judge did not have sufficient evidence before him on which to conclude that the plaintiff had made out such a claim. We therefore vacate the harassment prevention order and remand this matter to the District Court for that court to direct law enforcement agencies to destroy all records of the order. See G. L. c. 258E, \u00a7 9 ;\n   <em>\n    C.E.R\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    P.C\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20124\">\n    91 Mass.

Although this development, if true, may significantly affect the situation going forward, it does not render moot the defendant's current appeal seeking to vacate the order, which at this time remains in effect. Compare\n    <em>\n     Quinn\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Gjoni\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456690\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/89/408/#p412\">\n     89 Mass.

At oral argument, defense counsel represented that his client was never served. However, the defendant never moved to vacate the order on this ground and, on the current record, we have no way of addressing the notice question. We therefore do not reach this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    <em>\n     C.E.R\n    </em>\n    . v.\n    <em>\n     P.C\n    </em>\n    . involved a dispute between a homeowner and two tenants who rented space in her home.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20124\">\n     91 Mass.
