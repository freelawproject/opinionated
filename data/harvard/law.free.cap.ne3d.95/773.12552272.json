After this Court reversed the portion of the judgment relating to the aggravating circumstance specification, Mr. Franks was ultimately sentenced to twenty-three years to life on February 3, 1999. On March 22, 2001, Mr. Franks filed a pro se delayed petition for post-conviction relief, in which he claimed that he was in possession of newly discovered evidence that was indicative of a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation. The trial court denied the petition without a hearing and Mr. Franks did not appeal the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On October 25, 2016, Mr. Franks filed a second delayed petition for post-conviction relief. In this delayed petition, Mr. Franks again argued that he was denied his due process rights under\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), because the prosecutor withheld exculpatory ballistics evidence and ballistics reports and findings. Mr. Franks also argued his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to properly investigate, and it was counsel's deficient performance that allowed the prosecution to withhold favorable material and impeachment evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Finally, Mr. Franks argued that the United States Supreme Court recognized new federal and state rights in state post-conviction relief procedures which apply retroactively, including the retroactive application of\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court again denied Mr. Franks' petition without a hearing, concluding that Mr. Franks failed to comply with R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) and it, therefore, lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition. Mr. Franks appeals, raising four assignments of error, each of which contend that the trial court erred by dismissing his\n   petition for post-conviction relief without a hearing. For ease of analysis, this Court will address Mr. Franks' assignments of error out of order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED JUDICIAL DISCRETION VIOLATING THE SUPREMACY, DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSES, U.S. CONSTITUTION, DENYING THE DELAYED PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF ( [ ]R[.]C[.][ ]2953.23(A)(1)(a) &amp; (b)) WITHOUT A HEARING ON JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS BY REFUSING TO ACCEPT THAT MARTINEZ V.

Therefore, this Court will not disturb the decision of a trial court regarding a petition for post-conviction relief absent an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .
