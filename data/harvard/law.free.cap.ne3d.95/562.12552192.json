Under the circumstances of this case, to conclude that defendant's presence at such gatherings alone was sufficient to establish agreement to join a plot would be to equate his passive act of \"being present\" with the affirmative act of \"agreeing\" to engage in a criminal conspiracy discussed at those assemblies. The law does not contain a presumption of agreement based on sheer presence at a meeting at which a conspiracy is discussed (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Penal Law \u00a7 105.00\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ), and we share the view of the federal courts that mere \"knowledge of the existence and goals of a conspiracy does not of itself make one a coconspirator\" (\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant did not participate in the March 1 attack but was instead charged with conspiring to commit this act of arson. It is undisputed that the defendant was a member of BPH. The only issue is whether the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the People, was sufficient to establish that he entered into an agreement with his fellow gang members to commit this particular crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To properly evaluate the proof in this case, it is crucial to understand what led to the March 1 attack. In 2009, Kuang-a member of BPH-violated gang rules by dating a Latin Queen affiliated with a rival tribe. BPH's leaders ordered him to either end the relationship or have her join BPH. Instead, Kuang quit the gang, a violation of gang rules that called for severe punishment. As a result, members of BPH began harassing Kuang and his family, leading to escalating violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The People put in proof of the following: (1) the BPH leadership structure and the roles and responsibilities of gang members; (2) defendant's membership in BPH; (3) defendant's participation in an earlier attack on a different residence associated with Kuang; and (4) defendant's attendance at several meetings during which the proposed arson attack was discussed and planned. Together, this proof was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The victim and the two cooperating gang members testified concerning the detailed leadership structure and internal security apparatus of the gang. All BPH members who are not a part of the leadership structure are considered \"body members\" and must attend weekly meetings, pay dues, pledge loyalty to the gang, and carry out missions on behalf of the gang. If a gang member violates a gang rule, they receive a beating. If\n   the gang member leaves the gang, the members will either \"beat you down or if they can't get you, they will get to your family.\" Defendant was a Latin King for at least two years prior to his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As a response to Kuang's perceived disloyalty to BPH, in February 2010, on at\n   least one occasion, gang members attacked a residence associated with Kuang and his family. At some point, a group of BPH members went to this residence where some members threw rocks and other items at the house. Defendant himself told the police in a post-arrest statement that he went to this residence with other gang members who threw \"rocks, bottles[,] buckets, pretty much anything they could find to throw and create damage to the house.\" A group of BPH members subsequently threw Molotov cocktails at the windows, although the bottles apparently did not break through the glass. One of the cooperating witnesses at defendant's trial testified that defendant was part of that group. Though defendant was not charged with any crimes relating to that attempted arson, the jury was permitted to consider the testimony as proof of defendant's agreement in the conspiracy with which he was charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Later in February 2010, in response to the earlier attacks, Kuang stabbed a member of BPH-the brother of the gang's president. Following the stabbing, the leader of BPH called an emergency meeting in Prospect Park to discuss a retaliatory mission. At that meeting, gang leaders informed the members that the mission would occur that night and would involve throwing Molotov cocktails into Kuang's home. Members were selected for the mission but defendant was not chosen. Over the course of the day, two other meetings took place during which there was some discussion of the upcoming mission to firebomb Kuang's apartment. At one of these meetings, there was a discussion about the failure of the prior attempt to firebomb an apartment associated with Kuang, but a gang leader insisted that although \"that wasn't done properly,\" he knew \"what to do now to make it complete.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant was arrested prior to the actual firebombing and claimed responsibility for the attack-placing himself at the scene of the crime-but also stating he \"was part of something but ... didn't do it.\" Given the timing of his arrest, defendant's claim that he was present was not true. But it is just as clear from his post-arrest statements that he knew significant details about the planned arson prior to its execution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I agree with the majority that defendant's presence at gang meetings alone is insufficient to establish agreement. I also agree with the general principle that an individual's knowledge of the goals of a conspiracy does not automatically make one a coconspirator. But the proof in this case cannot be examined in isolation: mere membership in the gang is not enough; mere knowledge of the plan is not enough; and a false confession does not establish defendant's participation. Properly marshaled as evidence, however, the proof was legally sufficient (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ceballos\n    </em>\n    for the proposition that knowledge of the goals of a conspiracy is insufficient to establish agreement is misplaced (\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9100081\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/340/115/#p124\">\n     340 F.3d 115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [2d Cir.2003] ). In\n    <em>\n     Ceballos\n    </em>\n    , the defendant supplied narcotics to a customer who then resold the drugs to undercover agents purportedly involved in a bribery scheme. The agents, by delaying payment to the customer, pressured that customer into introducing them to the supplier-Ceballos-to explain the reason the customer had not made timely payment. Shortly before arrests were made in the case, an agent had a call with Ceballos and explained the delay in payment was tied to a bribery scheme. The government argued, based solely on the call, that Ceballos was a coconspirator in that separate bribery scheme. The Second Circuit reversed the conviction for the bribery conspiracy, noting that Ceballos's knowledge, gained from the call with the agent, did not equate to agreement to bribe public officials. There was no other evidence that Ceballos knew of, or participated in, the bribery scheme.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
