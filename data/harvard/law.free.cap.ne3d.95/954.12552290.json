The pharmacist reported suspicious conduct on the part of two women attempting to purchase a quantity of pseudoephedrine\n   while visiting the Walgreens pharmacy. The women had trouble producing identification, and one of the women left leaving her purported identification behind. Each of the women had prior significant history of purchasing pseudoephedrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Officer Rodriquez and Officer Steven Schivinski of the Mansfield Metrich Drug Task Force drove to the Walgreens and spoke with the pharmacist, retrieving the left-behind identification. The officers learned the identification belonged to Joanne Burns, codefendant herein, who had a suspended driver's license but had been issued a state identification card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The officers then drove to the address indicated on the identification card left at the pharmacy, that being 751 Armstrong in Mansfield, Ohio. The premises at the address appeared to be abandoned. A subsequent inquiry revealed Joanne Burns was presently living at 739 Bowman Street in Mansfield, Ohio. The officers proceeded to that address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Upon arrival there, a boy about twelve years of age answered the door, stating no adults were present at the home. The officers returned to the residence an hour later, noticing a vehicle in the driveway. Upon knocking, two adults answered the door, who were identified as Joanne Burns and her husband, Lyle Burns. The officers obtained verbal consent to search the residence from the Burns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Present in the home were: Joanne Burns, Lyle Burns, Appellant, and two minor children. The female child approximately five or six years of age belonged to Burns and her husband, and a male child, approximately twelve years of age, who had previously answered the door, belonged to Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant indicated to the officers she had been staying at the residence for about two weeks due to marital problems with her husband. At the time the officers entered the home, Appellant was in an upstairs bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Officers conducted a search of the home, including the upstairs area where Joanne Burns and Appellant had bedrooms, and the basement. In the basement of the residence, officers found: two bottles of liquid, rubber tubing, coffee filters, Coleman fuel, ammonia nitrate, peeled lithium batteries, and cold packs. The officers also conducted a test which indicated the presence of ammonia, necessary in the manufacture of methamphetamine. The items were submitted to the Mansfield Police Crime Lab. The liquid found in the one-pot cooking vessel was tested for the presence of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The Richland County Grand Jury indicted Appellant as follows: Count One, manufacturing or engaging in the production of methamphetamine, in the vicinity of a school zone and/or juvenile, in violation of R.C. 2925.04(A) and (C)(3)(b), a felony of the first degree; Count Two: assembling or possessing one or more chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine, in the vicinity of a school and/or juvenile, in violation of R.C. 2925.041(A) and (C)(2), a felony of the second degree; and Counts Three and Four, endangering children, in violation of R.C. 2919.22(B)(6), both felonies of the third degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On August 4, 2015, the State filed a motion for joinder of defendants.

The jury found Appellant guilty of the charges as stated in the indictment. On September 14, 2015, the trial court sentenced Appellant to a mandatory ten years\n   imprisonment on Count One; the trial court merged Appellant's conviction on Count Two with her conviction on Count One. The trial court sentenced Appellant to two years mandatory time on Counts Three and Four, ordering the terms to run concurrently, for a total term of ten years. Appellant was also sentenced to a five year term of mandatory post-release control, and a sixty month driver's license suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Via Order of September 17, 2015, the trial court imposed costs of the jury in the amount of $1,400 jointly and severally between Appellant and her codefendant Joanne Burns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellant filed a direct appeal of her conviction and sentence in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Beyond the psychic danger of seeing drugs being sold, there is a very real physical danger surrounding a drug transaction, even for nonparticipants.

Because the \"vicinity of a juvenile\" offense is so much more dangerous, the General Assembly has determined that the offender's knowledge that a juvenile is nearby is irrelevant. Also,\n   <em>\n    since \"in the vicinity of a juvenile\" includes being in view of a juvenile, its parameters can expand well beyond 100 feet\n   </em>\n   . Thus, if an offense occurs within 1,000 feet of a school, the offender still can be subject to strict criminal liability if there is a juvenile within view.

No. 08CA3234,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-3114\">\n    2009-Ohio-3114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201830785\">\n    2009 WL 1830785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Fourth District addressed the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal from a juvenile specification conviction. Turner transported drugs from Columbus to Portsmouth, delivering them to the home of Cindy Mershon, and eventually distributing the drugs to local dealers in the Portsmouth area. Turner stayed at the Mershon residence and dealt crack cocaine and heroin on at least three separate occasions. When officers searched the residence, Turner was found in constructive possession of crack cocaine and heroin. The officers observed Mershon's nine year-old daughter leaving the residence immediately preceding the execution of the search. Testimony established Mershon's daughter and seventeen year-old son lived at the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The Fourth District held the observation of a nine year-old girl leaving the residence prior to the execution of the search warrant, which found drugs in the house, and the juveniles' residency in the home sufficient evidence to support Turner's conviction for the juvenile specification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In\n   <em>\n    State v. Cunningham\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. No. WD-08-063,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-6970\">\n    2009-Ohio-6970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%205174151\">\n    2009 WL 5174151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Sixth District held,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   The state's evidence in this case as to the presence of juveniles consisted of background noise on the audiotapes that sounded like children's voices. There also was evidence that the drug transactions occurred at a residence in a mobile home park. Because children's voices were heard and the transactions occurred in a residence, the jury could reasonably have inferred that they took place \"within the vicinity of a juvenile\" as defined in R.C. 2925.01(BB). Establishing the juvenile enhancement elevates the degree of the offenses of which appellant was found guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 33} It is undisputed the children herein resided in the home. The children were present at the time the officers arrived\n   at the residence, and told police the adults were not present. The children were present during the time the officers searched the residence. The investigating officers testified at trial the basement door was unlocked at the time of the search. The basement was accessible from the outside of the home and from an entryway near the kitchen. State's Exhibit 49 introduced at trial depicts the basement door located in the kitchen of the residence. The picture indicates the stairs leading to the basement, with the meth lab in view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Based upon the evidence presented, we find the juvenile specifications were supported by sufficient evidence and the jury reasonably found the specifications proven beyond a reasonable doubt despite the lack of definite evidence the juveniles were within 100 feet of the meth lab.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 36} In the third assignment of error, Appellant maintains she was deprived of the effective assistance of trial counsel due to counsel's failure to argue the insufficiency of evidence with regard to the juvenile specifications attendant to Counts One and Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Having sustained Appellant's first assignment of error, we find any discussion of this assigned error moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Having overruled Appellant's second assignment of error, we find any further discussion of the assignment of error moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 39} The Judgment of the Richland County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed as it relates to the juvenile specification on Counts One and Two, reversed as to Appellant's convictions on Counts Three and Four, and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the law and this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Wise, John, J. and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Wise, Earle, J., concur\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    This matter comes before this Court on reopening pursuant to App. Rule 26(B), following our Opinion and Judgment Entry entered in\n    <em>\n     State v.
