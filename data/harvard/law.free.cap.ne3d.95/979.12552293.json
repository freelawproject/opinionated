For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In August 2012, appellant enrolled in UT's graduate Bachelor of Science in nursing to doctor of nursing program (\"BSN-DNP program\"). At the time, the BSN-DNP program was new and appellant was one of three students in the inaugural class. The BSN-DNP program was not accredited at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant was concerned that the BSN-DNP program was not accredited by the Commission of Collegiate Nursing Education (\"CCNE\"). On the first day of classes, appellant asked the Dean of the College of Nursing, Timothy M. Gaspar, when the BSN-DNP program would be accredited. According to appellant, in front of other students, Dean Gaspar answered \"unequivocally\" that the BSN-DNP program would be accredited before the first student graduated from the program. (Patel Aff. at \u00b6 14.) \"At the same time, [Dean] Gaspar touted his expertise in accreditation process because he had previously served with CCNE in the accreditation process.\" (Patel Aff. at \u00b6 15.) Another student in the inaugural class, Susan Recker, stated she heard this question and response. In his deposition, Dean Gaspar stated that he would \"never\" tell appellant that the BSN-DNP program would be accredited before the first student graduated because he knows what those standards are and the statement \"would not be true.\" (Gaspar Depo. at 32-33.) Dean Gaspar testified that he had served as a member of the Accreditation Review Board since 1998 at the CCNE, the accrediting body for college nursing programs and was instrumental and part of the establishment of the standards and key elements of the Accreditation Review Committee. Appellant asserts that if it was not possible to graduate from an accredited program, she was prepared to leave UT that first day and enroll in a different accredited program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In January 2014, appellant contacted her graduate nursing advisor, David Lymanstall, to determine whether she could change her plan of study and graduate in August 2015. Appellant wanted to work in a residency program that began in September or October 2015. Lymanstall consulted with the nursing program director, Dr. Huey-Shys Chen, and they indicated appellant could change her course of study and graduate in August 2015 if\n   she took classes during the summer. Soon after, appellant learned that UT's BSN-DNP program would not be accredited by August 2015. Appellant sought to transfer to UT's master-in-nursing program, which was accredited, but Dr. Chen informed appellant that was not possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} A site visit from CCNE was scheduled for fall 2015, and Dean Gaspar expected the BSN-DNP program to be accredited in May 2016. If UT's application were approved, the accreditation would relate back to the date of the site visit, fall 2015. Thus, UT faculty advised appellant to graduate in December 2015 to have a possibility of graduating from an accredited program. If a student does not graduate from an accredited program, the student is ineligible to take the national certification examination resulting in licensure, and in Ohio, cannot work as an advanced practice nurse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant withdrew from UT in fall 2014, enrolled in Wayne State's DNP program in Detroit, Michigan, and graduated in December 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On March 20, 2015, appellant filed a complaint against UT alleging negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, breach of contract, unjust enrichment/promissory estoppel, and/or negligence. UT filed a motion for summary judgment, which the Court of Claims granted on April 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Therefore, we undertake an independent review to determine whether UT was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. First Assignment of Error-Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In appellant's first assignment of error, she asserts the Court of Claims erred by granting summary judgment on her claim for breach of contract because the court failed to consider the parties' course of dealing and industry custom and usage evidence. Appellant's argument in support of this assignment of error is premised on an alleged\n   <em>\n    written\n   </em>\n   contract between appellant and UT. In her brief, appellant states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The term \"accreditation\" does not appear in any\n   <em>\n    written\n   </em>\n   documents signed by Ms. Patel or UT. But Ohio law holds that \"[p]arol evidence is admissible to ... supply an omitted term\" of a contract where it is not integrated. * * * \"Both at common law and under the Uniform Commercial Code, the conduct of the parties during the course of performance of a contract involving repeated occasions of performance is relevant evidence as to the meaning of the agreement.\" * * * Further, \"[i]n the law of contracts, custom in the industry or usage in the trade is always relevant and admissible in construing ... contracts and does not depend on any obvious ambiguity in the words of the contract.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Emphasis added.) (Footnote omitted.) (Appellant's Brief at 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Likewise, UT argues that the contract between appellant and UT was\n   <em>\n    written\n   </em>\n   in the form of the university catalog, handbook, and other guidelines. UT further argues that the written contract was unambiguous and, therefore, the parol evidence is inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The Court of Claims also addressed the written contract between the parties and held that \"[t]o the extent that plaintiff argues certain 'promises' were made to induce her to remain in the program and that such promises manifested a modification of the original agreement, \" 'absent fraud, mistake, or other invalidating cause, the parties' final\n   <em>\n    written\n   </em>\n   integration of their agreement may not be varied, contradicted or supplemented by evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements, or prior written agreements.\" ' \" (Emphasis added.) (Decision at 3.) The Court of Claims determined the written contract was unambiguous and that appellant had contracted to graduate from a program that was not accredited because she admits she knew on the first day of classes that the BSN-DNP program was not accredited. Further, the Court of Claims determined that appellant failed to allege an ambiguity that would permit the admission of parol evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13} It is not clear why the Court of Claims and the parties have extensively discussed whether the\n   <em>\n    written\n   </em>\n   contract was breached, when the complaint alleged breach of an\n   <em>\n    oral\n   </em>\n   agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, it is not clear why the parties and the Court of Claims extensively discussed the parol-evidence rule as such rule applies \"when there is a single and final memorial of the understanding of the parties [and] [w]hen that takes place,\n   <em>\n    prior and contemporaneous\n   </em>\n   negotiations, oral or written, are excluded; or, as it is sometimes said, the written memorial supersedes these prior or contemporaneous negotiations.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Galmish v.

Appellant did not allege that Dean Gaspar's statement was made prior to or contemporaneous with the written contract between UT and appellant, therefore discussion of the parol-evidence rule is not relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant alleged breach of an oral contract made subsequent to the written contract, and in her memorandum contra she elaborated that Dean Gaspar's statements made subsequent to the original written contract\n   <em>\n    modified\n   </em>\n   the original written contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court of Claims however rejected this argument and found that if Dean Gaspar had told appellant the BSN-DNP program would be accredited before the first student graduated, such statement would not constitute a mutual agreement that altered the written contract. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In\n   <em>\n    Lewis v. Cleveland State Univ.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

As applied here, we note that appellant did not point us to any place in the original written contract which authorizes the alteration of the contract terms by mutual agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Furthermore, we reject appellant's argument that appellant and UT implicitly modified their written agreement by their subsequent course of conduct.

Despite this reference to an \"implied contract,\" appellant's argument relies on the theory of promissory estoppel. In her complaint, appellant did not allege a breach of an implied contract, but did allege \"[d]uring her tenure at UT, Ms. Patel paid tuition to UT based on promises made by Defendants and/or their agents and employees that were ultimately untrue and/or unfulfilled. To allow UT to retain amounts paid by Ms. Patel to UT under the circumstances would be unjust and/or inequitable.\" (Complaint at \u00b6 55-56.)

Although Dean Gaspar denies the statements, because appellant provided evidence that Dean Gaspar promised the BSN-DNP program would be accredited before the first student graduated from the program, construing the evidence in favor of appellant, there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to the same. Furthermore, there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether appellant's reliance was reasonable given that Dean Gaspar was in charge of the College of Nursing and appellant provided evidence that Dean Gaspar touted his expertise and experience in the accreditation process. Furthermore, Dean Gaspar testified that as the chief nursing officer he was ultimately responsible for making the formal accreditation request of CCNE, and there was no reason for appellant to believe his authority was limited in this regard. Finally, there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether appellant suffered injury as a result of that reliance, as appellant provided evidence that she relied on Dean Gaspar's statements to her detriment as she was prepared to withdraw from the BSN-DNP program but did not, relying on the promise of accreditation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 27} We sustain appellant's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

In our discussion of negligent misrepresentation, we already rejected and disposed of this latter conclusion and we find viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to appellant, that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to justifiable reliance. Therefore, we will now address the Court of Claims' conclusion that Dean Gaspar and UT had no pecuniary interest in this alleged interaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Appellant argues that Dean Gaspar and UT had a pecuniary interest in retaining the students in the BSN-DNP program. According to appellant, those students paid tuition and would continue to do so for three years during their participation in the BSN-DNP program. If the BSN-DNP nursing program were successful and accredited, the BSN-DNP program would attract more students and expand, thus bringing more money to UT and in course, for UT to pay Dean Gaspar. Moreover, the academic reputation of UT would improve. Dean Gaspar testified that it is \"always usually desirable to have an\n   accredited program.\" (Gaspar Depo. at 12.) A student cannot practice as an advanced practice nurse in the state of Ohio unless he/she graduates and is certified from a national certified body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Appellant did withdraw from UT's BSN-DNP program. From this fact, an inference can be made that in so doing, she stopped paying tuition to UT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 34} We find appellant did present a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether UT had a pecuniary interest since UT had an interest in the students remaining in the BSN-DNP program and for the program to expand. Appellant did not point us, however, to any evidence in the record that Dean Gaspar had a pecuniary intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Accordingly, we sustain appellant's third assignment of error as to UT and overrule the third assignment of error as to Dean Gaspar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Fourth Assignment of Error-Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 36} In her fourth assignment of error, appellant contends the Court of Claims erred in granting summary judgment on her fraud claim because questions of fact exist regarding whether UT personnel acted with fraudulent intent. Appellant argues the Court of Claims did not construe the evidence in a light most favorable to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 37} The Court of Claims reasoned that \"[g]enerally, promises or representations concerning future actions or conduct cannot serve as a basis for fraud because such statements are merely opinions or predictions, not fraudulent misrepresentations.\" (Decision at 7.) The court determined that appellant pled that Dean Gaspar's alleged statements were \"mere promises that the program would be accredited in the future.\" (Decision at 7.) The Court of Claims found that appellant had not offered any proof of fraudulent intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Appellant alleged that UT and their employees made the statement that the BSN-DNP program would be accredited by the time she graduated \"knowing that [the statements] were false.\" (Complaint at \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Appellant argues that a material issue of fact exists regarding fraudulent intent because \" '[m]aking a contractual promise with no present intention of performing it constitutes promissory fraud in Ohio.' \"\n   <em>\n    Deitrick v.

Appellant testified in her affidavit that Dean Gaspar \"touted his expertise in accreditation process because he had previously served with CCNE in the accreditation process.\" (Patel Aff. at \u00b6 15.) Susan Recker testified she heard appellant ask Dean Gaspar about accreditation and she heard his response:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   On the first day of class in August 2012, I heard Chandni Patel ask Dean Timothy Gaspar in front of the cohort when UT's BSN-DNP program would be accredited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Dean Gaspar responded that the program would be accredited \"before the first student graduated.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   At the time of the statement, Dean Gaspar also indicated his expertise with the accreditation process because he had served with CCNE during the process, including attending CCNE-required site visits, and was familiar with the requirements of the accreditation process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (Recker Aff. at \u00b6 3-5.) In his deposition, when asked if he told appellant that the BSN-DNP program would be accredited before the first student graduated, Dean Gaspar replied: \"No, I would never do that. I've been an [Accreditation Review Committee] member for six years. I have been instrumental and part of the establishment of the standards and key elements during those first six years as well as policies and procedures. I know very well what they are. That would not be true.\" (Gaspar Depo. at 32-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Accordingly, while construing the evidence in appellant's favor, we find this evidence creates an issue of material fact\n   regarding whether Dean Gaspar made a knowing material misrepresentation, without the present intention of performing such a promise.

As the trial court noted, there is no dispute that Dean Gaspar lacked the authority to guarantee the BSN-DNP program would be accredited by a certain date. Construing the facts most strongly in favor of Patel, as we must under summary judgment, even by Patel's own version of events, Dean Gaspar conveyed to the students in the initial conversation that it was an outside entity that made determinations regarding accreditation. Additionally, there is no dispute that Patel knew the program was not accredited when she chose to enroll in it. It was therefore not reasonable for Patel to rely on Dean Gaspar's statements regarding accreditation when she knew both that the program was not accredited and that the ultimate decision on accreditation would come from CCNE and not from a representative of UT.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Militiev v.

Patel asserts Dean Gaspar promised the BSN-DNP program would be accredited by December 2015, what would have been her graduation date had she not made any\n   changes to the pace of her coursework. However, by choosing to change her graduation date to August 2015, Patel was no longer acting in reliance on Dean Gaspar's words. For this additional reason, I would conclude the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to UT on Patel's claim of promissory estoppel. Accordingly, I would overrule Patel's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 57} In her third assignment of error, Patel argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to UT on Patel's claim of negligent misrepresentation.

There is no dispute that, at the time Patel engaged in that conversation with Dean Gaspar, her expected graduation date was December 2015. Further, there is no dispute that UT did obtain a site visit from CCNE in the fall of 2015 and was awaiting accreditation at the time Patel filed suit, which would be backdated to the site visit, meaning students graduating from UT's program in December 2015 would be deemed to have graduated from an accredited program. Thus, there is no genuine issue of material fact related to whether Dean Gaspar had any intention to perform the promise as Civ.R. 56 evidence demonstrates UT actively sought accreditation in time for the December 2015 graduating class. For this additional reason, I would overrule Patel's third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 59} In her fourth assignment of error, Patel argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to UT on her fraud claim.

From the Civ.R. 56 evidence provided, it simply was not reasonable for Patel to rely on Dean Gaspar's statements that an outside, independent third party, here CCNE, would act in any certain way within any particular time frame. For these reasons, a reasonable juror could only conclude there remain no genuine issues of material fact regarding Patel's fraud claim, and that claim must fail as a matter of law. Thus, I would overrule Patel's fourth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Based on these reasons, I respectfully dissent on the issues of promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
