However, certain basic principles must guide us. An accused's right to be presumed innocent is protected by the right to prompt justice. Incarceration should generally follow conviction, not precede it. The failure of our criminal justice system to promptly resolve cases erodes faith in its fundamental fairness. This Court has long recognized that \"[s]ociety, as well as the defendant, has an important interest in assuring prompt prosecution of those suspected of criminal activity\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Armstead pointed a gun at the alleged offender and pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire. Armstead then handed the gun to defendant, who fired a shot that hit a 15-year-old bystander, killing him. Defendant was 16 years old at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant was arrested on May 28, 2008 and remanded without bail. Defendant and Armstead were charged in an indictment with murder in the second degree, two counts of attempted murder in the second degree, and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. On August 26, 2008, defendant filed an omnibus motion in Supreme Court seeking, inter\n   alia, severance of his case from Armstead's, in part on\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   grounds (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bruton v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    391 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1968] ). On October 23, 2008, the court held that part of the motion seeking severance on\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   grounds in abeyance, pending resolution of Armstead's motion to suppress his statements to police. The court, however, did not hold a\n   <em>\n    Huntley\n   </em>\n   hearing in Armstead's case or decide that suppression motion for nearly four years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For approximately 2\u00bd years, from January 2009 to June 2011, the People sought to obtain Armstead's cooperation in testifying against defendant. The People requested numerous adjournments for that purpose, generally with Armstead's consent. Inasmuch as severance had not yet been granted, these adjournments necessarily also resulted in adjournments of defendant's case. The People pursued Armstead's cooperation for this length of time even though the People acknowledged during later litigation of defendant's speedy trial motion that Armstead \"repeatedly indicated through his lawyer that he [would] never testify against the defendant,\" although they further asserted, without elaboration, that \"Armstead himself has wavered on this point.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The People's efforts to obtain Armstead's cooperation were unsuccessful. In June 2011, the People presented Armstead with the terms of a cooperation agreement, which Armstead rejected. Armstead's request for reassignment of counsel was granted. In July 2011, the People announced their intention to try Armstead first, separately from defendant. The People hoped that if Armstead was convicted on a top count, he might decide to testify against defendant in exchange for a more lenient sentence. The People further asserted that Armstead's testimony \"would significantly enhance the overall nature and quality of the evidence against the defendant.\" Due to adjournments requested by Armstead's counsel, Armstead's\n   <em>\n    Huntley\n   </em>\n   hearing did not begin until May 2012. In August 2012, the court denied Armstead's motion to suppress his statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the meantime, in October 2011, defendant was involved in a jailhouse altercation. He was convicted of assault in the second degree, and in June 2013, he was sentenced to 4\u00bd years' imprisonment. That judgment was affirmed on appeal (\n   <em>\n    People v. Wiggins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4367037\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/132/514/\">\n    132 A.D.3d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4367037\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/132/514/\">\n    17 N.Y.S.3d 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept. 2015],\n   <em>\n    lv\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    denied\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20N.Y.3d%201076\">\n    27 NY3d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20N.E.3d%201212\">\n    60 N.E.3d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2016] ). Defendant was also charged in 2009 with conspiracy and gang assault. Those charges were pending until March 2013, when they were ultimately dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Armstead's first trial began in October 2012, resulting in a partial verdict convicting him of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. Before deliberations could continue on the remaining counts, Hurricane Sandy interrupted the trial. When the trial resumed on November 7, 2012, only 11 jurors returned, and the court declared a mistrial. Armstead's counsel announced that he would be unable to retry the case until the following April.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In April 2013, Armstead's second trial began. That trial also ended in a mistrial due to jury deadlock. Armstead's counsel stated that he would be unable to retry the case until October.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In May 2013, before Armstead's third trial began, defendant filed his first motion to dismiss the indictment on constitutional speedy trial grounds. The court denied that motion in December 2013. The court acknowledged that the delay was lengthy, but reasoned that \"a good part of the extraordinary delay was caused by\" Armstead, and that defendant had been incarcerated due to his unrelated pending cases\n   during much of that time. The court further concluded that the defense did not appear to be impaired by the delay.\n   Armstead's third trial began in January 2014. Armstead was acquitted of second-degree murder, but the jury deadlocked on the attempted murder counts, and a third mistrial was declared. Armstead's fourth trial was scheduled for August 2014. In June 2014, defendant filed a second motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By September 23, 2014, Armstead's fourth trial had not yet begun, and the People had not responded to defendant's second speedy trial motion. Defendant pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the first degree in exchange for a determinate sentence of 12 years' imprisonment, to be followed by five years' postrelease supervision. During the plea proceeding, defendant withdrew his pending speedy trial motion. On October 7, 2014, defendant was sentenced in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement. On February 26, 2015, Armstead pleaded guilty to attempted murder in the second degree in exchange for a sentence of 15 years' imprisonment, to be followed by five years' postrelease supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In short, the People pursued a cooperation agreement with Armstead for approximately 2\u00bd years. After that effort proved unsuccessful, they spent the next three years attempting to convict Armstead, trying him separately from defendant. After three mistrials, Armstead had been convicted of only criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, he had been acquitted on the top count of second-degree murder, and the People were no closer to securing his testimony against defendant. The time between defendant's arrest on May 28, 2008 and defendant's plea on September 23, 2014 spanned six years, three months, and 25 days, from when defendant was 16 years old until he was 22. Defendant spent the entirety of that period incarcerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, the Appellate Division held, in a 3-2 decision, that defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated (\n   <em>\n    People v. Wiggins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12168903\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/143/451/\">\n    143 A.D.3d 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12168903\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/143/451/\">\n    39 N.Y.S.3d 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept. 2016] ).

By contrast, \"[t]he protection of speedy trial rights, which would include the consideration of delays caused not only by the prosecution but also by factors such as court congestion, were addressed by CPL 30.20 and by constitutional provisions\" (\n   <em>\n    Worley,\n   </em>\n   66 N.Y.2d at 527,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=498%20N.Y.S.2d%20116\">\n    498 N.Y.S.2d 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=488%20N.E.2d%201228\">\n    488 N.E.2d 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Thus, although many of the adjournments, both before and after the People decided to try Armstead first, were at Armstead's request or on his consent, each criminal defendant has an individual constitutional right to a speedy trial that cannot be rendered meaningless by the dilatory tactics of his or her codefendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In any event, even if CPL 30.30 were applicable, that statute excludes from the time chargeable to the People only a \"reasonable period of delay\" attributable to a codefendant, and then only when good cause has not been shown for granting a severance and the codefendant's CPL 30.30 time has not run ( CPL 30.30[4][d] ). Here, it is questionable whether the delay attributable to Armstead would be considered \"reasonable\" even if CPL 30.30 applied. In addition, defendant did show good cause for a severance on\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   grounds in 2008.

However, it remains incumbent upon us, in determining whether dismissal of the indictment is required, to balance all of the\n   <em>\n    Taranovich\n   </em>\n   factors in this particular case. In doing so, on this factual record, I would conclude that defendant, who stood accused of the intentional murder of a 15 year old-a grave offense exempt from the\n   five-year statute of limitations for felonies-was not deprived of his right to a speedy trial, or the due process right to prompt prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendant was arrested and arraigned on a felony complaint on May 29, 2008, five days after the murder was committed,\n   and was remanded without bail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In June 2008, he and codefendant Jamal Armstead were charged jointly in a single indictment with murder in the second degree, two counts of attempted murder in the second degree (involving another victim) and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.

The motion was denied in October 2008, except for the portion of the motion seeking a severance under\n   <em>\n    Bruton v.

The severance issue was held in abeyance pending the resolution of a\n   <em>\n    Huntley\n   </em>\n   hearing in Armstead's case, as the codefendant's statement implicated defendant as the shooter. Armstead's suppression hearing was held in May and June 2012, whereupon Supreme Court denied Armstead's motion to suppress and defendant's trial was severed in August 2012 ( CPL 200.40 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In May 2013, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment under CPL 210.20(1), arguing that the five-year delay in his prosecution violated his state right to due process and his federal constitutional right to a speedy trial, as well as his state statutory right to a speedy trial under CPL 30.20. The factual allegations in the motion concerning the reasons for the first four years of adjournments-from the commencement of the action in 2008 to 2012, when the pretrial hearings for the codefendant were held-can fairly be characterized as sparse, except for the litany of adjournments. One thing the motion does make clear is that defendant was brought to court with diligence on essentially a monthly basis from the time of his June 2008 indictment until May 2012 and that, on each occasion, \"the matter was adjourned.\" Defendant made no claim that he objected to any of the adjournments during this four-year period or that he raised any speedy trial protest during these proceedings. Indeed, there is nothing in the motion papers to indicate anything other than his silent acquiescence to the continuation of the case in this manner. To be precise, although he averred that he was incarcerated for the five-year period, he simply asserted that \"[t]he reasons for the delay are not clear from the court file.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendant's motion papers specifically aver that after the cases were severed in August 2012, the People elected to try Armstead first. The motion sets forth that defendant's matter\n   was adjourned for two months beginning in May 2012 while pretrial hearings were conducted in Armstead's case. It also alleges that defendant's case was adjourned for the period attributable to both Armstead's first trial in October 2012, which ended in a mistrial after the jury rendered a partial verdict convicting the codefendant of criminal possession of a weapon but failed to convene for the continuation of the trial due to Hurricane Sandy, and Armstead's second trial in April 2013, which was ongoing when defendant filed his dismissal motion. Defendant maintained that the \"8-week period for the co-defendant's two trials does not justify the 5 year delay in bringing defendant ... to trial.\" Thus, the focus of defendant's motion is plainly on the delay in his prosecution caused by\n   the People's attempt to resolve the case against codefendant Armstead before defendant was tried. Aside from defendant's protest as to the entire five-year period of delay, the requisite factual allegations set forth in support of his motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds narrowly addressed those proceedings that began in May 2012-four years after defendant's arrest and one year prior to the filing of the speedy trial motion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CPL 210.45 [1] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, defendant posited that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \"[b]ased upon the length of the post-arrest delay in this case, the People must establish good cause to justify such delay. In the event the People are unable to establish good cause for the 5 year delay in bringing the instant defendant to trial, defendant moves, pursuant to CPL 210.20(1)(h) to dismiss the indictment.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendant's motion was devoid of any allegation that he had suffered prejudice-actual or presumed-as a result of the delay. Rather, he observed that, where the delay is \"lengthy and unjustifiable,\" dismissal of the indictment may be required even in the absence of actual prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In response, the People conceded that the five-year delay was \"atypically long,\" but asserted that dismissal of the murder indictment was not warranted. The People noted that Armstead had consented to several adjournments beginning in January 2009 while a series of three ADAs attempted to secure his cooperation against defendant. Armstead rejected the cooperation agreement in June 2011 and then moved for reassignment of counsel. After new counsel was assigned in July 2011, \"every single adjournment of Armstead's case [was] at\n   the request of Armstead's counsel\"-including several adjournments after the People answered ready to try Armstead in May 2012. These latter adjournments were granted over the People's objection that the delays would impact defendant. The People further observed that, since defendant's speedy trial motion was filed, Armstead's second trial had ended in a mistrial and another six-month adjournment was granted at Armstead's counsel's request. They maintained that they decided to try Armstead first in an attempt to obtain his testimony against defendant-observing that \"[h]is testimony would significantly enhance the overall nature and quality of the evidence against the defendant.\" The People conceded that Armstead had repeatedly maintained through his counsel that he would not testify against defendant, but asserted that \"Armstead himself has wavered on this point.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The People also pointed out that defendant had been indicted for two separate assaults that occurred during the course of his pretrial incarceration. In January 2009, at the early stages of the case, he was indicted in Bronx County for gang assault and other related charges. Those charges were later dismissed in March 2013. In addition, defendant was indicted in October 2011 in New York County for attempted gang assault in the first degree, attempted assault in the first degree and two counts of assault in the second degree, based on a \"jailhouse assault\" that took place at the Manhattan Detention Center. He was convicted of assault in the second degree after an April 2013 jury trial and was sentenced to 4\u00bd years' imprisonment, to be followed by three years' postrelease supervision (PRS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Supreme Court denied defendant's motion, without a hearing, after engaging in the appropriate balancing test, holding that his right to a speedy trial had not been violated. Notably, although the court recognized that a significant portion of the delay was due to codefendant Armstead\n   (and his counsel)-particularly beginning in July 2011-the court also observed that the People have \"broad discretion\" when determining the order in which to prosecute codefendants. The court pointed out that the People \"consistently push[ed Armstead's] attorney to get ready for trial.\" Moreover, the court held that there were several additional reasons for the various delays, including the substitution of counsel for both the People and defendants and proceedings relating to defendant's other pending indictments. The court ultimately concluded that there was good cause for the delay.\n   In June 2014, defendant made a second motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds. However, defendant pleaded guilty on September 23, 2014 to the reduced charge of manslaughter in the first degree in full satisfaction of the indictment, in exchange for a sentence of 12 years' imprisonment, to be followed by five years' PRS. The manslaughter sentence was ordered to be served concurrent with the previously imposed 4\u00bd-year sentence for the 2011 assault, and to run nunc pro tunc from the date of defendant's May 2008 arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Appellate Division affirmed, with two Justices dissenting, agreeing that defendant's right to a speedy trial had not been violated (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12168903\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/143/451/\">\n    143 A.D.3d 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12168903\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/143/451/\">\n    39 N.Y.S.3d 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept. 2016] ). The Court likewise held that there was good cause for the delay. The Court opined that, although the attempt to get Armstead to testify \"certainly played an important role,\" it was not the only source of delay. It held that \"much of the delay was occasioned by requests for adjournments by defendant and/or his codefendant for motion practice, change of counsel, discovery proceedings, unavailability of co-defendant's counsel and the like\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12168903\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/143/451/\">\n    143 A.D.3d at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12168903\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/143/451/\">\n    39 N.Y.S.3d 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Court also concluded that the People's attempt to secure Armstead's cooperation was made in good faith. After balancing all of the relevant factors, the Court determined that there was no speedy trial violation. The dissent, however, would have dismissed the indictment, finding that the People failed to show good cause for the delay and hypothesizing that on the basis of the length of the delay it was \"likely\" that the defense was prejudiced. The majority noted that the dissent \"minimize[d] the defense side of the equation in determining the reason for the delay\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12168903\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/143/451/\">\n    143 A.D.3d at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12168850\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/143/433/\">\n    39 N.Y.S.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The United States Constitution guarantees a defendant a \"right to a speedy and public trial\" ( U.S. Const. 6th Amend). Recognizing that it is difficult to identify exactly when that right has been abridged, the United States Supreme Court has imposed a balancing test requiring an evaluation of the particular circumstances of each case (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barker v.

The five-year delay between defendant's arrest and his speedy trial motion, during which defendant was held in pretrial detention, was an undisputed fact and is presumptively prejudicial so as to trigger the speedy trial balancing test (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    407 U.S. at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Prompt prosecutions are fundamentally sound and serve the needs of both defendants and society. Five years of postindictment delay, even in a murder case, is antithetical to our long established goals in the speedy trial universe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As to the second factor, the reason for the five-year delay, the facts are in dispute. Both courts below held that the People established good cause for the delay attributed to the codefendant. Rather significantly, both courts also found that there were a variety of factors that contributed to the overall delay, including defendant's actions. The primary question as to one\n   part of the delay is whether the People's decision to defer defendant's prosecution while pursuing a cooperation agreement with Armstead amounts to good cause. A similar situation was presented in\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court held that a delay of four years so that the codefendant in a double murder could be used as a witness against the defendant was \"too long ... particularly since a good part of that period was attributable to the Commonwealth's failure or inability to try [the codefendant] under circumstances that comported with due process\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    407 U.S. at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Similarly, the prosecution believed it had a stronger case against the codefendant and that they could \"assure his testimony\" against Barker if they convicted the codefendant first (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    407 U.S. at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). There, the codefendant was tried six times-including two hung juries and two convictions that were then litigated and overturned on appeal. However, after balancing all of the other relevant factors, the Court concluded that Barker was not deprived of his right to a speedy trial. The Court noted the lack of prejudice-Barker was only incarcerated for 10 months of the pretrial delay and there was no indication that witnesses had gone missing or suffered memory loss (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    407 U.S. at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). \"More important,\" was the Court's conclusion that \"Barker did not want a speedy trial\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    407 U.S. at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Court observed that he had not asserted his speedy trial right for nearly four years and that the record suggested that Barker was \"gambling on [the codefendant's] acquittal\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    407 U.S. at 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Indeed, Barker's counsel had essentially conceded as much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Here, the majority does not even attempt to analyze this case under the federal constitutional speedy trial right. Indeed, as in\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   , defendant's failure to assert his speedy trial right for five years on a record that, despite regular court appearances, does not indicate that he ever objected to four of the five years of delay would be a significant factor weighing against him (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

One could reasonably conclude from this record that defendant, who faced a minimum sentence of 15 years\n   to life imprisonment on the murder charge, and potential consecutive prison sentences on the two assault indictments, had reason to bide his time and acquiesce in the delay in order to await the outcome of Armstead's first trial and assess the strength of the People's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In any event, the People have \"broad discretion in determining when and in what manner to prosecute a suspected offender\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    People v.

This discretion is not without boundaries and a defendant's trial cannot be postponed indefinitely while the People pursue a jointly indicted codefendant's conviction or cooperation. To that end, the lengthy adjournments granted by the court to Armstead's counsel at the latter stage of this case, over the People's objection on defendant's behalf, are at odds with defendant's right to a speedy trial at that late juncture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the record supports the reasonableness of the People's determination that Armstead's testimony would strengthen the evidence against defendant-the shooter. Significantly, there is no record to support that the People were not diligent, were negligent or acted in bad faith in their efforts to prosecute Armstead and obtain his cooperation against defendant (\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doggett v.

As this period of delay was not a result of prosecutorial inaction, negligence or bad faith, the nature of any presumed prejudice is weighed less as a consequence (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doggett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p656\">\n    505 U.S. at 652-653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p656\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Nor is this period of delay viewed in isolation. As the courts below also pointed out, there are several additional reasons that contributed to the other periods of delay-including factors that were beyond the People's control or were directly attributable to defendant (substitution of counsel, trial adjournments, etc.). Like\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   , this is a close case, but it appears that there is record support for the Appellate Division's conclusion that the People established good cause for the delay in this case and the issue is beyond our further review (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vernace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"203345,202927\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/96/886/\">\n    96 N.Y.2d at 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"202927\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/96/886/202927/\">\n    730 N.Y.S.2d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"202927\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/96/886/202927/\">\n    756 N.E.2d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Under no circumstances do we discount the extensive length of the pretrial delay here.

Here, despite that trial proceedings had been ongoing against Armstead, defendant made no allegation whatsoever that witnesses at the trials were having difficulty remembering the crime or that any witnesses were unavailable. Moreover, the witness testimony in Armstead's trials could have been a source of ample\n   <em>\n    Rosario\n   </em>\n   material to defendant's benefit.

However, as the majority observes, this prejudice is fully accounted for, under\n   <em>\n    Taranovich\n   </em>\n   , in the pretrial incarceration factor. In any event, under\n   <em>\n    Doggett\n   </em>\n   , presumptive prejudice must be evaluated on a sliding scale, in that not all delay is treated equally (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p656\">\n    505 U.S. at 656-658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p656\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). A delay resulting from bad faith weighs against the prosecution, while the weight \"assign[ed] to official negligence compounds over time as the presumption of evidentiary prejudice grows\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p656\">\n    505 U.S. at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p656\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). On the other hand, where the prosecution has been pursued with \"reasonable diligence,\" the defendant must demonstrate specific prejudice (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p656\">\n    505 U.S. at 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p656\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). As noted above, the delay in bringing defendant to trial did not involve bad faith or \"protracted [ ]\" negligence likely to threaten \"the fairness of the accused's trial\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p656\">\n    505 U.S. at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p656\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In the conspicuous absence of any allegation in the motion papers of a specific prejudice to defendant, this factor weighs in the People's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Clearly, five years is an extensive amount of time, even for a murder case, when the defendant remains incarcerated for the duration. The People, even while acting in good faith, must be wary of delays of this length when attempting to secure a codefendant's cooperation in a joint prosecution. However, the record supports the finding of the courts below that the People were making diligent efforts to move forward with the prosecution. In this context, it is duly noted that\n   the court brooked an unacceptable amount of delay in defendant's case as a result of codefendant's adjournments. Nevertheless, on this record, as defined by the pretrial motion papers, defendant apparently acquiesced in the bulk of the delay-between 2008 and 2012 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CPL 210.45 ). Based on a careful balancing of all of the factors, the courts below did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the murder indictment based on an alleged violation of defendant's due process right or right to a speedy trial. As this was the senseless murder of a 15-year-old victim, the most serious of offenses, the fact that defendant failed to allege any prejudice militates against the dismissal of the indictment under all the particular circumstances. Thus, I would affirm the Appellate Division order and uphold the denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Order reversed and indictment dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Judges Rivera, Stein and Wilson concur; Chief Judge DiFiore dissents in an opinion, in which Judges Garcia and Feinman concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    There is no preaccusatory delay in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Before the plea of guilty was entered, defense counsel acknowledged on the record that there was a second speedy trial motion filed in June that had not been decided and that he was withdrawing the motion. To the extent defendant now argues that the length of the delay at issue was beyond the five-year period designated in the first motion, that argument is not before this Court. Defendant expressly withdrew his second speedy trial motion prior to accepting the guilty plea. There is no indication whatsoever in this record that defendant's guilty plea was conditioned by the court or the People on the withdrawal of the second speedy trial motion and the motion, which was undecided, was therefore abandoned upon the entry of the plea (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     People v.

Thus, the length of delay that is properly before us is limited to the five-year period asserted in defendant's first speedy trial motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Although CPL 30.30 is not controlling to a CPL 30.20 speedy trial claim, it is relevant that the legislature has determined that this type of delay attributable to a joined codefendant would be excludable for speedy trial computation (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    CPL 30.30[4][b] ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Despite the majority's conclusion that there is no disputed issue of fact, the question of good cause necessarily entails a factual inquiry into the reasons for all of the delay and the merits of those reasons. Indeed, defendant himself argues only that there is no record support for the Appellate Division's conclusion-not that reasonable minds could not draw different inferences from the established facts (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     People v.
