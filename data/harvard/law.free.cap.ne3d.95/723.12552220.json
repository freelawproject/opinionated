Moneir appeals from his divorce in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division. Appellee (former wife) is Doaa Aldo Passyalia. The relevant facts leading to this appeal are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The parties were married in Egypt in April 1986. Two children were born as issue of the marriage, both of whom are now emancipated adults. In 2006, appellant obtained employment in county government in Virginia, and the parties separated. Appellee remained with the parties' children in North Canton, Ohio. During the ten-year separation, appellant paid the mortgage, taxes, insurance, and utilities for the North Canton residence occupied by appellee and the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On July 15, 2015, Appellee Doaa filed a complaint for divorce. Appellant Tarek filed an answer and a counterclaim for divorce on September 12, 2015. The case proceeded to a trial to the court on August 9, 2016 and September 2, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 12, 2016, the trial court issued a final decree of divorce, including orders regarding property division and spousal support, as further detailed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On October 6, 2016, appellant filed a notice of appeal. He herein raises the following two Assignments of Error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} \"I. THE TRIAL COURT'S DIVISION OF PROPERTY WAS INEQUITABLE, AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE, AND AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} \"II. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN AWARDING SPOUSAL SUPPORT BEFORE FIRST MAKING AN EQUITABLE DIVISION OF PROPERTY.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In his First Assignment of Error, appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in characterizing or awarding certain marital assets and debts, resulting in an inequitable division of property. We agree in part and disagree in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Standards of Review\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} As an appellate court, we generally review the overall appropriateness of the trial court's property division in divorce proceedings under an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    Cherry v.

The court found that said vehicle, titled to appellant, had a fair market value of $17,306.00, with a lien balance of $7,628.00. Decree at 4. However, in its property distribution chart, instead of listing the net value at the mathematically expected figure of $9,678.00, the trial court set forth a value of $11,442.00. Appellant challenges this result as a math error in the amount of $1,764.00, although appellee responds that the $11,442.00 net value on the chart came about because of a fair market value of $19,070.00 culled from one of appellee's trial exhibits (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $19,070.00 minus the $7,628.00 lien). Appellee also urges in response that appellant's proper remedy is to seek a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Upon review, we find the discrepancy between the Toyota's valuation in the findings of fact and the figure used on the property distribution chart constitutes reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Canton Student Loan Foundation Loan\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellant next challenges the trial court's valuation of a loan balance owed on behalf of the parties' adult daughter, A.M. It appears undisputed that said loan from the Canton Student Loan Foundation was incurred by both appellant and appellee in 2005. The trial court, on its distribution chart, set forth a balance of $1,290.00 for the loan as a marital debt, which was then \"awarded\" to appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} A review of the record, however, indicates that exhibits from the trial showed the Canton Student balance to be $9,530.17. Furthermore, on cross-examination, appellee estimated that the balance was \"in the nine thousands.\" Tr. II at 10. We also note that trial testimony from both parties indicated A.M. herself had taken over making the payments on the loan, and documentation produced at trial showed that the loan statements were being addressed to and mailed directly to her. Thus, it is unclear to this Court how the trial court arrived at the $1,290.00 figure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Although an appellate court generally reviews a decision on property division in its entirety, rather than examining individual awards in a piece-meal fashion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Espenschied v.

This obligation was incurred after the child's emancipation and while incurred with the knowledge of the wife, she is not a co-signor of the loan. As such, this obligation is deemed to be not a marital obligation but an obligation solely incurred by the husband. * * *.\" Decree at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} R.C. 3105.171(B) states in pertinent part that \"[i]n divorce proceedings, the court shall * * * determine what constitutes marital property and what constitutes separate property. * * *.\" The characterization of property as marital or separate must be supported by sufficient, credible evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chase-Carey v.

I don't really know what, which is which, what is\n   what.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20975756\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In sum, according to appellee, the latter loan \"was between [A.M.] and her father.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.

Upon review, we find the trial court's reliance on the evidence that appellee was not a co-signer on the U.S. Department of Education loan as a means of overcoming the marital debt presumption was not against the manifest weight of the evidence nor did it constitute an abuse of discretion, particularly where the parties had maintained a lengthy separation prior to the divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Appellant's First Assignment of Error is sustained in part and overruled in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In his Second Assignment of Error, appellant contends the trial court erred in making its award of spousal support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 26} R.C. 3105.171(C)(3) mandates in pertinent part that \"[t]he court shall provide for an equitable division of marital property under this section prior to making any award of spousal support to either spouse under section 3105.18 of the Revised Code * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jendrusik v.
