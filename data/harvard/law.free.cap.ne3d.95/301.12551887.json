After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of conspiracy, attempt to commit larceny, and identity fraud. On direct appellate review, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the defendant's conspiracy and attempt to commit larceny convictions, but vacated his identity fraud conviction for insufficient evidence.

The context of the judge's mention of One Fund donors as victims reflects that his concern was primarily with the egregious nature of the defendant's crimes, as the judge went as far as to describe the defendant's actions as \"almost sociopathic.\" Further, this statement was made at least in part in response to the defendant apologizing before the court \"to his mom, his girlfriend and his daughter\" while failing to show remorse toward the actual victims of the crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Provided that the decision is based on appropriate considerations, '[a] trial judge is permitted \"great latitude\" in sentencing.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725604\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/71/568/#p572\">\n    71 Mass.

The context of his mention of One Fund donors as among the victims of the defendant's crimes reflected the judge's thoughts on the egregiousness of the crimes and the defendant's character, which indeed are proper sentencing considerations. The defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    McFadden\n   </em>\n   was misguided, as that judge clearly erred in considering what he believed to be perjury committed by the defendant. See\n   <em>\n    McFadden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94977\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/49/441/\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94977\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/49/441/\">\n    at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, we discern no abuse of discretion in the judge's denial of the defendant's motion for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Since we decline to remand for resentencing, we need not address the defendant's argument that a different judge should preside over any remanded proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Order denying motion for resentencing affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    The sentences for the two convictions that were affirmed had been ordered to run concurrently with the vacated conviction. Grice was found not guilty of identity fraud and received the same disposition. As such, in deciding not to remand for resentencing, the Supreme Judicial Court concluded \"that the judge did not enhance any other portion of [the defendant's] sentence based on the identity fraud conviction.\"\n    <em>\n     Mattier\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173195\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/261/#p277\">\n     474 Mass. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    277 n.24.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    Contributing to a charity does not create a financial interest in that charity.
