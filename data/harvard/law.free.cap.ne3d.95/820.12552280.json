Because we are unable to review appellant's assigned errors, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant and appellee were married on December 28, 2007; they have two minor children. Appellee filed a complaint for divorce on August 23, 2013. Appellant filed an answer and a counterclaim for divorce on September 16, 2013. The trial court issued temporary orders regarding spousal support, child support, and parenting time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The parties filed a joint motion for arbitration on August 14, 2015. The motion stated that, upon \"permission being granted by the Court, the parties agree to proceed with arbitration, pursuant to the terms of the arbitration agreement which is attached.\" (Aug. 14, 2015 Joint Mot. at 1.) The arbitration agreement stated that the parties had selected Gerald J. Babbit to serve as arbitrator. The court sustained the joint motion for arbitration on August 19, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jgmt. Entry Decree of Divorce, Ex. D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The parties subsequently discovered that Babbit was unable to serve as the arbitrator due to a conflict of interest. As such, the court granted the parties' motion to vacate the court's August 19, 2015 entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On January 21, 2016, the parties filed another joint motion for arbitration, and attached their new arbitration agreement to the joint motion. The new arbitration agreement was identical to the agreement the parties filed with the August 14, 2015 motion, except that the new agreement identified Craig Treneff as the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In the arbitration agreement, the parties stated that they \"believe[d] that their domestic dispute should be submitted to arbitration; and in furtherance thereof they have entered into this agreement for binding arbitration to fully, resolve the\n   arbitrable issues to be submitted to the Arbitrator for resolution.\" (Arbitration Agreement at 1.) The parties identified the arbitrable issues as spousal support, division of property, application of R.C. 3105.73, all child-related financial issues, and any other issues agreed upon by both counsel at the commencement of the arbitration. Paragraph six of the arbitration agreement, titled \"AWARD,\" provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Arbitrator shall issue his decision in writing. His decision shall include Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The decision shall be delivered to each counsel simultaneously. The decision shall be rendered within 14 days following the conclusion of the hearing.\n   <strong>\n    Except as otherwise set forth in R.C. Sec. 2711.10, .11, and .13, upon completion of the arbitration hearing, the Arbitrators' determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on both parties.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The transcript of testimony, evidence produced, and the Arbitrator's Decision shall be considered the record of this divorce as it relates to any future proceedings including but not limited to modification of child support and spousal support, and full rights of appeal by either party from the Decree of Divorce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Emphasis sic.) (Arbitration Agreement at \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On January 21, 2016 the court issued an entry sustaining the joint motion for arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On February 11, 2016, the arbitrator's January 8, 2016 decision and award was filed in the trial court. The award stated that the arbitration hearing was held on December 7 and 14, 2015, and that the hearing was \"conducted pursuant to Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2711.01\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   \" (Arbitration Decision &amp; Award at 1.) The award contained findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding every issue presented to the arbitrator for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On February 25, 2016, the trial court issued the judgment entry decree of divorce, which adopted the arbitrator's decision and award and made the award the final order of the court. The court noted in the decree that the parties had entered into an agreement allocating parental rights and responsibilities, and that the guardian ad litem had approved their agreement. The court adopted the parties' agreement and made it an order of the court relating to all matters concerning the minor children. On March 4, 2016, appellant filed a notice of appeal from the judgment entry decree of divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant appeals, assigning the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [I.] The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion And Erred As A Matter Of Law In Failing To Find A De Facto Termination Of The Marriage Prior To The Date Of The Final Hearing And By Failing To Value Assets And Liabilities As Of The Proposed De Factor Date Of August 29, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [II.] The Arbitrator Abused his Discretion By Valuing And Dividing As An Asset Property That Is Neither Owned By the Appellee Or Appellant Thereby Rendering An Inequitable Property Division Per R.C. \u00a7 3105.171.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [III.] The Arbitrator Erred As A Matter Of Law And Abused His Discretion By Failing To Divide A Marital Deferred Tax Liability, And, As A Result, The Property Division Is Incomplete.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [IV.] The Arbitrator Erred As A Matter Of Law And Abused His Discretion In Its Child Support Calculation By Imputing $25,200 In Child Care Expenses\n   When None Exist, By Only Imputing Income of $25,000 To The Appellee And By Failing To Appropriately Analyze The Factors Of This Case Pursuant R.C. 3119.04(B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [V.] The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion And Erred As A Matter Of Law By Allocating Marital Debts/Loans Made By The Parties' Family Members As The Sole Debt Of The Appellant. Subsequently The Property Division Is Unequal And Inequitable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [VI.] The Arbitrator Erred As A Matter Of Law And Abused His Discretion By Dividing The Appellant's FA Capital Accumulation Awards Equally Between The Parties When The Parties And Their Experts Agreed Only 85.7% Of These Awards Were Marital.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant's assignments of error all pertain to findings made by the arbitrator, which were adopted by the trial court and incorporated into the judgment entry decree of divorce. Because appellant failed to properly challenge the arbitrator's award in the trial court, we are unable to reach the merits of appellant's assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"Arbitration occurs when disputing parties contractually agree to resolve their conflict by submitting it to a neutral third party for resolution.

Chapter 2711. The arbitration agreement states that it is \"derived from ORC Chapter 2711,\" that the parties' rights would be \"as prescribed in Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2711,\" and that \"\n   <strong>\n    [e]xcept as otherwise set forth in R.C. Sec. 2711.10, .11,\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    and .13, upon completion of the arbitration hearing, the Arbitrators' determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on both parties\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis sic.) (Arbitration Agreement at \u00b6 1, 6 &amp; 7(a).) The parties further stated that the proceedings before the arbitrator would \"be considered the record of this divorce as it relates to any future proceedings including * * * full rights of appeal by either party from the Decree of Divorce.\" (Arbitration Agreement at \u00b6 6.) As the parties agreed to proceed to final, binding, and conclusive arbitration pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2711, the parties' acknowledgment of their full rights of appeal from the decree of divorce was an acknowledgment of the appeal rights contained in R.C. 2711.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Accordingly, we are unable to find that the court's statement in the January 21, 2016 entry, acknowledging that each party reserved their right to appeal the decree of divorce, evidenced a meeting of the minds to modify the arbitration agreement. R.C. 2711.15 provided each party with a statutory right to appeal from the court's judgment entered on the arbitration award. Accordingly, the court's acknowledgment in paragraph two of the entry that each party had reserved their right to appeal was an acknowledgement of the parties' right to appeal the judgment pursuant to R.C. 2711.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Furthermore, the court ordered in paragraph one of the entry that the case would be \"submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement.\" (Jan. 21, 2016 Entry.) Thus, rather than stating that the parties had modified their arbitration agreement, or that the case would be submitted to non-binding arbitration and proceed outside of R.C. Chapter 2711, the court reiterated that the case would be submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to the parties' arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 28} \" 'Ohio law recognizes that when parties agree to submit their disputes to binding arbitration, they have bargained for the arbitrator's determination concerning the issues submitted and agreed to accept the result regardless of its legal or factual accuracy.' \"\n   <em>\n    Robert W.
