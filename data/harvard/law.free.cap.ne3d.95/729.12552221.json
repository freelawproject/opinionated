She believed she had divorced Fox in 1989 in Franklin County, Ohio. After her 1996 marriage to Husband, Wife sought child support for her two children with Fox and filed for child support in Stark County. The child support action was dismissed because Wife was found to still be \"common law married\" to Fox. In 1998, Wife commenced a divorce action against Fox and the divorce was granted, terminating the common-law marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On March 4, 2016, Husband filed a complaint for divorce against Wife, and Wife answered with a motion to dismiss alleging the two were never validly married because she was still effectively married to Fox at the time of the 1996 \"marriage.\" Husband sought a division of marital property and alimony, but Wife filed a motion for declaratory judgment to establish no marital property existed because the parties were never \"married.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court overruled the motion to dismiss and allowed the matter to proceed under the same terms and conditions as a \"divorce case filed in a valid marriage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court found Wife was still married to Fox when she married Husband:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   R.C. 3105.01(A) provides that the Court of Common Pleas may grant a divorce if either party had a husband or wife living at the time of the marriage from which the divorce is sought.

It would be inconsistent for us to determine the trial court has the authority to grant the parties a divorce, but no authority to divide the marital estate. We disagree with Wife's characterization of the marriage to Husband as a \"legal fiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Wife has not presented us with any authority in support of her novel argument that a domestic relations court has no authority to divide the marital estate under these circumstances, and we find this argument to be contrary to both the literal language and the spirit of the relevant statutes and case law. Wife's fourth assignment of error is therefore overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Wife's four assignments of error are overruled and the judgment of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Gwin, J. and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Wise, Earle, J., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
