Albea, Jr., was convicted of first-degree murder ( 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(2) (West 2010)) and sentenced to 33 years in prison. Defendant argues on appeal that his conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered because the trial court committed plain error when it denied defendant's request to represent himself at trial. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 On October 12, 2011, defendant was indicted on 14 counts of first-degree murder ( 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1), (a)(2) (West 2010)) and 2 counts of aggravated battery of a child ( 720 ILCS 5/12-4.3(a) (West 2010)). The charges stemmed from a September 6, 2011, incident in which defendant allegedly struck a minor, X.C., about his body, causing great bodily harm and death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 On January 4, 2012, retained counsel Robert P. Ritacca appeared on defendant's behalf. Ritacca represented defendant until July 15, 2014, when he moved to withdraw, citing defendant's dissatisfaction with his services. Defendant confirmed that he no longer wished to be represented by Ritacca and that he could not afford another attorney. The trial court allowed Ritacca to withdraw and appointed the public defender to represent defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 On July 16, 2014, assistant public defender Gillian Gosch appeared on behalf of defendant. The trial court continued the matter so that Gosch could review discovery. After several continuances, the matter was set for a jury trial on February 27, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 On February 5, 2015, Gosch informed the trial court that defendant had told her that he wanted to represent himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant confirmed that he wished to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . Thereafter, the following colloquy occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"THE COURT: [Defendant], I don't hesitate to tell you that is a bad idea. There are a number of things that occur during the course of regular legal proceedings on a day-to-day basis, not to mention what occurs during the course of a trial that requires somebody with very particularized expert legal knowledge. Ms. Gosch is that kind of a person. I know that sometimes when you have discussions with your lawyers-and I know you have now had a couple-you might not always agree with what they have to say, and you don't have to always agree with what they have to say, but you do have to listen to them when you make judgments about what's best for you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   So you do have a right to represent yourself, but it's something that is generally frowned upon because there is an old saying that a lawyer who represents himself or has himself for a client is a fool for both. Do you know what that means?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: It means it's not a good idea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   How far did you go in school?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: I got a GED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE COURT: You got a GED? And when did you get that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. And have you had any jobs?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: And so tell me what it is or why it is you think that you should represent yourself in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Well, I talked-I talked to her yesterday and I tried to get her to get a continuance as far as the trial is set.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: Well, that's not up to her. You know that, right? So if she told you that I wasn't going to grant a continuance, she's probably basing that on her knowledge of working in my courtroom because she's worked in my courtroom for a long time now. So she knows that when a case gets to be as old as yours is and when it's set for trial she knows that just asking for a continuance without a really good reason generally isn't going to-going to fly. Okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: So if she told you she couldn't get you a continuance, that was probably her accurate opinion about what's going on in this case. Do you know what I mean?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE COURT: All right. What else?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant went on to complain that counsel had not shown him all of the discovery. The court told defendant that, although counsel could go through the discovery with him, she could not give it to him. Defendant stated, \"That's not what I'm saying.\" Defendant reiterated his complaint that counsel had not reviewed the discovery with him. Thereafter, the following colloquy occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"THE COURT: Well, I know you have been in front of me a lot, [defendant], so you know what you are charged with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Exactly, exactly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: And you know what they're saying happened, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. So a lot of what's contained in the documents is information that might only be useful to the attorney. I mean, if you-if you want me to continue the case for a short period of time, like later this week or early the following week, I can certainly accommodate that to give Ms. Gosch the opportunity to go through some more of the information with you, if that's what you like.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   But if that's the only objection you have, I can tell you that my experience with Ms. Gosch is she happens to be an outstanding trial attorney, and she has representing [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] people in the [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] some of the most serious cases that I have ever had in front of me, and she is a very skilled and able trial lawyer. So if that's your only problem, I think you should probably try to work with her about this a little bit. Don't you think that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: I feel like I won't receive a fair trial due to the fact that we haven't really had time to go over nothing together except she came up here yesterday and that's all. That's all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT: Well, why don't we try this. Why don't I give you some more time, like we will have you back in here February 17th or 18th. That will give you and Ms. Gosch another week and a half, two weeks to go over some of the information just to answer any questions that you have about what the evidence is and about what your options are.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   But, you know, it sounds to me like you may have been frustrated because she was conveying to you what the State's offer was in the case. Would that maybe be accurate?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Not really.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE COURT: Well, that's the situation. So if she tells you something, that that's what that is. She's allowed to tell you and she should tell you what her opinion is about that. Okay? You don't have to agree with her; she will tell you that. You still have an absolute right to have a trial in front of me or in front of a jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Right now, as a matter of fact, you're set for a jury trial, and we're going to start picking that jury actually not too long from now. I've got it in my calendar for evidence starting on March 2nd and jury selection on February 27th. So we've got, you know, your case right on track to get going. Okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   THE COURT: So what I'll do is I'll give you time to talk to, you know, Ms. Gosch a little bit more, make sure that you understand exactly what it is that's going on in your case. And then if there is something else that you want to bring to my attention, then you can. Okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: All right.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 7 At the next court date, on February 18, 2015, Gosch advised the trial court that she met with defendant the day before and reviewed additional documents with him but that defendant still wished to represent himself. Defendant confirmed that he wished to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . The trial court advised defendant that he had the right to do so. The court then went on to state that the case involved \"a number of relatively complex areas\" and that much of the evidence \"require[d] some expertise in dealing with it appropriately.\" The court inquired as to defendant's education and age. Defendant told the court that he was 21 years old and that he had a GED. The\n   court asked defendant whether he had \"any type of specialized education in the legal profession\" or \"any specialized education in terms of medical knowledge.\" When defendant responded no, the court stated, \"And yet you stand in front of me and you tell me today that you think that you would be qualified to represent yourself in a case that would require some type of expertise in the law and in medicine?\" After defendant responded in the affirmative, the court asked defendant why he wanted to represent himself. Defendant stated that \"[he] didn't feel like [he] would receive a fair trial with Miss Gillian Gosch.\" Defendant stated that Gosch told him that he \"had a 99.9 percent chance of losing the trial.\" He further complained that she just recently came to see him, that she should have come to see him sooner, and that she should have gone over more material with him. The court explained to defendant that Gosch was educated in the law and experienced in the particular type of case involved. The court explained that her opinion of the case did not excuse her from her obligation to represent defendant zealously. The court stated, \"If I thought for a minute that there was a lawyer that I appointed to represent you that wasn't going to do her job, I would excuse that lawyer in a heart beat because I would never allow you to go to trial if I thought the lawyer wasn't doing the job.\" The court also explained that counsel had a lot of preparation to do, which she could not do if she were spending time with defendant in jail. The court stated, \"[Y]ou're not her partner in law. Okay? You're her client.\" The matter concluded with the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \"THE COURT: * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   So is there anything else that she has not done, except for sharing with you an opinion that you don't like?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE COURT: So do you think that it would be a good idea to try to represent yourself just because you don't like what she's telling you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   THE COURT: So we're going to go forward with Miss Gosch, and, if there's something that comes up, you'll bring it to my attention right away; right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 8 At the outset of the next court date, on February 26, 2015, Gosch informed the trial court that defendant wished to speak. Defendant then stated, \"I was seeing if I can go pro se today.\" The court responded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"Okay, [defendant]. We started to have this conversation a couple days ago. I thought you had seen the better of that decision. It is a very difficult thing to represent yourself. Even lawyers should never undertake representing themselves. You are far too close to the proceedings to make informed good decisions. As I told you I am going to be in court obviously during the entirely of the proceedings. If any problems come up and you feel there's something you need to bring to my attention even outside the presence of [the] jury I am going to let you do that, but in terms of the technical aspects of representing yourself at trial, knowing the proper objections to make, knowing the motions to make, you put yourself at an extreme disadvantage especially given your educational background, your life history that you indicated to me earlier, a very difficult in [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] actually an impossible thing to do, [defendant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   You wouldn't know how to preserve your own record. You wouldn't know the\n   proper things to say or what to do. Don't you think you might wind up in a much worse situation than you're in if you made mistakes on the record if I were to let you represent yourself; isn't that right?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendant agreed but then stated, \"I'd rather take my chances representing myself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 9 Thereafter, the court again inquired as to defendant's age and education. The court told defendant that he had \"no ability to file any type of motions.\" The court asked defendant whether he had gone through the file, whether he knew what it meant to conduct discovery, whether he knew how to make objections, whether he knew how to conduct jury selection, and whether he would be able to preserve the record. After defendant responded no, the court emphasized that Gosch was \"an extremely experienced litigator and a very able trial attorney.\" The court stated, \"You got to make sure you have the best representation going to trial examining and cross-examining doctors, medical reports, going through police officers [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ].\" The court continued, \"Don't you think it's in your best interest at least to let her begin representing you, and if there is an issue bring it to my attention? That's what you need to do, [defendant]. If you want to have a fighting chance you need to have a lawyer. You are nodding your head yes. You think that's your best idea?\" Defendant responded, \"I still rather take my chances going pro se.\" The court asked whether defendant was prepared for trial tomorrow. When defendant responded that he was not, the court stated, \"Well, how do you think I am going to let you go pro se?\" The remainder of the conversation addressed defendant's complaints that counsel had not gone over \"video segments\" with him or contacted any of the witnesses provided by defendant's family. Arrangements were made for counsel to review the video with defendant the next morning with jury selection to follow. At the conclusion of the proceedings, the State advised the court that defendant had rejected its offer of 25 years for first-degree murder. Gosch told the court that she had advised defendant to accept the offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 10 The next day, February 27, 2015, defendant waived his right to a jury trial. The matter proceeded to a bench trial on March 2, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 11 The evidence at trial established that, during the late evening of September 14, 2011, defendant was playing video games with three-year-old X.C., the son of defendant's girlfriend, Qa'Chelle, in the living room of Qa'Chelle's apartment while Qa'Chelle slept upstairs. Sometime after midnight, defendant told Qa'Chelle that X.C. did not seem well. Qa'Chelle discovered X.C. slumped over and not talking, and she took him to Vista Medical Center West. X.C. was airlifted to Children's Memorial Hospital where he died from massive internal bleeding. Medical testimony established that X.C. suffered from severe internal injuries in his abdominal area and that none of the injuries could have occurred more than a few hours before his arrival at the hospital. The injuries had been caused by at least three blows from a round object, possibly a fist. An autopsy revealed that X.C. suffered from additional injuries to his chest cavity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 12 The State's evidence further established that defendant made a series of statements to police. Defendant told police at the scene that X.C. had fallen and hit his head. Defendant later told detectives that he had punched X.C. in the abdomen one time because X.C. swore at the video\n   game. Finally, after being told that it was impossible for X.C.'s injuries to have resulted from one blow, defendant told detectives that he had hit X.C. four or five times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 13 The judge found defendant guilty of first-degree murder and found that the offense was exceptionally brutal and heinous. Defendant's motion for a new trial was denied. Following a sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced defendant to 33 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 14 Defendant timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 15 II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 16 Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his request to represent himself at trial. Defendant acknowledges that he did not raise this issue in his motion for a new trial and thus has forfeited it. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Enoch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5550081\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/122/176/#p186\">\n    122 Ill. 2d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20Ill.%20Dec.%20265\">\n    119 Ill.Dec. 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20N.E.2d%201124\">\n    522 N.E.2d 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). However, he argues that the issue is reviewable under the plain-error rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 17 Under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 615(a) (eff. Jan. 1, 1967), \"[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the trial court.\" The plain-error rule allows review of a forfeited claim of error if the error is clear or obvious and either (1) \"the evidence is so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error\" or (2) \"the error is so serious that it affected the fairness of the defendant's trial and challenged the integrity of the judicial process, regardless of the closeness of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.

However, rather than admonishing defendant under Rule 401(a) and determining whether defendant's request was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, the trial court focused exclusively on defendant's ability to represent himself. This was error. At the hearing on February 5, 2015, the court told defendant that the request was \"a bad idea\" and that a trial required \"somebody with very particularized expert legal knowledge.\" The court asked defendant about his education and employment experience. The court also inquired as to why defendant wanted to represent himself. When defendant told\n   the court that counsel had not reviewed discovery with him, the court told defendant that it would give him time to talk to counsel and address his concerns about his case. At the next court date, defendant persisted in his request to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . In response, the court again inquired into defendant's educational background. The court asked defendant whether he had \"any type of specialized education in the legal profession\" or \"any specialized education in terms of medical knowledge\" and whether he felt that he was qualified to represent himself. Although defendant agreed, at the end of the hearing, when the court stated that \"we're going to go forward with Miss Gosch,\" at the outset of the next court date, defendant reiterated his request to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . The court once again emphasized that proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   would place defendant \"at an extreme disadvantage,\" and it focused on defendant's lack of legal knowledge. Although defendant agreed with the court, he stated, \"I'd rather take my chances representing myself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 25 The State attempts to justify the trial court's refusal to allow defendant to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   by arguing that the court was \"protecting defendant's right to a fair trial,\" given defendant's age, education, and lack of employment history.
