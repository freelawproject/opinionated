If it were not so construed, a conflict would exist between the provisions of Article V, Section 2, and the provisions of Article II, Section 8, paragraphs 13 and 14, and Article III, Section 1. For excerpts from these by-laws, see the opinion of the Chancellor dated August 26, 1957, 134 <em>A.2d </em>518. The so-called \u201cexcept\u201d clause of Article II, Section 5, does not, in our opinion, relate to the quorum requirement, but to cases in which the affirmative vote of a greater number of directors than a majority is required for corporate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">It is impossible to file before October 15 an opinion discussing all the arguments presented. Since we are in accord with the conclusion of the Chancellor as set forth in paragraph 2 of his judgment dated August 29, 1957, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
