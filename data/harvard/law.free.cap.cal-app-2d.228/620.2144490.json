On May 9, 1961, the board served notice on him that he was relieved of all duties and suspended without pay. At the same time an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>acting director of finance was appointed. Later this appointment was made permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Oxley\u2019s formal demand for reinstatement, back wages, and fringe benefits was rejected. He then petitioned the Superior Court of Orange County for a writ of mandate. In denying the writ the court found that Oxley served at the pleasure of the board of supervisors and that he had been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The question raised on appeal is whether the board of supervisors had the power to discharge Oxley.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The hoard of supervisors has the power to regulate the terms of all deputies, assistants, and employees in the county (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 5). It may employ such persons as are necessary to assist it in the performance of its duties. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 25208.) In the absence of provision to the contrary the general rule is that the employee serves at the pleasure of the appointing authority. (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 16; <em>Patton </em>v. <em>Board of Health of San Francisco, 127 </em>Cal. 388, 392 [59 P. 702, 78 Am.St.Rep. 66]; <em>Nightingale </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>70 Cal. App. 424, 430 [233 P. 807]; <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Police Commissioners, </em>1 Cal.App. 5, 7 [81 P. 674].)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Oxley argues the manner of his discharge was governed by and did not comply with the requirements of County Personnel Ordinance No. 1276. The sections dealing with suspension and discharge do not apply to a person such as Oxley, appointed by the board of supervisors as the principal employee of a delegated function of the board. Oxley\u2019s suspension and discharge therefore are governed by the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Coughlin, Acting P. J., and McCabe, J. pro tem.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-11\"> Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
