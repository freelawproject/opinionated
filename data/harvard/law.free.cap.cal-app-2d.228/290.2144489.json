Basically it claimed therein that it had duly prepaid its franchise tax for said taxable year, that it had been dissolved on December 11, 1956, that said dissolution was not pursuant to a reorganization, consolidation or merger as defined in section 23251, and that it was therefore entitled to a refund of 3/12ths of the amount of the prepayment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The cause was tried in the court below on a written stipulation of facts, in addition to which there was testimony of one witness called by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">We first set forth the stipulated facts: Plaintiff Heating Equipment Manufacturing Co. (hereafter referred to as Heating Equipment) was incorporated in the State of California in 1938 and engaged in the manufacture of various types of forced-air furnaces. Prior to October of 1956, the outstanding stock of Heating Equipment was owned 47 per cent by Frederick L. Anderson, 48 per cent by John M. Baeza, 3 per cent by members of Anderson\u2019s family, and 2 per cent by members of Baeza\u2019s family. Anderson was the president and general manager of Heating Equipment prior to its dissolution and liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">San Carlos Manufacturing Co. (hereafter referred to as San Carlos) was incorporated in California in 1951 and engaged in the manufacture of various types of wall heaters. Prior to October of 1956 all of the outstanding stock of San Carlos was owned 50 per cent by Frederick L. Anderson and 50 per cent by John M. Baeza. Baeza was president and general manager of San Carlos prior to its dissolution and liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Pacific Industries, Inc. (hereafter referred to as Pacific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Industries) is a California corporation whose name was changed from Central Eureka Corporation on September 21, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">In the spring of 1956 Pacific Industries commenced negotiations with Anderson and Baeza regarding the possibility of acquiring Heating Equipment and San Carlos. At or about the same time as these negotiations were being conducted, Pacific Industries was negotiating for the acquisition of other businesses through the issuance of its stock. Anderson and Baeza were informed of these other potential acquisitions during their negotiations with Pacific Industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">On June 8, 1956, Pacific Industries entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization with the stockholders of Heating Equipment and San Carlos whereby Pacific Industries would issue shares of its common stock in exchange for all the outstanding stock of Heating Equipment and San Carlos.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Pursuant to paragraph 8 of the agreement and plan of reorganization, Anderson and Baeza, through their attorneys, requested a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to the income tax consequences of the contemplated exchange of stock, it being the position of Heating Equipment, San Carlos and the stockholders thereof, that the exchange constituted a tax-free plan of reorganization under sections 354(a) (1) and 368(a)(1)(B) of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The Internal Revenue Service ruled that the acquisition by Pacific Industries of all the stock of Heating Equipment and of all the stock of San Carlos solely for voting stock of Pacific Industries constituted a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code and that no gain or loss would be recognized to the stoek<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>holders of Heating Equipment or San Carlos under section 354(a) (1) of the same code.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Thereafter, on October 9, 1956, Pacific Industries, pursuant to the agreement and plan of reorganization above referred to, issued 2,000,000 shares of its stock in exchange for all the outstanding stock of Heating Equipment and San Carlos, 1,000,000 of said shares being in exchange for all the outstanding stock of Heating Equipment and 1,000,000 shares being in exchange for all the outstanding stock of San Carlos.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">On or about October 17, 1956, the directors of Pacific Industries elected to dissolve and liquidate Heating Equipment and San Carlos.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">On October 24, 1956, the board of directors of Heating Equipment and the board of directors of San Carlos, pursuant to the consent of Pacific Industries, the sole shareholder of both companies, resolved to wind up and dissolve the corporations and to this end, adopted plans of liquidation whereby all the assets of Heating Equipment and San Carlos would be distributed to Pacific Industries and the stock of Heating Equipment and San Carlos would be cancelled. On October 26, 1956, both San Carlos and Heating Equipment filed a notice of intent to wind up and dissolve with the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">I On October 31, 1956, all of the assets of Heating Equipment and San Carlos were transferred to Pacific Industries in liquidation and the stock of Heating Equipment and San Carlos was cancelled. Formal final certificates of winding up and dissolution were filed with the Secretary of State on December 11,1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Prior to the exchange of stock heretofore described, the stockholders of Heating Equipment and San Carlos held no interest in Pacific Industries, and Pacific Industries or its stockholders held no interest in Heating Equipment or San Carlos.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The 1,000,000 shares of Pacific Industries stock received by Anderson and his family constituted 14 per cent of the then outstanding stock of Pacific Industries. Similarly, the 1,000,-000 shares of Pacific Industries stock received by Baeza and his family constituted 14 per cent of the then outstanding stock of Pacific Industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Subsequent to October of 1956, Pacific Industries acquired a number of other businesses resulting by the end of March 1957 in the reduction of the interests of the Anderson and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Baeza families in Pacific Industries to 9.05 per cent of its outstanding stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">After the liquidations of October 31, 1956, Heating Equipment and San Carlos were operated as divisions of Pacific Industries. Anderson and Baeza were made vice presidents of Pacific Industries. Anderson being named general manager of Heating Equipment Division and Baeza being named general manager of San Carlos Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Neither Anderson nor Baeza were candidates for the board of directors of Pacific Industries at the annual meeting in March 1957, but were elected to the board at a meeting held in June of 1957. The board of directors then consisted of 11 members. None of the members of the board of directors were nominees of Anderson or Baeza.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Heating Equipment timely filed its California Bank and Corporation Franchise Tax Return for its taxable fiscal year beginning March 1, 1956, and paid the tax due thereon in the sum of $11,121.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">On January 16, 1957, plaintiff, Heating Equipment, filed a claim for refund of tax in the amount of $2,780.28 (being three-twelfths of $11,121.10), alleging said sum to be refundable pursuant to section 23332.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant denied the claim for refund by sending notice thereof to the plaintiff dated June 12, 1957. On September 6, 1957, plaintiff filed an appeal with the State Board of Equalization, and the appeal was heard on April 8, 1958. On November 14, 1960, the State Board of Equalization affirmed defendant\u2019s denial of the claim for refund and gave notice thereof to plaintiff.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>In addition to the foregoing stipulated facts, plaintiff called Donald Smith, president, general manager and director of Pacific Industries during the period of time here material. Mr. Smith was the sole witness at the trial. He testified, over defendant\u2019s objection, that he personally negotiated the arrangements between Pacific Industries and Heating Equipment in order to diversify; that Pacific Industries wanted the assets of Heating Equipment in order to strengthen its earning capacity; that it was not interested at all in acquiring the stock of Heating Equipment; that it intended to liquidate the latter corporation and \u201cmerged the assets into the assets of Pacific Industries \u2019 \u2019; and that it never intended to operate Heating Equipment as a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Smith further testified that after Pacific Industries acquired the physical assets of Heating Equipment certain changes were made in operations of both Heating Equipment\u2019s plant and San Carlos\u2019 plant, accounting and fiscal procedures were consolidated with those of Pacific Industries and certain activities formerly carried on by Heating Equipment were transferred out of the Heating Equipment Division of Pacific Industries. Although Frederick Anderson was named general manager of the Heating Equipment Division, Pacific Industries\u2019 board of directors was responsible for policy making with respect to the operations of such division. Approximately four months after acquiring Heating Equipment assets, Pacific Industries transferred Anderson to its head office where he was put in charge of liquidating into Pacific Industries\u2019 business other assets not connected with those of Heating Equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The trial court concluded that \u201c [t]he acquisition of plaintiff Heating Equipment Manufacturing Company by Pacific Industries was a \u2018reorganization, consolidation, or merger, \u2019 within the meaning of Revenue and Taxation Code section 23332.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The present controversy revolves about sections 23251 and 23332. As we have pointed out (see footnote 5, <em>ante) </em>the latter section at all times here relevant prohibited any abatement or refund of franchise tax \u201cbecause of the cessation of business or corporate existence of any taxpayer pursuant to a reorganization, consolidation, or merger.\u201d While the trial court decided that plaintiff was not entitled to a refund because the transaction involved was a reorganization, consolidation or merger, the record before us fails to disclose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>basis of the court\u2019s conclusion. It is noteworthy that the conclusions of law do not indicate in which category or categories of reorganization specified in section 23251 the transaction falls and indeed make no mention of section 23251 at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Section 23251 as in effect in 1956 at the time the present controversy arose, provided: \u201cThe term \u2018reorganization\u2019 as used in this chapter means (a) a transfer by a bank or corporation of all or a substantial portion of its business or property to another bank or corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor or its stockholders or both are in control of the bank or corporation to which the assets are transferred ; or (b) a mere change in identity, form or place of organization however effected; or (c) a merger or consolidation; or (d) a distribution in liquidation by a bank or corporation of all or a substantial portion of its business or property to a bank or corporation stockholder, and the bank or corporation stockholder continues all or a substantial portion of the business of the liquidated bank or corporation. As used in this section the term \u2018control\u2019 means the ownership of at least 80 percent of the voting stock and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the bank or corporation. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">It is plaintiff\u2019s position before us that the transactions here in controversy, involving an exchange of stock followed by liquidation of the acquired corporation, do not constitute a reorganization within the meaning of section 23251 but are in substance the acquisition of assets in exchange for stock. It is defendant\u2019s position, on the other hand, that such transactions even when considered as a whole constitute a reorganization as defined by both subdivisions (c) and (d) of section 23251. In sum, we face a single crucial issue: whether the transactions involved constitute a reorganization within the meaning of the above statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We first consider whether the transactions referred to are a merger or consolidation within the meaning of subdivision (c) of section 23251.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Section 23251 defining \u201creorganization\u201d is based upon former section 13(j) of the Bank and Corporation Franchise Tax Act. The language of section 13 (j) was largely borrowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>from section 112 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 791) which defined \u201creorganization\u201d for the purpose of recognition of gain or loss under the federal income tax law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The definition of \u201creorganization\u201d incorporated in section 13 of the California act at the time of its revision in 1933 (Stats. 1933, pp. 696, 697) was apparently borrowed word for word from subdivisions (B), (C) and (D) of the federal statute. (See footnote 8, <em>ante.) </em>By amendments in 1937 (Stats. 1937, pp. 2331, 2333-2334) this definition was included in subdivision (j) of section 13 of the California act at which time there was added to the definition the following: \u201cor (4) a merger or consolidation.\u201d It is to be noted that this addition was in reality subdivision (A) of the federal statute without the language appearing therein in parentheses. By amendment in 1939 (Stats. 1939, pp. 2946, 2948-2949) the term \u201ca recapitalization\u201d was removed from the definition of reorganization in section 13(j), the subdivisions renumbered, and the following added: \u201cor (4) a distribution in liquidation by a bank or corporation of all or a substantial portion of its business or property to a bank or corporation stockholder.\u201d The resulting statute eventually became section 23251 as in effect in 1956 and set forth by us above.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In <em>San Joaquin Ginning Co. </em>v. <em>McColgan </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 254 [125 P.2d 36], the court faced the task of construing section 13(j) of the Bank and Corporation Franchise Tax Act, as amended in 1937. The plaintiff there had become the wholly owned subsidiary of another California corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>which had purchased all its stock for cash. Thereafter upon the vote of the parent corporation, San Joaquin elected to dissolve and turned over to the parent company all of its remaining property and assets in return for the stock of the subsidiary which was thereupon cancelled. Such property was then used by the parent corporation in the conduct of the same business operations formerly conducted by the subsidiary. Plaintiff San Joaquin then claimed a refund of that portion of the franchise tax paid by it for the months following dissolution upon the theory that the liquidating transaction was nothing more than a dissolution and distribution of assets. Defendant Franchise Tax Commissioner contended that it amounted to a reorganization as defined by subsection (3) (\u201ca mere change in identity, form or place of organization however effected\u201d\u2014now \u00a7 23251, subd. (b)) or subsection (4) (\u201ca merger or consolidation\u201d\u2014now \u00a7 23251, subd. (e)) of section 13 (j) of the former act.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The court there held that \u201c [t]he rule to be applied in the interpretation of the terms reorganization, merger and consolidation in relation to exemptions, abatements and refunds in the taxing provisions is the rule of liberal construction.\u201d (P. 259.) Applying this rule of construction the court sustained the commissioner\u2019s contention that the transaction amounted to a reorganization and reversed the judgment allowing a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In respect to the first subsection (\u00a7 13(j) (3)) the court observed that the plaintiff San Joaquin in order to sustain its claim for the refund, was required to show that the change consequent upon a statutory dissolution and liquidation \u201cwas in reality a change of substance as well as of form.\u201d (P. 259.) If only of <em>form, </em>there would be a reorganization within the meaning of the statute thus precluding a refund, since the statute provided that a reorganization included a mere change in identity, form or place of organization \u201chowever effected. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In respect to the second subsection there involved (\u00a7 13(j) (4) ) the court stated: \u201cAlso, in conformity with the legislative purpose, consolidation or merger as a form of reorganization is not restricted to statutory consolidation or merger in the absence of appropriate language of limitation.\u201d (P. 260.) Recognizing that the statute then before it had been adopted in part from section 112 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (see footnote 8, <em>ante), </em>the court reviewed a number of fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>eral eases which determined whether certain transactions constituted a \u201creorganization\u201d as defined by the federal statute for the purpose of recognition of gain or loss. From such review the court reached these conclusions: that such cases lent further support to a rule of liberal construction in determining what is a reorganization, consolidation or merger; \u201cthat a disposition or distribution of assets in liquidation or dissolution proceedings may be a reorganization, consolidation or merger\u201d (p. 260); and that the failure of the California Legislature to adopt the parenthetical phrase of clause <em>(A) </em>of section 112 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (see footnote 8, ante) when in 1937 it added \u201cmerger or consolidation\u201d to the definition of reorganization (\u00a7 13(j) (4) of the former act, now \u00a7 23251, subd. (c)) did not \u201cimpel a conclusion that it was the legislative intention to exclude elements of a de facto merger or consolidation from the meaning of reorganization.\u201d (Pp. 262-263.) The court was of the view that the appropriate rule of interpretation \u201crequires a holding that the language as adopted was sufficiently broad to include as a reorganization any transaction which did not substantially change the continuity of interest.\u201d (P. 263.) In ordering a reversal, it noted that \u201cthe continuity of interest after dissolution and so-called liquidation is beyond question. The same interests were represented in fact, if not in form, by the same stockholders before and after the transfer.\u201d (P. 263.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">While the instant ease, unlike <em>San Joaquin, </em>does not involve subdivision (b) of section 23251, it does involve, as that case did, the question whether the transactions in controversy are \u201ca merger or consolidation\u201d within subdivision (c) of the statute. Since it is not argued here that there was a consolidation, our inquiry actually narrows to whether there was a merger.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\"><em>San Joaquin </em>established that a merger as a form of reorganization under the statute here involved is not restricted to a statutory merger in the absence of appropriate lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>guage of limitation but includes a de facto merger as well.  Generally speaking a merger is the absorption of one corporation by another which survives, retains its name and corporate identity together with the added capital, franchises and powers of the merged corporation and continues the combined business. (15 Fletcher, Cyclopedia Corporations (1961) \u00a7 7041, p. 9; 1 Ballantine &amp; Sterling, California Corporation Laws (4th ed. 1963) p. 565.) \u201cA merger ordinarily is an absorption by one corporation of the property and franchises of another whose stock it has acquired. The merged corporation ceases to exist, and the merging corporation alone survives. \u2019 <em>\u2019 (Cortland Specialty Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>(2d Cir. 1932) 60 F.2d 937 939, cert. denied 288 U.S. 599 [53 S.Ct. 316, 77 L.Ed. 975]; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>(6th Cir. 1939) 108 F.2d 707, 709.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">As the Supreme Court observed in <em>San Joaquin, </em>federal cases determining what constituted a reorganization for purposes of nonrecognition of gain or loss under the then applicable federal revenue act from which the California franchise tax statute defining reorganization was adopted,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> have generally held that a disposition or distribution of assets in liquidation or dissolution proceedings may be a reorganization, consolidation or merger. Thus it was held under the federal act that while the mere purchase for money of the assets of one corporation by another did not amount to a reorganization <em>(Pinellas Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>(1933) 287 U.S. 462, 470 [53 S.Ct. 257, 77 L.Ed. 428, 433]), a merger or consolidation occurred where the seller acquired an interest in the affairs of the purchasing company which was definite and substantial and represented a material part of the value of the thing transferred. <em>(John A. Nelson Co. </em>v. <em>Helvering </em>(1935) 296 U.S. 374, 377 [56 S.Ct. 273, 80 L.Ed. 281, 283] ; <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Minnesota Tea Co. </em>(1935) 296 U.S. 378, 385-386 [56 S.Ct. 269, 80 L.Ed. 284, 288-289]; <em>Pinellas Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra.) </em>Inherent in the concept of reorganization articulated by the federal act was \u201csome continuity of interest on the part of the transferor corporation or its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>stockholders \u2019 \u2019 in the properties transferred. <em>(Cortland Specialty Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra, </em>60 F.2d 937, 940.) The fact that the relationship of the taxpayer to the assets conveyed was substantially changed; that the transferor did not participate in the management of the purchaser; that the transferor did not acquire a controlling interest in the transferee company; or that the transferor while having a substantial interest therein, was denied voting rights did not prevent the transaction from being a merger or consolidation. <em>(John A. Nelson Co. </em>v. <em>Helvering, supra; Helvering </em>v. <em>Minnesota Tea Co., supra.) </em>It is to be noted that the Supreme Court did not define with precision what it meant by \u201cdefinite and substantial interest\u201d or \u201ca substantial part of the value of the thing transferred\u201d as those phrases are used in <em>John A. Nelson Co. </em>v. <em>Helvering, supra, </em>and <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Minnesota Tea Co. </em>In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>(6th Cir. 1936) 84 F.2d 415, 418, it was said that \u201c [i]n the commonly accepted legal sense, a substantial interest is something more than a merely nominal interest, and, in respect to corporations, a definite and material interest is an interest beyond what is usually referred to as represented by \u2018qualifying shares.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In summary, the federal statute was satisfied where the transferor retained a substantial stake in the enterprise and such a stake was thought to be retained where a large proportion of the consideration was in common stock of the transferee. <em>(Letulle </em>v. <em>Scofield </em>(1940) 308 U.S. 415, 420 [60 S.Ct. 313, 84 L.Ed. 355, 359-360]; <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>v. <em>Segall </em>(6th Cir. 1940) 114 F.2d 706, 708, cert, denied 313 U.S. 562 [61 S.Ct. 838, 85 L.Ed. 1522].) A reorganization existed within the purpose and meaning of the statute \u201cwhere, pursuant to a plan, the interest of the stockholders of a corporation continues to be definitely represented in substantial measure in a new or different one, ...\u201d <em>(Groman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>(1937) 302 U.S. 82, 89 [58 S.Ct. 108, 82 L.Ed. 63, 67].)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">In the instant case the stockholders of plaintiff received 1,000,000 shares of Pacific Industries stock in exchange for all outstanding stock of Heating Equipment. As a result the stock of Pacific represented the entire consideration moving to the stockholders of Heating for their shares in the latter corporation and in effect for the assets and properties of such corporation which Pacific thereupon acquired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>and absorbed. According to the stipulation of the parties, Heating\u2019s former stockholders thereby acquired a 14 per cent stock ownership interest in Pacific. Applying the authorities set forth above, we are satisfied that there was a continuity of interest on the part of the stockholders of the transferor corporation in the property and assets transferred, that such stockholders retained an interest in the affairs of the purchasing company which was definite, substantial and manifestly in excess of a mere nominal interest, and that the interest thus acquired by them clearly represented a material part of the value of the transferred assets. We are therefore of the view that the transactions in controversy, possessing the requisite elements and characteristics of a merger and reorganization under the former federal act and the federal cases interpreting it,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> constituted a merger and reorganization within the scope and purpose of the California statute which was patterned after the federal legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Plaintiff contends that the transactions here involved did not constitute a merger and hence a reorganization within section 23251 since the ownership and control of Heating\u2019s assets were substantially changed as a result of their acquisition by Pacific. Plaintiff grounds its argument on an analysis of the four decisions of California appellate courts which have dealt with section 23251: <em>San Joaquin Ginning Co. </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 254; <em>Great Western Power Co. </em>v. <em>McColgan </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 896 [125 P.2d 42]; <em>Bethlehem Pacific Coast Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1962) 203 Cal.App.2d 458 [21 Cal.Rptr. 707]; <em>Andersen-Carlson Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 825 [283 P.2d 278], The gist of the argument is this: The uniform test to be distilled from these decisions, says plaintiff, is \u201cwhether the ownership and control of the acquired assets is substantially the same after the transaction as it was before. \u2019 \u2019 The purpose of the statute was to provide for a continuing taxable entity only where the same business continues to be owned and operated by the same interests. Therefore, so the argument goes, there cannot be a merger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>within the meaning of the statute if there is a substantial change of ownership and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">We have already summarized the <em>San Joaquin </em>case pointing out that the court there found that the transactions involved constituted a reorganization within both subsections (3) and (4) of section 13(j) of the Bank and Corporation Franchise Tax Act then in effect, said subsections being the predecessors of subdivisions (b) and (c) respectively of section 23251. The <em>Great Western Power </em>case, <em>supra, </em>decided on the same day as <em>San Joaquin </em>presented a factual situation almost identical to that of <em>San Joaquin </em>and was decided in favor of the Franchise Tax Commissioner on the basis of <em>San Joaquin. </em>Presumably this case also involved the statutory predecessors to subdivisions (b) and (c) of section 23251. In the <em>Bethlehem </em>case, supra, one of two wholly owned subsidiaries transferred all of its California assets to the other. It was held that this constituted a reorganization since, the statute being applicable to California property or business only, there had been a transfer of \u201call or a substantial portion\u201d of the transferor subsidiary\u2019s business or property, the parent corporation (Bethlehem Steel Corporation of Delaware) still retaining control of the transferred property by reason of its ownership of all the * stock of the transferee. Obviously <em>Bethlehem </em>held that a reorganization occurred within the statutory predecessor to subdivision (a) of section 23251.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">While plaintiff concedes that the foregoing three cases \u201cproperly\u201d held that there was a reorganization as defined by section 23251, it neglects to indicate under which subdivisions of the statute or its predecessor, the particular reorganization was determined to fall. <em>San Joaquin </em>(and its companion case <em>Great Western Power </em>which we need not consider separately) posited reorganization on the predecessors to both subdivisions (b) and (c) of section 23251. Yet it is noteworthy that plaintiff here relies heavily on that portion of the court\u2019s opinion which states that the plaintiff in that case in order to prevail in its claim for refund was required to show that the change effected by the transactions there involved was in reality a change of substance as well as of form. (See 20 Cal.2d 254, 259.) As we have explained <em>supra, </em>this language relates to the determination whether there was a reorganization as defined by the predecessor to subdivision <em>(h) </em>of section 23251. That subdivision is not involved in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>case at bench. Plaintiff\u2019s argument that no claim can be made here that there was \u201ca mere change in identity, form or place of organization,\u201d for the reasons that the two corporations involved (Heating Equipment and Pacific Industries) had previously been entirely unrelated, that the aggregate interest of Heating\u2019s stockholders in the transferred assets was reduced from 100 per cent to 14 per cent, and that such stockholders no longer had control, is therefore of no avail and indeed beside the point.  The test of mere change in form without a substantial change in business operations or interests is applicable to determine whether a reorganization has occurred within the meaning of subdivision (6) of section 23251 (cf. <em>San Joaquin Ginning Co. </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 254; <em>Great Western Power Co. </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 896) just as the test of transfer of all or a substantial portion of corporate business or property followed by control on the part of the transferor or its stockholders is applicable to determine whether a reorganization has occurred within the meaning of subdivision (a) of section 23251 <em>(Bethlehem, Pacific Coast Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.2d 458).  Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s claim, none of these three eases hold that the above tests are applicable to determine whether a reorganization has occurred within the meaning of subdivisions (c) and (d) and that there is one test uniformly applicable to all subdivisions of the statute\u2014whether, as plaintiff would have it, the ownership and control of the acquired assets is the same after the transaction as it was before.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Nor does the fourth case to which plaintiff refers, <em>Andersen-Carlson Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, supra, </em>support such a uniform test. Plaintiff in that case and Rome Cable Corporation, an unrelated company which was its creditor, had entered into a contract providing for loans by Rome to the plaintiff and for the giving of an option by plaintiff to Rome to purchase all the plaintiff\u2019s assets. The agreement provided that the purchase price therefor would be the assumption by Rome of all of plaintiff\u2019s liabilities, the cancellation of plaintiff\u2019s indebtedness to Rome, and the issuance to plaintiff of a certain number of shares of Rome\u2019s stock. Approximately 15 months after the contract was made Rome gave notice of intention to exercise its option. Approximately three months later, plaintiff transferred substantially all of its assets to Rome and Rome delivered to plaintiff 27,500 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>shares of the latter\u2019s stock which represented less than 7 per cent of its shares outstanding. Plaintiff thereupon distributed the Rome shares to its own stockholders pro rata. From the date of the transfer, Rome operated the plant acquired from the plaintiff without any basic change in the former personnel. Approximately three months after the transfer, Andersen-Carlson dissolved. In affirming a judgment for refund of franchise taxes on the basis that there was no reorganization, the court stated that \u201c [t]here is nothing in the stipulated facts herein which would justify a conclusion that the contract made between the two corporations, more than a year before the dissolution, was not a bona fide contract providing for the outright sale of plaintiff\u2019s assets. As a result of the transfer of assets and the dissolution, there was a substantial change in the business operations and the interests involved.\u201d (132 Cal.App.2d at p. 829.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">It would appear that the court\u2019s observation as to \u201csubstantial change\u201d refers to a form or reorganization based upon a mere change in form without a substantial change in the business operations or interests transferred. (See \u00a7 23251, subd. (b).) Although the lower court was upheld in its conclusion that there was no reorganization, consolidation or merger at all, the opinion does not disclose to what, if any, extent a reorganization under the predecessor statute to section 23251, subdivision (c), was assertible or even asserted, which is the issue here confronting us. <em>Andersen </em>is distinguishable on its facts from the case at bench. It did not involve, as the instant case does, merely an exchange of stock followed by liquidation of the acquired corporation. At the time of the original contract a debtor-creditor relationship existed between the parties and by the terms of the contract arrangements were made between them for additional loans of a very substantial amount. As part of this arrangement, the lending corporation was given the option to purchase assets above described. This was clearly a mechanism reserved by the lender to protect its position as creditor and ultimately if it so desired, to settle or otherwise adjust its relationship with its debtor. The opinion in <em>Andersen </em>does not disclose whether the details of the transaction would support the application of the principles announced in <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Minnesota Tea Co., supra, </em>296 U.S. 378 [56 S.Ct. 269, 80 L.Ed. 284], and the related eases cited by us <em>supra. </em>It may well be that the facts did not. We find a significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>distinction between <em>Andersen </em>and the instant case in the debtor-creditor relationship between the parties and we feel that the court there could have very well concluded that the ultimate transaction was merely incidental to such relationship and did not derogate from the good faith of the arrangement thus availed of by the creditor. At any rate, we apprehend in <em>Andersen </em>no rule declaring that a reorganization within subdivision (c) of section 23251 is to be determined by the same criteria as one within subdivisions (a) or (b) of said section.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Plaintiff presents three arguments to support its proposition that a construction of section 23251, which includes the present transaction within the terms of such statute, is entirely unjustified. We consider them in the order presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">First it is argued that the words which would have precisely covered the present transaction were consciously omitted by the Legislature when it adopted the statute from the federal revenue act. This refers to the parenthetical phrase of clause (A) appearing in former section 112 of the Revenue Act of 1928. (See footnote 8, <em>ante.) </em>This same argument was made to and rejected by the court in <em>San Joaquin Ginning Co. </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 254, 262-263.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As we have explained, the court in <em>San Joaquin </em>held in effect that de facto mergers came within the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Secondly, plaintiff claims that a comparison of section 23251 with section 24562, which defines reorganization for gain or loss purposes, indicates that the transaction here involved is not a reorganization within section 23251. The argument runs as follows: The present transaction clearly falls within section 24562, subdivision (a)(3)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; this parti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>cular provision however is nowhere contained in section 23251; both sections 23251 and 24562 \u201cwere patterned after the same federal definition\u201d; therefore the omission of the above provision from section 23251 \u201cis especially significant as an expression of legislative intent to exclude the acquisition of assets in exchange for stock\u201d which is the instant transaction. We are not impressed with the argument. As plaintiff itself appears to concede, the above sections set forth two separate definitions of \u201creorganization\u201d for two different tax purposes. It appears to us to be illogical to argue that because a given transaction falls within section 24562 for gain and loss purposes, it is perforce excluded from section 23251 for franchise tax purposes. Each section sets forth separate and independent criteria to measure a transaction for the purpose proper thereto. Furthermore, while both sections may have had their genesis in the same federal legislation, it seems obvious from a comparison of them that California followed a legislative eclecticism in constructing an appropriate yardstick in each case and thus not providing for a uniform statutory result.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We do not find the general coinci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>denee between them that plaintiff claims to exist nor such an identity prevailing in respects other than that singled out as to compel the conclusion that the type of transaction here present was purposely withheld from the operation of section 23251.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Finally plaintiff argues that when the Legislature amended section 23332 in 1961 by expressly incorporating therein the definition of reorganization found in section 23251, it approved the judicial interpretation of the latter section in the <em>Andersen-Carlson </em>case. (See footnote 5, <em>ante.) </em>But, as we have explained, <em>Andersen-Carlson </em>is distinguishable on its facts from the instant ease and is not here controlling. Furthermore the 1961 amendment relied on by plaintiff seems to us to be merely of a technical or clarifying nature and, in our view, does not warrant the conclusion that the Legislature must have reviewed all the ease law and approved the \u201cuniform rule\u201d which plaintiff claims to find in the <em>Andersen-Carlson </em>ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We therefore conclude that the transaction before us constitutes a reorganization as defined in subdivision (c) of section 23251. In view of this conclusion, we deem it unnecessary to decide whether, as the board argues, the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the trial court can be sustained on the additional ground that the present transaction constitutes a reorganization as defined in subdivision (d) of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Our conclusion herein at the same time disposes of plaintiff\u2019s argument that the transaction, viewed as a whole, is in substance an acquisition of assets rather than a reorganization. In its opening brief plaintiff, relying on the trial court\u2019s finding<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that Pacific Industries at all relevant times intended to obtain the assets of Heating Equipment by liquidating the latter corporation, invokes the so-called <em>KimbellDiamond </em>rule. <em>(Kimbell-Diamond Milling Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>(1950) 14 T.C. 74.) This rule deals with the acquisition of assets of another corporation by the <em>purchase </em>of its stock. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mattison </em>(9th Cir. 1959) 273 F.2d 13, 17, cited by plaintiff, the court explained the rule in the following language: \u201cThere is, however, an established exception to the rule giving effect to liquidating distributions, which is known as the KimbellDiamond rule. Under this doctrine, when a taxpayer who is interested primarily in a corporation\u2019s assets first <em>purchases </em>the stock and then liquidates the corporation in order to acquire the desired assets, the separate steps taken to accomplish the primary objective will be treated as a single transaction. Thus, even though the objective was accomplished in form by a purchase of stock, the substance of the transaction is a purchase of property. [Footnote omitted].\u201d (Italics added.) This rule has been codified in California. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a724504, subd. (b)(2). Cf. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334(b) (2); see 3A Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation, \u00a7 21.167.) Clearly in the instant case Pacific Industries did not acquire the stock of Heating Equipment by purchase but in a stock for stock exchange as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code, as the court also found.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>It is interesting to note that none of the eases cited by plaintiff<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> in its opening brief as illustrative of the <em>KimbellDiamond </em>rule involve a situation, as in the instant case, where the stockholders of the transferor corporation retained a definite and substantial interest in the affairs of the acquiring corporation. (See <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Minnesota Tea Co., supra, </em>296 U.S. 378 [56 S.Ct. 269, 80 L.Ed. 284].)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In plaintiff\u2019s closing brief the real thrust of its argument on the <em>Kimbell-Diamond </em>rule becomes apparent. Here plaintiff attempts to employ the argument in support of its position that the present transaction is not a reorganization within subdivision (d) of section 23251. It is urged that subdivision (d) is not applicable since under \u201cthe broad step transaction doctrine\u201d (of which plaintiff claims the <em>KimbellDiamond </em>case is only one application) the liquidation of Heating Equipment attained no independent significance but was merely one step in an overall transaction pursuant to which Pacific acquired the assets of Heating in exchange for its stock. However since we sustain the trial court\u2019s judgment under section 23251, subdivision (c), we need not pass upon plaintiff\u2019s claim that the application of the step transaction principles preclude the operation of subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Bray, P.

Thus the predecessor of \u00a7 24562 (\u00a7 20 of the Bank and Corporation Franchise Tax Act) contained the federal statutory definition of \"reorganization\u201d as early as 1929 when the Franchise Tax Act was first enacted. (Stats. 1929, ch. 13, \u00a720, subd.(g), p. 27.) However the term \"reorganization\u201d was not defined in the predecessor of \u00a7 23251 (\u00a713 of the Franchise Tax Act) until that section was amended in 1933 (Stats. 1933, eh. 210, \u00a7 5, p. 696; ch. 303, \u00a7 6, p. 872). While \u00a7 13 as amended in 1933 did not include the \"merger and consolidation\u201d clause of \u00a7 112(i) (1) (A) it did include in separate paragraphs provisions for the payment of the tax by \"merged\u201d or \u20181 consolidated <em>\u2019 \u2019 </em>corporations. Section 112 of the Revenue Act of 1934 saw a change in the definition of \"reorganization.\u201d Thus former subd. (A) was in effect expanded in the 1934 Act into two subdivisions, (A) and (B), that section thereafter reading in part: \"The term \u2018reorganization\u2019 means (A) a statutory merger or consolidation, or (B) the acquisition by one corporation in exchange solely for all or a part of its voting stock: of at least 80 per centum of the voting stock and at least 80 per centum of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation; or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>of substantially all the properties of another corporation.\u201d This change was reflected in \u00a7 20 of the Franchise Tax Act by an amendment in 1935 (Stats. 1935, eh. 275, \u00a7 14, p. 974) which incorporated by reference the 1934 Revenue Act. Section 13 was also amended in 1935 (Stats. 1935, ch. 275, \u00a79, p. 967), but the definition of \u201creorganization\u201d remained substantially the same without incorporating subdivisions (A) and (B) of the federal statute. Finally in 1937 \u00a720 was amended and the definition of \u201creorganization\u201d of the Revenue Act of 1936 (substantially the same as that of the 1934 Act) was incorporated therein by reference. (Stats. 1937, eh. 19, \u00a7 2, p. 86.) Section 13 was also amended in 1937 and to the definition of \u201creorganization\u201d there were added the words \u201cor (4) a merger or consolidation.\u201d (Stats. 1937, p. 2331.) It is to be noted that the Legislature in adding these words to \u00a7 13 did not abstract them from the federal statute then in force. As pointed out above, the 1936 Revenue Act defined a reorganization in part as a <em>\u201cstatutory </em>merger or consolidation.\u201d (Italics added.) By deliberately excluding the limiting adjective \u201cstatutory\u201d before the nouns \u201cmerger\u201d and \u201cconsolidation\u201d it is clear that the Legislature intended that this subdivision possess a broader scope than its federal counterpart and hence inferably embrace within its terms de facto mergers such as that in the case at bar.
