A 5773, by order duly made, was transferred to the District Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division One.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">In its order of certification the judges of said appellate department declared that the above entitled action presents a new and important question of law which should be settled, to wit, when a felony complaint is dismissed by the magistrate before whom a preliminary examination is pending and a new complaint for a misdemeanor is filed on the same facts, when does time begin to run within which the misdemeanor case may be brought to trial under Penal Code section 1382, subdivision 3 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">The judgment of the appellate department was filed April 20, 1964, reversing the order made by the magistrate on January 27, 1964, dismissing the action under the provisions of section 1382, subdivision 3, of the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The appeal was regularly calendared here for oral argument. Upon examination of the record, we conclude with the appellate department that the order dismissing the action should be reversed and we adopt the unanimous opinion of that court prepared by Presiding Judge Frank G. Swain, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">The defendant had been formerly charged with felony manslaughter (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. 3 (a)) and felony drunk driving (Veh. Code \u00a7 23101). A preliminary examination had been held and defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was granted. A second complaint was filed six days thereafter charging the same offenses as contained in the previous complaint. Thereafter, on motion of the district attorney, that complaint was dismissed and the same day a new complaint was filed charging the defendant with misdemeanor manslaughter (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. 3(b)) and misdemeanor drunk driving (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23102) based on the same acts as the previous complaints. Upon arraignment for the misdemeanors, the court, on motion of the defendant, dismissed the action relying on section 1382, subdivision 3, of the Penal Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The dismissal of the felony complaints was not a bar to filing another complaint whether for a felony or for a misdemeanor. Section 1387 of the Penal Code states: \u201cAn order for the dismissal of the action, made as provided in this chapter, is a bar to any other prosecution for the same offense if it is a misdemeanor, but not if it is a felony.\u201d  The words \u201cif it is a misdemeanor\u201d refer to the complaint which was dismissed, not to the new complaint which was filed.  Respondent, in effect contends, that the 30 days within which a misdemeanor case must be brought to trial (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1382, subd. 3) began to run before the misdemeanor prosecution commenced. There is no merit to this. The record does not show that the defendant was ever arrested on the misdemeanor charge but it does show that the misdemeanor complaint was filed January 27, 1964, that the defendant appeared, moved for a dismissal and the motion was granted on January 27, 1964. The time for trial did not begin to run until that date. Section 1382, subdivision 3, of the Penal Code, provides: \u201c . . . if there has been no arrest\u201d (on misdemeanor charge . . . the subsection deals only with misdemeanors) \u201cand he has not signed a notice to appear,\u201d (he must be brought to trial) \u201cwithin 45 days after he has, by appearance in court pursuant to a parking citation <em>or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>otherwise, </em>submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court. . . . (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Dismissal of a felony prosecution where jeopardy has not attached is not a bar to filing a new felony action on the same charge even though the 60-day period for trial provided by section 1382, subdivision 2, of the Penal Code, has run.  <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilkes </em>(1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 691, 697 [2 Cal.Rptr. 594] states: \u201cWith respect to the 60-day period for bringing a case to trial (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1382, subd. 2), the court stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>149 Cal.App.2d 151, 159 [307 P.2d 994] : \u2018It seems to be the rule that the 60-day period is reinstated not only by a mistrial [citation], but by the filing of a new or amended pleading, whether or not a new or different charge is involved.\u2019 [Citations.] Since the order dismissing the first information was not res judicata . . . It follows that there is no foundation for defendant\u2019s further argument that the jurisdiction of the court was exhausted by such dismissal.\u201d  It is obvious that if the dismissal of a felony prosecution in which the 60-day period has run does not bar another 60-day period within which a second felony prosecution for the same charge may be tried, the dismissal of the felony complaints in the present case does not bar the time for trial of a misdemeanor action based on the same charge. We must not confuse this with the law that dismissal of a misdemeanor complaint on this charge would have barred this action. No misdemeanor complaint has been dismissed except the one from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The order dismissing the action is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 20, 1964.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
