Such person and the company each agree to consider itself bound and to be bound by any award made by the arbitrators pursuant to this Part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Petitioners sought an order of the court below \u201cdirecting that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in said written insurance contract. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Respondent thereupon filed a memorandum in opposition to the petition, signed by its counsel, stating <em>inter alia </em>the following: \u201cThis matter\u201d was before the arbitrator on January 16,1963, and \u201cat that time was put off calendar, because by jury verdict in the case of <em>Cunningham, </em>v. <em>Loscalzo et al, </em>petitioner Loscalzo was found negligent, and a verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff Cunningham.\u201d The latter suit involved the same accident which was the basis of petitioners\u2019 claim for arbitration. The judgment on the verdict in the <em>Cunningham </em>case was final and therefore a bar to any claim of right to arbitration, since that action determined that responsibility for the accident rested with Loscalzo and therefore did not permit relitigation of that issue in court or arbitration. Furthermore, \u201ccounsel for Loscalzo agreed at the arbitration hearing when the matter was continued, that if the Cunningham judgment became final it would be a bar to any further arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">In support of such memorandum respondent filed the affidavit of its counsel D. W. Brobst. Said affidavit states that he attended the arbitration hearing in the matter involving petitioners and respondent in San Jose on January 16, 1963, before the arbitrator; that he moved that the matter be continued because any award in favor of Loscalzo would be void if the judgment theretofore rendered in the <em>Cunningham </em>ease adverse to Loscalzo became final; that counsel for Loscalzo agreed that if the judgment in the <em>Cunningham </em>case became final it would defeat the Loscalzo claim; and that thereupon the hearing was continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Petitioners filed no counteraffidavit but filed a memorandum in support of the petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This memorandum states the following: That in the so-called <em>Cunningham </em>case, Cunningham brought an action against Loscalzo, Matsunaga and Guardiola and obtained a judgment against all three. Matsunaga and Guardiola were not insured. The resulting judgment however, so the memorandum urges, does not prevent the matter from going to arbitration since the doctrines of res judicata or collateral estoppel are inapplicable to such proceedings which are contractual rather than judicial. Furthermore, even if the doctrines were applicable in arbitration proceedings, they would not be operative here since the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>involved were not adversaries in the <em>Cunningham </em>case hut only codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The positions of the parties in this court may be summarized as follows: Petitioners contend (1) that in the light of the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 they are clearly entitled to an order directing the arbitration to proceed; (2) that the judgment in the <em>Cunningham </em>case is not res judicata of petitioners\u2019 right to seek relief against the two uninsured motorists above mentioned and even if it were as to petitioner Salvadore Loscalzo, it would not be as to petitioner Bertha Loscalzo who was a guest in the automobile; and (3) that the doctrine of res judicata does not preclude the continuance of the arbitration proceedings since its applicability is to be determined by the arbitrator. Respondent on the other hand contends (1) that there was a waiver of the arbitration proceedings when the judgment in the <em>Cunningham </em>case became final; and (2) such judgment is res judicata of petitioners\u2019 negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Section 1281.2 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides in relevant part: \u201cOn petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">\u201c(a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\u201c (b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">\u201cIf the court determines that a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy exists, an order to arbitrate such controversy may not be refused on the ground that the petitioner\u2019s contentions lack substantive merit. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The petition filed in the instant case alleges, as pointed out above, (a) the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy, (b) the controversy, and (c) at least the implied refusal of respondent to arbitrate such controversy by maintaining that no arbitrable controversy exists. It is not clear whether respondent\u2019s memorandum in opposition was intended to be a response as permitted by Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Assuming it may be so considered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>nevertheless it is notable that nowhere does it, or for that matter its supporting affidavit, contain any denial of the allegations of the petition outlined above. It is clear therefore that the petition contained all the allegations required by the statute. (Cf. <em>Weiman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 710, 712-713 [336 P.2d 489]; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Richfield Oil Corp. </em>(1950) 98 Cal.App.2d 667, 670 [220 P.2d 973], both decided under the former statute.) Manifestly on this state of the record the trial court was required to order the parties to arbitrate unless it determined that petitioners had waived their right to compel arbitration or that grounds existed for the revocation of the agreement. (See \u00a7 1281.2, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The record before us does not disclose the basis of the court's order denying the petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor does it disclose that any contention was made urging the existence of grounds for the revocation of the agreement. It must be assumed then that the court based its order denying the petition on the ground that petitioners waived the right to compel arbitration. Indeed respondent devotes most of its brief on this appeal to urging waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right after knowledge of the facts. <em>(Alden </em>v. <em>Mayfield </em>(1912) 164 Cal. 6, 11 [127 P. 45]; <em>Roesch </em>v. <em>De Mota </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 563, 572 [150 P.2d 422].) It therefore rests upon intent. <em>(Roesch </em>v. <em>De Mota, supra.) </em> A party to an agreement providing for arbitration may waive his right to arbitrate. <em>(Trubowitch </em>v. <em>Riverbank Canning Co. </em>(1947) 30 Cal. 2d 335, 339 [182 P.2d 182]; <em>Case </em>v. <em>Kadota Fig Assn. </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 596, 606 [220 P.2d 912]; <em>Tas-T-Nut Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Nut Co. </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 351, 354-355 [270 P.2d 43]; <em>Qrunwald-Marx, Inc. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Joint Board, Amalgamated Clothing Workers </em>(1961) 192 Cal.App.2d 268, 277 [13 Cal.Rptr. 446].)  Whether or not there has been a waiver is ordinarily a question of fact. <em>(Local 659, I.A.T.S.E. </em>v. <em>Color Corp. of America </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 189, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>196 [302 P.2d <em>294]; Tas-T-Nut Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Nut Co., supra ; Grunwald-Marx, Inc. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Joint Board, Amalgamated Clothing Workers, supra ; Bertero </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 213, 219 [30 Cal.Rptr. 719].)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">So far as the record before us shows, the sole evidence before the court below was the verified petition and the affidavit of Mr. Brobst filed by respondent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   It appears that the matter was determined on affidavits. Upon such a trial of an issue, if there is a substantial conflict in the facts stated, a determination by the trial court of the controverted facts may not be disturbed on appeal. <em>(Griffith Co. </em>v. <em>San Diego College for Women </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 501, 508 [289 P.2d 476, 47 A.L.R.2d 1349]; <em>Beckett </em>v. <em>Kaynar Mfg. Co., Inc. </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 695, 699 [321 P.2d 749].) In such instances we are bound by the same rule which governs our review of oral testimony. (See <em>Lundblade </em>v. <em>Phoenix </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 108, 110-111 [28 Cal.Rptr. 660] and eases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">An examination of the petition and respondent\u2019s affidavit reveals that the only evidence which can be construed as reasonably referring to a waiver is the statement in Mr. Brobst\u2019s affidavit that \u201ccounsel for Loscalzo agreed that if the judgment in the Cunningham case became final it would defeat the Loscalzo claim, ...\u201d Bespondent here argues that \u201c [t]his was a clear waiver of the right to arbitrate when the Cunningham judgment became final, thus defeating any right of appellants to an order directing arbitration.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree. Neither the above quoted allegation relied upon by respondent nor any other part of Mr. Brobst\u2019s affidavit states that petitioners\u2019 counsel waived their right to arbitrate or to continue with the arbitration then pending or to terminate or abandon such proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Express language to this effect is notably absent. The terms \u201cwaiver,\u201d \u201crelinquishment,\u201d \u201carbitration\u201d or other expressions synonymous therewith nowhere appear.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As we read the affidavit it says this: That Mr. Brobst moved that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the arbitration hearing be continued on the ground that any award therein would be void if the <em>Cunningham </em>judgment became final and petitioners\u2019 counsel agreed that such event would defeat the Loscalzo claim. At best, and assuming it was authorized, this statement ascribed to petitioners\u2019 counsel merely referred to the <em>internal conduct of the arbitration proceedings themselves </em>and not to the <em>termination or abandonment </em>of such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">This contraction of the allegation is fortified by the statement that the arbitration hearing was <em>continued </em>presumably for the purpose of having the arbitrator then consider the effect of the finality of the judgment. If the statement of petitioners\u2019 counsel has any effect at all on petitioners\u2019 entitlement to an award, this bears upon the merits of the matter to be arbitrated which is to be determined by the arbitrator and with which we are not concerned. <em>(Posner </em>v. <em>Grunwald-Marx, Inc. </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 169, 189 [14 Cal.Rptr. 297, 363 P.2d <em>313]; O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Petroleum Maintenance Co. </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 107, 111 [308 P.2d 9] and cases there collected.) We therefore are not called upon to determine whether or not the <em>Cunningham </em>judgment is res judicata as to these petitioners. Even assuming that the developments related in respondent\u2019s affidavit cause petitioners\u2019 contentions to lack substantive merit, such fact does not justify the order appealed from. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 <em>1281.2; Bertero </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.2d 213, 221.) \u201cThe parties have contracted for an arbitrator\u2019s decision and not for that of the courts.\u201d <em>(Posner </em>v. <em>Grunwald-Marx, Inc., supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 169, 175.)  The policy of California law is to recognize and give the utmost effect to arbitration agreements. <em>(Grunwald-Marx, Inc. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Joint Board, Amalgamated Clothing Workers, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.2d 268, 276-277; <em>Homestead Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 697, 700 [16 Cal.Rptr. 121]; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Richfield Oil Corp., supra, </em>98 Cal.App.2d 667, 671.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Respondent further claims that the arbitrator\u2019s ruling that petitioners had no claim under the uninsured motorists\u2019 coverage of their policy by reason of the adverse finding in the <em>Cunningham </em>ease constituted an award. The claim is utterly without merit. The record is barren of any evidence that the arbitrator made any ruling whatsoever except to continue the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">We therefore conclude that the record does not support a conclusion that petitioners waived their right to compel arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>tration and we hold that it was therefore an abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Bray, P.
