The judge who presided at a trial for injury resulting from a collision between the car so registered and the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle was unable to agree with that contention. Nor can we.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 2, begins \u201cApplication for the registration of motor vehicles and trailers may be made by the owner thereof.\u201d This contemplates and requires an owner of sufficient legal capacity to undertake the responsibilities imposed by the statute, or to authorize another to undertake them on his behalf. An infant under four years of age does not possess such legal capacity. Citation of authorities would be supererogation. The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 34A-34J, inclusive, dealing with compulsory insurance obviously contemplate a registrant who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>legal capacity to contract for insurance, and would not be satisfied by acts of one such as the infant plaintiff here.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\">Since the registration was illegal, in accord with the terms of the report the verdict ordered by the judge to be entered must stand and judgment be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
