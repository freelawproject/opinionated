There was testimony direct and unequivocal to the effect that the plaintiff was severely injured in one ear and otherwise by being struck intentionally by the defendant with the door of his automobile. Whether the defendant \u201ckicked\u201d open or otherwise forcibly pushed the door against the plaintiff is an inconsequential detail. The evidence, which need not be narrated or summarized, was conflicting, but its weight and credibility were wholly for the trial judge and it abundantly justified the finding in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
