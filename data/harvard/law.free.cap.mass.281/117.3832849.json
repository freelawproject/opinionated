The defendant insurance company insured the defendant Rego under the Massachusetts compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance act, and for an additional premium also gave him an \u201cextra-ter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ritorial coverage endorsement\u201d insuring him against liability for accidents in other territory including Rhode Island. The accident in -this case was not covered by the Massachusetts compulsory policy, for it did not occur upon \u201cthe ways of the Commonwealth.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 34A. It was not covered by the indorsement, for although the plaintiff was receiving a free ride as a guest, the defendant Rego was using the automobile at the time of the accident for \u201cthe carrying of passengers for a consideration,\u201d and by the terms of the indorsement he was not insured while so doing. The rights of the plaintiff under the indorsement depend upon those of Rego, and since he was not insured against liability to the plaintiff there was nothing for her to reach by her bill in equity under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 112, 113, and c. 214, \u00a7 3 (10). <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Bloomfield, </em>246 Mass. 510. <em>Kana </em>v. <em>Fishman, </em>276 Mass. 206. <em>Sontag </em>v. <em>Galer, </em>279 Mass. 309. <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Preferred Accident Ins.

Consequently the exceptions of the defendant insurance company become immaterial, and are expressly waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
