For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">According to his petition, Rublee was arrested for a drug offense involving marijuana and was released on bond. After he failed to appear, a warrant for Rublee\u2019s arrest issued. Rublee was located in Colombia, and was returned to the United States where he pled guilty to a single-count indictment charging him with a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). On January 6,1997, the trial court sentenced him to thirty-three months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">While in prison, Rublee participated in and completed a 500-hour residential drug-treatment program which provisionally qualified him for early release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the course of his treatment, he was considered for placement in a community corrections center (CCC) (a type of half-way house where inmates receive community-based treatment), but, on July 31, 1997, Rublee was denied placement due to concern that he would be a flight risk. The denial of the request for CCC placement disqualified Rublee from early release under Bureau of Prisons (BOP) regulations. Ru-blee filed grievances with the warden, the regional director, and the BOP national administrative inmate appeals division requesting administrative review of the decision to deny him CCC placement and a \u00a7 3621(e) early release. Ml of Rublee\u2019s requests for administrative relief were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-15\">On November 7, 1997, Rublee filed a \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court arguing that the BOP exceeded its authority by requiring that a prisoner be eligible to participate in a community-based drug-treatment program to be eligible for a \u00a7 3621(e) sentence reduction, and that the BOP\u2019s requirements were arbitrary and a violation of his constitutional rights. The magistrate judge, citing <em>Venegas v. Henman, </em>126 F.3d 760, 765 (5th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 1679, 140 L.Ed.2d 817 (1998), concluded that the BOP\u2019s policy of refusing to grant \u00a7 3621(e) sentence reductions to inmates ineligible for community-based treatment was within the discretion afforded the BOP under \u00a7 3621. The magistrate judge recommended dismissal of Rublee\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. On February 5, 1998, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Rublee\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. Rublee timely appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-18\">\n<em>II. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b260-19\">A. Promulgation of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58(a)(l)(v)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-21\">Section 3621(b) provides that \u201c[t]he Bureau shall make available appropriate substance abuse treatment for each prisoner the Bureau determines has a treatable condition of substance addiction or abuse.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b). Section 3621(e)(1) states that in order for the BOP to carry out this requirement, it \u201cshall ... provide residential substance abuse treatment (and make arrangements for appropriate aftercare).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3621(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-24\">The statute defines \u201cresidential substance abuse treatment\u201d as \u201ca course of individual and group activities, lasting between 6 and 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>months, in residential treatment facilities set apart from the general prison population.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3621(e)(5)(A). The statute defines \u201caftercare\u201d as \u201cplacement, case management and monitoring of the participant in a community-based substance abuse treatment program when the participant leaves the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3621(e)(5)(C). As an incentive for prisoners to participate in the drug treatment program,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">[t]he period a prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense remains in custody after successfully completing a treatment program may be reduced by the Bureau of Prisons, but such reduction may not be more than one year from the term the prisoner must otherwise serve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Under BOP regulations, certain categories of inmates are not eligible for early release, including \u201c[i]nmates who are not eligible for participation in a community-based program as determined by the Warden on the basis of his or her professional discretion.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58(a)(l)(v). The BOP policy statement expresses the BOP\u2019s belief that a community-based program (either in a CCC or on home confinement) is necessary to achieve successful results. <em>See </em>61 Fed.Reg. 25,121 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Rublee argues that the BOP exceeded its authority by requiring completion of a community-based drug program as a component of the drug treatment program necessary to be eligible for early release under \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B). He contends that the definitions of \u201cresidential substance abuse treatment\u201d and \u201caftercare\u201d in \u00a7 3621(e)(5) are unambiguous and that the plain language of the statute indicates that a community-based drug program is not a component of the drug program described in \u00a7 3621.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">This court reviews the BOP\u2019s regulations in \u00a7 550.58 under the two-step standard set forth in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>See Wottlin v. Fleming, </em>136 F.3d 1032, 1035 (5th Cir.1998). First, if the intent of Congress is clear and unambiguously expressed in \u00a7 3621, the BOP and the court must give effect to congressional intent. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778). Second, if the statutory language is ambiguous or silent on a particular issue, then we must determine whether the BOP\u2019s interpretation is \u201c \u2018based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Although this circuit has held that \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) gives the BOP discretion to determine which prisoners are eligible for early release and that the \u201cBOP did not abuse its discretion in promulgating 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1036, neither this nor any other circuit has addressed specifically whether the BOP exceeded its authority in promulgating 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58(a)(l)(v), which disqualifies prisoners not eligible for community-based treatment from receiving early release under \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B). Because the language of the statute does not unambiguously prohibit the BOP\u2019s community-based treatment requirement, the requirement need only be a permissible interpretation of the statute to survive <em>Chevron </em>scrutiny. This court will defer to legislative regulations so long as they are not \u201c \u2018arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u2019\u201d <em>Wottlin, </em>136 F.3d at 1035 (citing <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">In <em>Venegas v. Henman, </em>this court focused on the language \u201cmay be reduced\u201d in \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B), and found that it affords the BOP discretion to determine which offenses constitute \u201cnonviolent offenses\u201d eligible for early release. <em>See </em>126 F.3d at 763. We held that the BOP\u2019s decision to exclude felon-in-possession of a weapon convictions and drug convictions enhanced for possession of a firearm was \u201cconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Bureau\u2019s authority as derived from section 3621(e).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">In <em>Wottlin v. Fleming, </em>this court reviewed the disqualification from \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) early release of \u201c \u2018inmates who have a prior felony conviction for homicide, forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault.\u2019 \u201d 136 F.3d at 1035 (quoting 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58). We agreed with the Ninth Circuit that the language of \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B), which provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>a prisoner\u2019s sentence \u201cmay be reduced\u201d after the successful completion of a drug-treatment program, affords the BOP broad discretion in deciding which inmates qualify for early release, and agreed with the Ninth and Third Circuits that \u00a7 550.58 was not an abuse of the BOP\u2019s discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 1035-36 (citing <em>Stiver v. Meko, </em>130 F.3d 574, 577 (3d Cir.1997); <em>Jacks v. Crabtree, </em>114 F.3d 983, 984 (9th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 1196, 140 L.Ed.2d 325 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The <em>Venegas </em>and <em>Wottlin </em>cases stand for the proposition that the language of \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) affords the BOP discretion in deciding whether to allow early release upon completion of the drug-treatment program described in the statute. Rublee argues that the plain language of the statute precludes the BOP from requiring community-based treatment because the statutory definition of \u201cresidential substance abuse treatment\u201d is defined explicitly as \u201ca course of individual and group activities, lasting between 6 and 12 months, in residential treatment facilities set apart from the general prison population,\u201d and does not include any reference to community-based treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(5)(A). However, it is the responsibility of the BOP to determine whether an inmate has successfully completed a drug-treatment program: \u201cThe legislative history of section 3621(e) states that the determination of successful completion of a substance abuse treatment program! ] is to be \u2018based on criteria <em>established and applied by the Bureau of Prisons.\u2019 \u201d Venegas, </em>126 F.3d at 762 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 103-320 (1993)). The BOP, \u201cin exercising its discretion in determining the successful completion of a residential drug abuse treatment program under 18 U.S.C. 3621(e), ... therefore required] that consideration for early release be contingent upon the inmate\u2019s completion of transitional services in a community-based program.\u201d 61 Fed.Reg. 25,121 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Even if Rublee is correct that the BOP has improperly expanded the definition of \u201cresidential substance abuse treatment\u201d by requiring community-based treatment, he still is not entitled to the relief he seeks because \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) affords the BOP broad discretion to deny sentence reductions to even those inmates who have \u201csuccessfully com-plet[ed] a treatment program.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B); <em>see Wottlin, </em>136 F.3d at 1035-36; <em>Venegas, </em>126 F.3d at 763-65. Under \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B), the BOP \u201cmay,\u201d but implicitly need not, reduce the sentences of such inmates.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, it has the authority to make \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) early release contingent upon the fulfillment of the community-based treatment requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Rublee next argues that the BOP\u2019s requirement that an inmate complete community-based treatment <em>prior </em>to early release subverts the definition of \u201caftercare,\u201d which requires community-based treatment <em>after </em>\u201cthe participant leaves the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(5)(C). The definition of \u201caftercare\u201d set forth in \u00a7 3621(e)(5)(C) and the requirement that the BOP \u201cmake arrangements for appropriate aftercare,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3621(e)(1), do not preclude the BOP from exercising its discretion under \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) to require pre-release community-based treatment before awarding a sentence reduction. The provisions are not mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">Finally, Rublee argues that the BOP\u2019s community-based treatment requirement is impermissible because it conflicts with the BOP\u2019s earlier interpretation of the statute that did not require community-based treatment. <em>See </em>61 Fed.Reg. 25,121 (1996). The court does not find this argument compelling. The BOP added the community-based treatment requirement after receiving public comment, including a comment from the American Psychiatric Association (APA) that expressed the belief that the BOP\u2019s requirement of one hour per month of transitional services would be insufficient to facilitate good results. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the BOP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>did not abuse its discretion in adding the community-based treatment requirement to its regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">.The exclusion of prisoners who cannot complete community-based treatment from \u00a7 3621 early release is not arbitrary or capricious and does not conflict with the purposes underlying the statute. Therefore, we hold that 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58(a)(l)(v) is a permissible exercise of the BOP\u2019s discretion under \u00a7 3621(e).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">B. Constitutional Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Rublee argues that the application of \u00a7 550.58 to him violates his rights to due process and equal protection. Liberally construed, Rublee\u2019s due process argument is that he had a protected liberty interest in a sentence reduction once he completed the residential drug-treatment program. He further argues that the BOP\u2019s community-based treatment requirement violates equal protection because completion of a drug program in a half-way house is not rationally related to the successful completion of the drug program described in \u00a7 3621 and because it discriminates against prisoners not eligible for CCC placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Rublee\u2019s argument that he had a protected liberty interest in receiving the sentence reduction lacks merit. A protected liberty interest exists only when a regulation uses \u201c \u2018mandatory language to place a substantive limit on official discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wottlin, </em>136 F.3d at 1036 (quoting <em>United States v. Tubwell, </em>37 F.3d 175, 179 (5th Cir.1994)). There is no mandatory language requiring that inmates be released upon completion of the drug-treatment program, and thus Ru-blee had no protected liberty interest in receiving a \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) sentence reduction. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">With respect to Rublee\u2019s equal protection argument, \u201c[s]triet scrutiny is appropriate only where a government classification implicates a suspect class or a fundamental right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., </em>473 U.S. 432, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985)). Otherwise, rational-basis review applies and this court need only determine whether the classification is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. <em>See id. </em>at 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The BOP\u2019s classification implicates neither a fundamental right nor a suspect class. In <em>Wottlin, </em>we refused to recognize a fundamental right to early release \u201c \u2018among the rights and liberties protected by the Constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1036-37 (quoting <em>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 29, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor does the classification of prisoners by their eligibility for CCC placement implicate a suspect class.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Thus, rational-basis review is appropriate. The exclusion from early release of those inmates ineligible for community-based treatment survives rational-basis review. In promulgating the regulation, the BOP took account of the APA\u2019s concern about the efficacy of transitional drug-treatment services in an institutional context. <em>See </em>61 Fed.Reg. 25,121 (1996). The BOP agreed with the APA that enhanced transitional services were necessary for the successful completion of the drug program, and decided to require community-based treatment to increase the opportunity for positive results. See <em>id. </em>This requirement is rationally related to the legitimate government interest of reducing recidivism, which is a stated purpose underlying \u00a7 3621(e). <em>See Venegas, </em>126 F.3d at 763 (citing H.R.Rep. No. 103-320 (1993)). Accordingly, there is a rational basis for the categorization contained in \u00a7 550.58(a)(l)(v) and Rublee\u2019s constitutional challenges fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\n<em>III. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court. Rublee\u2019s motion to expedite the appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-12\">. Rublee completed the treatment program on February 27, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-25\">. Rublee\u2019s projected release date is November 8, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\">. Rublee contends that \"[s]ection 3621(e)(2) plainly and unambiguously authorizes sentence reduction for prisoners convicted of a nonviolent offense who successfully complete a 6 to 12 month residential substance abuse treatment program while in prison.\" Rublee is correct that the BOP is <em>authorized </em>to allow sentence reductions for such prisoners. However, it is not <em>required </em>to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">. Rublee also argues that the limitation of \u00a7 3621(e) early release to those inmates who complete community-based treatment produces absurd and unconstitutional results because inmates can be denied CCC placement for numerous reasons that bear no relation to their ability to complete the drug-treatment program defined in the statute. This argument will be addressed infra in the analysis of Rublee\u2019s constitutional claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b263-12\">. In <em>Wottlin, </em>we also held that classification of prisoners based on the type of offense for which they were convicted did not implicate a suspect class, and that the classification was rationally related to Congress's intent to afford early release only to prisoners convicted of nonviolent offenses. <em>See Wottlin, </em>136 F.3d at 1036-37.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
