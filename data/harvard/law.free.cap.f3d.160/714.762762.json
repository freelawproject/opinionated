The issue before the arbitrator is whether air traffic controllers employed by the FAA are entitled to Sunday premium pay for hours of annual or sick leave taken on Sundays. While the arbitration was pending, NATCA filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking a ruling that the air traffic controllers are entitled to premium pay for Sunday leave notwithstanding legislation purporting to affect the employees\u2019 right to premium pay. The court, however, dismissed NATCA\u2019s complaint, ruling that it did not have jurisdiction to grant the request for declaratory and injunctive relief. NATCA has appealed that dismissal to this court. We agree that the Court of Federal Claims may not grant the relief requested and we therefore affirm the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b946-16\">In 1993, this court held in <em>Armitage v. United States, </em>991 F.2d 746 (Fed.Cir.1993), that the Sunday premium pay statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5546(a), required that federal police officers receive Sunday premium pay for hours of annual or sick leave taken on Sundays. Congress subsequently enacted the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1995, which contained a provision forbidding any of the appropriated funds to be used to provide premium pay under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5546(a) \u201cto any Federal Aviation Administration employee unless such employee actually performed work during the time corresponding to such premium pay.\u201d Pub.L. No. 103- 331, 108 Stat. 2471, 2475 (1994). Identical language was included in the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 1996. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 104- 50,109 Stat. 436, 440 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-19\">NATCA\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with the FAA provides that disputes under the agreement must be submitted for arbitration. In 1995, NATCA sought arbitration of its claim that the FAA was improperly denying Sunday premium pay to air traffic controllers who took sick or annual leave on Sundays. After the arbitration began, NAT-CA filed this action in the Court of Federal Claims, requesting a declaratory judgment that the language in the pertinent Appropriations Acts did not authorize the FAA to deny Sunday premium pay to the air traffic con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>traders. The arbitrator stayed the arbitration pending a decision from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">The Court of Federal Claims dismissed the complaint on the ground that it was not authorized to grant equitable relief in a case, such as this one, in which the claim for monetary relief was not before the court but was pending in another forum. NATCA appealed to this court, arguing that the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, authorizes the Court of Federal Claims to grant injunctive or declaratory relief in a case involving a request for monetary relief, even though the underlying claim for monetary relief is not before the court, but is legally committed to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Although the issue in this case is technically one of first impression, the outcome is governed by well-established principles. The Tucker Act defines the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims and grants that court jurisdiction to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-7\">render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a). That statutory language has been interpreted to require that a plaintiff seeking to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction must present a claim for \u201cactual, presently due money damages from the United States.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>395 U.S. 1, 3, 89 S.Ct. 1501, 23 L.Ed.2d 52 (1969). Although the Tucker Act has been amended to permit the Court of Federal Claims to grant equitable relief ancillary to claims for monetary relief over which it has jurisdiction, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1491(a)(2), (b)(2), there is no provision giving the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to grant equitable relief when it is unrelated to a claim for monetary relief pending before the court. <em>See Katz v. Cisneros, </em>16 F.3d 1204, 1208 (Fed.Cir.1994). It is not enough that the court\u2019s decision may affect the disposition of a monetary claim pending elsewhere, or that the court\u2019s decision will ultimately enable the plaintiff to receive money from the government. <em>See King, </em>395 U.S. at 4, 89 S.Ct. 1501 (\u201ccases seeking relief other than money damages from the Court of Claims have never been \u2018within its jurisdiction\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">The basic rule that the Supreme Court announced in <em>King </em>is still in effect and has not been changed by subsequent legislation. <em>See New York Life Ins. Co. v. United States, </em>118 F.3d 1553, 1556 (Fed.Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 118 S.Ct. 1559, 140 L.Ed.2d 792 (1998), <em>quoting from, Eastport SS. Corp. v. United States, </em>178 Ct.Cl. 599, 372 F.2d 1002, 1007 (Ct.Cl.1967) (\u201c[I]t is not every claim involving or invoking the Constitution, a federal statute, or a regulation which is cognizable here. The claim must, of course, be for money.\u201d); <em>Overall Roofing &amp; Constr. Inc. v. United States, </em>929 F.2d 687, 689 (Fed.Cir.1991) (\u201c[T]he word \u2018claim\u2019 [in the Tucker Act] carnes with it the historical limitation that it must assert a right to presently due money.\u201d). Although, as noted, Congress has authorized the Court of Federal Claims to grant equitable relief in certain limited circumstances, those circumstances do not include the general authority to grant equitable relief whenever a declaratory judgment or an injunction would assist a claimant in obtaining monetary benefits in another forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">NATCA argues that the distinction between this case and <em>Armitage, </em>in which the Court of Federal Claims adjudicated a claim for Sunday premium pay by federal police officers, is \u201ca purely procedural one.\u201d That is, the collective bargaining agreement in this case requires the claim for premium pay to be submitted to arbitration and not brought in the Court of Federal Claims, <em>see Carter v. Gibbs, </em>909 F.2d 1452 (Fed.Cir.1990), while in <em>Armitage </em>the claim for monetary damages could properly be brought before the Court of Federal Claims. The distinction between the two cases may indeed be \u201cprocedural,\u201d but it is important. The Court of Federal Claims has never been granted general authority to issue declaratory judgments, and to hold that the Court of Federal Claims may issue a declaratory judgment in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>unrelated to any money claim pending before it, would effectively override Congress\u2019s decision not to make the Declaratory Judgment Act applicable to the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">None of the authorities on which NATCA relies are to the contrary. NATCA relies heavily on the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc. v. United States, </em>901 F.2d 1530 (10th Cir.1990), but that case provides no support for its argument. In <em>Eagle-Picker, </em>the plaintiff sought equitable relief in a district court, and the government argued that the case should have been brought as a suit for money damages in the Claims Court. The court of appeals stated that a party \u2018\u201cmay not circumvent the Claims Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction by framing a complaint in the district court as one seeking injunctive, declaratory, or mandatory relief where the thrust of the suit is to obtain money from the United States.\u2019 \u201d 901 F.2d at 1532 (citation omitted). Thus, the court noted, the \u201ctest for determining if a case belongs in the Claims Court is whether or not \u2018the \u201cprime objective\u201d or \u201cessential purpose\u201d of the complaining party is to obtain money from the federal government.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The language used by the court in <em>Eagle-Picker </em>describes the test for determining whether a plaintiff may bring an action for equitable relief in district court rather than being required to litigate his underlying claim in the Court of Federal Claims. But it does not by any means suggest that the Court of Federal Claims may assume jurisdiction of a case in which the plaintiff is not seeking money damages in that court. The same distinction applies to the language from the district court\u2019s opinion in <em>Saraco v. Hallett, </em>831 F.Supp. 1154, 1165 (E.D.Pa.1993), <em>aff'd, </em>61 F.3d 863 (Fed.Cir.1995), upon which NATCA also relies. Finally, NATCA cites several cases in which district courts have granted declaratory relief on a legal issue relating to an underlying dispute that was pending before an arbitrator, but those cases are inapposite, since they are based on the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, which is not applicable to the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">In sum, NATCA has asked the Court of Federal Claims for a declaratory judgment and an injunction, not for monetary relief, and in the circumstances of this case the Court of Federal Claims has no jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
