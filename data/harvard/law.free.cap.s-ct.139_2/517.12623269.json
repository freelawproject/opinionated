The question in this case is whether the statutory scheme limits the aggregate amount of fees for both stages of representation to 25% of the claimant's past-due benefits. Because \u00a7 406(b) by its terms imposes a 25% cap on fees only for representation before a court, and \u00a7 406(a) has separate caps on fees for representation before the agency, we hold that the statute does not impose a 25% cap on aggregate fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Title II of the Social Security Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20Stat.%20622\">\n    49 Stat. 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20401\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .,\"is an insurance program\" that \"provides old-age, survivor, and disability\n   benefits to insured individuals irrespective of financial need.\"\n   <em>\n    Bowen v.

Here, the only form of representation \"already described\" in \u00a7 406(b) is \"represent[ation] before the court by an attorney.\" Accordingly, the 25% cap applies only to fees for representation before the court, not the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This interpretation is supported by \"the structure of the statute and its other provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Maracich v.

As an initial matter, subsections (a) and (b) address different stages of the representation. Section 406(a) addresses fees for representation \"before the Commissioner,\" whereas \u00a7 406(b) addresses fees for representation in court. Because some claimants will prevail before the agency and have no need to bring a court action, it is unsurprising that the statute contemplates separate fees for each stage of representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   These subsections also calculate fees differently. Section 406(b) applies a flat 25% cap on fees for court representation. By contrast, \u00a7 406(a) provides two ways to determine fees for agency proceedings. Subsection (a)(2) caps fees based on a fee agreement at the lesser of 25% of past-due benefits or $6,000.\n   <em>\n    Supra,\n   </em>\n   at 520. If there is no fee agreement, the agency may set any fee, including a fee greater than 25% of past-due benefits, so long as the fee is \"reasonable.\" \u00a7 406(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Given this statutory structure, applying \u00a7 406(b)'s 25% cap on court-stage fees to \u00a7 406(a) agency-stage fees, or the aggregate of \u00a7\u00a7 406(a) and (b) fees, would make little sense. Many claimants will never litigate in court, yet under the aggregate reading, agency fees would be capped at 25% based on a provision related exclusively to representation in court. Absent a fee agreement, \u00a7 406(a)(1) subjects agency fees only to a reasonableness limitation, so applying \u00a7 406(b)'s cap to such fees would add a limitation that Congress did not include in the relevant provision of the statute. If Congress had wanted these fees to be capped at 25%, it presumably would have said so directly in subsection (a), instead of providing for a \"reasonable fee\" in that subsection and adding a 25% cap in \u00a7 406(b) without even referencing subsection (a). Thus, the structure of the statute confirms that \u00a7 406(b) caps only court representation fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   Amy Weil agrees that \" \u00a7 406(a) and \u00a7 406(b) provide separate avenues for an award of attorney's fees for representation of a Social Security claimant,\" but emphasizes that \"these fees are certified for payment out of a single source: the 25% of past-due benefits withheld by the Commissioner.\" Brief for Court-Appointed\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   10. According to\n   <em>\n    Amicus,\n   </em>\n   \"[b]ecause the Commissioner withholds only one pool of 25% of past-due benefits from which to pay attorney's fees for both agency and court representation, for an attorney to collect a fee that exceeds the 25% pool of withheld\n   disability benefits,\" the attorney may \"need to file a lawsuit against his disabled client\" to collect the difference.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 23-24. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   urges, \"[w]hen the statute is read as a whole,\" \"it is evident that Congress placed a cumulative 25% cap on attorney's fees payable for successful representation of a Social Security claimant before both the agency and the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   is quite right that presently the agency withholds a single pool of 25% of past-due benefits for direct payment of agency and court fees.

And\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   sensibly argues that if there is only a single 25% pool for direct payment of fees, Congress might not have intended aggregate fees higher than 25%. This argument is plausible, but the statutory text in fact provides for two pools of money for direct payment of fees. Any shortage of withheld benefits for direct payment of fees is thus due to agency policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under \u00a7 406(a)(4), the agency \"shall\" certify for direct payment of agency representation fees \"an amount equal to so much of the maximum fee as does not exceed 25 percent of\" past-due benefits. In other words, this subsection requires that the agency withhold the approved fees for work performed in agency proceedings, up to 25% of the amount of the claimant's past-due benefits. But this is not the only subsection that enables the agency to withhold past-due benefits for direct payment of fees. Section 406(b)(1)(A) provides that the agency \"may\" certify past-due benefits for direct payment of court representation fees. As the Government explains, the agency has nevertheless \"exercised its discretion ... to withhold a total of 25% of past-due benefits for direct payment of the approved agency\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   court fees.\" Reply Brief for Respondent 8 (emphasis added). The agency's choice to withhold only one pool of 25% of past-due benefits does not alter the statutory text, which differentiates between agency representation in \u00a7 406(a) and court representation in \u00a7 406(b), contains separate caps on fees for each type of representation, and authorizes two pools of withheld benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   More fundamentally, the amount of past-due benefits that the agency can withhold for direct payment does not delimit the amount of fees that can be approved for representation before the agency or the court. The attorney might receive a direct payment out of past-due benefits, but that payment could be less than the fees to which the attorney is entitled. Indeed, prior to 1968, the statute allowed fees for agency representation but lacked a provision for direct payment of such fees from past-due benefits. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 520. And under the current \u00a7\u00a7 406(a)(1) and (4), the agency can award a \"reasonable fee\" that exceeds the 25% of past-due benefits it can withhold for direct payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In short, despite the force of\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   ' arguments, the statute does not bear her reading. Any concerns about a shortage of withheld benefits for direct payment and the consequences of such a shortage are best addressed to the agency, Congress, or the attorney's good judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because the 25% cap in \u00a7 406(b)(1)(A) applies only to fees for court representation, and not to the aggregate fees awarded under \u00a7\u00a7 406(a) and (b), the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the\n   case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    It is so ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.
