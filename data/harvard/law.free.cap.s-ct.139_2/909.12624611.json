As part of that program, Morris County also distributes funds to help preserve\n   <em>\n    religious\n   </em>\n   buildings such as synagogues, temples, churches, and mosques. But it turns out that New Jersey law, as recently interpreted by the New Jersey Supreme Court, prohibits Morris County from awarding grants to preserve religious buildings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The petitioners here argue that the State's exclusion of religious buildings-because they are religious-from Morris County's historic preservation program constitutes unconstitutional discrimination against religion in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that the State's discrimination did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In my view, the decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court is in serious tension with this Court's religious equality precedents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As this Court has repeatedly held, governmental discrimination against religion-in particular, discrimination against religious persons, religious organizations, and religious speech-violates the Free Exercise Clause and the Equal Protection Clause. In the words of Justice Brennan, the \"government may not use religion as a basis of classification for the imposition of duties, penalties, privileges or benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    McDaniel v.

Under the Court's precedents, both of those categories of cases can pose difficult questions.

But at this point and in this case, it is appropriate to deny certiorari, for two main reasons. First, the factual details of the Morris County program are not entirely clear. In particular, it is not evident precisely what kinds of buildings can be funded under the Morris County program. That factual uncertainty about the scope of the program could hamper our analysis of petitioners' religious discrimination claim. Second, this Court decided\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   only recently, and there is not yet a robust post-\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   body of case law in the lower courts on the question whether governments may exclude religious organizations from general historic preservation grants programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For those reasons, denial of certiorari is appropriate. As always, a denial of certiorari does not imply agreement or disagreement with the decision of the relevant federal court of appeals or state supreme court. In my view, prohibiting historic preservation grants to religious organizations simply because the organizations are religious would raise serious questions under this Court's precedents and the Constitution's fundamental guarantee of equality.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
