Lance's counsel bore responsibility for the one-sidedness of the sentencing proceedings; he inexcusably failed even to look into, much less to put on, a case for sparing Lance's life. And we have since learned that Lance suffers from significant cognitive impairments that the jury could have weighed in assessing his moral culpability. In other words, there is a meaningful case to be made for sparing Lance's life, but-because he lacked access to constitutionally adequate counsel-he has never had a chance to present it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The Georgia Supreme Court concluded that this state of affairs was constitutionally tolerable because, in its view, Lance's untold story stood no chance of persuading even a single juror to favor life without parole over a death sentence. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that its conclusion was not unreasonable. I cannot agree. Our precedents clearly establish that Lance was prejudiced by his inability to inform the jury about his impairments. I therefore would grant Lance's petition for review and summarily reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of Lance's crimes-murdering his ex-wife, Sabrina \"Joy\" Lance, and her boyfriend, Dwight \"Butch\" Wood, Jr., in 1997-admittedly inspire little sympathy. Lance went to Butch's home, kicked in the front door, shot Butch with a shotgun, then bludgeoned Joy to death with the gun. According to a fellow inmate, he later bragged about the killings. Lance also had an extensive prior history of domestic violence against Joy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Due to his counsel's ineffectiveness, however, those facts were all the jurors ever learned about Lance; they heard no evidence why his life was worth sparing. Lance was represented during both the guilt and penalty phases of his trial by a solo practitioner who became convinced of Lance's innocence-and his own ability to prove it-early in the representation. He thus prepared exclusively for the guilt-or-innocence phase of the trial. Counsel did not even broach the subject of possible penalty-phase evidence with Lance or his family, because he did not want them \"thinking that [he] might be thinking in terms of losing the case.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 232. So when the jury found Lance guilty and the question became whether Lance should be put to death,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lance's counsel had no evidence whatsoever to present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State did. It called six witnesses, including the victims' relatives, to explain why Lance deserved to die. The State's closing argument emphasized Lance's history of violence against Joy, the brutality of her killing, and Lance's apparent lack of remorse. The State urged the jury to perceive Lance as \" 'cold and calculating' \" and repeatedly asked \" 'what kind of person' \" would do these things. 1 App. in No. 16-15008 (CA11), pt. 1, pp. 68, 75, 77. Lance's counsel, by contrast, made no opening statement and presented no mitigating evidence. By his own admission, he \"had nothing to put on.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 273. His closing argument merely urged the jury to consider Lance's family and to resist the temptation to exact vengeance. About Lance, counsel said only that he was \" 'kind of a quiet person and a country boy' \" who \" 'doesn't talk a lot.' \" 1 App. in No. 16-15008, pt. 1, at 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The jury sentenced Lance to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2003, Lance filed a petition for postconviction relief in state court, asserting\n   that his trial counsel's failure to investigate or present any mitigating evidence was ineffective assistance of counsel. Essentially, he argued that there was a meaningful case to be made for sparing his life, and that his counsel had forfeited his chance to do so through inattention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The evidence showed that counsel could have found possible cognitive problems had he looked into Lance's personal history. That history included repeated serious head traumas caused by multiple car crashes, alcoholism, and-most seriously-Lance's once being shot in the head by unknown assailants while lying on his couch.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the aftermath of the shooting, Lance had \"terrible headaches,\" \"dizziness,\" \"difficulty working,\" and \"became even more quiet than he had before.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 171-172. The court found that any reasonable defense attorney would have had Lance's mental health evaluated and, in so doing, uncovered \"significant mitigating evidence for the jury to consider.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 174.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Four mental health professionals testified at an evidentiary hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   They agreed on many points. First, Lance had permanent damage to his brain's frontal lobe. Second, his IQ placed him in the borderline range for intellectual disability. Third, his symptoms warranted a diagnosis of clinical dementia. The experts differed somewhat, however, over the extent and practical consequences of Lance's brain damage. Primarily, the experts seemed to disagree about the extent to which Lance's brain damage affected his impulse control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Superior Court granted Lance's habeas petition and vacated his death sentence, holding that trial counsel's failure to investigate and present evidence of Lance's mental condition was deficient performance, and that his failure prejudiced Lance. The missing evidence could have prompted a different sentence, the court explained, because it went directly to the key issue before the jury: the assessment of Lance's character, culpability, and worth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Georgia Supreme Court, however, reversed and reinstated Lance's death sentence.\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

It agreed that counsel's performance was deficient but held that Lance suffered no prejudice. As relevant here, it held that even if the jury had considered at trial all the neuropsychological evidence adduced at the postconviction hearing, there was no reasonable probability that Lance's sentence would have\n   changed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Georgia Supreme Court's view, the new evidence was only \"somewhat mitigating\" because it showed only \"subtle neurological impairments,\" which would necessarily have been outweighed by Lance's prior threats and violence toward the victims, the nature of the crime, and Lance's statements and demeanor in its aftermath.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12163131\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/286/365/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12163131\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/286/365/\">\n    at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12163131\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/286/365/\">\n    687 S.E.2d, at 815-816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Lance sought a federal writ of habeas corpus.

That is plainly correct. Counsel in a death penalty case has an obligation at the very least to consider possible penalty-phase defenses.

Lance's unintroduced case for leniency, even if not airtight, \"adds up to a mitigation case that bears no relation to the few naked pleas for mercy actually put before the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Rompilla,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209271\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/374/#p381\">\n    545 U.S., at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209271\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/374/#p381\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p397\">\n    529 U.S., at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p397\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our precedents thus clearly establish Lance's right to a new sentencing at which a jury can, for the first time, weigh the evidence both for and against death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Georgia Supreme Court reached its contrary conclusion only by unreasonably disregarding or minimizing Lance's evidence.

It failed, however, to allow for the possibility that the jury might credit that evidence.

With regard to Lance's frontal lobe damage, the Georgia Supreme Court appears to have credited the testimony of the State's expert over Lance's experts' testimony, treating as definitive Martell's assertion that \"Lance's symptoms were so subtle that a typical court-ordered evaluation might not have given any indication of problems.\"\n   <em>\n    Lance,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12163131\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/286/365/\">\n    286 Ga., at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12163131\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/286/365/\">\n    687 S.E.2d, at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   815 ; see also\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 373,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12163131\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/286/365/\">\n    687 S.E.2d, at 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The mental impairment evidence reasonably could have affected at least one juror's assessment of whether Lance deserved to die for his crimes, and Lance should have been given a chance to make the case for his life.
