This device is made of colorless, translucent plastic with hooks attached. In use, the head of a minnow or herring is placed in a cavity in the device and fastened by means of a pin inserted through the bait fish\u2019s head. The hooks of the Herring Magic are secured to the dead body of the bait fish by means of a body clamp in order to keep the hooks close to the underpart of the body of the bait fish at all times. When being trolled through the water, the Herring Magic, with its attached herring or minnow, provides whatever luring characteristics a dead bait fish might have plus produc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>ing a swimming action claimed to be identical to that of a live herring, a result caused by the hydrofoil of the Herring Magic. The device itself has no scent, does not resemble any natural food of game fish, and in trolling use is practically invisible. When used without a minnow or similar balancing weight, the Herring Magic tumbles erratically and tends to foul the line of the fisherman using it and thus has no practical value without the additional use of a small fish as bait.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The sole question presented to this Court is whether this patented device manufactured and sold by appellant is an \u201cartificial lure\u201d within the purview of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4161.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We believe that appellant\u2019s product is such an \u201cartificial lure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Because the statute sets out no definition of \u201cartificial lure\u201d those words must be accepted in their ordinary and everyday meaning. The word \u201cartificial\u201d is defined as an adjective meaning:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq0\">\u201c1. a. Made or contrived by art; produced or modified by human skill and labor, often as an imitation of something found in nature; \u2014 op- posed to <em>natural; </em>as, <em>artificial </em>heat . or light, * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">From this definition and the ones which follow it in the same authority, it is apparent that the emphasis of the definition must be placed upon the \u201chuman skill and labor\u201d element and the \u201copposed to natural.\u201d There thus can be no doubt that the plastic and steel device called Herring Magic, here under scrutiny, is \u201cartificial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">It is appellant\u2019s contention, however, that Herring Magic is not a \u201clure\u201d because the device in and of itself has little or no alluring qualities for game fish. We cannot agree with appellant\u2019s conclusion. The device is designed to produce a certain motion or action under proper conditions and it is this motion or action which makes Herring Magic a saleable product. It is believed that the fish-like actions which it (Herring Magic) produces in the inanimate fish bait gives the entire setup (Herring Magic with minnow) an added allurement to game fish which the dead minnow alone does not have. This added luring power is produced by appellant\u2019s device.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">An expert witness for appellee testified that Herring Magic is not necessarily limited to use with a fish as bait, but will give the aforementioned luring motion or action to any other object of a similar size, weight and shape. Testimony on both sides indicated that this motion or action attracted game fish.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">One of the definitions Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition (unabridged) gives for the noun \u201clure\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-14\">\u201c2. That which invites by the prospect of advantage or pleasure; an allurement; enticement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">It is apparent from the discussion above that appellant\u2019s product \u201cinvites by the prospect of advantage\u201d the game fish it is designed to aid in catching through the imparting of fish-like motion to objects attached to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">It should further be noted that the record indicates that among sport fishermen objects such as Herring Magic are thought of as \u201cartificial lures.\u201d Appel-lee\u2019s expert witness, Mr. Korff, a manufacturer of fishing tackle and sport fisherman of long experience, identified Herring Magic as an \u201cartificial lure,\u201d and appellant in its advertising designated the device on several occasions as a \u201clure.\u201d Mr. Miller, the inventor of Herring Magic, also identified it in his patent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>application as a \u201cfish lure\u201d and a \u201cfishing lure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AeP\">We think that the Herring Magic device manufactured by appellant is an \u201cartificial lure\u201d and as such comes within the orbit of the taxing statute here involved. It was, therefore, properly taxable and the judgment of the lower court must be and is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4161 (I.R.C. of 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">\u201cThere is hereby imposed upon the sale by the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the following articles (including in each case parts or accessories of such articles sold on or in connection therewith, or with the sale thereof) a tax equivalent to 10 percent of the price for which so sold:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-18\"># * # \u00ed\u00a1\u00ed <em>%</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-19\">\u201cFishing rods, creels, reels and artificial lures, baits and flies. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-20\">.
