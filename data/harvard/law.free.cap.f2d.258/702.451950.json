Patterson is the administrator of one, Doody, who was killed while employed as a machinist on a ship owned and operated by the War Shipping Administration although he was not employed \u201cthrough\u201d that Administration, and was not therefore covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>by the \u201cClarification Act\u201d of 1943 (50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 1291). It is to be assumed that Doody met his death because of the unseaworthiness of the ship, or the negligence of those in charge of her, and that his administrator could recover, if the claim arose under the Suits in Admiralty Act (46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 741). Sullivan, Hays and Duncan were all civil service seamen, employed as such upon \u201cmerchant vessels,\u201d publicly owned and operated ships of the United States. They too sued for injuries suffered under circumstances that would have entitled them to a recovery, had they been individually employed \u201cthrough\u201d the War Shipping Administration. All were entitled to compensation under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 751 et seq.) and the question in all the suits is whether that was their exclusive remedy, or whether the Suits in Admiralty Act (46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 741 et seq.) was also open to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In Johansen v. United States, 343 U.S. 427, 72 S.Ct. 849, 96 L.Ed. 1051, the Supreme Court held that a person injured on board a \u201cPublic Vessel\u201d owned and operated by the United States might not recover under the Public Vessels Act (46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 781 et seq.), his only recourse being under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act. The only question before us is therefore whether the same reasoning applies to suits under the Suits in Admiralty Act. In Johansen\u2019s case the vessel wras a troop transport, and could not be regarded as in any sense a \u201cmerchant vessel\u201d; in the case at bar the opposite was true, as we have already said. Save for one consideration that we shall mention in a moment, it might be hard to understand why the language of the Suits in Admiralty Act should not apply: \u201cIn cases where if such vessel were * * * privately owned and possessed, * * * a libel in personam may be brought -* * * provided that such vessel is employed as a merchant vessel.\u201d (46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 742.) Indeed such a conclusion would be reinforced by the preceding section (\u00a7 741) that forbids the creation of maritime liens on \u201cmerchant vessels\u201d of the United States such as would arise if the \u201cmerchant vessel\u201d were privately owned. On the other hand, if the proper purport of \u00a7 742 was generally to assimilate claims against the United States for injuries arising on its \u201cmerchant vessels\u201d to those arising in the case of privately owned ships, the \u201cClarification Act\u201d of 1943 was unnecessary which limited the same relief to \u201cseamen\u201d \u201cemployed on United States * * '* vessels * * * through the War Shipping Administration.\u201d The Fourth Circuit in United States v. Marine, 155 F.2d 456, had held that the Suits in Admiralty Act did apply, although the libel-lant was not employed \u201cthrough the War Shipping Administration\u201d; and, as a new question, it might have been held that the grant of a claim by the Clarification Act of 1943 did not inevitably presuppose that such claims had not been already covered by the Suits in Admiralty Act. However, the Supreme Court in Johansen v. United States, supra (343 U.S. at page 439, 72 S.Ct. at page 856), specifically declared that United States v. Marine, supra, was not rightly decided and made no distinction between it and a libel under the \u201cPublic Vessels Act.\u201d Moreover, the Eighth Circuit in Inland Waterways Corporation v. Doyle, 204 F.2d 874, at page 878, although it did distinguish between \u201cpublic vessels\u201d and \u201cmerchant vessels,\u201d declared: \u201cWe have no hesitation in saying that we can conceive of no sound reason for making a distinction with respect to remedies between civilian seamen employed by the United States on its \u2018public vessels.\u2019 \u201d It appears not to have observed the disapproval of United States v. Marine, supra, 155 F.2d 456 that we have just mentioned. We feel bound to hold that the Court did not mean to recognize any such distinction which we too think is not \u201csound.\u201d As <em>res integra, </em>there was indeed more reason for reading broadly the \u201cPublic Vessels Act\u201d (46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 781) than the \u201cSuits in Admiralty Act\u201d (46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 742) because the \u201cPublic Vessels Act,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>is not subject to the implication arising from the express grant of relief to employees of the War Shipping Board, that is relevant in the interpretation of the \u201cSuits in Admiralty Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">As for the Clarification Act of 1949 (63 St.L. 854), it is altogether \u25a0clear that the subsection b of \u00a7 201 and \u00a7 305(b), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 757, 791-4(b) were not intended to do more than leave untouched the rights of seamen as they already were (Johansen v. United States, supra, 343 U.S. at pages 436-438, 72 S.Ct. at pages 855-856).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The decrees are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
