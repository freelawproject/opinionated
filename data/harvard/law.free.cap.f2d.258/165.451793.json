On direct appeal we affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> About three years later, appellant filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his sentence, alleging denial of a fair trial by misconduct of a juror \u2014 described now by his counsel as the juror\u2019s failure to live up to a promise to be \u201csympathetic\u201d to appellant. The District Court denied his motion and on appeal from that denial we dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-18\">In December 1957, appellant again filed a motion under section 2255, alleging a number of violations of constitutional rights; some new, and some previously raised on the direct appeal. The District Court denied relief without a hearing, on the ground that the motion was a second or successive motion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and alternatively, that the files and records conclusively showed that appellant was entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-19\"> Where there has been a previous appeal or a previous 2255 motion, the District Judge has discretion to deny relief as to those allegations which could have been, but were not, raised in the earlier proceeding, <em>unless </em>the petitioner has \u201csome justifiable reason he was previously unable to assert his rights,\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>unless he was \u201cunaware of the significance of relevant facts.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Absent some allegation or evidence as to what is the \u201cjustifiable reason\u201d or \u201cunawareness,\u201d the District Court is under no duty to grant a hearing on what appear on the face of the petition to be old claims; indeed without such allegations the District Judge cannot even be aware of a possible basis for exercising his discretion to grant a hearing, applying the standards of Price v. Johnston, supra note 4. Here those of appellant\u2019s allegations reviewable on a \u00a7 2255 motion could readily have been raised on the first \u00a7 2255 motion, and of course all of the allegations could have been raised on the direct appeal. No indication of any \u201cjustifiable reason\u201d or \u201cunawareness\u201d is apparent or alleged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hence, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing relief<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on the grounds this was a second or successive motion for similar relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-10\">.
