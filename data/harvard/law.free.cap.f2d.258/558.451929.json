In connection with his deportation proceedings appellant applied for suspension of deportation under Title 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1254(a)(1). This application was denied by the Special Inquiry Officer and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the denial. The Board expressly approved the Special Inquiry Officer\u2019s denial stated to be \u201cbecause the respondent came into the United States on an allied merchant vessel during the war, left his ship and did not engage in seaman service during the remainder of hostilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The appellant sought review of the order denying suspension of deportation by complaint filed in the court below invoking the provisions of \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009). The district court denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">On this appeal from that decision appellant asserts that the action of the Board of Immigration Appeals was arbitrary and capricious and hence subject to review or correction in the district court. His argument is that the stated ground for denying suspension of deportation was arbitrary in that it purported to be based upon a rule that any merchant seaman who left an allied merchant vessel during the war and did not engage in seaman service must be denied suspension of deportation. Appellant relies upon Mastrapasqua v. Shaughnes-sy, 2 Cir., 180 F.2d 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">We find nothing in the record to warrant a conclusion that the action of the Board, or the reason given by it for denial of suspension of deportation was based upon an arbitrary determination that all persons in that category must be denied this relief. In the light of later decisions, we think the Mastrapasqua case is in any event of doubtful authority. See United States ex rel. Hintopoulos v. Shaughnessy, 2 Cir., 233 F.2d 705, affirmed 353 U.S. 72, 77 S.Ct. 618, 1 L.Ed. 2d 652; Jay v. Boyd, 351 U.S. 345, 76 S.Ct. 919, 100 L.Ed. 1242, and Wolf v. Boyd, 9 Cir., 238 F.2d 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">On the authority of the cases last cited, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
