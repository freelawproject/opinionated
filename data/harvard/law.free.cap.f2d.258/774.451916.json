This statute became effective as of July 18, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">\n<em>I. The Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Because of the language used in that statute, and particularly in its preamble, we quote the entire section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-10\">\u201c \u00a7 1407. Border crossings \u2014 \u25a0 narcotic addicts and violators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-12\">\u201c(a) In order further to give effect to the obligations of the United States pursuant to the Hague convention of 1912, proclaimed as a treaty on March 3, 1915 (38 Stat. 1912), and the limitation convention of 1931, proclaimed as a treaty on July 10, 1933 (48 Stat. 1571), and <em>in order to facilitate more effective control of the international traffic in narcotic drugs, </em>and to prevent the spread of drug addiction, no citizen of the United States who is addicted to or uses narcotic drugs, as defined in section 4731 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (except a person using such narcotic drugs as a result of sickness or accident or injury and to whom such narcotic drug is being furnished, prescribed, or administered in good faith by a duly licensed physician in attendance upon such person, in the course of his professional practice) or who has been convicted of a violation of any of the narcotic or marihuana laws of the United States, or of any State thereof, the penalty for which is imprisonment for more than one year, <em>shall depart from or enter into or attempt to depart from or enter into the United States, </em>unless such person registers, under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury with a customs official, agent, or employee at a point of entry or a border customs station. Unless otherwise prohibited by law or Federal regulation such customs official, agent, or employee shall issue a certificate to any such person departing from the United States; and such person shall, upon returning to the United States, surrender such certificate to the customs official, agent, or employee present at the port of entry or border customs station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-14\">\u201c(b) Whoever violates any of the provisions of this section shall be punished for each such violation by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not less than one nor more than three years, or both.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-15\">Appeals from the convictions below lie here. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-16\">\n<em>71. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-17\">It was stipulated in the lower court that Reyes, a citizen of the United States, pleaded guilty on June 4, 1943, to a charge of possession of marijuana then proscribed by \u00a7 11160 (now \u00a7 11500) of the Health and Safety Code of the State of California. Reyes was charged with a felony, but sentenced to only sixty days in the County Jail. Reyes, subsequent to the passage of \u00a7 1407 of Title 18, never registered as a narcotic violator, nor did he apply for the \u201cdeparture\u201d certificate mentioned in said section. No such certificate was issued. On the morning of March 4, 1957 Reyes left the United States for Mexico and returned, entering the United States on that date without registering or otherwise complying with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-18\">At the trial three questions were asked Reyes \u2014 as to his knowledge of the law; whether he had an intent to violate it; and, whether or not he had seen any signs at the border requiring him to register. The United States Attorney objected that knowledge and intent were immaterial. The objections were sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-19\">It was stipulated below that Perez, a United States citizen, did not at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>time register or apply for a \u201cdeparture\u201d certificate, nor was any certificate issued. There was no evidence of the date when Perez left this country, but it was stipulated that with respect to his entry to the United States on April 28, 1957, Immigration Inspector Maxon would testify Perez told him \u201che had been convicted for \u2018marks\u2019 (addiction) in Los Angeles in 1956;\u201d that he had used narcotics that day in Mexico; that Maxon saw numerous apparent needle scars on Perez\u2019 arm; that when examined by flashlight the pupils of Perez\u2019 eyes did not react naturally; that in Maxon\u2019s opinion Perez was then under the influence of narcotics. It was stipulated a doctor would have testified Perez was under the influence of narcotics the day of his entry; Perez would have testified he was illiterate, could not read or write, and had no knowledge of \u00a7 1407 and no intent to violate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">On such stipulated facts the district court judge found each appellant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">\n<em>III. The Assignments of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A0V\">As to each defendant, error is charged <em>\u2014first, </em>in the court\u2019s refusal to permit evidence of defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge of the statute and lack of intent to violate it; <em>second, </em>that the statute is unconstitutional because it is indefinite, arbitrary and capricious, and violates due process safeguards because (a) of its uncertainty, and (b) its restriction on a citizen\u2019s right to travel; and <em>third, </em>the statute is unconstitutional because it deprives affected persons of their privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">As to Reyes alone, it was additionally urged that his two months sentence was not a conviction of a violation of a narcotic law, \u201cthe penalty for which is imprisonment for more than one year,\u201d as the statute requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">\n<em>IV. The Reyes Conviction Was Within the Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">We first dispose of Reyes\u2019 individually claimed error. Former section 11160 of the California Health and Safety Code (now section 11500) made possession of marijuana a crime. Section 11712 of that same code made punishment for conviction of possession \u201cimprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year, or in the state prison for not more than 10 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">Thus the <em>penalty </em>for the crime of which Reyes was convicted was imprisonment for a period of time which could be either under or over one year. The court saw fit to fix the penalty as imprisonment for two months. It could have fixed the penalty as two years, or ten years. Either sentence could not have \u2019 been attacked by Reyes as unlawful. The length of sentence was within the discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-15\">Section 1407 does not say that the section applies only if \u201cthe penalty <em>imposed </em>is imprisonment for more than one year.\u201d It says if \u201cconvicted of a <em>violation </em>* * * the <em>penalty for which </em>is imprisonment for more than one year.\u201d At the time of Reyes\u2019 conviction, he had been convicted of a violation the penalty for which was imprisonment for more than one year. That the Superior Court judge, at the time of sentence, saw fit to give Reyes a lesser sentence did not affect the fact of his conviction of a crime, the-<em>penalty for which </em>was in excess of one year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-16\">This point was carefully considered in the able opinion rendered by United States District Judge Carter in United States v. Eramdjian, D.C.S.D.Cal., 1957, 155 F.Supp. 914, 931.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-17\">With his reasoning and conclusions we agree. Reyes was convicted of violation</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>of a narcotic law, the penalty for which was imprisonment for more than a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">V. <em>Constitutionality of the Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">We next consider the alleged error that the statute is unconstitutional because indefinite, arbitrary and capricious, because it violates due process in requiring one by registration to incriminate <em>himself, </em>and because it interferes with his right to travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">We are satisfied these arguments were adequately met and answered in the opinion in the Eramdjian case, to which we have heretofore referred. In disposing of these issues, we adopt such portion of that opinion as is quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>A proper consideration of the constitutional contentions focuses attention on the precise language of the indictments before us. In the Reyes indictment, No. 15756, the defendant is charged as a citizen and a convicted narcotic violator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>with returning to and entering the United States \u201cwithout registering with a customs official * * * and without surrendering the certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The Perez indictment, No. 15851, similarly charged, except that the defendant was brought within the statute by being identified as a citizen \u201cwho was then addicted to and used narcotic drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Considering what is charged in the indictments, a further portion of Judge Carter\u2019s opinion in Eramdjian is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">\u201cThus each indictment charges \u2018return to and enter into the United States * * * without registering * * * and without surrendering the certificate.\u2019 When read without considering the regulations describing the registration, it might appear that the \u2018registering\u2019 referred to registration when leaving the United States. But when the regulation is taken into account it is clear that the \u2018registering\u2019 referred to is that required on returning to the United States.\u201d 155 F.Supp. 923.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">Judge Carter then discusses the essentials of proof: (a) citizenship; (b) the defendant\u2019s return to and entering into the United States; (c) the lack of registration at the time of return and entry; (d) in violation cases, certified copies of a prior conviction; and in addiction and user cases, either admissions, evidence of present use, and/or expert testimony to support addiction or use. He concludes that the alleged incriminating registration slip is <em>not </em>used against the defendant \u2014 he is prosecuted for <em>not </em>registering and for <em>not </em>surrendering the certificate; he is not prosecuted for making the certificate or for any fact appearing therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-16\">The court continues in the Eramdjian case with a discussion of the alleged unconstitutionality of the statute. We adopt as our own that portion of the opinion now quoted in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>we concur in Judge Carter\u2019s conclusions. We find the law constitutional, as did he.</p>\n<p id=\"A07s\">We come now to the evidentiary questions \u2014 the court\u2019s refusal to permit evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>dence (a) of each defendant\u2019s lack of intent to violate the statute, and (b) of his lack of knowledge of its existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">\n<em>VI. Lack of Intent to Violate the Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Here we believe Morissette v. United States, 1952, 342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288; United States v. Behrman, 1922, 258 U.S. 280, 42 S.Ct. 303, 66 L.Ed. 619; United States v. Balint, 1922, 258 U.S. 250, 42 S.Ct. 301, 66 L.Ed. 604, are controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-18\">As Judge Carter points out in Eramd-jian (155 F.Supp. at pages 924-925) we start with the proposition that the statute does not by its term require a wilful violation of the statute; that the statute creates a crime <em>mala prohibita, </em>and not <em>malum in se, </em>and hence is the type of legislative enactment described in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Morissette case as that \u201c \u2018now familiar type of legislation whereby penalties serve as effective means of regulation\u2019,\u201d which \u201c \u2018dispenses with the conventional requirement for criminal conduct\u2014 awareness of some wrongdoing. In the interest of the larger good it puts the burden of acting at hazard upon a person otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public danger.\u2019 \u201d 342 U.S. at pages 259-260, 72 S.Ct. at page 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In Morissette, the Supreme Court pointed out that such a view of the law, enunciated in the Behrman and Balint cases and in United States v. Dotter-weich, 1943, 320 U.S. 277, 280, 281, 64 S.Ct. 134, 88 L.Ed. 48, causes hardship\u2014 \u201c \u2018Hardship there doubtless may be under a statute which thus penalizes the transaction though consciousness of wrongdoing be totally wanting.\u2019 \u201d 342 U.S. at page 260, 72 S.Ct. at page 248. Yet when dealing with narcotics and their regulation and control (as did Behrman and Balint, and as does \u00a7 1407 here), the same \u201clarger good\u201d found sufficient by the Supreme Court must be here considered paramount.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-21\">\n<em>VII. Lack of Knowledge of the Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b831-22\">This alleged erroneous ruling was not before the court in the Eramdjian case, but is before us now because of the recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Lambert v. United States, 1957, 355 U.S. 225, 78 S.Ct. 240, 2 L.Ed.2d 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-23\">The Lambert case dealt with a Municipal Ordinance of the City of Los Angeles which (a) defined a \u201cconvicted person\u201d as one \u201cconvicted of an offense punishable as a felony in the State of California,\u201d or one convicted elsewhere of an offense which \u201cif committed in the State of California, would have been punished as a felony,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (b) required any such \u201cconvicted person\u201d to register with the Chief of Police if he was to be or remain in the City of Los Angeles more than five days.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By its terms, no element of wilfulness was included in the ordinance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>The Supreme Court assumed Mrs. Lambert had no knowledge of its existence. She had been convicted of forgery seven years before her arrest for failing to register. Forgery is a felony in California. Mrs. Lambert never registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The majority opinion in Lambert lays down no rule that intent is essential in every crime. It recognizes the authority of legislative bodies \u201cto declare an offense and to exclude elements of knowledge and diligence from its definition.\u201d But it points out and largely relies on the fact that the conduct of Mrs. Lambert was without knowledge of the law; hence without intent; and \u201cis wholly passive \u2014 mere failure to register. * * * Violation of its (the ordinance\u2019s) provisions is unaccompanied by any activity whatever, mere presence in the city being the test. Moreover, circumstances which might move one to inquire as to the necessity of registration are completely lacking.\u201d 355 U.S. at pages 228, 229, 78 S.Ct. at page 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">And Mr. Justice Douglas, in speaking for the majority, states that the Lambert conviction rested on facts, <em>\u201cunlike </em>the commission of acts, or the failure to act under circumstances that should alert the doer to the consequences of his deed,\u201d 355 U.S. at page 228, 78 S.Ct. at page 242, citing Beliht, supra, and Dotter-weich, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The question in the Lambert case was \u201cwhether <em>a registration act of this character </em>violates Due Process where it is applied to a person who has no actual knowledge of his duty to register, and where no showing is made of the probability of such knowledge.\u201d 355 U.S. at page 227, 78 S.Ct. at page 242. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">We readily distinguish the Lambert case and hold it not applicable to the registration provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407 for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\"><em>First: </em>Here there was no mere non-feasance on the part of Reyes and Perez \u2014there was misfeasance. They crossed the border (ordinarily lawful) in an unlawful manner (without registering).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\"><em>Second: </em>If the failure to register could be considered a mere failure to act, unaccompanied by and unrelated to the positive act of leaving the country and returning across the border, yet such failure plus the planned departure is \u201cunder circumstances that should alert the doer to the consequence of his deed.\u201d Crossing the border into a foreign country is a lawful act, but it is rarely a totally unrestricted act. It is a comparatively uncommon act for a great majority of citizens, even those residing in the near vicinity of our borders. Certainly it is uncommon in comparison to Mrs. Lambert\u2019s act \u2014 that of living in the community of Los Angeles. A border crossing seems sufficient in itself to put a person on notice or inquiry to determine if he is required by law to do anything when he proposes to, or prior to the time he does, so depart from the United States. And we would be blind to the realities of life were we not to realize that such inquiry would particularly be the responsibility of narcotic violators, addicts and users as they cross into Mexico, for they know better than anyone else, save law enforcement officers, that that country is the primary source to the rest of the North American Continent of the forbidden heroin and marijuana. We believe the act, after conviction or addiction, of crossing into Mexico and attempting to return \u201calerts the doer\u201d and is attended by circumstances which \u201cmove one to inquire as to the necessity of registration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\"> <em>Third: </em>The statute under consideration here, unlike that in the Lambert case, is not a mere convenient aid to police departments\u2019 bookkeeping, enabling the officers to keep an eye on likely criminals. The preamble to section 1407 indicates the intent of Congress to curb the importation of narcotics. This Court has taken <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and will again take judicial notice (as did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>court below <footnotemark>8</footnotemark>) of the great public danger that there will be attempts to smuggle such drugs into the country every time an addict or user crosses the boundary line. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The purpose of the statute is not to keep track of potential narcotic law violators and obtain convictions \u2014 its primary purpose, as expressed in its preamble and from a logical consideration of the problem, is to reduce and control the amount of illegal narcotics crossing the border by checking carefully the person and possessions of those most likely to be importing the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Whether or not Mr. Justice Frankfurter is correct in his estimate of Lambert as <em>\u201ca </em>derelict on the waters of the law,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> defining police power, does not here concern us. We hold the holding of the majority in Lambert inapplicable, both on its facts and its reasoning, to the statute involved in the instant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-8\">. Cf. Jones v. Rhay, 9 Cir., 1958, 254 F. 2d 393; Daloia v. Rhay, 9 Cir., 1958, 252 F.2d 768.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-10\">. We borrow from that opinion its conclusion on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-18\">\u201cThe question hinges on the meaning of the words in Sec. 1407, \u2018the penalty for which is imprisonment for more than one year.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-19\">\u201cWe hold it refers to the penalty which was provided for by the State statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>i. e. what was the <em>penalty </em>provided in such statute which could have been invoked, and not the actual <em>punishment </em>imposed in the particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-7\">\u201cThe Congress of the United States, without doubt, was familiar with the federal rule as to what constitutes a felony or misdemeanor conviction and that such determination is made by reason of the penalties provided in a statute \u2014 i. e. what penalty could have been invoked, and not the punishment actually imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-8\">\u201cMoreover, the clear meaning of the word \u2018penalty\u2019 refers to the provisions of the statute generally and not to the \u2018punishment\u2019 imposed in the particular case. Had Congress intended otherwise, it could easily have so stated. It did not.\u201d Ibid.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b826-9\">. \u201cThe court takes judicial notice of the great numbers of persons intercepted upon entering the United States at points of entry and particularly at San Xsidro, within this District, carrying quantities of narcotics and marihuana; of the number of criminal cases in the courts of the United States and in the southern division of the southern district of California, concerning narcotics and marihuana; of the large number of such persons who, prior to arrest, were either addicted to the use of narcotics, or were prior users of marihuana or had been previously convicted in state or federal courts of violation of narcotic or marihuana laws; that such classes of persons are prone to engage in illicit traffic in drugs; that one of the most disruptive factors in the effective control of the traffic in narcotics and marihuana is the smuggling of such substance across the international boundary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-10\">\u201cIt is a fair and logical conclusion from such facts, that special attention, scrutiny, registration and recording of such classes of persons most prone to smuggle such drugs into the United States, to be made upon the occasion of their leaving the United States and particularly on their return to the United States from Mexico, would materially assist in controlling the illicit traffic in narcotics and marihuana across the international boundary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-14\">\u201cI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-15\">\u201cThe Questions Raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-16\">\u201cThe statute provides in part, that \u2018no citizen of the United States who is addicted to or uses narcotic drugs * * \u2019 etc. We pause to note that this provision as to the <em>addict </em>or <em>user </em>applies only to narcotic drugs and not to marihuana. The statute incorporates the definition of narcotic drugs from Sec. 4731, Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.O.A. \u00a7 4731. The omission here of marihuana is apparently because marihuana itself is not a substance causing physical addiction thereto, although psychological addition may result. However, marihuana has a definite relationship to the narcotic and crime problem. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-17\">\u201cIt is contended that the words, \u2018who is addicted to or uses narcotic drugs,\u2019 are too uncertain to be used in stating a public offense and that therefore the statute violates the Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-18\">\u201cThe statute next refers to one \u2018who has been convicted of a violation of any of the narcotic or marihuana laws of the United States, or of any State thereof * * *\u2019. Here marihuana laws have been included and properly so, because of the relationship of marihuana to the drug problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-20\">\u201cThe statute proceeds, \u2018the penalty for which is imprisonment for more than one year.\u2019 One of the cases at bar presents questions of interpretation of the statute, whore the actual sentence imposed by a state court was less than one year. Contention is made that \u2018penalty\u2019 applies to the punishment actually imposed and that the word \u2018is\u2019 has some controlling significance.

Although there is no federal crime penalizing mere <em>possession </em>of narcotics, proof of possession of narcotics (\u00a7 174, U.S. C.A. Title 21), or marihuana (\u00a7 176a, U.S.C.A. Title 21), unexplained, is sufficient evidence upon which to predicate a conviction under tbe foregoing statutes. It is argued that if a person registered under Sec. 1407, U.S.C.A. Title 18, and stated he was a user or addicted to the use of narcotics, he would be forthwith subject to a prosecution. The contention is not correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-19\">\u201c(1) There is no requirement that the registrant state he has or has had <em>possession </em>of narcotics. Such an inference might l^e possible but is not a necessary or compelled inference. A person could be a user or an addict and never have handled or possessed narcotics. Others might have given the injections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-20\">\u201c (2) No statement is required from the registrant as to <em>when or where </em>he used or was addicted. He may have used in Mexico or Canada, and he may be addicted from such use. His prior use may have been at a time beyond the statute of limitations. Standing alone, his statement he was a user or addicted would enable no prosecutor to secure an indictment since a necessary element of a narcotics crime is an allegation that the offense occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-21\">\u201c(3) The privilege against self incrimination does not extend to matters which might tend to incriminate a witness under the laws of another jurisdiction. United States v. Murdock, 1931, 284 U.S. 141, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>149, 52 S.Ct. 63, 76 L.Ed. 210; Feld-man v.

State of Maryland, 1954, 347 U.S. 179, 74 S.Ct. 442, 444, 98 L.Ed. 608, is not opposed to the above cases but rested on the breadth of the words, \u2018in any court\u2019 used in the immunity statute involved. The fact that possession of narcotics would be a crime under state law (e. g. See. 11500, California Health and Safety Code) does not permit the invocation of the Fifth Amendment against the registration required in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1407.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-7\">\u201c2. <em>Exceptions to the operation of the Fifth Amendment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-8\">\u201cAnother principle of law is here worthy of consideration.

United States, 1941, 312 U.S. 342, 61 S. Ct. 603, 85 L.Ed. 876, since the statements or declarations required to be made, occurred before the commission of the offense which was later charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-13\">\u201cThere are numerous categories in the application of the rule that the use of reports, statements or applications, made prior to the commission of an offense, does not violate the Fifth Amendment; viz.

(I.R.C.1939) \u00a7 3290 et seq., and a required registration, construed the statute as operating prospectively, nevertheless some of the language in the case is of interest. \u2018The fact that he may elect to pay the tax and make the prescribed disclosures required by the Act is a matter of his choice. There is nothing compulsory about it, and, consequently, there is nothing violative of the Fifth Amendment. * * * The only compulsion under the Act is that requiring the decision which would-be gamblers must make at the threshold. * * * \u2019 (348 U.S. at page 422, 75 S.Ct. at page 418).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-24\">\u201cAt the time of registration the registrant has committed no crime and no crime is revealed by his registration. Our case differs from most of the situations set forth above, in that if he registers, no prosecution is predicated thereon. In fact, it can be argued that the classes of cases referred to above constitute a broader exception to the Fifth Amendment than does Sec. 1407, Title 18 U.S.C.A., in that in such cases and situations the registration or statements made can thereafter be an integral part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>of a prosecution for a crime. Here the situation is the reverse. If registration is made no prosecution can be based upon the honest registration. If the registration is false, that is if a person falsely claimed he was a user or addicted to the use of narcotics, or was a convicted violator of narcotic laws (an almost impossible situation) then a prosecution might result for false statement to a government agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-7\">\u201c3. <em>A later claim, of privilege.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-8\">\u201cWhere the defendant fails to register, we do not believe he can later, at time of trial, claim any privilege against self incrimination.
