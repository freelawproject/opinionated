Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 1941, 116 F. 2d 578. We do not understand the order <em>as written </em>to be challenged, but only the Commission\u2019s subsequent interpretation of its order. However, this interpretation may be changed or it may never be enforced. We hold that there is no controversy calling for judicial review of the interpretation at the present time, See Aetna Life Insurance Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. Haworth, 1937, 300 U.S. 227, 57 S.Ct. 461, 81 L.Ed. 617.</p>\n<p id=\"agn-dedup-0\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
