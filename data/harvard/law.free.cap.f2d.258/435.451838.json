His pre-trial motion to suppress, based upon a claim that the Commissioner issued the warrant without a proper showing of probable cause, was denied. The motion was renewed at the trial and again denied. Having been found guilty by the jury, Mitchell appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-29\">He assigns as error the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress and its refusal to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal made at the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>of the Government\u2019s proof. We think the District Judge acted correctly in denying the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The search warrant was issued February 12, 1957, but was not executed until February 17, 1957. This delay was not made the basis of an objection, and appellant made no point of it on appeal. Nevertheless, although he notes that Mitchell \u201cdid not object to the warrant on the ground of unseasonable execution\u201d and concludes that \u201cThat objection is therefore not available to him on appeal,\u201d our brother Bazelon discusses the matter and expresses the view that a search warrant is not executed \u201cforthwith\u201d when five days intervene between its issue and execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">While it is true that Rule 41(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> provides that a search warrant \u201cshall command the officer to search forthwith the person or place named for the property specified,\u201d subsection (d) of the same Rule begins: \u201cThe warrant may be executed and returned only within 10 days after its date.\u201d Thus the federal rule defines the word \u201cforthwith\u201d by limiting the time of the search to ten days after the issuance of the warrant. Sgro v. United States, 1932, 287 U.S. 206, 53 S. Ct. 138, 77 L.Ed. 260; Murby v. United States, 1 Cir., 1924, 2 F.2d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b484-15\"> 18 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b484-7\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AN2W\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">At 3:45 P.M. on February 12, 1957, two police officers applied to the United States Commissioner for a warrant to search appellant\u2019s home, stating under oath that they had reason to believe that \u201con the premises * * * there is now being concealed\u201d certain narcotics paraphernalia. In a supporting affidavit, the officers stated (1) that they had received information on February 3, 1957 from a reliable informant that appellant was selling narcotics at his home and had several peddlers working for him; (2) that in the course of their observation of the premises during the week of February 4 through February 10, the officers had seen numerous narcotic addicts going in and out; and (3) that the officers believed that certain narcotics paraphernalia \u201care * * * on these premises * * * <em>\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">The same day (February 12) the Commissioner, finding (1) that the officers had sworn that they had reason to believe that \u201cthere is now being concealed\u201d on the premises certain narcotics paraphernalia; and (2) that there was probable cause to believe that such property \u201cis being concealed on the premises,\u201d issued the warrant whereby the Chief of Police or any member of the force was</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">\u201c * * * commanded to <em>search forthwith </em>the place named for the property specified, serving this warrant and making the search at any time in the day or night and if the property be found there to seize it, leaving a copy of this warrant and a receipt for the property taken, and prepare a written inventory of the property seized and <em>return this warrant and bring the property before me within ten days of this date, </em>as required by law.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">The officers did not execute the warrant \u201cforthwith.\u201d They waited five days until 2:00 A.M. of February 17, 1957, at which time they broke into the home and found appellant in bed with his wife. They searched the home and seized the evidence which formed the basis of appellant\u2019s conviction. The return of the warrant was made on February 18, 1957, within the ten days specified in the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">On the motion to suppress the evidence, appellant attacked the sufficiency of the affidavit upon which the search warrant had been issued, but did not object to the warrant on the ground of unseasonable execution. That objection is therefore not available to him on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Nevertheless, because of the Importance, in the administration of criminal justice, of the question of seasonable execution of search warrants, I deem it necessary to set forth my views upon that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">A search warrant is based upon a judicial determination of the <em>present existence </em>of justifying <em>grounds </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>at the time of issuance of the warrant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe purpose is to seize the thing alleged to be at that time in the place to be searched, to prevent its removal or further concealment.\u201d State v. Guthrie, 1897, 90 Me. 448, 38 A. 368, 369. \u201cWarrants are directed to existing violations of the law and not to violations which may come into existence in the future.\u201d Simmons v. State, Okl.Cr.1955, 286 P.2d 296, 298. So, in the instant case, the warrant was based on the Commissioner\u2019s determination on February 12, 1957, that grounds for issuing it were then in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The <em>in praesenti </em>basis of the warrant requires as a matter of logical necessity that it be served without delay, for, if there is delay in execution, the property to be seized may disappear. There is danger, especially in cases like the present one where the establishment to be searched is claimed to be a scene of recurring law violations, that the officer, acting on a five-day-old warrant, may seize property which came into existence after the warrant was issued. \u201cIn any case of delay it would be difficult, if not impossible, to prove the identity of the [things] found with those complained against. The prosecution would fail, resulting only in expense to the state, and expense and annoyance to the citizen.\u201d State v. Guthrie, supra, 38 A. at page 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">Such are the considerations which have always caused magistrates to require the speediest possible execution of search warrants they issue. And, it goes without saying that the judicially-imposed requirement of speed is a mandate which controls the officer who executes the warrant. As the court said, in Guthrie, supra, 38 A. at page 369:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">\u201cIt is an integral principle in our system of law and government that ministerial officers assuming to execute a statute or process upon the property or person of a citizen shall execute it promptly, fully, and precisely. The time of execution is as essential as any other element. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-15\">\u201cWe think the foregoing propositions are applicable with especial directness and force to the nature and purpose of a search warrant. It is a sharp and heavy police weapon, to be used most carefully, lest it wound the security or liberty of the citizen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">The officer to whom the warrant is issued \u201chas no discretion, but must proceed with diligence at the earliest reasonable opportunity, to make the search as commanded * * *. \u201d McDaniel v. State, 1926, 197 Ind. 179, 150 N.E. 50, 53. So, when the warrant commands a search to be made <em>forthwith, </em>\u201can unexplained delay of three days in serving such a warrant seems clearly needless, unreasonable, and hence unlawful, and destructive of the power of the warrant.\u201d State v. Guthrie, supra, 38 A. at page 369.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Whatever circumstantial elasticity must be allowed to the term \u201cforthwith,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the unexplained delay of five days in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>before us is inconsistent with the command of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The mere fact of delay does not necessarily vitiate a search warrant. A number of circumstances, such as distance and weather conditions, may cause a court to consider a warrant to have been executed forthwith, despite some delay,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> State v. Guthrie, supra; People v. Wie-deman, supra; but delay occasioned merely by the officer\u2019s assumption of authority to select the time of execution does vitiate the warrant. Even the magistrate has no right, once he has determined that the conditions for the issuance of a warrant are in existence, to keep the suspect under surveillance and postpone execution of the warrant until such time as it may do the suspect the greatest harm. State v. Perkins, 1926, 220 Mo.App. 349, 285 S.W. 1021. Delay in either issuance or service, \u201cwhen deliberate and made by the officers for the purpose of selecting their own time and for their own purpose, whether that purpose be to aid the state or the accused, [takes] away from them the power to issue and serve a search warrant.\u201d Id., 285 S.W. at page 1024; see also State v. Miller, 1932, 329 Mo. 855, 46 S.W.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We hear it said that efficient control of the illicit traffic in drugs requires that the police be allowed discretion in the matter of when they should pounce on the contraband. Similar arguments concerning liquor traffic were thus disposed of in State v. Guthrie, supra, 38 A. at pages 369-370:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201cIt is urged that the conclusion reached in this case [that a \u201cforthwith\u201d warrant is rendered invalid by an unexplained three-day delay of execution] will materially impair the efficiency of one of the most useful instrumentalities for the enforcement of the liquor statutes. Even if such were the effect, we could not shrink from declaring the law as we believe it to be. But no such effect need be apprehended. No case can be stated in which a needless delay of service will aid the prosecution. Any such case, when stated, will ipso facto show the delay to have been needful, and hence reasonable, and hence remove the case from the purview of this opinion. On the other hand, the more promptly the warrant is served, the more likely the officer is to find the liquors complained of, and the more easy to prove the identity. Every hour\u2019s delay, whether from the officer\u2019s inefficiency or from his collusion with respondents, endangers the success of the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">\u201cIt is suggested that the prosecution often needs to obtain search warrants in advance, in order to have them in readiness to seize the liquors at the moment of deposit before they can be concealed; that such a procedure is very efficacious, and even essential, to circumvent the cunning of liquor sellers; and that the rule here evolved will nullify it. If such a practice obtains, it should be nullified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-13\">\u201cNo prosecution can be lawfully begun, no criminal process lawfully issued, before the offense is committed. The practice suggested, if it obtains, is a scandalous abuse of legal process, based upon the perjury of the complainant,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and subjecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>all concerned in it to penalties and damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Since the warrant in this case commanded the <em>search </em>to be made <em>forthwith, </em>only the <em>return </em>being permitted to be deferred for as much as ten days, the unexplained five-day delay of execution vitiated the warrant and made the search illegal. People v. Fetsko, 1928, 332 Ill. 110, 163 N.E. 359; People v. Wiedeman, 1926, 324 Ill. 66, 154 N.E. 432; McDaniel v. State, 1926, 197 Ind. 179, 150 N.E. 50; State v. Guthrie, 1897, 90 Me. 448, 38 A. 368; State v. Miller, 1932, 329 Mo. 855, 46 S.W.2d 541; Simmons v. State, Okl. Cr.1955, 286 P.2d 296; State v. Pachesa, 1926, 102 W.Va. 607, 135 S.E. 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The only authority for the five-day delay of the search pointed to by the Government at the argument is the provision of Rule 41(d), Fed.R.Crim.P.: \u201cThe warrant may be executed and returned only within 10 days after its date.\u201d Actually this warrant was not issued under that Rule, but rather under D.C.Code, \u00a7 33-414,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which contains, in subsection (i), the somewhat similar provision: \u201cA search warrant must be executed and returned to the judge or commissioner who issued it within ten days after its date; after the expiration of this time the warrant, unless executed, is void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The whole tenor of the statute bespeaks immediacy. It authorizes issuance of a search warrant upon a showing under oath that \u201cnarcotic drugs <em>are </em>manufactured, possessed, * * in the described premises. Subsections (a)(d). Only if the commissioner is satisfied of the <em>present existence </em>of the contraband or of probable cause to believe its <em>present existence </em>may he issue the warrant. Subsection (e). If he is so satisfied, the commissioner must issue to the officer a warrant \u201ccommanding him forthwith<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to search the place named <em>for the property specified </em>and to bring it before the * * * commissioner.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, not only the search, but even the return must be commanded to be made forthwith. This is made explicit in subsection (k), providing that \u201cthe officer <em>must forthwith return </em>the warrant to the * * * commissioner and deliver to him a written inventory of the property taken * * *. \u201d Speedy action is required even after the return, for subsection (m) requires the commissioner to file the return \u201cat once\u201d with the clerk of the court, together with the affidavits, the warrant, the inventory, the evidence and the record of his proceedings. Such delay of execution of a search warrant as might result from locked doors is avoided by subsection (g) which authorizes the officer to break in if that proves necessary. The statute does not even brook overnight delay of service in a case like the instant one, where the warrant is issued late in the afternoon, for the 1956 amendment, D.C.Code \u00a7 33-414(h) (1951 ed., Supp. VI), requires the commission<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>er to authorize night-time search without demanding a \u201cpositive\u201d fact showing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">To read the ten-day provision of subsection (i) as allowing .an unexplained ten-day delay of execution of a search warrant is to read out of the statute completely the flat requirement that service be <em>forthwith </em>and all of the other foregoing indicia that Congress intended the speediest possible execution of search warrants. As I read the statute, ten days is the maximum allowable delay, even if circumstances make service impossible, but, if earlier service can be made, it must be made as soon as possible after the warrant has been issued.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> I think this is what the statute clearly and unambiguously directs. If there were any ambiguity resulting from the ten-day provision, I would resolve it in favor of the appellant. Such statutes \u201care designed to protect the privacy of the citizen, unless the strict standards set for searches and seizures are satisfied.\u201d Rea v. United States, 1956, 350 U.S. 214, 218, 76 S.Ct. 292, 294, 100 L.Ed. 233. \u201cThe proceeding by search warrant is a drastic one. Its abuse led to the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, and this, together with legislation regulating the process, should be liberally construed in favor of the individual.\u201d Sgro v. United States, 1932, 287 U.S. 206, 210, 53 S.Ct. 138, 140, 77 L.Ed. 260.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-14\">. See People v.

Tims, when a search warrant expires by its terms, it cannot be renewed on the basis of the original affidavits; the magistrate must make a new determination of the grounds for issuing a warrant, based on new affidavits showing the grounds to be still in existence.
