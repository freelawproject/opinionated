The same court-appointed counsel represented the accused at the trial and in this Court. After denial by the trial court of a motion to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>this Court allowed such appeal, The appellant\u2019s sole ground for reversal is admission of a \u201csecond confession,\u201d so denominated by appellant, though it might more accurately be called a state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>ment of events preceding the death. Objection was duly made on the ground that the statement was taken during detention by police in violation of Rule 5 (a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"alj-dedup-0\">We understand that the rulings and decisions of the Supreme Court on the admissibility in criminal trials of statements or confessions of the defendant after arrest and before commitment proceedings are to be applied with the following considerations in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"ANG\">Such cases call for inquiry as to whether Rule 5(a) has been violated. If it has, the admission of such statement, over defendant s objection, and if it is material, is an error that requires reversa^-</p>\n<p id=\"AN9y\">The significant words are \u201cshall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available commissioner or other properly emp<em>o</em>wered officer. That phrase, without unnecessary delay is a compendious rest<em></em>atement, without substantive change of the various former statutory requirements for prompt presentation of an arrested prisoner before an authorized magistrate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The phrase appeared in the Preliminary Draft of the Advisory Committee on Rules of Criminal Procedure (1943), p. 11, issued after McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819, and was employed in lieu of the words \u201cimmediately\u201d and \u201cpromptly,\u201d referred to in that case, 318 Page S.Ct. at page 614.</p>\n<p id=\"AW7E\">The Preliminary Draft included a subsection (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This was dropped later, The Advisory Committee and the Supreme Court, at the time of their adoption of the Rules, were familiar with the former commentary, p. 266, of the American Law Institute on its proposed Code 0f Criminal Procedure (1930), section 39 concerning preliminary examination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That commentary called attention to Scotch practice. The draftsmen of Rule g and gUpreme Court did not accept the suggestion of the \u201csimplest, clearest, and. apparently_ the most effective\u201d rule <em>f </em>\u00ed50 lce \u2122 error lon- n co ' land\u2019 Interrogations of arrested persons by the police are forbidden * * *? \u201d ~ ^ w, Preliminary Draft, supra, p. 14. Use of ,, <em>, </em>, . statements, too, received under such cir- , ? \u2019 , _ cumstances, could have been forbidden, mi i nev were not</p>\n<p id=\"Ab5\">Instead, the Supreme Court pointed out in the McNabb case, supra, 318 U.S. at page 344, 63 S.Ct. at page 614 that the police must act \u201cwith rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>sonable promptness\u201d; 318 U.S. on page 346, 63 S.Ct. on page 615 \u201c[t]he mere fact that a confession was made while in the custody of the police does not render it inadmissible.\u201d Cf. United States v. Carignan, 342 U.S. 36, 72 S.Ct. 97, 96 L. Ed. 48. In United States v. Mitchell, 322 U.S. 65, 64 S.Ct. 896, 88 L.Ed. 1140, although the defendant was eventually illegally detained following prompt confession after arrest, the prosecution\u2019s introduction of his statement in evidence was approved. Thus the holding was that later \u201cillegal detention did not render inadmissible his prior confessions.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Confession or statements to police, after arrest and during illegal detention, not in the presence of a commissioner or other official authorized to hold hearings and advise the prisoner of his rights, are inadmissible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWl_\">eral Rules occurs when there is unnec essary delay m e pre \u00edminary earing preceding the statement. The statement is then inadmissible whether it is vo untary or involuntary in the common law or due process sense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In England, prisoners\u2019 statements to officers are admissible although made after arrest, if proper caution as to their rights has been given by the officer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge, however, may admit the statement even if taken contrary to the Judges Rules, if he concludes it would be fair to do so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In Canada, a preliminary caution as to his rights is required before statements after arrest are allowed in evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Australia applies the English Judges Rules as England does. It was said in R. v. Jeffries, (1947) 47 S.R. (N.S.W.) 284, at pp. 313-314:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ade-dedup-0\">\u201cThe obligation resting upon police officers is to put all questions fairly and to refrain from anything in the nature of a threat or any attempt to extort an admission. But it is in the interests of the community that all crimes should be fully investigated with the object of bringing malefactors to justice and such investigations must not be unduly hampered. * * * Upon the particular circumstances of each case depends the answer to the question as to the admissibility of such evidence.\u201d Cf. 30 Australian L.J. 60</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqKA\">qhe statutory direction to \u201cproduce a prisoner before a magistrate without unnecessary delay\u00bb is not a meaSure as de-fxnitiVe as the standard yard. It did have a background of interpretation, however, wben it appeared in the Rules.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cWithout unnecessary delay\u201d had been used in New York at least since 1887, Code of Criminal Procedure \u00a7 165, and in Illinois since 1874, Smith-Hurd Criminal Code \u00a7 660. Disregard of the duty of arraignment, it was held in People v. Mummiani, 258 N.Y. 394, 396, 180 N.E. 94, 95, \u201cdoes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>not avail, however, without more to invalidate an intermediate confession.\u201d People v. Alex, 265 N.Y. 192, 194, 192 N. E. 289, 94 A.L.R. 1033. Of course, evidence of illegal detention is admissible on the question of coercion. People v. Elmore, 277 N.Y. 397, 14 N.E.2d 451, 124 A.L.R. 465. Thus they differ from the federal rule.</p>\n<p id=\"AGCb\">Both New York and Illinois recognize that the rule for production \u201cwithout unnecessary delay\u201d is during the ordinary professional hours of commissioners and judges.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axq-dedup-0\">\u201cFurthermore, his detention was not unlawful, for section 7 of division 6 of the Criminal Code, Ill.Rev. Stat.1947, chap. 38, par. 660, does not require that courts of committing magistrates shall be open on Saturday night, Sunday, and Sunday night in order to enable peace officers to bring an arrested person before one for arraignment when, during all that time, the crime committed has not been fully solved in respect to the identity of other participants, and the arrested person\u2019s connection therewith is still under investigation. <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL7\">This is the view of the Supreme Court, Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. at page 453, 77 S.Ct. at page 1359. Police detention was willful disobedience of law \u201cwhen a committing magistrate was readily accessible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ap4\">We turn now to the application to this case of these rulings. The people and courts of this Nation are one m their desire to support police efforts to detect and punish crime, and equally concerned with assuring a defendant of a fair and just trial. The value in enforcement of careful interrogation of suspects is recognized and encouraged until such time as a suspect is taken into custody. The danger of alarm to accomplices or flight by suspects before arrest complicates-such preliminary investigations. On arrest the prisoner must be taken before any reasonably accessible magistrate without unnecessary delay. But until there is such an opportunity to reach such an official, the Supreme Court has not held reasonable questioning without more of prisoners must cease. Each case depends upon its own facts as to what is or *s not unnecessary delay,</p>\n<p id=\"AhI\">The significant testimony concerning the investigation and trial of this homicide is this. After a fist fight with decedent, around 1:30 P.M., Tuesday, July 31, 1956, in appellant\u2019s apartment, over decedent\u2019s association with appellant\u2019s wife, both decedent and appellant being \u201chalf drunk,\u201d appellant forcibly ejected decedent from the room, down a short flight of cement steps, with a final shove through the door onto the sidewalk, There decedent fell upon the tree strip between the walk and the highway. An abrasion was on his skull near the ear when decedent was picked up by the police, on a call from the apartment. He was locked up at No. 11 Precinct at 2:55 P.M., Tuesday, as intoxicated,</p>\n<p id=\"AXRp\">It developed that the head injury was more serious than the police realized at first. He was taken by them to D. C. General Hospital and admitted at 7:25 P.M. An emergency operation on the brain followed and he died Wednesday morning at 9:55 o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p id=\"arm-dedup-0\">Meanwhile; WOrd having reached the precinct of the seriousness of the injury appellant was arrested Tuesday night about 10:30 at bls m\u00b0tner <em>* </em>holf by D\"; tectlve Remhardt\u2019 charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, to-wit a trained fist, and made a statement to the same officer, when alone with him, in the Detective Office. Transcription was finished at 11:15 P.M. that day. It appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>below.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Next morning, Wednesday, about 9 A.M., Detective Wallace of the Homicide Squad on hospital assignment in a routine check, having heard of the nature of the injury but not uhe death, was told by the prisoner verbally the same facts as were m his earlier state-ment. <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJ0q\">A little later that oner was taken to the United States Branch of the Police Court for his appearance under Rule 5, Fed.Rules Crim. Proe., on the charge of assault. While awaiting appearance, between 10 and 10:30 A.M., it was learned for the first time of the death of the injured man at 9:55 A.M. Judge Howard then told the officer \u201cthat the case should be taken to the Homicide Squad.\u201d This was done by the United States Marshal. We find nothing in the record to support the statement of appellant\u2019s brief that \u201che was standing before the arraigning judge\u201d when the Court was advised of the death of the injured man. He may have been in the room or a cell awaiting his turn. His exact location seems unimportant. No appearance was made before the magistrate at that time and nothing appears in the record that the prisoner was advised of his right to counsel. No witness queried by the defense had heard such advice given,</p>\n<p id=\"ajl-dedup-2\">Neither doeg ^ recQrd ghow gpecifi_ cally the reason for the judge,g direction to retum the prigoner to the precinct. It may be norma] practice to defer ap_ pearance on minor charges until an arrest on homicide or other more serious charges that may have developed has been made. At any rate the prisoner was returned to No. 1 precinct \u201cnot later\u201d than eleven o\u2019clock. At 12:45 P.M. the taking of his statement on the homicide started in the offices of the Homicide Squad before Reinhardt, a precinct detective, two detective sergeants, and a civilian clerk. The questioner, Sergeant Qiarke first read: \u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axv\">\"Charles Stanislas Porter, you are being held on account of the death Bertram Bowers, white, who was pronounced dead August 1, 1956, ^his death being caused by his being beaten while in premises 1107 Trenon Blace, Southeast, Apartment 2 about 2:45 p. m., July 31, 1956.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agq-dedup-0\">\u201cI now ask you if you want to make a complete statement telling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>what knowledge you have of this beating so it can be taken down in typewritten form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGmC\">\u201cBefore making such statement I advise you that your statement must be made freely and voluntarily and also your statement will be used against you in court at your trial if it becomes necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayb-dedup-1\">\u201cAfter hearing what I have just said to you, do you want to make a complete statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_2\">\u201cAnswer by Charles Stanislas Porter: Yes sir.\u201d Transcript of Record, 61-62.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEj\">Thereafter appellant amplified the same facts set out in the first statement quoted above. The only pertinent new information or incident in the second statement of which appellant does or could complain is this single question and answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOqa\">\u201cQuestion: Have you ever had any experience as a boxer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmrI\">\u201cAnswer: When I was about 14 years old I used to tram with the 7 boys club but I never had an actual fight m the ring.\u201d Transcript of Record, 68.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"afx-dedup-0\">Nothing further appears as to any p\u00fagil-istic experience. The statement was finished at 1:44 P.M. The appellant was taken before the committing magistrate that day at 3:30 P.M. Nothing appears in the record as to whether an appear-anee could have been arranged during the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"aob-dedup-0\"><em>First. </em>Under these circumstances, was the admission in evidence of either the first or the second statement or confession or admission an error, requiring reversal? Or, stated differently, was the production of the prisoner for preliminary appearance \u201cwithout unnecessary delay?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Am_\">This Court has recently decided two cases that bear upon the problems in this case \u2014 Metoyer v. United States, 1957, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 62, 250 F.2d 30, and Trilling v. United States, - U.S.App. D.C. -, 260 F.2d 677. The Metoyer case involved an arrest at noon and a detention in Maryland of a suspect in a District of Columbia crime for an hour before the arrival of the District police, Thereupon he promptly admitted certain facts to these police. It was reduced to writing before the District warrant arrived, after which, at 3:30 P.M., he was first taken before a judge, advised of his rights, and extradited. This Court held the confession admissible over a dissent 011 the ground there was \u201cno excuse\u201d for the delay under the Mallory case. This Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AloO\">\"If police are compelled to arraign all potential suspects before questioning any of them we shall have used the artificial niceties and superficial technicalities concerning our liberties to reduce genuine and important rights to absurdity-and dangerous absurdity at that Every citizen has a right to insist that the police make some pertinent and definitive inquiry <em>before </em>he may be arraigned on a criminal charge which even uf it is later abandoned inflicts on him a serious stigma. 250 F.2d 33</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKV9\">In the Trilling case a prisoner arrested A.M. was questioned by several officers for short periods until he confessed before 8 A.M. His appearance was iat\u00b0r but the confession was admit-</p>\n<p id=\"AHa\">_ tew words will suffice on the question \u00b0t the admission of the first statement. See note 13, supra. No objection was made by defense counsel. The statement was given almost immediately. It was without pressure of any kind except iTm mere fact of detention. To say it was inadmissible would be to say no statement to police is admissible after arrest a step that the Supreme Court has not taken in the Rules and has dedined to adopt in the McNabb, Mitchell and Carignan cases.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The arrest was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>past the ordinary hours for appearances, See note 12, supra. There is no rule of law in federal courts that bars the admissibility of extra-judicial statements of prisoners to the police after arrest and before the time has expired of permissible detention between arrest and appearance before a magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"AcFo\">While we have no doubt that the second statement was made within the period of necessary delay, in advance of the required appearance before a magistrate, a different conclusion is reasonably possible. The result might well depend upon a court\u2019s weighing of the interests of society in law enforcement through the disclosure of the actual facts surrounding an alleged criminal act and the protection of a prisoner from being induced, even though without unconstitutional coercion, to make a clean breast of his participation in the action charged. There is nothing in the case to call for the belaboring of the police for lazy methods of investigation by compelling confession instead of searching in the haystack for the sharp needle of fact. They were prompt to respond to duty and when taking the statements, cautioned the prisoner in almost the words of the Judges\u2019 Rules of England.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In our system of justice, as in England, it has not been thought necessary for the police to inform everyone, upon arrest, \u201cRemember, you are entitled to the advice of counsel before you answer any question.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The time that an accused is entitled to counsel for the protection of his rights on criminal charges is from arraignment, that is plea after indictment, to the con-elusion of his trial. Cf. Hawk v. Olson, 326 U.S. 271, 278, 66 S.Ct. 116, 90 L.Ed. 61. Rule 5(a), Fed.Rules Crim.Proc., requires that he be advised at his appearance of his right to .retain counsel,</p>\n<p id=\"asu-dedup-0\">As for the prisoner\u2019s appearance before the magistrate after the charge of manslaughter, we conclude that also was without unnecessary delay. Surely a man arrested Tuesday night at eleven o\u2019clock for assault need not be taken before a magistrate until the next morning. No one will assert, without specific proof, that the personnel of our police departments are so regardless of court rulings on interrogation as to require every prisoner to be taken before a magistrate at midnight for every kind of offense or before the opening of the courts in the morning.</p>\n<p id=\"ask-dedup-0\">Promptly at usual court hours, though the seriousness of decedent\u2019s injuries was already known to the police, but not frig death, the prisoner was presented before the court. When the judge heard of the death, he directed the return of the prisoner by the United States Marshal to the City Homicide Squad. On his return, with the probability of a charge of some degree of homicide, what more natural than that the police would take a statement before selecting a charge of murder or manslaughter. It is to be noted that the statement was made after a question as to whether the prisoner wanted to do so. See 103 U.S.App.D.C. 390, 258 F.2d 690, supra. We do not think there was unnecessary delay,</p>\n<p id=\"A4A7\"><em>Second. </em>But let us assume that the second appearance before the magistrate was unnecessarily delayed and therefore inadmissible under rulings of the Supreme Court. A court would then have to decide whether the error in admitting the statement was material to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>the result of the trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The reason the series of cases from McNabb to Mallory set aside the verdicts on account of the admissions of the confessions is that facts were obtained by the confessions that may have aided the jury in reaching their result. In the Mallory case, the Court succinctly summarized the reason\u00bbfor exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYd\">\u201cIn order adequately to enforce the congressional requirement of prompt arraignment, it was deemed necessary to render inadmissible incriminating statements elicited from defendants during a period of unlawful detention.\u201d 354 U.S. at page 453, 77 S.Ct. at page 1359.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ac2-dedup-0\">in the present case there were no \u201cincriminating statements\u201d in the second admission. The bar against admissions after prohibited interrogation is not to penalize the police or the public for the error but to protect the rights of the accused</p>\n<p id=\"ag3-dedup-0\">In this case nothing appeared that had not already been told by timely statements. Appellant seeks to draw from boxing experience, at fourteen years of age <em>m </em>a boys club, a conclusion of appellant s training m slugger tactics. See ocro ni 103 U.S.App.D.C. 391 258 F.2d 691, supra It is inconceivable to us that such testimony could harmlully affect appelan s rig s.</p>\n<p id=\"AfA5\">_ We^ find notning to justify a reversal of this judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-25\">. 18 U.S.C.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab_\">\u201cRule 5.

United States, -U.S.App.D.C. -, 260 F.2d 677; and Mallory v. United States, - U.S.App.D.C. -, 259 F.2d 796. Basically, it suffices to say here, Rule 5 is the mechanism for effectuating the individual\u2019s constitutional rights to be <em>free </em>from restraint except upon probable cause, to be bailed from confinement in. proper cases, and not to be compelled to incriminate himself. Whether there is probable cause to detain an arrested person requires a judicial determination, Even if there is such cause he is entitled, within recognized limitations, to be free \u00b0n ball pending trial. And <em>he </em>must be informed of his right to counsel and of his right to refuse to make any state-m&lt;mt lest he incriminate himself. With\u00b0ut \u2122ch protection our citizens would be subject to police control rather than dae Prof f There be a Pollf. state. The essence of Rule 5 is fat removes the arrested individua f(ro\u201c ce contro1 ^ ;*ial contro1 without unnecessary delay.</p>\n<p id=\"atq-dedup-0\">While the phrase \u201cwithout unnecessary ry delay may connote something less \u201e than immediacy, it allows arresting oi ficers little more leeway than the interval between arrest and the ordinary administrative steps required to bring a sus fl pect before the nearest available magistrate\" Mallory v. United States, 1957, 354 U.S 449, 453 S.Ct <em>1356. </em>That the police <em>m </em>the present case thought the \u201cordinary administrative steps\u201d had heen completed is plain from the fact that the prisoner had been taken to court for the Rule 5 commitment proceedings a+ 10:00 A.M., some twelve hours after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoh\">The complaining officer was in court ready to make the assauit charge, When word was received that the victim of the assauit had died, appellant could have been arraigned on the assault charge, or the officer could have made a homicide charge, or another officer could have stepped across the street from police headquarters to make the homicide charge. In any event, there were no fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ther \u201cadministrative steps\u201d to be taken which necessitated delay of the commitment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"Av4Y\">The Government said at the argument that appellant could not have been charged with homicide when he was in the Municipal Court because the report of the death was only unconfirmed hearsay at that time. But if the police had reason to doubt the accuracy of the information, they could easily have confirmed it and then made a homicide charge. If they had no confidence in the homicide charge, they should have proceeded on the assault charge. An unconfirmed rumor is no basis for a homicide charge, but neither is it a valid reason for depriving a prisoner of his right to speedy arraignment on a pending assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"AEi\">The real purpose in delaying the arraignment is disclosed in the Government\u2019s alternative contention that it was proper to bring appellant back to police headquarters, without arraigning him, for the purpose of putting in writing the oral statements which appellant had made shortly after 9:00 A.M. under questioning by Detective Wallace of the Homicide Squad.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This, of course, is a callous admission that the arraignment was postponed and appellant \u201ctaken to police headquarters in order to carry out a process of inquiry that lends itself * * * to eliciting damaging statements to support the arrest and ultimately his guilt.\u201d Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. at page 454, 77 S.Ct. at page 1359. Since this is exactly what the law forbids, the ensuing confession was inadmissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"art-dedup-1\">I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s view that receiving the confession in evidence was harmless error, if error. As the majority recognizes, it was through that confession that the Government proved appellant\u2019s boxing training, such as it was. But the majority finds it \u201cinconceivable * * * that such testimony could harmfully affect appellant\u2019s rights.\u201d Since the Government referred to this evidence in its opening argument to the jury, it obviously did not consider it inconceivable that it would influence the jury. Nor do I. And, if it is conceivable that the evidence may .have tipped the scales in favor of conviction, we usurp the jury\u2019s function by assum*ng that it did not. Krulewitch v. United States, 1949, 336 U.S. 440, 445, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790.</p>\n<p id=\"as1-dedup-0\">The confession may have been harmful to appellant in another respect as well, The Government, anticipating that the jury might be disinclined to condemn a man for throwing his wife\u2019s paramour out of his home, made a considerable point of the fact that appellant and his wife's bad been separated at the time of ^he incident. This fact was supplied by inadmissible confession,</p>\n<p id=\"Aik\">The other confessions discussed in the majority opinion \u2014 a written one taken from appellant the night of his arrest and an oral one shortly after 9:00 o\u2019clock the next morning \u2014 are not before us. Both were received in evidence without objection and neither was attacked on appeal. Yet the majority considers them and concludes that they were admissible under Mallory v. United States, supra. I consider that conclusion clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"ArL\">j hold to the view that confessions obtained through police interrogation of an arrested person before he has been arraigned under Rule 5 are inadmissible, My reasons for that view are set forth at length in Trilling v. United States, supra. I shall not repeat them here. I shall only comment upon two propositions asserted by the majority,</p>\n<p id=\"aif-dedup-1\">The majority asserts that to hold these confessions inadmissible \u201cwould be to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>say no statement to police is admissible after arrest \u2014 a step that the Supreme Court has not taken in the Rules and has declined to adopt in the McNabb, Mitchell and Carignan cases.\u201d This assertion completely misses the point that is involved here. To be sure the Supreme Court has not said that <em>no </em>statement made to the police after arrest is admissible. The type of statement it has held admissible, however, is that which is \u201cpromptly and spontaneously\u201d made. Upshaw v. United States, 1949, 335 U.S. 410, 413, 69 S.Ct. 170, 171, 93 L.Ed. 100. A person who is arrested is, of course, free to unbosom himself of his guilt. If he does so, his statement may be used against him</p>\n<p id=\"AQAy\">. . , , . ,, That is the principle embodied m the British practice to w ic e majorny refers. To make certain that the prisoner\u2019s statement is a voluntary one the arresting officer cautions him immediately upon the arrest t a e is lee o remain silent and that whatever he says may be used against him. Then the offlcer asks the prisoner whether he desires to make any statement. If the prisoner wishes to make a statement, he does so; <em>but he is not subjected to an interrogartion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9n\">Only by disregarding facts we conclude that the practice by which these two confessions were obtained bears any resemblance to the British practice. When appellant was arrested on the Might of the assault, he was questioned by Detective Reinhardt. After the interrogation, Detective Reinhar<em>dt </em>inserted m a typewriter a prepared police form reading as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Aqoh\">Date.............. Re:........................ You are requested to make a statement of the facts in this case to the best of <em>your </em>knowledge.

There are no ordinary hours for \u201e , . .. appearances, for, as we said in Akowskey v.

United States,-U.S.App.D.C.-, 259 F.2d 796; see my opinion in Trilling v. United States, supra. It is regrettable that this court should disinter an argument which has been decently laid to rest by the prosecutor, which has no basis in fact, and which disregards the fundamental rights of arrested persons.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\">. The interrogation at the Homicide Squad office was conducted by Sergeant Clarke, not a single question being asked by Detective Wallace. If the purpose were to record what appellant had earlier told Wallace, it would seem that the latter would have participated in the interrogation. Detective Wallace testified that appellant was brought back to lieadquar-ters \u201cto take the statement,\u201d referring to the written confession which is here at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b743-51\">.

Washington Post-Times Herald, April 4, 1958, p. A-l.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b744-28\">. What justified the postponement of appellant\u2019s arraignment, according to the Government, was not the late hour of his arrest, but rather the fact that he was too drunk to be taken before a magistrate. I agree that it may be fair to postpone for a short time an arrested person\u2019s Rule 5 proceeding if he is. mentally unfit, by reason of drunkenness or otherwise, to avail himself of the rights afforded him therein. But the very same considerations of fairness which call for postponing his arraignment forbid'subjecting such a prisoner to an interrogation- dtu-ing the period of postponement.
