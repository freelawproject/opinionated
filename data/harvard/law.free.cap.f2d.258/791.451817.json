In a second cause of action he claimed damages alleged to have been suffered by him in consequence of such alleged wrongful expulsion. The action was dismissed for want of jurisdiction to entertain it. Upon appeal here the cause was argued and submitted but decision of this court was withheld awaiting decision of the Supreme Court in the case of International Association of Machinists v. Gonzales which has now been decided by that court. See 356 U.S. 617, 78 S.Ct. 923, 2 L.Ed.2d 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-20\">Upon the authority of that decision, the judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to take such further proceedings as may be consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court in the case cited.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
