United States of America, 249 F.2d 672. Appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>appeal from this order presents four contentions. (1) He was denied due process of law because the court\u2019s instruction on entrapment was insufficient in law and fact, (2) he was denied a fair trial because the judge failed to instruct the jury that if it found that Banks had acted as a \u201cpurchasing agent,\u201d he could not be convicted under the indictment as a \u201cseller,\u201d (3) the court erred when it failed to pass on the merits of appellant\u2019s allegation that he had been entrapped, and (4) the court erred when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for the reporter\u2019s transcript in <em>forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\"> Appellant\u2019s counsel agrees that no appeal was taken from the 1954 judgment and sentence here involved, and that appellant took no exceptions to the above mentioned instructions given the jury. None of the first three contentions above noted involves a violation of the constitutional rights of appellant. They present issues that could have been and should have been raised by a timely appeal from the sentence if appellant desired to raise them. Section 2255, supra, does not give him the right to try over again a case in which he was adjudged guilty. See Hastings v. United States of America, 9 Cir., 184 F.2d 939. Under the circumstances of this case, the lower court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion for a reporter\u2019s transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The order here appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
