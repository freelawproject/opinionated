Assuming that the plaintiff\u2019s distributors did in fact make concessions in sales to the dealers, we cannot understand how that can be thought to affect the obligation of the defendant to maintain the \u201cFair Trade\u201d prices in his sales to customers. The injunction being outstanding, the defendant was not free to disregard or disobey its terms. Had the defendant believed that plaintiff\u2019s conduct justified some modification of the injunction, defendant could have sought appropriate remedial relief from the issuing court. It is not necessary to decide whether, if after the temporary injunction had been issued, the plaintiff had induced the defendant to sell at prices below those fixed by the contract, that would have been relevant in a proceeding like this for remedial relief for the disobedience of the injunction without some modification of the injunction itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">As to the amount of the fees allowed to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, it is enough to cite our decisions in Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Tucker, D.C., 221 F. 305, 307 and Sunbeam Corporation v. Golden Rule Corporation, 2 Cir., 252 F. 2d 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
