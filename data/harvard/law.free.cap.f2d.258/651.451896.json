They present the question whether amounts distributed in complete liquidation of a corporation, to the extent that those amounts exceed the cost of the stock and represent corporate earnings, are properly includible in the stockholders\u2019 gross income as a dividend under Section 47-1551c(m) of the District of Columbia Code (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In 1937 the petitioners became common stockholders in the Engineering <em>&amp; </em>Research Corporation (\u201cErco\u201d), each paying to the company the full par value for his or her shares. On November 15, 1954, Erco sold its assets and business to ACF Industries, Inc. (\u201cACF\u201d), for $3,000,000,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> realizing a profit of $2,196,-371.46 on the sale. On that date Erco had an earned surplus of $613,628.54, a substantial part of which represented earnings in 1954. Following the sale the profit of $2,196,371.46 also was reflected in and became a part of its earned surplus account. In December of 1954 Erco distributed to its common stockholders, pro rata on the stock owned by each, the cash and the ACF stock acquired on the sale of assets, reserving only the amounts required to retire its preferred stock and to pay liabilities not assumed by ACF. It was stipulated that, after excluding the amount of capital included in the distribution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the remainder was paid out of surplus acquired from operating profits up to November 15, 1954, and surplus acquired from the proceeds of the sale of its business to ACF. Erco charged the distribution, after excluding the capital, to earned surplus; it had no paid-in or capital surplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">In their 1954 income tax returns to the District of Columbia, the petitioning stockholders reported the distribution as a sale or exchange of their stock, a capital asset, resulting in a non-taxable gain. Deficiencies for 1954 were assessed against them, computed by including in taxable income as a dividend under Section 47-1551e(m) of the Code the amount distributed by Erco in complete liquida-dation, less an amount representing return of capital.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The taxpayers paid the taxes so assessed and petitioned for refunds. The District of Columbia Tax Court approved these assessments and denied refunds of the taxes so paid. The present petitions followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">Section 47-1557a(a) of the Code includes \u201cdividends\u201d within the definition of gross income. Section 47-1551c(m) defines a dividend as\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">\u201cany distribution made by a corporation (domestic or foreign) to its stockholders * * *, out of its earnings, profits, or surplus (other than paid-in surplus), whenever earned by the corporation and whether made in cash or any other property * * * and whether distributed prior to, during, upon, or after liquidation or dissolution of the corporation: * * <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>It was stipulated in writing before the Tax Court that the distribution, to the extent taxed, was paid out of surplus, and the evidence showed that Erco had only earned surplus, to which the distribution was charged. The taxpayers make no contention to the contrary here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The distribution made by Erco, during or upon its liquidation, was thus out of \u201cits earnings, profits, or surplus,\u201d earned in part from operations and in part on the sale of its assets in 1954. As such, it falls precisely within the statutory language and the imposition of the tax was required.</p>\n<p id=\"A4e\">The correctness of this view is confirmed, by reference to the history of the related Federal taxing provisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Corn-mencing with the Revenue Act of 1916,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> c. 463,39 Stat. 757 (1917), a dividend was defined generally as any distribution out of earnings and profits accumulated after February 28, 1913,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> with certain additions not relevant here, and this definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>has continued until the present time.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The 1918 Act, the 1924 Act (but not the 1921 Act), and all subsequent acts including the present Code,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provide specifically that amounts distributed in complete liquidation of a corporation shall be treated as in full payment in exchange for the stock. Under such specific provisions a liquidating distribution is treated as the proceeds of an \u201cexchange\u201d resulting in gain or loss to the stockholder-recipient, even though the distribution may include corporate earnings and profits, and even though without the specific provision the broad definition of dividends would include distributions in liquidation. See Hellmich v. Hellman, 1928, 276 U.S. 233, 236-237, 48 S.Ct. 244, 72 L.Ed. 544; White v. United States, 1938, 305 U.S. 281, 59 S.Ct. 179, 83 L.Ed. 172; Helvering v. Chester N. Weaver Co., 1938, 305 U.S. 293, 59 S.Ct. 185, 83 L.Ed. 180. But in the Revenue Acts of 1916, 1917, and 1921 there was no such specific provision as to the treatment of distributions in complete liquidation. In cases governed by those acts it has been uniformly held that distributions in liquidation, whether partial or complete, fell within the definition of a dividend to the extent that they represented accumulated earnings, and thus were properly taxable as a dividend.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The holdings under the 1921 Act are especially significant: they construed the general definition of a dividend unequivocally to include distributions of earnings in a liquidation, where the specific provision of the 1918 Act that distributions in liquidation are to be treated as paid in exchange for the stock was omitted from the 1921 Act. See particularly Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Sansome, supra, note 11, 60 F.2d at page 932 and McCaughn v. McCahan, supra, note 11, 39 F.2d at page 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-21\">The District statute contains virtually the same definition of a dividend as the Federal statutes have contained since the 1916 Act, with the significant addition that in the District statute Congress included a specific provision that the term \u201cdividend\u201d includes a distribution of earnings \u201cduring, upon, or after liquidation.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Had Congress intended that such a distribution be treated as an exchange, we think it would have omitted the reference to liquidating distributions in the definition of a dividend and would have included a provision similar to that which has appeared in the Federal statutes uninterruptedly since 1924. We must therefore reject the taxpayers\u2019 contention that the transaction should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>held to be an exchange, the gain from which is excluded from gross income by Section 47-1557a(b) (11).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The petitioners recognize that the statutory definition of a dividend is broad enough to include the liquidating distributions to them, after capital is excluded. But, petitioners argue, the statutory language should not be applied literally here to tax as a dividend the part of the distribution which represents earnings, because to do so would lead to results not intended by Congress. The foregoing discussion demands rejection of this argument. We note, however, that Congress was undoubtedly cognizant that either method of treatment might present some problems in application, cf. Magill, The Income Tax Liability of Dividends in Liquidation, 23 Mieh.L.Rev. 565, 566-568 (1925), and that it purposely selected the method of taxing liquidating distributions of earnings as dividends for purposes of the District tax. The wisdom of such a choice is obvious, when the provisions of the District law relating to capital gains (D.C.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 47-1551c(i) and 47-1557a(b) (11)) are considered. If distributions like the present were treated as sales or exchanges of stock, as taxpayers argue they should be, some stockholders (those who had owned their stock for more than two years) would escapo tax altogether on receipt of the corporate earnings whereas other stockholders would be taxed in full on receipt of exactly the same distribution of earnings merely because they had held their stock for only two years or less. Such a difference in treatment for the same distribution would hardly be justified by logic \u2014 and, as we read the statutes, Congress has not authorized it. The argument that the distributions \u201cgrew out of\u201d the ownership of stock would be equally applicable to any distribution of earnings, including dividends in the ordinary course paid by corporations not in liquidation, and is hardly persuasive as a reason for holding these distributions not within the literal statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Finally, the taxpayers contend that the Fifth Amendment prohibits taxation as dividends of amounts distributed in liquidation to the extent that they represent corporate earnings. Their argument is two-fold: that to do so taxes the stockholder on the earnings of another entity, the corporation, and that it arbitrarily and capriciously provides a different treatment from that afforded stockholders who sell their stock to third persons. The first point, if accepted, would prohibit the taxation of any distribution of corporate earnings to a stockholder as a dividend. But, of course, the point cannot be accepted. Cf. United States v. Phellis, 1921, 257 U.S. 156, 169, 42 S.Ct. 63, 66 L.Ed. 180. In respect of the taxpayers here the argument overlooks the fact that the distributions not only returned to them their capital investments in full but also a substantial additional amount as a gain or profit. The question is whether the Fifth Amendment permits Congress to tax this profit as dividend income, when it also represented a distribution of corporate earnings. The courts have frequently recognized that a distribution of earnings in liquidation may rationally be treated as a dividend as well as an exchange.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It was constitutionally open to Congress to elect to tax the profit as a dividend for purposes of the District tax, just as it was constitutional for it to do so for purposes of the 1921 Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Act. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Sansome, supra, note 11, 60 F.2d at page 932. Cf. Neild v. District of Columbia, 1940, 71 App.D.C. 306, 110 F.2d 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">To be sure, this method of taxation provides a different treatment from that accorded to stockholders who sell their stock to third persons. But such a sale does not involve a distribution by the corporation of its earnings and capital in liquidation, and has no element of a dividend, unlike the distributions here.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It thus cannot be thought to be unreasonable or arbitrary to treat sales of stock to third persons as sales and to treat distributions in liquidation as dividends to the extent that earnings are included\u2014 although such considerations are probably not relevant for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. Neild v. District of Columbia, supra, 71 App.D.C. at pages 318-320, 110 F.2d at pages 258-260.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-5\">. This amount was paid in substantial part in cash; the balance was made up by the issuance of 10,000 shares of ACF stock, valued at the stock\u2019s market value on the date the contract was closed. In addition to the payment of $3,000,000 for the assets, ACF assumed all of Erco\u2019s liabilities, with the exception of certain items specifically excluded by the sale contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\">. I. e., an amount equal to the original capital paid in (the par value of their common stock) by the stockholders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\">. See footnote 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b700-9\">. A proviso to this section reads as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\"><em>\u201cProvided, however, </em>That in the case of any dividend which is distributed other than in cash or stock in the same class in the corporation and not exempted from tax under this article, the basis of tax to the recipient thereof shall be the market value of such property at tile time of such distribution. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-17\">The only part of the dividend here involved which was distributed other than in cash was stock of AOF (not common stock of Erco), which was valued at its market value on the date of distribution as the proviso directs. Taxpayers have pointed out no provision of the income tax law, and we know of none, which exempts a dividend paid in property other than cash or stock of the same class in the paying company, here stock of another company, from tax. Taxpayers do rely on the provisions exclud-</p>\n<p id=\"A1l\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>ing from gross income the gains on sales or exchanges of capital assets, which will be discussed <em>infra. </em>Suffice it to say here that such exclusion provisions do not relate to the exemption, from tax of the type of dividend referred to in the proviso.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">. Such a contention would* not be sustainable. There was a gain by the corporation on the sale of its assets. For Federal tax purposes that gain may not have been taxable (cf. Int.Rev.Code of 1954, \u00a7 337(a) and (b), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 337(a, b)), and if not recognized as taxable income would not be regarded as increasing Erco\u2019s earned surplus by virtue of a specific statutory enactment (Int.Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 332(f) (1), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 312 (f) (1)). But the District statute has no such provision as <em>to </em>the effect on earned surplus. Furthermore, we are not advised as to the status of the gain for District corporate income tax purposes. If the assets sold had been held for more than two years <em>and </em>if they were not stock in trade or inventoriable properties or lield primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the corporation\u2019s business, they would be capital assets as defined in D.C.Code, \u00a7 47-1551c(Z) and would be excluded from the statutory definition of gross income by D.C.Code, \u00a7 47-1557a(b) (11). The corporation\u2019s balance sheet on the date of sale showed very substantial inventories so that at least a substantial part of the assets sold were not capital assets of the corporation, as defined by statute, and would have been within the broad definition of income contained in D.C.Code, \u00a7 47-1557a(a). Cf. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court Holding Co., 1945, 324 U.S. 333, 65 S. Ct. 707, 89 L.Ed. 981; Eisner v. Macomber, 1920, 252 U.S. 189, 207, 40 S.Ct. 189, 64 L.Ed. 521. If some part of the assets sold were within the definition of capital assets of the corporation, which the evidence docs not show, and thus were excluded from its income by the statutory definition of gross income, the gain allocable to such part would nevertheless probably be regarded as increasing its earned surplus account in the absence of a statutory provision or regulation to the contrary.

They sought to avoid the many complications such as have arisen under the federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The draftsmen knew that distributions \u201cin kind\u201d have given rise to myriad problems under the federal law. See, e.g., Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Hirshon Trust, 2 Cir., 1954, 213 F.2d 523, certiorari denied 1954, 348 U.S. 861, 75 S.Ct. 85, 99 L.Ed. 679. Thus, for the purposes of the tax law of the District of Columbia, as to distributions \u201cin kind,\u201d they added the proviso, above noted, defining the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cbasis\u201d but only as to property so distributed which is \u201cnot exempted from tax.\u201d Surely Congress did not stultify itself by this deliberately selected language in this very section.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">To recapitulate, Congress sought simply to class as dividends to stockholders the distribution of <em>earnings, </em>whenever paid out, and whether in complete or partial liquidation or dissolution or otherwise. Reverting to the definition of \u201cdividend,\u201d we see that its reach applies to a distribution by a corporation of its property, whether it be cash or otherwise, if that distribution is made \u201cout of its earnings, profits, or surplus (other than paid-in surplus), whenever earned by the corporation.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">I see no complexity inherent in the sweep of this language. The Tax Court said in its opinion that \u201cThere can be no doubt that all of such items, with the exception of the $190,000 capital item, were surplus.\u201d Thus the Tax Court treated the entire sum, whether in cash or stock, paid by ACF to ERCO other than paid-in capital, as \u201csurplus,\u201d and hence as a dividend or \u201csurplus\u201d income to the stockholders. I believe its error stems from its loose and all-inclusive classification of \u201csurplus,\u201d without regard to the type of surplus. Obviously, the Code itself excludes \u201cpaid-in surplus.\u201d The term certainly.must be taken to exclude unearned surplus, or that represented by appreciation in value. Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is makes the point for me in his opinion in Edwards v. Douglas, 269 U. S. 204, at page 214, 46 S.Ct. 85, at page 88, 70 L.Ed. 235, where he says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-13\">\u201cThe word \u2018surplus\u2019 is a term commonly employed in corporate finance and accounting to designate an account on corporate books. * * * The surplus account represents the net assets of a corporation in excess of all liabilities including its capital stock. This surplus may be \u2018paid-in surplus,\u2019 as where the stock is issued at a price above par. [In our case paid-in surplus is specifically excluded.] It may be \u2018earned surplus,\u2019 as where it was derived wholly from undistributed profits. [In our case, I deem at least $613,628.54 to be \u201cearned surplus,\u201d specifically subject to tax.] <em>Or it may, among other things, represent the increase in valuation of land or other assets made upon a revaluation of the company\u2019s fixed property.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>I think the case should be remanded to the Tax Court for a determination of the several elements as separately distinguished by Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is. The words \u201csurplus * * * whenever earned by the corporation\u201d have not here been broken down by evidence of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The petitioners had been arguing that no part of the sum paid by ACF was subject to the deficiency tax here asserted. Yet it is perfectly clear that as at December 31, 1953, there was an earned surplus balance of $54,241.64. Again, the corporation between January 1 and November 15, 1954, had net income of $559,386.90. Surely these two items constituted earned surplus, within the meaning of the Code, subject to tax, when distributed, as \u201cdividends.\u201d Exclusive of capital, the balance was represented by notes and accounts receivable, buildings and other fixed depreciable assets and inventories. There were contracts, work in process and other elements, no doubt. We do not know what they are or the value ascribed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In short, between January, 1937, and November, 1954, the stockholders saw their capital investment grow. No doubt, some earnings were ploughed back. No doubt, some dividends were paid. But the experience of the corporation was one of progress. Its good will was enhanced. Its potential for doing business was expanded. Its management developed a product in demand under Government contract \u2014 for all we know, the only such company in the nation in a specialty field.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The value of the stock increased accordingly in the hands of its holders, irrespective of what elements contributed to that enhanced value. Thus, it was that invested capital of $190,000 by the time of the ACF transaction represented asset value of $3 million. That amount, in what appears to have been an arm\u2019s-length transaction, was what ACF agreed to pay. The stockholders bound themselves expressly by contract not to use the ERCO name, or any similar name, and not for five years to compete with ACF, or even indirectly to become interested in a competitor. ACF saw value in that restriction and ERCO\u2019s shareholders were entitled to compensation for it. The contract with ERCO bound ACF to pay $3 million, and ERCO was bound to transfer and did transfer \u201call of Seller\u2019s then existing assets and business, as a going concern, including, without limitation, all rights to the use of the name Engineering and Research Corporation (or any variant thereof) and all patents, applications for patents, trade-marks and licenses.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Then, upon liquidation, ERCO\u2019s stockholders surrendered their stock. They exchanged the value back of that stock for $3 million. To the extent that the amounts received thereafter constituted a distribution of surplus <em>earned </em>by the corporation, such amounts were dividends under the Code section here applicable. To the extent that such amounts so distributed reflected value, not earned, they also were properly carried on ERCO\u2019s books as surplus, possessing, within the meaning of the Code, a capital asset value when related to the stock in the hands of the shareholders. Whatever the exact tax consequences may be depends upon the elements back of that valuation, to be measured in terms of what portion was earned, and on this point no findings have been made. That there was some capital gain to the shareholders seems beyond peradventure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>My colleagues recognize, I see, that if these stockholders had sold their stock to a third person, there would be no income tax because there would be no \u201cdividend,\u201d as they construe the term. That is the way the law clearly points, they concede. Presumably the same result would follow had the stock been sold to ACF. Yet they observe that unless their construction of the term \u201cdividend\u201d is here adopted, these stockholders will likewise not be required to pay an income tax on the unearned asset value included in the ERCO \u201csurplus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">I think the result they deplore reflects precisely the purpose of the statute which presents a policy question with which we are not concerned. The 1947 amendment expanded the earlier language<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> so as to reach earnings or profits distributed upon liquidation or dissolution, but otherwise made no change in the principle. If a \u201cdividend\u201d in a corporate liquidation is not a distribution of corporate earnings, but represents only a return of unearned increment, the stockholders have received no more <em>in value </em>than they had before surrendering their stock. They have merely exchanged their capital, the shares being evidence of their ownership, for the valuation itself, whether it be distributed in dollars or in property. The Code reaches corporate distributions out of <em>earnings, </em>whether distributed currently in a given tax year as a \u201cdividend\u201d in the usual sense, or declared but not paid until later, or earned, but not distributed at any time until either by a partial or complete liquidation or dissolution. Thus equality of tax treatment is accorded to District residents as to <em>income </em>from corporate earnings. It seems to me the scheme of the statute in these several respects is completely clear.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">In sum, when the statute says that gross income shall not include capital gains resulting from the sale or exchange of capital assets as defined in the Code, it seems to me to assimilate that portion of the District law to the federal law with years of experience behind it. Thus shareholders in the District who wish to <em>speculate </em>must treat as ordinary income, gains on transactions in capital assets held for less than two years. But <em>investors, </em>who through a corporation help build asset value and whose holdings appreciate due to many valid causes, some, perhaps, wholly fortuitous, are bound upon liquidation of the corporate medium to pay a District income tax only upon such \u201csurplus\u201d as shall have been earned by the corporation. Whatever may be the tax liability of shareholders, such as these, to the federal Government, I think their District liability has expressly and purposefully been limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">I would remand for a determination of whatever facts may measure District income tax liability according to the criteria I have suggested.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-18\">.
