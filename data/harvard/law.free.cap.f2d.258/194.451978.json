This appeal is from that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">This Court granted appellant\u2019s motion to appeal in typewritten form. Thereafter he filed two typewritten briefs which wholly failed to conform to the requirements of Rule 18(2) (a) (b) (c) and (d) of this Court, 28 U.S.C.A. A complete transcript of trial proceedings has not been filed with this Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, no showing is made that appellant ever filed with the lower court a \u201cdesignation\u201d of any part of the record on this appeal. See Rule 39(b) (1) Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A. and Rule 75(a) Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. Apparently a designation was never filed by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-17\">Prior to filing his Opening Brief, appellant filed with this Court a document styled \u201cPoints Raised on Appeal.\u201d These four \u201cpoints\u201d are:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-18\">(1) The Court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-19\">(2) The verdict is contrary to the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-20\">(3) The Court erred in charging the jury and in refusing to charge the jury as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-21\">(4) The appellant was denied a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-22\">Possibly, appellant\u2019s \u201cPoints Raised on Appeal\u201d were intended by him to perform the office of specification of errors occurring at trial. He did not set forth a specification of errors in his briefs as required by the rules of this Court. Obviously each of his so-called \u201cpoints\u201d is an attack upon the proceedings at trial in the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-23\">As to point one above noted, the record transmitted to this Court does not show whether appellant made a motion for acquittal at any stage of the proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ings, nor does this record show the ruling of the trial court thereon, if such a motion was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">As to appellant\u2019s point 2, aside from the very brief extract from the testimony of Dupuis (referred to in footnote 1) none of the testimony taken at trial appears in the \u201coriginal papers\u201d transmitted to this Court by the clerk of the lower court or elsewhere in the record before us. In the face of this absence of any record of the testimony at trial, it is impossible to determine whether the verdict of the jury is \u201ccontrary to the weight of evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Point 3 urged by appellant is that the trial court erred in charging the jury, and in refusing to charge the jury, as requested. Since the instructions given were not brought up, we have no way of determining in what respect, if any, the instructions given by the court were erroneous. The \u201coriginal papers\u201d transmitted to this Court do contain certain \u201crequested instructions\u201d submitted by appellant, but there is nothing in this record to indicate that the trial court refused to give these requested instructions, or that the court did, or did not, give equivalent instructions, or instructions that fully protected appellant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Appellant\u2019s point 4 is a blanket charge that he was denied a fair trial. From the scanty record before us, it is impossible to determine in what respect trial procedures might have denied him a fair trial. A judgment based on what is now before us would compel resort to sheer speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Most of appellant\u2019s opening brief in support of his four \u201cpoints\u201d is given over to arguments on what he contends were the facts developed at trial. These arguments are advanced by appellant as though this Court had before it all of the testimony concerning the matters he discusses. Arguments are not a substitute for a record showing just what happened in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">In his briefs appellant asserts that he was denied a fair trial because certain \u201cillegally seized\u201d evidence was used against him at trial, to wit: a portion of heroin, a small measuring spoon, and certain currency. The _ abbreviated record before this Court does not support appellant\u2019s assertions in that:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">1. It does not show that any of the items complained of were ever introduced into evidence as alleged by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">2. If these items were introduced in evidence, there is no showing in the record that at the trial appellant objected to their introduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">3. Though the file of \u201coriginal papers\u201d transmitted by the Clerk of the lower court indicates that at some time prior to trial, appellant moved to suppress this evidence, there is no indication in this file as to how the lower court may have ruled upon this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\"> It is not necessary to discuss in any detail appellant\u2019s arguments in his briefs as to improprieties of government agents in obtaining and executing a search warrant. The record is completely devoid of any showing that evidence connected in any way with the mentioned search warrant was used at trial to obtain appellant\u2019s conviction. Appellant further argues that he was denied the right \u201cto confront the witnesses against him\u201d as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. There is nothing in the record before us to indicate who did or did not testify at appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">Appellant\u2019s final argument in his briefs is that he was denied a fair trial by a prejudicial statement made at trial by one government witness. The <em>only </em>testimony given at the trial which is before this Court is the <em>portion </em>of the testimony of witness Dupuis referred to in footnote 1. Appellant argues in his briefs that there was a statement in the testimony of Dupuis to the effect that appellant was \u201ca three times loser.\u201d The only testimony in the entire case that is before us is the aforementioned portion of the Dupuis testimony, and that part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>of his testimony contains no reference to appellant being \u201ca three times loser.\u201d Since appellant has seen fit to proceed with his appeal on the wholly inadequate record we have described, the judgment must be and is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-24\">. After appellant filed Ms notice of appeal in the lower court, the Clerk of that court transmitted to this Court all of the \u201coriginal papers\u201d (excluding exhibits) in appellant\u2019s file in the instant case. Appatently this step was taken by the said Clerk on his own motion since appellant did not file with the lower court a \u201cdesignation\u201d of any portions of the record, proceedings, and evidence in the instant proceeding in the lower court. This file of \u201coriginal papers\u201d does not contain or include a transcript of any of the <em>testimony </em>taken at the trial of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"ARg\">Subsequently, appellant filed with this Court <em>two documents, </em>one being a reporter\u2019s transcript of proceedings had in the lower court upon appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial and upon sentencing. The second document was a <em>portion </em>of the testimony of one Dupuis, a government witness in appellant\u2019s trial. Aside from the two documents here mentioned, the file of so-called \u201coriginal papers\u201d represents the <em>entire </em>record now before this Court,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
