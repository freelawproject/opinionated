The thrust of the appellant\u2019s complaint is that the defendants were responsible for his false arrest and false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-24\">The record shows that appellant and his wife were convicted of second degree murder by jury verdict in the Superior Court of Grand R\u00e1pids, Michigan, on March 14, 1949; that during those crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>nal proceedings each had freely testified in open court as to the details of the killing and the part each had played in the perpetration of the homicide; and that both admitted that no \u201cthird degree\u201d methods had been employed by the police officers. The district court properly held that there is no basis in this record on which any judgment for damages would be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is ordered to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
