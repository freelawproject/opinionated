The cardboard has two flaps which, when folded back, enable it to stand for display. The appellants sought to register as a \u201cwork of art\u201d under a section of the Copyright Statute, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(g), the actual shaping of the \u201cself-supporting star-shaped photograph bearing phonograph record,\u201d but not the photograph or the recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\"> The appellee, Register of Copyrights, refused registration on the ground that the device is not a work of art and is not subject matter for copyright. Upon his refusal, the appellants sued in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. They prayed (1) for a declaration that their picture-record device is a work of art within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(g); and (2) for an order requiring the Register to register the device as a work of art. Summary judgment having been granted to the Register of Copyrights, the appellants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u201c * * * [T]he Register may properly refuse to accept for deposit and registration \u2018objects not entitled to protection under the law.\u2019 * * * It seems obvious, also, that the Act establishes a wide range of selection within which discretion must be exercised by the Register in determining what he has no power to accept. * * * \u201d Bouve v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., 1941, 74 App.D.C. 271, 273, 122 F.2d 51, 53. The Register\u2019s discretion is not uncontrolled, but is subject to judicial review and correction. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">We hold the appellee was right in determining appellants\u2019 device is not a work of art within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(g). \u201cA thing .is a work of art,\u201d said the Ninth Circuit in Rosenthal v. Stein, 1953, 205 F.2d 633, 635, \u201cif it appears to be within the historical and ordinary conception of the term art.\u201d A cardboard star which stands because of folded flaps does not fall within that conception.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
