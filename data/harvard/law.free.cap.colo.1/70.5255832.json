The last error assigned is for overruling the motion f\u00f3r a new trial. As these different causes, assigned as errors, have not been properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>presented by a bill of exceptions, signed and sealed by the judge before whom the cause was tried, they become no part of the record, and cannot be considered in this court. In <em>Thompson </em>v. Riggs, <em>5 </em>Wall. 663, which is a case very s\u00edmil a,r to this, the whole doctrine in regard to bills of exceptions is very clearly and forcibly stated. As it is presumed, <em>prima facie, </em>that the judgment is correct, it must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
