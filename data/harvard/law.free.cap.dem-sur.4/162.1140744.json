Pro., \u00a7\u00a7 2690, 2814, to permit the former to resign, especially where the beneficiaries of the trust are opposed to such a course.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">Petition by Margaretha Baier, an executrix of, and one of two acting trustees under decedent\u2019s will, for leave to resign as such ; opposed by Edward Baier and others, <em>cestuis que trustent.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-6\">Chas.

The only reason assigned in this petition is embodied in the general allegation that the petitioner is \u201c too busy with her own private matters, and no longer desires to be busied \u201d with her trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Her counsel supplements this claim for relief by pleading her limited knowledge of the English language and a lack of business capacity which amounts to an inability fitly to discharge her duties. He insists that by her retention in office the estate will be incumbered with a \u201c needless appendage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">I find that she had sufficient knowledge of English and of business to claim and receive, under the decrees of October 13th, 1881, and May 10th, 1883, commissions amounting in all to $1,491.76. Her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>petition expressly asserts that the duties that remain to be fulfilled are of a much simpler character than those which have been performed already; and, as her discharge is opposed by the <em>cestuis que trustent, </em>she must continue to play the modest role of needless appendage, until she shows better cause than has yet appeared for being allowed to abandon it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
