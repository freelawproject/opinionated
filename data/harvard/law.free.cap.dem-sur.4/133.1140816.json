He left, him surviving, a widow and ten children, and no child of living or deceased children. By his will, which was dated November 17th, 1873, and admitted to probate April 10th, 1880, after bequeathing to his widow $5,000 per annum, in lieu of dower or other claims, he provided as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-4\">By the fourth clause he gave to four of his children (the issue of his second wife) \u201c one fourth part of the. net income of my estate, to be by my executors hereof appropriated for their benefit, share and share alike, in - such manner and to such extent in amount, in each year, as my said executors, or a majority of them, may judge best, until said four children shall respectively become of age. After which my said executors shall pay over to each of my said four children, yearly, one fourth part of said net income for and during their respective lives, together with all income, if any, that may have accumulated on their respective shares during their minority. And at the death of each of said children, leaving lawful issue, then the part, the income of which was paid to such child, shall be divided equally among such issue.

But if there be no lawful issue, then such part shall be equally divided among the survivors of said six children,\u201d etc., etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">Much of the real property was vacant and unproductive, and subject to mortgages, the interest upon which, with taxes and assessments, exhausted, for the first three years, the income of the productive property, and left a deficit in each year, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">1st year, . \u00a760,688 80</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">2nd year, ....... 10.688 80</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\">3rd year, 984 39</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-9\">Total, .... \u00a772,361 99</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-10\">In the fourth year there was a surplus of $\u00a7,\u00a728.74, At the time of the hearing, there was no person living who had an interest in the question presented, viz., the disposition of this surplus, except testator\u2019s ten children.
