For I should thus be offering a premium to executors for remissness in their duty. They should, at all times, keep distinct and accurate accounts for the inspection of persons interested in the estate (Blauvelt v. Ackerman, 23 <em>N. J. Eq., 495). </em>I do not doubt that the attorney has earned all the compensation he claims by way of counsel fees; but the accounting party, out of his commissions, or otherwise, may make good the amount that I feel compelled to disallow.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
