Pro., \u00a7 2832, subd. 6), the power of the court is subject to a narrower limitation as regards a testamentary guardian, who cannot be removed except upon grounds which would justify it in displacing a testamentary trustee (id., \u00a7\u00a7 2817, 2858).</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-9\">Application for the removal of testamentary guardian.

B. King, deceased, for the removal of Phebe Fullerton, the testamentary guardian of Mrs. King\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>It is provided by the seventh subdivision of \u00a7 2472 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that the Surrogate\u2019s authority to supersede the guardian of an infant \u201c must be exercised in the cases and in the manner prescribed by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">In view of these restrictive provisions, it is manifest that one who is a lawful incumbent of the office of guardian, either by appointment of the Surrogate or by virtue of a testamentary provision, can successfully resist in this court an application for his removal, until such facts and circumstances have been established as furnish statutory warrant for his super-session (Matter of Kerrigan, 2 <em>Civ. Pro., </em>334 ; Ledwith v. Union Trust Co., 2 <em>Dem., </em>439).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The various causes which will justify the Surrogate in removing <em>a guardian appointed under title seventh </em>of the 18th chapter of the Code are fully set forth in the six subdivisions of \u00a7 2832. It is declared, in the last of these subdivisions, that a guardian of the person may be deprived of his office, whenever <em>\u201c </em>the infant\u2019s welfare will be promoted by the appointment of another guardian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The legislature has seen fit to restrain the Surrogate\u2019s authority as regards <em>testamentary guardians </em>within somewhat narrower limitations. He can only direct the removal of such a guardian upon the grounds assigned in \u00a7 2858; that is, <em>\u201c </em>in cases where a testamentary trustee may be removed as prescribed in title sixth of this chapter.\u201d This is a reference to \u00a7 2817, whose second subdivision alone has any possible application to the case at bar. If, within the meaning of that subdivision, this respondent has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>guilty of \u201c misconduct in the execution of her trust,\u201d and has thereby become \u201cunfit\u201d to be continued in her office, she must be removed; otherwise, the Surrogate is powerless to displace her.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Now, there are no allegations in this petition that seem to me to require comment, except such as are in some way associated with the shameless behavior of the respondent\u2019s son, Richard Butler, towards the children, vdiom their mother had, by testamentary direction, entrusted to the respondent\u2019s care. I am so profoundly impressed with the truth of these revelations, and with the desirability of placing these infants under new conditions, not only for preventing future mischiefs, but for effacing from their minds, if possible, the memory of indignities which they have already suffered, that, if I had power, under the circumstances here existing, to substitute another guardian in place of this respondent, I should not hesitate to exercise it. But have I such power ?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">It is not suggested that the respondent connived at her son\u2019s disgraceful practices, and it. is not claimed that she ever heard of them until about the time when they came to the knowdedge of the petitioner. Nor does it appear that she knew or had reason to believe that evil consequences wrere likely to flow from the intimate relations that were allowed to exist between these children of a common household. Her treatment of her son, since the discoveries which gave rise to the present proceeding, has furnished no just cause for criticism. She is taken to task by petitioner\u2019s counsel for protesting her belief in the boy\u2019s innocence. But her credulity is perhaps not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>unnatural in a mother, and it does not 'seem to have betrayed her into any act or omission that can fairly be interpreted as \u201cmisconduct in the execution of her trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">This petition must, therefore, be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
