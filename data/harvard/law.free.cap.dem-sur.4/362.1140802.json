Pro., \u00a7 2804, upon a petition to compel him, either alone or in conjunction with his successor, to pay to the petitioner income of the trust, received by him before his removal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-8\">An answer to a petition presented under Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 2804, praying for a decree directing the payment of money by a testamentary trustee, wherein respondent asserts\u2014that he is not possessed of knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to whether petitioner\u2019s claim is valid and legal or not\u2014does not oblige the court to dismiss the petition, under id., \u00a7 2805.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-9\">Petition by Mary F. Moorhouse, a legatee and devisee under decedent\u2019s will, praying for a citation directed to Mary Ann Hutchinson, who had been removed from office as executrix thereof and trustee thereunder, and to the Central Trust Company, her successor, and others, requiring them to show cause why petitioner should not have an advance of $20,000 out of the funds of the estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-10\">O. <em>J. </em>Wells, <em>for petitioner.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-11\">Chas. H. Woodruff, <em>for Mary Ann Hutchinson.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b382-12\">The Surrogate.</author>\n<p id=\"A0E\">I must deny this application, so far as it seeks to compel the discharged trustee to exercise any power that she may be supposed to possess for directing, either separately or in conjunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>with her successor, the disposition of the surplus income of this estate, and the payment of any sum to the petitioner out of any such surplus received by such trustee before her removal. For granting relief of that character, in a proceeding such as the present, I find no warrant in the statutes. This proceeding is founded upon \u00a7 2804 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and can properly be instituted only against a testamentary trustee in office. This respondent was displaced from office in August, 1885, at the petitioner\u2019s instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The answer of the present trustee undertakes to set forth facts showing that it is doubtful whether the claim of the petitioner is valid and legal. The trustee fails, however, to make such a denial of the legality or validity of that claim as necessitates, when taken in connection with the alleged facts, a dismissal of the petition under \u00a7 2805. This section provides that, to entitle a respondent to such dismissal, he must, in addition to the allegation of facts, deny, either absolutely, or upon information and belief, the validity or legality of the petitioner\u2019s claim. The respondent in the case at bar simply asserts that he is not possessed of knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to whether the claim is valid and legal or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">I shall allow the respondent Trust Co. ten days within which to amend its answer in this particular, should it be so advised, and in that event the petition will be dismissed (Bank v. Camp, 3 <em>Dem., </em>278 ; Hurlburt v. Durant, 88 <em>N. Y., </em>121). Otherwise it will be further considered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
