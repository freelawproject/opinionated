A. Arnold against J. W. Jermon and S. A. Jermon, his wife. The first count of the declaration set out, that Mrs. Jermon was indebted to the plaintiff for goods, &amp;c., and work and labor found, provided and used about the improvement, &amp;c., of real estate, her separate estate, at her special instance and request; that she had assumed to pay it, &amp;c. The second count was that the \u201c <em>defendants\u201d </em>were indebted to the plaintiff for goods, &amp;c., work and labor found, applied, &amp;c., about real estate, -being her separate estate, at her special instance, &amp;c., and at the special instance, &amp;c., of J.

Assignment of the mortgage, dated June 5th 1867, from the Reliance Insurance Company to Edward Lyon, Thomas Lyon and George W. Taylor. To July Term 1867, the assignees of the mortgage issued a scire facias on it against George W. Roberts, the mortgagor, which was returned \u201c nihil.\u201d An alias scire facias in the same form was issued returnable to the 1st Monday of August 1867, which was also returned \u201c nihil;\u201d judgment was taken September 2d 1867 and damages assessed at $5115.83. A number of writs of levari facias wrere issued on this judgment, the first to January Term 1868 and sales made under them, in which either the purchasers neglected to comply with their bids or the sales were set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-10\">The 5th pluries levari facias issued September 18th 1869. To this levari the sheriff returned that he had sold to the defendants in this ejectment lot No. 1 for $10,000, and lot No. 2 for $2000, and had taken their receipt as plaintiffs in the execution for $5748.57, and brought the .remainder of the purchase-money into court. The deed to the purchasers was acknowledged December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>4th. 1869. On the 13th of December 1869 a pluries vend. ex. was issued on the Arnold judgment, and lot No. 3, being 16 feet on Broad street, was sold to Edward Lyon (defendant) for $2000, and deed acknowledged January 22d 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">The plaintiffs submitted the following points all which were refused:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\">1. The Orphans\u2019 Court sale of January 13th 1864 divested the lien of the mortgage of the Reliance Mutual Insurance Company, dated April 13th 1861, recorded in mortgage book A. C. H., No. 9, page 71, &amp;c., and substituted the money arising from the sale in the place of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-8\">2. After the Orphans\u2019 Court sale, the Reliance Mutual Insurance Company could only look to the fund in the hands of Pratt Roberts, Ann Roberts and Charles W. Roberts, for satisfaction of the debt secured by the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-9\">3. The lien of the mortgage having been divested by the Orphans\u2019 .Court sale, if the jury find from the evidence that it was not revived or continued as a lien by any writing signed by the parties, the making of the conveyance subject to its payment, would not reinstate it as a lien upon the premises, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-10\">4. After the lien of the mortgage of the Reliance Mutual Insurance Company had been divested by the Orphans\u2019 Court sale, a new lien could only have been given to the insurance company by the\u2019 creation of a new mortgage, and the plaintiffs are entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-11\">5. The subsequent issuing of scire facias upon the mortgage, and recovery of judgment, were ineffectual to create any lien, and the judgment was void, and no title passed at a sheriff\u2019s sale under the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-12\">6. The title of a married woman cannot be divested by a judgment and sheriff\u2019s sale, unless the record shows her liability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-13\">7. The entry of a judgment against a married woman by her confession in an action in which some counts in the <em>narr. </em>show a good cause of action against her and others, show only a cause of action against her husband for the same claim, does not create a presumption that the judgment is valid against her, and the burden of proof is on the purchaser at a sheriff\u2019s sale, under such a judgment to show her liability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-14\">8. If the jury find from the evidence that the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale acquired the title by any trick or fraud, the verdict must <em>be </em>for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-15\">9. If the jury find from the evidence that the judgment of Arnold was paid by the sale of premises No. 1, no title passed by the .sale of premises Nos. 2 and 3, and as to these two lots, the verdict must be for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-16\">Judge Williams further charged :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\u201c This is an action of ejectment against landlord and tenants. The evidence shows an application by Roberts\u2019 heirs to the Orphans\u2019 Court to sell this property. It was sold to John Rice for $10,500. Ordinarily, this sale would have discharged any mortgage. But before the sale was completed an agreement was made to take $5500 cash and let an - old mortgage for $5000 remain. The Orphans\u2019 Court approved this, and it was done. There was nothing wrong here, and the only persons affected were Roberts\u2019 heirs, Rice and the mortgagee. The heirs did not object, and the' mortgagee did not object, and Rice certainly did not object. Then the mortgagee assigned the mortgage to defendants. They issued a scire facias and obtained judgment. Many applications were, made by these plaintiffs to stay proceedings, and there were many executions. Finally, there was a sheriff\u2019s sale of two lots to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\">\u201c The other lot was sold under a judgment obtained for materials furnished to this very property. The judgment was confessed by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. They most probably had authority, and there has been no evidence offered to impeach the judgment. The sale under it is, therefore, good. The plaintiffs have been fighting the title to this property with unusual pertinacity, and they have had unusual opportunities of being heard. But the time has come when we must cease to hear them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-7\">\u201c There is no evidence of trick or fraud in acquiring title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-8\">\u201cNo objection was raised that more property was sold than was sufficient to pay debt.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-9\">He instructed the jury to find for the defendants; they accordingly so found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-10\">The plaintiffs took a writ of error, and assigned for er-ror the refusal of their points and the charge of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-11\"><em>JD. Q. Harrington </em>and <em>F. 0. Brewster, </em>for plaintiffs in error.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACp\">Judgment having been entered against the mortgagor on two nihils, without notice to the terre-tenant, she can, in an ejectment against a purchaser at a sheriff\u2019s sale, make any defence which she might have set up on the trial of the scire facias : Mevey\u2019s Appeal, 4 Barr 80; Menges <em>v. </em>Oyster, 4 W. &amp; S. 20. If by any reason the lien had been divested, no title passed at the sheriff\u2019s sale. As the proceedings are <em>in rem, </em>the foundation of the judgment is the alleged lien of the mortgage of which they are attempting to enforce the collection : Wilson <em>v. </em>McCullough, 7 Harris 77. An Orphans\u2019 Court sale is a judicial sale, and divests liens: Moliere <em>v. </em>Noe, 4 Dall. 450; Gilmore <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 17 S. &amp; R. 276; Presbyterian Corp. <em>v. </em>Wallace, 3 Rawle 109; McLanahan <em>v. </em>Wyant, 1 Penna. R. 96; Bowers <em>v. </em>Oyster, 3 Id. 239; Cadmus <em>v. </em>Jackson, 2 P. F. Smith 295. After the mortgage was paid by the sale, it had performed its office. An attempt to revive is equivalent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>creation of a new mortgage: Kinley <em>v. </em>Hill, 4 W. &amp; S. 426. A mortgage is but a security for the payment of a debt, and when that is paid or extinguished, it can never be resuscitated: Wentz <em>v. </em>Dehaven, 1 S. &amp; R. 317; Anderson <em>v. </em>Neff, 11 Id. 208; Ayres <em>v. </em>Wattson, 7 P. F. Smith 360. The recital in the deed to Mr. Rice had not the effect to revive the lien which had been discharged, and the subsequent sheriff\u2019s sale conveyed no title. In a deed-poll the grantee makes no covenant: Campbell <em>v. </em>Shrum, 3 Watts 60. If by the deed from Roberts to Rice the grantee covenants to pay the debt, no scire\u00b0facias would lie on the mortgage, and the remedy would be in covenant on the deed : Walter <em>v. </em>Physick, 5 Barr 193. The words in the habendum making the conveyance subject to the payment of a mortgage debt are void. There is no covenant on part of Mr. Rice to pay the debt: Lancaster Bank <em>v. </em>Myley, 1 Harris 544; Shoenberger <em>v. </em>Hay, 4 Wright 132; Maule <em>v. </em>Weaver, 7 Barr 329 ; Tyler <em>v. </em>Moore, 6 Wright 386; Miners\u2019 Appeal, 11 P. F. Smith 283. The recital of unpaid purchase-money in the deed does not make it a lien on the premises conveyed: Bear <em>v. </em>Whisler, 7 Watts 144; Neas\u2019s Appeal, 7 Casey 293; Hiester v. Green, 12 Wright 96. If the mortgage was discharged by the Orphans\u2019 Court sale, the assignees acquired no title by the sheriff\u2019s sale: Samms <em>v. </em>Alexander, 3 Yeates 268 ; Hoffman <em>v. </em>Strohecker, 7 Watts 88 ; Gibbs <em>v. </em>Neely, Id. 307; Caldwell <em>v. </em>Walters, 6 Harris 85; Fetterman <em>v. </em>Murphy, 4 Watts 424.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-6\">. As to the judgment of Arnold, the judgment against the wife must be founded upon a <em>narr., </em>which discloses her liability only, and not a joint liability with her husband: Park <em>v. </em>Kleeber, 1 Wright 251, 254. A joint promise by the husband and wife is but the promise of the husband: Cummings <em>v. </em>Miller, 3 Grant 146. The question of lien as against Mrs. Jermon must be determined by inspection of the record: Finley\u2019s Appeal, 17 P. F. Smith 453 ; Swayne <em>v. </em>Lyon, Id. 436. A judgment entered upon the bond of a married woman is a nullity, and a sale of her property on such a judgment conveys no title: Keiper <em>v. </em>Helfricker, 6 Wright 325; Steinman <em>v. </em>Ewing, 7 Id. 63 ; Brunner\u2019s Appeal, 11 Id. 67; Caldwell <em>v. </em>Walters, 6 Harris 79.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-7\">When the proceeds of a sale are sufficient to satisfy a writ, its force is spent, and the plaintiff in a judgment can acquire no title to property of a defendant by a sale after his judgment is paid. He is guilty of actual fraud: Gilbert <em>v. </em>Hoffman, 2 Watts 66; McKennan <em>v. </em>Pry, 6 Id. 137.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-8\"><em>A. T.

F. Smith 51; Ashmead <em>v. </em>McCarthur, 17 P. F. Smith 326 ; Loomis\u2019s Appeal, 10 Harris 318. The conveyance to Mrs. Jermon under and subject to the_ payment of the mortgage, and her acceptance of the deed, her retention of the purchase-money to that amount, &amp;c., made the mortgage debt her own : Campbell <em>v. </em>Shrum, 3 Watts 60; and was binding upon her, although she was <em>a, feme </em>covert, for not even a married woman can retain both the land and the consideration: Patterson <em>v. </em>Robinson, 1 Casey 81; Ramborger <em>v. </em>Ingraham, 2 Wright 147; Glass <em>v. </em>Warwick, 4 Id. 140; Bortz <em>v. </em>Bortz, 12 Id. 382.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-6\">Mrs. Jermon was liable under the contract set forth in the first count, and a judgment thereon would have been valid; for a married woman\u2019s contract for the improvement and repair of her separate estate is binding upon her as being constructively within the exception introduced-by the Act of 1848; Lippincott <em>v. </em>Hopkins, 7 P.

But when the purchaser agreed to take the deed subject to the payment of the mortgage, and that much of the purchase-money was deducted from the sum bid, at which the premises were sold, and this was sanctioned by the court, by permitting the acknowledgment of the deed, reciting the consideration as $6500 and the subjection to the mortgage for the remainder, the purchaser estopped himself from denying the continued existence and lien of the mortgage. When Rice, the purchaser, sold to Mrs. Jermon, he recognised the mortgage and conveyed to her subject to it. She, therefore, is clearly estopped by her deed from denying the encumbrance subject to which she bought. Clearly she had no defence to the mortgage. It constituted a part of her purchase-money, and was binding upon her on the principles of Patterson <em>v. </em>Robinson, 1 Casey 81, and Ramborger v. Ingraham, 2 Wright 146. As to the premises number three, it may be conceded that the judgment against Mrs. Jermon was erroneous and might have been reversed upon a writ of error, but this would not destroy the sheriffs sale made under the judgment while standing in full force and unreversed. This judgment was obtained by W. A. Arnold, with whom Lyons and Taylor had no connection. Conceding that sufficient real estate had been sold to satisfy the judgment, yet no appropriation had been made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>to it out of the proceeds of sale, and no satisfaction entered. Lyon and Taylor being strangers to the judgment were not responsible for the act of the plaintiff, supposing that he was aware of the fact that the former sales would have reached and satisfied his judgment. It was the duty of Mrs. Jermon to have moved in the matter, if she thought the judgment was in fact satisfied by the former sales. But permitting the sale to be made and the deed acknowledged, and never having taken out a writ of error upon the judgment, it does not lie in her mouth now to deny the validity of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
