On the 30th of March 1867, all the children having arrived at age, an amicable partition was made, under which Elizabeth conveyed to Henry and James the land afterwards sold by the sheriff as Henry\u2019s, and they conveyed to Elizabeth another piece of their father\u2019s land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-12\">On the 28th of September 1869, James conveyed to Henry his interest in the land assigned \u2019to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-13\">On the 11th of November 1869, the widow of the one part and Henry and Elizabeth of the other part entered into an agreement reciting, amongst other things, the amicable partition and final conveyance to Henry; also \u201c That Margaret Hughes is entitled to. her dower in said lands as widow of James Hughes, deceased; and that to avoid proceedings at law and to fix upon the sum which shall be paid her in semi-annual payments during her life by Henry and Elizabeth, and the amount each shall pay, and to secure the payment of the same upon the aforesaid premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-14\">\u201c The parties agree upon (three men) to decide and fix-upon amount to be paid each year by Henry and Elizabeth, to be paid in semi-annual payments, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>\u201c </em>And Henry and Elizabeth jointly and severally covenant and agree well and truly to pay to said Margaret or her assigns annually during her life the sum awarded to be paid her, in semiannual payments; and that this agreement and the sum or sums so awarded to be paid annually to said Margaret or her assigns, and the said award when made hereafter, hereon endorsed, and each and every of the same shall be and remain a true claim and demand upon and against the aforesaid described lands, and said lands to be and remain charged therewith and liable for the payment thereof, and in case of failure at any time or times to pay any money becoming due upon this agreement or the award made in pursuance of same, it shall be lawful for said Margaret Hughes to sue out a writ of scire facias hereon, and for the Court of Common Pleas to enter judgment thereon for such sums as to said court shall seem meet and proper, to enable said Margaret or her assigns to collect any moneys that then are or may thereafter become due upon this agreement or upon said award, &amp;c., &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">\u201c It is further agreed in case of default for thirty days in said annual payments, said Margaret may if she elects declare this agreement at an end and proceed to recover and enforce hor claims or right of dower in aforesaid premises, without exception, loss or hindrance by or from the parties of the second part to this agreement, but said election to be in writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-7\">\u201c The award of arbitrators to be endorsed upon this agreement, to be without appeal and final between the parties, and to become part of the agreement, so that same may be made and entered of record herewith, and the recorder is authorized to enter same of record.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-8\">The award of the referees endorsed on the agreement decided that Henry and Elizabeth should pay to the widow the annual sum of $225 <em>in </em>semi-annual payments ; the first payment of $112.50 to be made on the 11th day of May, A. d. 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-9\">Both the agreement and award were acknowledged and, on the 22d day of November 1869, entered of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-10\">Before the execution and recording of the agreement and award, judgments to a large amount were entered against Henry Hughes in favor of various parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-11\">Judgments to a large amount were also entered against Henry Hughes in favor of various persons after recording the agreement and award.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-12\">Henry died about December 1st 1870. His real estate was sold by the sheriff August 29th 1873; the proceeds, $6267.95, were brought into court and H. M. Seely, Esq., appointed auditor to report distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-13\">Before him the widow claimed that the agreement and. award, having been duly recorded, created a lien on the land of Henry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Hughes in her favor for the amount awarded to be paid to her, for which she was entitled to come upon the proceeds of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">The auditor reported as his opinion that it was not competent for the parties by the agreement to create a lien upon the land to secure the payments to the widow; he therefore awarded the fund to the judgment creditors of Henry Hughes, excluding the widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-7\">The -widow excepted to the report of the auditor; that he should have awarded to her all the money arising from the sheriff\u2019s sale after payment of the liens entered before the 22d of November 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-8\">The court sustained the exceptions, Dreher, P. J., saying:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-9\">* * * \u201cAny writing that is a valid mortgage in Pennsylvania, it seems to me, must be within our recording acts. I cannot conceive how there can be a valid mortgage that may not be recorded if acknowledged, or the execution thereof proven in the mode prescribed by the recording acts. The sheriff\u2019s sale was by virtue of an execution upon a judgment prior in lien to Mrs. Hughes\u2019s mortgage, and therefore no question can arise as to whether the lien of the mortgage was discharged by the sale. The lien being discharged the case only looks to the fund now in court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-10\">\u201c I do not see how the question, whether Mrs. Hughes\u2019s claim of dower was valid or not, can affect her right under the mortgage. The parties were competent to contract in relation thereto and actually did contract. It is certainly binding as between themselves, and there is no allegation of fraud as to creditors, and therefore whether she could or could not have maintained an action of dower is immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-11\">\u201c The mortgage covers Elizabeth\u2019s property as well as that of Henry Hughes, and by the agreement they were each to pay one-half of the annuity. Henry\u2019s property has been sold by the sheriff, and the proceeds are now in court. The mortgage is still a lien on Elizabeth\u2019s land, and I think that the widow should claim of the fund in court only the one-half of the annuity. She is entitled to the cash value of the one-half of the annuity, at the date of the sheriff\u2019s sale, and in addition thereto the amount that was then due and unpaid by Henry. The report is referred back to the auditor with the instruction to make distribution in accordance with this opinion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-12\">'. The auditor reported in accordance with the decree of the court, awarding to the widow \u201c for one-half the annuity and interest due at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale,\u201d and \u201c for half the cash value of the annuity at the date of the sheriff\u2019s sale, $1280.92.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-13\">The balance of the fund did not reach to pay the subsequent lien creditors of Henry Hughes. They excepted to this report of the auditor; it was confirmed, and Jesse C. Dexter, with other creditors, appealed to the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-14\">They assigned the decree of confirmation for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number><em>G-.

It is an instrument under seal, admitting an estate in the widow in the land, at the time of they amicable partition among the children, and charging the land with the payment of the annual sum to her in lieu thereof, according to the terms of the writing. To this charge the other parties bound themselves firmly by their covenants, when ascertained in the mode fixed upon by themselves ; and provided for a record thereof, as notice to all persons who might take title after-wards to the land. Now, that an encumbrance maybe fixed upon land by deed, following it into the hands of subsequent purchasers, is too well settled to require a citation of precedents. Such is the nature of a mortgage, of a ground-rent deed, of an annuity, and of a subjection by the terms of a conveyance. It is the direct aGt of tbe owners of the land, whereby they fix a charge upon it, and is quite as effective as the lien of a judgment, which is a mere incident at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Decree affirmed, with costs, and appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
