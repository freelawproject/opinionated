As a general rule a constructive trust as to personal rights may he asserted at any time within six years after the knowledge of the facts creating it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-6\">2. Such trust is barred after six years, but laches for a shorter period, aided by other circumstances, will bar the right.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-7\">3. Plaintiffs filed a bill alleging that they and defendants were associated in the formation of a company; that defendants purchased- lands and sold them to the corporation at a price much beyond cost, concealing the price .paid, and thereby a resulting trust arose, and praying for payment of the profit, &amp;e. Under the circumstances in the case the bill was dismissed on account of laches in filing it four and one-half years after knowledge of the facts.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-8\">4. The bill was by plaintiffs, <em>\u201c </em>and all other stockholders,\u201d &amp;c.; the relief prayed for was that defendants should pay to the corporation. This was to obtain relief through the equitable rights of the corporation, and required a consideration of the knowledge and conduct of the corporation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-9\">5. The land was conveyed to the corporation April 8th 1863 ; the bill was filed March 19th 1870; the minutes of the same April showed the facts which were the ground of the complaint. Nothing was done to establish a constructive trust. In October next the company authorized a loan, to prevent which nothing was done. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff thereby acquiesced in it. \u2022</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-10\">6. Money was borrowed, judgments were obtained against the'company, and all their property sold and bought in for the creditor\u2019s. These new business arrangements having intervened after the plaintiffs had knowledge, their delay .was unreasonable and was fatal to the bill.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-11\">7. Although the transaction was originally voidable, the acquiescence for less than six years of those who might have avoided it having induced the offending parties to believe that it was not to be questioned, barred the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-12\">8.

On the 18th of December all the defendants except Wood, Shaw and William\u2019 Harris filed answers. On the 16th of December, a replication was filed. Testimony was taken in the cause until June 15th 3872, and on the 1st of July and the 24th of October 1872, respectively, Charles Wells and H. F.

On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the 11th of January 1873, on affidavit of plaintiffs an amendment was made, allowing the plaintiffs to add the names of Adolph E.

Company, for mining zinc ore, and manufacturing and selling zinc paint in the counties of Northampton and Lehigh.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-10\">In March 1864, the defendants formed the design of making profit from land in Blair county of which they had heard, as containing zinc ore; and they announced that they had secured lands containing zinc ore and -were forming a company to develop them ; the capital stock to consist of two hundred thousand shares at $5 per share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-11\">In consequence of these representations, about March 24th 1864, Evans, plaintiff, took one thousand shares and paid $5000 for them, believing that he thus became an original subscriber; at the filing of the bill he still owned three hundred shares. Kuhn, plaintiff, took six thousand shares and paid $30,000 for them, believing the stock belonged to the company and the purchase-money would go into their treasury ; he still held all the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-12\">Kuhn took no receipt, but Evans and others who subscribed for stock, took a receipt in the following form :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-13\">\u201c Received of dollars, in full, for a subscription to</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-14\">shares of stock in a company to be hereafter organized, under the title of the Keystone Zinc Company, with a capital of one million of dollars, divided into two hundred thousand shares, at five dollars each.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-15\">Subsequently certificates for the number of shares subscribed for by the plaintiffs were received by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-16\">Large sums of money wrere thus received by the defendants on these representations for stock; this money was in part paid to the owners of the land and the remainder appropriated to the defendants\u2019 own use and never entered on the books of the company. Whilst taking measures to obtain these moneys, the defendants were negotiating for the land and taking measures to secure.them for the company which they were organizing. On the day Kuhn paid for his stock, C. L. Borie, acting for the defendants, obtained from Lewis, one of the defendants, a contract to convey to him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Borie, two tracts of land in Blair county, containing together 186 acres, for $100,000. On the next day, 0. L. and H. P. Borie, defendants, obtained from H. B. and Gr. N. Tatham a contract to convey certain leaseholds in the same county for $50,000; these were also secured for the company by the two Bories with the intention of vesting the title in the company. The plaintiffs averred that all .,the defendants were jointly concerned in the common object of endeavoring to make an illegal profit by buying lands for a company which they were forming at one price and selling to the company at a higher one. At the same time the defendants were \u2022engaged in obtaining a charter and organizing under it. On March 28th 1864 there was enacted an act supplementary to Act of 1854 before mentioned, extending its provisions to Blair county. The company was organized by a meeting of Charles Wister and two others of the corporators named in the Act of 1854; at this meeting a book for subscriptions for stock was opened and subscriptions were made by several of the defendants ; before any money had been paid to the company for stock or a conveyance made to them and without notice to the plaintiffs and others to whom stock had been sold, C. P. Bayard was elected president, C. L. Borie, treasurer, H. P. Borie, Gr. $. Eex, E. Y. Maitland, J. P. Bell and Charles Wister, directors. The defendants were affected with a fiduciary relation to those whose money was thus obtained and were bound to pay for any stock which they took, and to put all the money which they received for stock into the company\u2019s treasury, and to buy the lands at the lowest prices without any profit to themselves, and every right and interest in the land bought from Lewis and the Tathams belonged to the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\">On the morning of the 8th of April 1864, the day after the land had been paid for by defendants and the title made to C. L. Borie, they procured a meeting of the directors, who resolved to buy the land from C. L. Borie for $200,000; they afterwards procured another meeting in the afternoon of the same day, at which they rescinded this resolution and passed one to pay Borie for the land by one hundred and ninety thousand shares of stock at the par value of $5 per share, that being the entire stock of the company except ten thousand shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-7\">These one hundred and ninety thousand shares, or the money raised by the sale of them, were divided among the defendants. This resolution actually passed to Borie and the defendants the cash proceeds of shares already sold, which were far more than all that had been paid for the land; and also the unsold shares, if any, to fill up the one hundred and ninety thousand shares. The sum actually paid for the land was $200,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-8\">The defendants owned or controlled a majority of the stock of the company, and some of them were its directors and officers, and neglected and refused to take measures or to permit the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>to take any measures against themselves for the purpose of granting the relief the plaintiffs prayed for; and that, therefore, no relief through the intervention of the company could be obtained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">The plaintiffs prayed:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-7\">1. That the defendants might he compelled, by the decree of this court, to pay into the treasury of the company $5 per share for each of said one hundred and ninety thousand shares of said stock so allotted or transferred by resolution of April \u25a0 8th 1864, to defendants, or to Borie for them, with interest, deducting the sums actually bond, fide paid for the lands so acquired for said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-8\">2. Or, if the court shall be of opinion that such a decree is more consonant with equity, might compel defendants to pay into the treasury of the company, with interest, all sums received by them or any of them from sales of said one hundred and ninety thousand shares, or any part of them, less what they paid for said lands, and might surrender all of said one hundred and ninety thousand shares which they have not so sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-9\">3. That if such a course be necessary in order to enable the court to reach such a decree, or prepare the way therefor, the company might be compelled to take such steps, and commence such proceedings against said defendants as may be or become proper or necessary for the purpose of enforcing against them the redress sought by this bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-10\">4. Further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-11\">The bill asked for relief by reason of a trust arising by implica tion of law, more than five years before filing the bill; the plaintiffs were therefore barred by the 6th section of the Act of April 22d 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-12\">The individual defendants answered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-13\">Lewis was the owner of the farm in Blair county, and had also an interest (with one Taylor) to the extent of one-half in the Tatham leasehold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-14\">For at least a year before March 1864, Lewis had been speaking to C. L. Borie and Hopkins, and had made many representations as to its value. Wister also had endeavored to induce his co-defendants to unite with him in purchasing the lands of Lewis, the inducements being its intrinsic value, and the certainty of being able to sell at an advance; no determination had been reached as to the. mode of turning it to profit. On March 1st 1864, Wister procured from Lewis a contract to sell his farm in Blair county to C. L. Borie, Hopkins and, Wister, the price \"being $100,000, with an option for a month to buy or refuse; the contract was secured by Wister without consultation with the others, his object being to secure for himself power to participate in the purchase. Whilst these three had this option, Tatham asked Borie to unite in forming a company with leasehold property held by them; Borie said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>he and his associates thought of doing that with the Lewis property, and suggested to Tatham to join both properties in one company; the Tathams were informed that the Lewis property would be put in at $100*000, the Tatham at $50,000, two-thirds of the stock to belong to the owners of the Lewis land, and one-third to the owners of the Tatham land. Tathams declined this, but gave Borie by writing an option till April 1st to buy their property at $50,000. On the 24th of March Wister urged Borie to close with Lewis, assuring Borie that he, Lewis, could immediately resell at a profit. C. L. Borie, for himself and Henry Borie, said he would sell at $200,000, which would yield $50,000 profit, the Tatham property to be included, though no reference had been made to that property, Wister believing from inquiries that he could at that price find purchasers, they intending to form a company, the land to be converted into stock. This was the only proposal made to these defendants, and on this they consented to join. Borie, at Wister\u2019s request, drew a paper to be signed by persons entering into the project; it was as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">\u201c We, the undersigned, hereby agree to pay to Mr. Charles Wister or his assigns the sums opposite to our names, or a pro ratfi proportion of the same towards the purchase of the zinc property in Blair county, embracing the entire interest of Mr. G. T. Lewis in a farm or farms containing two hundred acres of ground, more or less, certificates of stock to be issued to us as soon as the company can be organized; cash to be paid on execution of the deed in the name of such party as we may agree upon for a sum not exceeding $200,000.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\">Borie then bought the property from Lewis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-7\">C. L. Borie had expected that the $100,000 would purchase Lewis\u2019s interest in the leasehold as well as his farm, but Lewis declined and. required that he should be paid for his leasehold interest as much as the Tathams were to receive; this interest had not previously been referred to, and Borie had no right to agree for the' others. He entered into a contract for this interest for himself and H. Borie, intending the others take it if they chose. Whster procured signatures to the paper to the extent of $130,000, but it was not deemed by any that there was a binding contract, both because there were but $130,000 subscribed; and the contract was but verbal with Borie, although he had contracted in writing with Lewis. Borie was then unwilling to sell unless the new interest in the leasehold was included, and the price increased to $250,000 ; of this \"Wister and others-who had signed the paper were informed. There was then no binding contract affecting the title bought by Borie from Lewis, except Wister and Hopkins, nor any supposition then that Borie could not vary his offer. One of the signers to the paper proposed that they should give the Bories and their associates forty thousand shares of stock in the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>intended to be organized, in addition to the cash price they had agreed to pay. This being agreed to by Borie, he, on behalf of his firm and others who had authorized him to do so, subscribed enough to make up the $200,000 and to form a corporation, the capital of which was to be the land and the stock to be issued to the owners of the property, in the proportion of their interests. There were then added to the paper the names of the several persons on whose behalf Borie undertook to sign, and the whole amount of $200,000 filled, by subscriptions in sums of $20,000, $10,000 and $7500. The names of all the original individual defendants, except Woods, were to the paper, and also the names of A. E. Borie, Trotter, Lewis and Bartlett, afterwards brought in as defendants. At this time no one was interested but those who had signed the paper, and none of those who had originally signed were bound, because of the change after they had signed; but on the same day they ratified the change. None of them supposed that the Bories, Wister or Hopkins had been their agents. They were then under no obligation to apply for a charter, and when they obtained it none wmre included but those whom the grantees of the franchises admitted as associates; and, therefore, when the corporation was formed it was bound by the terms of the purchase, which had- been settled before the contract was applied for. When the Bories, Wister and Hopkins agreed to sell to those about to form a corporation, there was a refusal at the cost, and a demand for an advance, which was accepted. There was then no power in anybody to require the purchasers to sell on any terms, and no pretence that they acted as agent for any one. Those who bought and agreed to convey to the corporation, agreed subsequently amongst themselves to contribute ten thousand shares, to be sold and the proceeds paid to the company for wmrking capital. The organizers of the company agreed to pay for the land $200,000 and forty thousand shares. One hundred and sixty thousand shares were received by the owners of the property as the price of giving it to the corporation, and they sold ten thousand shares of the one'hundred and sixty thousand, and gave the proceeds to the corporation as working capital. Eorty thousand of the one hundred and fifty thousand remaining, were sold to reimburse the cash paid for the property. One hundred thousand shares, more than a year afterwards, were distributed amongst the owners in proportion to their rights. The larger portion of these shares was still owned by these parties. Twenty-eight thousand shares were sold more than a year after the company was organized at the then market price; and it is impossible for any one claiming in the right of the corporation to demand, as the property of the corporation, the difference between the cost of the property and the amount realized by the purchasers out of their stock sold, on the ground that C. L. Borie and his associates bought as agents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>of the corporation. On the 24th of March 1864 the contract was signed to buy from the purchasers from Lewis. The Tatham property was not included. Some of those buyers, deeming the contract complete, offered to sell their proportion of shares of the stock they were to receive. They had offers to take it at the price named by them. These offers were without representations as to capital or property or cost; all that was stated was that it was a zinc farm, and the price five dollars per share. Neither of the plaintiffs/ were amongst those offering to buy; those who did offer were after-^ wards referred to the broker authorized to sell for all the owners jointly; they made their contract with him, paid him the money and received their stock. All these were \u201c the private acts of the individuals who, expecting to complete an inchoate bargain, had in anticipation proposed or agreed to sell the property they would' receive if that bargain had been carried out. That bargain was never made, as has Been stated. A distinct one was substituted, and under it these purchasers received the stock they had offered to sell, but on very different terms from those anticipated when they proposed selling. They submit that none of them are in any manner liable to the corporation by reason of any such transaction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">Harris, an expecting purchaser, on March 24th, after the contract of that date had been signed, supposing the transaction was settled, told Kuhn there was a zinc stock \u201c we are about buying on the market, and I think money can be made on it. The price is five dollars.\u201d There was no statement as to the location or cost of the property. They denied that Evans through Fisher made any contract by which he got any right to stock before March 28th. Fisher applied for one thousand shares of stock to Fox, who, supposing all that had been authorized <em>to be </em>sold had been sold at five dollars, agreed to sell at six dollars. Fisher accepted. Fox learning that the broker had not sold all he had been authorized to sell at five dollars, relieved Fisher from the sale, and referred him to Maitland, their broker, from whom, on the 28th of March, he bought one thousand shares for $5000. The defendants insist that neither the corporation nor the plaintiffs litigating in their name can claim relief under these circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-7\">On the 25th of March, at a meeting of some of the owners, it was ascertained that some had sold their stock. C. L. Borie being dissatisfied with this because it would interfere with the sale of his forty thousand shares, it was agreed that all sales should be by a common broker, and be made pro rat\u00e1.; those who had given orders to individual owners were turned over to the broker, and through him all sales were made; it was agreed ten thousand shares, to be contributed pro rat\u00e1,, should be sold for working capital; this was done and the proceeds paid to the corporation after its organization. It was also agreed that one hundred thousand shares <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>should be sold. Borie at that meeting said that as stock could not be issued until after the corporation should be organized, if any were sold and paid for before, a memorandum should be given to the purchasers of the fact, and for that purpose the form of receipt mentioned as having been given to Evans was prepared and the recital that the money was paid by subscription, is untrue if implying that the money was paid on a subscription to a corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">Arrangements were then made for procuring a charter; the charter of 1854 being under the control of one of their number, on their application, was extended to Blair county; the corporators, under the Act of 1854, associated whith them those who desired it, and they organized, elected officers, and prepared to issue stock; the purchasers of shares did not then- know whether the company would be organized under the general law of 1854, allowing land to be taken as stock or under a special charter. Immediately after Borie made the contract, and before any sales were made, on the 25th of March he called for fifty per cent, of the cash purchase-money, and on the next day $100,000 were paid to him, none of which was from the sale of stock. Kuhn on the 24th deposited with Harris, United States certificates of debt for his stock, but none of his money was used for the purpose; Harris advanced his own money, and Kuhn\u2019s securities were not cashed until the 28th; there was no agreement amongst any of the parties to organize a corporation and take the stock asa consideration for the property, less $50,000 to be raised from the ten thousand shares. Even if those who bought from Borie with intent to organize a corporation were compelled to let the corporation have the property at cost, the defendants are required to account to the corporation only for the profit on the transaction, which was $50,000, the proceeds of the ten thousand shares, viz., of the two hundred thousand shares, the capital, one hundred thousand shares were left with a committee of the purchasers, forty thousand shares, realizing $200,000, were paid for the property; and in addition there were paid forty thousand shares by agreement; there were ten thousand shares for working capital; which would leave ten thousand shares as above stated. The one hundred thousand shares left with the committee were not to be put on the market for a year; after that time they were distributed amongst the parties, and there were still held by them under that distribution seventy-two thousand shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-7\">If it were a mistake to receive money for stock as subscription to capital instead of as the price of stock sold, it was a contract of the seller with each stockholder and not with the corporation representing the aggregate body of the purchasers, and the cause of action would be the difference in value as represented to the purchaser and the actual value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-8\">This answer averred that the Bories, Bell, Maitland, Bowen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Fox, Bayard, D\u2019lnvilliers, Hopkins and Wister, defendants, were creditors of the corporation to the amount of $36,500, with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-6\">Any claim on the ground of misrepresentation, that the money paid was for subscription to the capital, could not be pursued by' the corporation, not being a right common to all the stockholders, and this would be a matter between the particular person defrauded and the party defrauding. It was still averred that the plaintiffs had no cause of action, as they did not give more for the stock than its market value when they purchased. Up to April 1st stock could not have been bought at a less price than they paid, and up to April 4th it was generally at a premium. The corporators, in the Act of 1854, did not contemplate any connection between their charter and the property mentioned in the bill; but when the owners of the property contemplated organizing a corporation, they applied to the corporators to enable them to act under it. On March 24th 1864 it was agreed to organize a corporation, and they obtained a charter for that purpose oh March 28th. Evans\u2019s agent, when he bought the stock, knew he bought it from persons who had undertaken there should be such a company. Kuhn\u2019s agent told him it was a stock \u201cwe are about bringing out,\u201d and on this he ordered the stock. The purchasers of the stock acquiesced in the conduct of the defendants in regard to the transaction by accepting their certificates, and not making complaint until they filed this bill, nearly six years afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-7\">The defendants were holders of a majority of the stock, some of them directors and officers. They did not control the company in respect of suits, &amp;c. Until this bill was filed,, no one had asked the officers to sue. This acquiescence was not from ignorance. In 1865, and after the stock had declined, they made a request to examine the facts. A committee of stockholders was appointed, to wh\u00e9tn all the facts were stated, explanations made and papers furnished; every fact now known was then known and made as public as possible. The report of the committee of stockholders was made in July 1865. Several persons brought suits; one was withdrawn, and the others had been pending for a long time and were never brought to trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-8\">The answer of the corporation averred that the charter of 1854 was obtained and other persons associated with the corporators for the purposes as stated in the foregoing answer, and that the facts stated in it were true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-9\">If any trust existed it wag an implied one, and arose when the owners of the property transferred it and received the stock bar gained for. This was completely done as early as April 1864; before any proceedings were commenced, more than five years had elapsed, and the right, if any, which the corporation had, was barred by the Act of 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Tbe master found the facts as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">1.

On the 25th, Tatham inquired of Borie what the company was to be. Borie informed him that, if one should be formed, it would be on the basis of $100,000 for the Lewis farm, and the leases at their relative value. Tatham declined, thinking the Lewis farm not worth that sum. Borie said if Tathams would give him the refusal of the leases till April 1st, he would try to include them in any arrangement that might be made.

Harris added that, believing this to be a valuable property, he had come to give him a chance of being interested; that they had determined to dispose of sixty thousand shares of the two hundred thousand at $5 a share; Kuhn agreed to purchase six thousand shares; and on the 26th Harris informed him he bad purchased that amount for him; and the next day Kuhn paid the purchase-money in the temporary loan of the United States.

On the 3d October 1865, however, there was a meeting of stockholders, which Mr. Kuhn attended; he testified that a report from a committee which had been appointed to investigate the affairs of the company was read, \u201c of such a damaging character to the concern and those having the management of it, that I at once determined to take legal measures for the recovery of my money, which I considered had been improperly made use of.\u201d Mr. Kuhn \u201c very shortly after\u201d called on counsel and informed him of his determination and retained him to commence suit. His counsel informed him that a suit had been instituted by other parties, that their case was similar to his, and that a decision in that would determine his, and advised delay until the termination of the existing case. In this advice Mr. Kuhn acquiesced. Mr. Kuhn\u2019s counsel testified that he did not bring suit \u201cbecause he had no instructions to do so,\u201d and because he believed his recommendation to him that he should await the issue of pending suits seemed to have his acquiescence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-10\">42.

At such a meeting, in \u00cd865, he learned that which was, he says, \u2018 of such a damaging character to the concern and those having the management of it, that he at once determined to take legal measures for the recovery of his property,\u2019 which he considered had been improperly used. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>called on counsel to commence suit, and the delay which occurred was in consequence of his advice. The reason given for such advice was <em>\u2018 </em>that there had been a suit commenced by other parties ; that (his) case was .similar to theirs; that as their suit terminated favorably or unfavorably, so would (mine), and that there was no use for (me) to bring suit, as a decision in that case would determine my own.\u2019 The testimony of Mr. Kuhn\u2019s counsel is, that he did not proceed because he had no instructions to do so, and because he believed that his \u00a3 recommendation to Mr. Kuhn that he should await the issue of the suit mentioned had his acquiescence.\u2019 The suits referred to were actions on the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">\u00a3\u00a3 There has been no evidence on the subject of the delay in proceeding on behalf of Evans, Wells and Kenney, the other plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">\u00a3\u00a3 The bill in this case was filed March 19th 1870, five years and over from the time Mr. Kuhn determined to take legal measures to recover his money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-8\">\u201c Laches and neglect are always discountenanced. Nothing can call a court of equity into activity but conscience, good faith and reasonable diligence. That court cannot define the time of bar by a positive rule: it must be governed by circumstances. It refuses relief to stale demands, even in cases where no statutable limitation exists.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-9\">\u00a3\u00a3 The question of what length of time will bar the assertion of a constructive trust, was considered in Ashhurst\u2019s Appeal, 10 P. E. Smith 290. In this case it was said by the judge at Nisi Prius,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-10\">\u00a3 But what is the reasonable time within which a constructive trust must be asserted ? The eases do not clearly define it, and perhaps it is incapable of strict definition. It must vary with the circumstances of each case. Eor myself, I think it may be safely laid down, that where a party claims to hold another a trustee of personal property under a constructive trust, that he must assert the claim within six years from the time when the trust is alleged to have originated; in analogy to the Statute of Limitations he cannot be permitted to make the assertion afterwards. This, I think, should be regarded as the general rule. There may be cases where even.six years cannot be allowed, as when a party, having a right to set aside a transaction or treat it as a trust, stands by and sees another dealing with the property in a manner inconsistent with any trust, and makes no objection. And so when the rights of third persons may have intervened. So, also, where the property is of a peculiar kind, and the alleged trustee, in ignorance of any intention to hold him to an account, relying on his ownership, enters upon a hazardous business or incurs large responsibilities. At least this is true when the alleged constructive trust does not grow out o.f actual or intended fraud. It has often been said that equity obeys the Statute of Limitations, and it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>been held that laches for a much shorter period than six years, aided by other circumstances, will bar a right.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">\u201c These principles were applied to that case, and the plaintiff was held to be barred because his bill was not filed until seven years and four months after his right to sue, if any he had, came into existence. This decree of the judge at Nisi Prius was affirmed by the court in banc, the opinion declaring that the court were unable to discover error in any of the conclusions arrived at by the judge below. This case, therefore, must be taken to have decided that laches for a shorter period than six years, aided by other circumstances, will bar a right in equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-7\">\u201c The meeting of the stockholders at which Mr. Kuhn learned that which determined him to bring suit to recover the money which he had paid for stock, was held October 3d 1865. At a meeting held October 17th, in the same year, he and Mr. Evans were present and participating in the proceedings by voting their stock against the acceptance of an amendment to the charter of the company, which authorized it to borrow money, issue bonds, and secure them by a mortgage of the estate and franchises of the corporation. At this meeting a resolution was offered authorizing the directors tp borrow on the security of such a mortgage.

It was filed by Evans and Kuhn, who are stockholders in the Keystone Zinc Company. Some two and a half years thereafter the bill was amended by adding two other stockholders as complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The ground of complaint is, that in the formation of the company both the defendants and the plaintiffs were associated together ; that the defendants purchased certain mineral lands, and sold them to the corporation of which they were directors, for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>sum many times greater than they actually paid for them ; that the price they paid was concealed from the plaintiffs, whereby a resulting trust has arisen, and the defendants are liable to account for the profits which they have made.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The master found the evidence sufficient to establish a constructive trust, but reported that the bill be dismissed by reason of the laches of the plaintiffs in filing it. The court confirmed the report and dismissed the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">We will therefore consider the sufficiency of the laches and attending circumstances, to justify the decree of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">In March 1864, the agreement for the formation of the company was made, and the defendants entered into a contract for the purchase of the land. The necessary act of incorporation was procured in a few days thereafter. Early in the next month, the defendants obtained a conveyance of the land, and sold it to the corporation, of which they were three directors, and certificates of stock were issued thereon, in pursuance of a resolution of the stockholders. At a meeting of the stockholders, early in 1865, .Kuhn swears that he obtained information \u201c of such a damaging character to the overseer and those having the management of it, that I at once determined to take legal measures for the recovery of my money, which I considered had been improperly made use of.\u201d With that view he consulted counsel, but in consequence of other persons occupying a similar position, having brought actions on the case, which were then pending, he postponed instituting any proceedings. At another meeting of the stockholders, held in October of the same year, Kuhn and Evans were both present and participated in the proceedings. They voted their stock on the question of the acceptance of an amendment to the charter, authorizing the company to borrow money, issue bonds and secure the same by a mortgage on the estate and franchises of the corporation. It is true they voted against accepting the amendment; but that fact in no wise changes the legal effect of their action for the purposes we are now considering it. The amendment was adopted by a vote of the majority of the stockholders, representing a majority of the stock. At the same time a resolution was also passed authorizing the directors to borrow money on the security of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">This bill was not filed until nearly four and a half years after that meeting. If the case rested on the lapse of time alone, that would be insufficient to bar the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to file the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">As a general rule, a constructive trust in regard to personal rights or personal property may be asserted at any time within six years after a knowledge of the facts creating it. At the expiration of that time it is barred by analogy to the time fixed by the Statute of Limitations: Ashhurst\u2019s Appeal, 10 P. F. Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>290. But laches for a much shorter time than six years, aided by other circumstances, will bar the right: Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">There is another aspect of this case.' The relief prayed for is not that the defendants shall pay anything directly to the plaintiffs, but that they shall pay into the treasury of the corporation, whereby the plaintiffs may be benefited by the increased property of the company. The attempt is to obtain relief through the equitable rights of the corporation. Then the knowledge and conduct of the latter must he considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The bill is not to repudiate so much as it is to enforce a constructive or implied contract. The land was conveyed to the corporation 8th of April 1863. Nearly six years thereafter the bill was filed. The minutes of the corporation of the same month of April show the facts on which the present complaint mainly rests. The manner in which the certificates of stock were issued, and payment for the lands made, were sufficient to make inquiry a duty of all who were unsatisfied. No steps were taken to establish a resulting trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">In October following the company accepted the amendment to its charter and authorized a loan, predicated thereon, to be made. The plaintiffs had full knowledge of this action, both present and prospective. They instituted no proceedings to prevent it. They acquiesced in it. They thereby encouraged the directors to borrow money in pursuance of the resolution of the stockholders. They thereby induced the defendants to believe that no legal proceedings would be instituted predicated of the original purchase of the land. Afterwards the defendants lent money to the corporation, but not under the authority of the amendment. The master has found that the directors \u201c seem to have fairly and honestly endeavored to manage its affairs for the advantage of the stockholders.\u201d Nevertheless the company became embarrassed. Judgments were recovered against it by creditors. All its property, both real and personal, was sold and bought in for the benefit of the' creditors. Hence, since the plaintiffs had full knowledge, new business arrangements have been made and other rights have intervened. These proceedings were delayed, under the attending circumstances, an unreasonable time. Having been so delayed, the laches is fatal to the plaintiffs\u2019 bill. This view is fully sustained by Ashhui\u2019st\u2019s Appeal, supra, and the numerous authorities there cited. Although the transaction was originally voidable, yet having been acquiesced in by the parties who might have avoided it, for a length of time less'than six yeai's, but by their conduct having induced the offending parties to believe it was not to be questioned, they are now debarred from avoiding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The two other stockholders, who became. plaintiffs by amendment, are in a worse condition than the original plaintiffs. Their first action was more than six years after they had full knowledge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>This is not a creditor\u2019s bill, in which a creditor, has come in during the progress of a suit which one creditor has instituted in behalf of himself and others. We are now dealing with a constructive trust. These latter plaintiffs are to be considered as such, with like effect only as if they had filed an original bill at the time they applied by petition to be added to the record as complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
