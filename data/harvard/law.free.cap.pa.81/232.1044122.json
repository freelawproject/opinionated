You may infer malice, if the evidence warrants it, from the want of probable cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Then, if you find that the defendant was actuated by malice in arresting the plaintiff, and did it without probable cause, you will proceed to assess the damages. In doing this, you may consider the deprivation of the plaintiff\u2019s liberty by being thrown into prison; his physical suffering while there, occasioned by the arrest, [and you have heard what he has said about being compelled to lie upon a bench for a bed, and having nothing to eat till the next day at eleven o\u2019clock in Moyamensing prison ;] and the risk he was subjected to of being convicted and punished for the larceny charged against him. These are elements of damages for your consideration, in case the evidence satisfies you the plaintiff is entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-8\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $1000.

The special damages must be proved as laid : Gerhard <em>v. </em>Bates, 2 E. &amp; B. 490 ; Vicars <em>v. </em>Wilcocks, 8 East 2; Ashley <em>v. </em>Harrison, 1 Esp. 49; Clark <em>v. </em>Wendell, 18 Wend. 229; 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl. 388; Butler <em>v. </em>Kent, 19 Johns.

Law and Eq., p. 201; Munns <em>v. </em>Dupont, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 31; Laing <em>v. </em>Colder, 8 Barr 483. In an action for false imprisonment, evidence that the plaintiff was stinted in his food, when confined, can be received if specially pleaded: Lowdrick <em>v. </em>Goodrich, Peake\u2019s N. P. 46 ; Petit <em>v. </em>Addington, Id. 61; Hart <em>v. </em>Evans, 8 Barr 21; Spigelmoyer <em>v. </em>Walter, 3 W. &amp; S. 540.

The suffering of the plaintiff from cold, the want of a bed to lie upon, and deprivation of food for many hours, sprang directly from the imprisonment to which the malice of the defendant exposed the plaintiff Because others may have also been in fault, it does not take away the participation of the defendant in the wrong done to the plaintiff</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
