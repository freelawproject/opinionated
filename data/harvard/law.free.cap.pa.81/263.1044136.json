An executor, who was also surviving partner of the testator, chai\u2019ged himself in his account with $2262 as the value of the testator\u2019s interest in the firm ; the auditor, after a tedious examination of books, &amp;c., found that the interest was worth \u00a752242 more, and surcharged him with that sum : <em>Held, </em>that the burden of the expense of resisting the claim should not be thrown on the estate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b263-10\">2.

Martin, the present executor, was engaged in the wholesale liquor business, and also in the business of brewing in the city of Philadelphia, had considerable capital invested, and enjoyed a large and well-established trade. At that date he took with him into partnership, the decedent, Harry F. Price, who contributed no capital, but only his services to the business. In addition to the capital which Mr. Martin had invested in the business, he also gave to it his time and attention. No written articles were entered into upon the formation of the partnership, but on April 7th 1868, the following paper was drawn up and executed by Martin and Price :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-9\">\u201c \u2018 Whereas, on the first day of August, A. D. 1864, Thomas J. Martin and Harry F. Price entered into copartnership for the purpose of carrying on the wholesale liquor business, and which copartnership still exists; and whereas, no written agreement between said Thomas J. Martin and Harry F. Price has been previously executed to confirm said copartnership, or show the relations existing between each of said parties as partners: These presents witnesseth, that it was and is mutually agreed upon by said Thomas J. Martin and Harry F. Price, that the net profits realized from the business carried on by them at, &amp;c., are to be so divided that Thomas J. Martin shall receive seven-eighths of the amount, and the balance, or one-eighth, shall be received by Harry F. Price.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-10\">\u201cUnder this agreement and upon these terms Martin and Price carried on the liquor business until July 1st 1869, when Henry Johnson was admitted into the firm, the brewing business having been discontinued some time before. Johnson put in no\u2019 capital, and was to receive one-fourth of the profits, Price still retaining his one-eighth interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-11\">\u201c At the time of Johnson\u2019s admission into the firm, an inventory \u2022was made of the stock of whiskey on hand, which then amounted, at the appraised value, to $139,460.85, and there was standing at that time to the credit of Harry F. Price, on the books of the firm, $5066.79. * * * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-12\">\u201c At the time of Price\u2019s death, the amount to his credit on the books had been reduced, by his drawings, to $4587.91, which, together with the amount to the credit of his copartner Martin\u2014 viz., $116,228.39 \u2014 was represented by the stock in trade, book accounts and othei assets of the firm. Shortly after Mr. Price\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>death an inventory was taken of the stock on hand at that time, and the stock appraised by Martin, the surviving partner, at $104,462.73. After some time the books were closed, showing a loss on the business, since July 1st 1869, of $7672.17.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">\u201cAfter Price\u2019s death Martin continued to carry on the business with the stock and assets of the old firm, together with such additional stock as he purchased from time to time, but with little or no profit, until July 1872, when he disposed of the business to William N. Graham, who had been taken into the firm at Price\u2019s death. * * * * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-7\">\u201c The correctness of the appraisement made by Martin of the stock on hand at the death of Price was attacked by the counsel for the widow, * * * An examination of the books of the firm shows that the appraisement of September 24th 1869 was made at prices below those at which the same stock had been appraised by Martin on July 1st 1869, while in the sales entered on the books \u2022 between those dates and immediately and for a long time subsequent thereto there appeared no reduction in the prices at which the goods were sold. Although it may be true, as was testified before the auditor, that there was no market in tbe latter part of 1869 for any considerable quantity of whiskey at the appraised value, it is equally true that the stock, when sold by Mr. Martin, yielded a considerable advance on those values; and a surviving partner who elects to keep the stock instead of selling it, and to carry on the business for his own advantage, ought not to be permitted to take it at a price which could have been obtained for it only by its sacrifice at a forced sale in a peculiarly unfavorable market, such as the accountant alleged existed, from special and temporary causes, in the autumn of 1869. He can have no reason to complain if he is called upon to account for the stock, at its fair average price, under ordinary conditions of the market. Such a valuation the auditor finds in the appraisement made of the stock by Mr. Martin in July 1869, the correctness of which has not been questioned before the auditor. And adopting the valuation of that date, it will appear that the appraisement of September 1869 should be increased biy the sum of $18*,023.76. As a result of carrying this increase in the \u2018 merchandise account\u2019 into the \u2018 profit and loss\u2019 account, we find that, instead of the business from July 1st 1869 to September 21st 1869 showing a loss of $7572.17, it yields a profit of $10,451.58, one-eighth of which, or $1306.44, is to be added to the July statement of Harry E: Price\u2019s account, making the true amount which should be to his credit at the date of his death, $5894.35. Deducting from this latter sum his share of the bad debts * * * amounting, &amp;c. * * * and we have a balance of $4904.98, which was the true amount of Harry E. Price\u2019s interest in the firm at his death on September 6th 1869, for which the executor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>is to account, instead of $2622.89, as charged in the account now before the auditor. * * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-6\">\u201c By the tenor of the agreement, and from the evidence afforded by the entries in the partnership books, it is clear that Price was entitled to one-eighth of the profits-of the business, and that he originally contributed no capital. * * * The books of T. J. Martin &amp; Co. show clearly to the mind of the auditor that it never \u25a0was the understanding of H. F. Price that he had any fixed or definite interest in the capital of the firm, or any interest in the stock of assets, except in so far as the stock and assets represented his share of the undrawn profits of the business. The account of Thomas J. Martin is credited on the books, with the whole amount of the stock on hand, at the several dates of settlement, and is debited with the amount due to H. F. Price for his share of the profits; and nowhere is Mr. Price credited with any share of the capital stock of the firm. His interest, wherever it appeal\u2019s upon the books, is stated to be one-eighth of the profits, and this share of the profits is all that is carried to his credit. There is, therefore, no room for doubt that it was well understood between the partners that the interest of Price was confined to the profits alone, and he could not, therefore, have justly claimed to be admitted to share with his copartner, Martin, in the capital which, as the evidence shows, was wholly contributed by the latter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-7\"><em>\u201c </em>But, on the other hand, the proposition of the accountant\u2019s counsel that Mr. Price had no interest in the stock on hand at his decease is equally untenable. The books of the firm show there was standing to his credit at the time of his death, an amount of undrawn profits now ascertained to be $4904.98, which equally with the capital contributed by Martin was represented by the stock in trade and other assets of the firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-8\">\u201c To the extent of those undrawn profits, he had an interest in, and was a tenant in common with his copartners of the stock and assets which had been purchased by and accumulated from the capital and profits of the \u2018 business.\u2019 The decedent having therefore a joint interest with Martin in the stock, it became the duty of Martin, as surviving partner,' to sell the stock and wind up the business. * * * Martin, as a surviving partner, had no right to take the stock at a valuation ; and as executor of the decedent, he was clothed with the further trust to protect the interests of the widow and the creditors, and to make sale for the purpose of distribution. * * * This duty he failed to perform, but appraised and retained the property, and continued to trade with the old stock. In failing to make an immediate sale of the stock, he appears to have been influenced by a desire to avoid the sacrifice which would in all probability have resulted, had so large a stock of goods been thrown upon the market immediately upon Mr. Price\u2019s death. His own share of the stock was greatly in excess of decedent\u2019s, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>and his interest in preserving it identical with that of decedent\u2019s estate; ho imputation of fraud or unfair dealing can be justly attributed to him in declining to make sale of the stock. By retaining the stock and continuing to deal with it, he became liable to account'to the decedent\u2019s estate for all subsequent profits, while the responsibility for losses fell entirely upon his own shoulders. * * * There is no fixed rule at law which measures the interest of the deceased partner in the profits by the interest which he had in the business during his lifetime. * * * Out of this difficulty of apportioning the profits, has arisen the simpler rule which gives to the estate of the deceased partner his share of the stock at the time of his decease, with interest upon the same in lieu of profits. * * * It is manifestly for the interest of the <em>cestui que </em>trust, that the rule allowing interest in lieu of profits should be adopted in the present instance ; and moreover, the accountant, by neglecting to invest the moneys of the estate' by mixing them with his own, and by failing to account until cited so to do, has subjected himself to the penalty of paying interest upon the balance in his hands. The auditor has concluded to charge the accountant .with the value of the decedent\u2019s interest in the partnership at the time of his death, with interest upon the same to the date of the filing of this report; first deducting any payments which the accountant may have made in the settlement of the estate. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-10\">\u201c Having found nothing in the conduct of the executor which savors of actual fraud or bad faith on his part in the administration of the estate, the auditor sees no reason to disallow commissions to the accountant, or to charge him with the expenses of the audit, as requested by the counsel for the widow.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-11\">The auditor adjusted the account by increasing the charge for the testator\u2019s interest in the firm to $&gt;4904.48, striking out the charges for rents, allowing the accountant $83.60 commissions at 5 per cent, on $1672.09, the amount of the surcharges (after deducting the rents struck out), and making other corrections not necessary to particularize on both sides of the account. This resulted in a balance of $-3394.16 against the accountant as of September 17th 1869, on which he added interest until May 16th 1873, the date of filing his report, being $746.68, making the total balance due by the accountant, $4140.84.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-12\">The expenses of the audit as allowed by him, were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-13\">\u201c Auditor\u2019s fee as per order, ' .... $350.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-14\">Pierce Archer, Esq., professional services, . . 500.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-15\">L.

The gift of all his real and personal estate to his executor, in trust for the use of his wife and mother for life, with remainder to William and Charles Price, and to Caroline Lukens, is inconsistent with the subsequent bequests to Sarah Martin, and to the two charitable corporations named in the will; as a rule of construction, where two parts of a will are inconsistent, the latter prevails, hut this is applied only after the failure of every endeavor to give such a reasonable construction to the entire dispositions as will render every part of them operative. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-8\">\u201c In the present instance, the primary intent of the testator seems to he, to make provision for the support of his widow and mother during their lives, and to devote the income of his entire estate, both real and personal, to that purpose. Such a purpose is at variance with an intention to make the pecuniary legacies payable in the lifetime of either the wife or mother of the testator. In the opinion of the auditor the payment of those legacies is to be postponed until the termination of the two life estates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-9\">\u201cThe fund for distribution, under the will, is $2409.44, of which amount $1662.76 is principal, and $746.68 is interest upon the fund in the accountant\u2019s hands at decedent\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-10\">\u201c The auditor awards the above sum of $746.68 to Mary Price, the widow of the decedent. * * * The remainder of the fund, $1662.76, the auditor directs to he paid to the trustee appointed in the place of Thomas J.

Upon what ground said surcharge was made we are not informed, as no opinion was filed by the learned judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court. It is always desirable in such cases to know the reasons of which the decree of the court below was predicated. The auditor\u2019s report, however, discloses sufficient to show that the action of the Orphans\u2019 Court should be in part sustained. The executor was also the surviving partner of the testator ; in his account he charged himself with the sum of $2662.89, as the value of the deceased partner\u2019s interest in the firm. The auditor surcharged him with the sum of $2242.09, as the real value of said, interest. The contention upon this question protracted the audit very greatly, and involved a tedious examination of the books and the business of the firm. The burden of this increased expense ought not to be thrown upon the estate. It should be borne by the unsuccessful party by whom it was occasioned. It would be manifestly unj ust to charge the widow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>who succeeded in thus surcharging the accountant, with the amount expended by him in counsel fees in resisting her claim. But we think it was error to strike out all allowance for counsel fees. The accountant was entitled to the services and advice of counsel, and so far as those services were rendered for the benefit of *the estate, or to protect the accountant in his rights, compensation should be made therefor out of the estate. An examination of the auditor\u2019s report discloses the fact that the widow objected to a number of items on the credit side of the account, which were allowed by the auditor. Among them was the item of funeral expenses. It is also noted that she attempted to surcharge the accountant with a much larger sum, as the value of the testator\u2019s interest in the firm, than was found by the auditor. It is only right that a reasonable allowance should be made out of the estate, to pay for this portion of the services of counsel. We think $150 is sufficient for this purpose. The accountant must be surcharged with the residue, to wit, $350.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We think the court below erred in disallowing the accountant\u2019s claim to commissions. The auditor finds that he was not guilty of actual fraud or bad faith. It would be a harsh rule to hold that, in the absence of fraud or bad faith, an accountant should be deprived of his commissions merely because he has been surcharged in his account, especially when the subject of the surcharge was the value of the testator\u2019s interest in the profits of a business. It is unnecessary to refer to the cases upon this point. The whole subject has been thoroughly discussed in a number of recent decisions. None of them sustains the disallowance of commissions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">No question as to the amount of the auditor's fee was raised in the court below. It was fixed by the agreement of the parties, with the approval of the court. The question is whether it shall be paid by the accountant or by the estate. The court below surcharged the accountant with all but fifty dollars of the amount. What we have said upon the first assignment of error is equally applicable here. The necessary and proper expenses of the audit should be paid out of the estate. So far as they were increased unnecessarily by the accountant the burden should fall upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">It is not easy to fix the precise line of division, but in our judgment the estate should pay $150 of the auditor\u2019s fee. The. accountant must be surcharged with the residue thereof, to wit, $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">There are three other appeals in this estate, viz.: Appeal of Sarah Martip, legatee, appeal of St. John\u2019s Orphan Asylum, legatee, appeal of House of Hood Shepherd, legatee. Neither of these appellants appeared before the auditor to claim any legacy or bequest under the will, nor were the appeals pressed, upon the argument here. The auditor has given satisfactory reasons why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the payment of the respective legacies should he postponed until after the termination of the life estates. As to each of these appeals the decree of the court below must be affirmed, and the appeals dismissed at the cost of the respective appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In the appeal of Thomas J. Martin, executor, the decree is reversed, and the record remitted for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
