If the cashier had called upon the lieutenant of police, the robbery would have been discovered; and if the servant had obeyed instructions, the actual robbery would not have occurred. The bank would not be liable for the felony of its servants; but they are liable for their gross negligence. Whether the evidence submitted proved that, was wholly for the jury : Bank v. Smith, 12 P. F. Smith 54; Scott <em>v. </em>Bank, 22 Id. 471.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-9\"><em>A. D. Campbell </em>and <em>R. C. MoMurtrie, </em>for defendants in error.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZv\">There is a distinction between the liability of a bailee for hire and that of a mere depositary or gratuitous bailee: Bank <em>v. </em>Smith, 12 P. F. Smith 54; Scott <em>v. </em>Bank, 22 Id. 471; Lance <em>v. </em>Greiner, 3 Id. 204. A gratuitous bailee is liable only for <em>gross </em>negligence; the failure to use. that degree of care which would be exercised by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>any man of ordinary common sense and prudence: Coggs <em>v. </em>Bernard, Ld. Raym. 909; 1 Sm. Lead.

The burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to show a loss resulting from such degree of negligence as would render the depositary liable, and mere proof of loss is not evidence of such negligence: Giblin <em>v. </em>McMullen, Law Rep. 2 Privy Council 317; Smith <em>v. </em>Bank, 99 Mass. 611; Pitlock <em>v. </em>Wells, Fargo &amp; Co., 109 Id. 452; Knowles <em>v. </em>Railroad Co., 38 Maine 60. The scintilla doctrine has long since been exploded: Ryder <em>v. </em>Wombwell, Law Rep. 4 Exch. 31; Jewell v. Parr, 13 C. B. 916; Toomey <em>v. </em>London &amp; Brighton Railway Co., 3 C. B. N. S. 150; Wheelton <em>v. </em>Hardisty, 8 E. &amp; B. 262; Improvement Company <em>v. </em>Munson, 14 Wall. 442; Welfare <em>v. </em>Brighton Railway Co., Law Rep. 4 Q. B. 692; Searle <em>v. </em>Laverick, Law Rep. 9 Q. B. 122. The court should give imperative instructions to the jury where the facts are undisputed: Malson <em>v. </em>Fry, 1 Watts 433; Koons <em>v. </em>Steele, 7 Harris 210 ; Kerr <em>v. </em>Wright, 1 Wright 196; Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Evans, 3 P. F. Smith 250. The question, of negligence is one of mingled law and fact, to be decided as a question of law by the court when the facts are undisputed or conclusively proved: Gagg <em>v. </em>Vetter, 41 Ind. 228; Green <em>v. </em>Hollingsworth, 5 Dana (Ky.) 173 ; Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Butts, 7 Kans. 308; Trow <em>v. </em>Railroad Co., 24 Verm.

Smith 201; Phila. &amp; Reading Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Yerger, 23 Id. 121; Adams Express Co. <em>v. </em>Sharpless, 27 Id. 516. Gross negligence cannot be predicated of a designed act except where so much skill is contracted for as ought to prevent the mistake: Shiells <em>v. </em>Blackburne, 1 H. Blackst. 158 ; Moore <em>v. </em>Mourgue, Cowp. 480 ; Kohl <em>v. </em>Love, 8 Vroom 5. It is at least a question how far a national bank is liable for the loss of valuable^ deposited with it for safe-keeping: Wiley <em>v. </em>Bank, 14 Am. L. Reg. N. S. 342; Weckler <em>v. </em>Bank, Id. 609; Fowler <em>v. </em>Scully, 22 P. F. Smith 456; Bank <em>v. </em>Bank, 7 Leg. Gaz. 134; Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Turner, Law Rep. 8 Ch.

Waiving the question of the want of power in a national bank to take bonds, &amp;c., on a deposit for safe-keeping, the officers here took as much care of them as they did of the property of the bank. The robbery was effected by a most ingenious and unexpected device, calculated'to succeed with the most careful of persons, and made successful by its very openness and apparent freedom from design. The cashier had no reason to suspect an attack on <em>his </em>bank, the message of the pseudo police officer being merely that there were suspicious persons about; that is, in the city. Hence his omission to call at the police precinct was no evidence of such carelessness as would charge the bank. He took all proper precautions. The nonsuit was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
