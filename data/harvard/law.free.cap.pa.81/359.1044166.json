This intention of the testator must prevail, if consistent with the rules of l'aw: Hauer <em>v. </em>Shitz, 3 Yeates 237. If this was the intention of the testator, the devise over has no tendency to create \u00e1 perpetuity: Yard\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F.

F. Smith 481 ; Preston on Abstracts of Title 401. An executory devise can be destroyed by common recovery suffered by the tenant in tail, which enlarges his estate into a fee, and excludes all subsequent limitations, whether by remainder or by the way of springing use or executory devise : 2 Preston on Estates 460 ; 1 Id. 401; 3 Id. 130; 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 13 ; Lewis on Perpetuities 663 ; Dormer <em>v. </em>Parkhurst, 18 Viner\u2019s Abridg. 413; 4 Bro.

This is the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case: Hays on Estates Tail, 7 Law Library 106; Doe <em>v. </em>Applin, 4 T.

Superadded words of limitation will not make \u201cheirs of the body\u201d words of purchase: Hawkins on Wills 184 ; 2 Jarman on Wills 337; Jesson <em>v. </em>Wright, 1 Bligh 1; Paxson <em>v. </em>Lefferts, 3 Rawle 59 ; George <em>v. </em>Morgan, 4 Harris 95; Karker\u2019s Appeal, 10 P.

When the words are used to limit a fee given in the first instance, they are always words of limitation, and change the fee simple first given to a fee tail. The devise imports an indefinite.failure of lawful issue, or lawful heirs, at the death of Lockwood Smith, Jr. : Matlack <em>v. </em>Roberts, 4 P. F. Smith 148 ; Braden <em>v. </em>Cannon, 12 Harris 165; Amelia Smith\u2019s Appeal, 11 Id. 9 ; Price <em>v. </em>Taylor, 4 Casey 95 ; Hauer <em>v. </em>Shitz, 2 Binney 532.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aiy\">March 20th 1876,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Judgment was entered .in the Supreme Court,</p>\n<author id=\"b361-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AkV\">\u2014 It is very clear that under the will of Lockwood Smith, his son, Lockwqocb Smith, Jr., would have taken an estate in fee simple, had it not been for the terms of the devise over. The principal devise was to him and to his <em>lawful heirs : </em>Criswell\u2019s Appeal, 5 Wright 288. The devise over was in these words: \u201c But in case the said Lockwood should die without any lawful heirs, then the property to revert back and be equally divided among my children who shall survive him, except the one equal'third part of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>property, which shall belong to his widow as long as she shall continue as such.\u201d Had the principal devise been for life instead of in fee, the terms of the devise over indicating a definite failure of issue, the estate of Lockwood Smith, Jr.-, would have come to an end at his death without issue. But the words \u201c lawful heirs \u201d clearly meant \u201clawful issue,\u201d as interpreted by the terms over, for the testator\u2019s children, the brothers and sisters of Lockwood, would have been his heirs on leaving no issue, and therefore the testator must have meant lineal descendants, and not collateral, when he used the words \u201clawful heirs.\u201d This being the case he gave to Lockwood, Jr., an estate tail, which could be barred by deed in the form prescribed by the act for barring entails. This being done, the devise over was cut off. This case falls directly within the decision in Covert <em>v. </em>Robinson, 10 Wright 274. And indeed is stronger, for in the will in that case there were no words of inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
