A debtor was adjudged a bankrupt; whilst the proceedings in bankruptcy were pending he was arrested as a fraudulent debtor under the Act of July 12th 1842 and gave bond to apply to the Court of Common Pleas for the benefit of the insolvent laws. He made his application, which was dismissed because of the pending bankrupt proceedings. In an action on the bond, <em>Held, </em>that the dismissal of the application was a defence to the action.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-12\">2. In the action on the bond, defendant pleaded that it had been obtained in a proceeding which was exclusively cognisable in the United States Bankrupt Court, the debtor having been previously adjudicated a bankrupt. The plaintiffs replied that the cause was not exclusively within the jurisdiction of the United States court and averred that the District Court of Philadelphia where the action was brought had jurisdiction and put themselves on the country. <em>Held, </em>the replication raised an issue of law and was to be treated as a demurrer, and defendant was entitled to judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-13\">3. The effect of the plea was to assert that the action was for a debt'for which the debtor would be discharged under the Bankrupt Law; if this were not so, he should have so replied.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-14\">4. The defendant pleaded also \u201cnon est factum\u201d and \u201cnil debet;\u201d the verdict was for the p'aintiffs; it was to be considered as rendered on these two pleas, as raising issues of fact; the judgment entered on the verdict was necessarily on the whole record and therefore erroneous.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>5. Under the Bankrupt Laws a debtor can be proceeded against for a debt created by fraud, embezzlement, defalcation as a public officer, or while acting in a fiduciary capacity ; unless the debtor had been arrested for one of these causes, the bond was discharged by his adjudication as a bankrupt.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b40-6\">6.

Nevertheless, the said plaintiffs say that after the making of the said writing obligatory, and th-e delivery thereof to the said plaintiffs, the said John P. Harlan did not comply with all the requisitions of the said insolvent laws, and did not obtain his discharge as an insolvent debtor, but wholly failed so to do, and that he did not, on the day of his so failing, surrender himself to the jail of the said county.

The defendant \u2019 Hubert removed the record to the Supreme Court by writ of error. The record showed nothing further.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-12\">The history of the case by plaintiff in error, which was not denied by defendants in error, stated as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-13\">\u201cUpon 17th August 1872 the said Harlan, in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, obtained leave to file his petition for the benefit of the insolvent laws of Pennsylvania, and upon the same day the petition was filed.

Harlan as principal; and that at the time of the institution of the proceedings in which said insolvent bond was given, the said Harlan had been theretofore adjudged a bankrupt, and said proceedings in bankruptcy were then still pending and undetermined ; therefore said judgment is null and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-7\">\u201c 2. Said judgment is null and void because the Bankrupt Act of 2d March 1867 superseded all state insolvent laws, among \u25a0which is the Act of General Assembly of 12th July 1842, under which said Harlan was arrested, and gave the said bond to take the benefit of the Act of General Assembly of \u00cd6th June 1836.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-8\">i|c</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-9\">\u201c 5.

L. 334), conditioned that John P. Horter, the party arrested, should apply to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia county, for the insolvent laws, and alleging a breach of the condition. To this the defendant, Hubert, the only one served with process, pleaded <em>non est factum, nil debet, </em>and a special plea \u2014 that the bond was obtained from him in a proceeding of and concerning a cause of action exclusively cognizable by the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in Bankruptcy, the said Horter having been theretofore adjudicated a bankrupt in the said court. The plaintiff replied, taking issue upon the first two pleas, and by a special replication denied that the cause of action was exclusively cognizable by the District Court of the United States, and averred that the District Court for the city and county of Philadelphia had jurisdiction to require of the said Horter the execution of the said obligation, and of this the plaintiffs put themselves on the country. It is very clear that the issue raised by the replication was an issue'of law and not of fact. It admitted the facts averred in the plea, but denied the inference of law. It admitted that Horter had been theretofore adjudicated a bankrupt. It can be regarded only as an informal demurrer. It must be considered, then, that the verdict rendered was upon the two other issues of fact. When, however, judgment was entered by the court below, it was necessarily upon the whole record. We think the judgment was erroneous, and that upon the whole record the defendant was entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The plea demurred to in averring that the cause of action was exclusively cognizable in the Bankruptcy Court, in effect asserted that it was for a debt or cause of action from which Horter would have been entitled to his discharge under the bankrupt law. If it had not been so, the plaintiff should have replied that fact. Under the bankrupt laws, parties can still be sued and proceeded against for any \u201c debt created by the fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt, or by his defalcation as a public officer, or while acting in any fiduciary character:\u201d Revised Statutes U. S., sec. 5117, Unless the warrant of arrest was for one or other of these causes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Horter having been adjudicated a bankrupt, the condition of the bond was discharged: Barber <em>v. </em>Rodgers, 21 P. F. Smith 362. It has been stated in the paper-book of the plaintiff in error, and not denied in.the counter-statement, that the petition in the Court of Common Pleas, for the benefit of the insolvent laws, was dismissed by that court for the reason that he had previously been adjudged a bankrupt. Such a dismissal on that ground, whether right or wrong, would have been, if pleaded, a conclusive answer to the declaration on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Judgment reversed, and now judgment for the defendant below. February 28th 1876. It is ordered that the . judgment heretofore entered February 21st 1876, in favor of the defendant below, be vacated and set aside, and that <em>a venire facias de novo </em>be awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
