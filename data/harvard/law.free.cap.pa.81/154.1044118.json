Kane against the Reserve Mutual Life Insurance Company, on a policy of insurance for $2000, issued April 1st 1872, by the defendants to the plaintiff, on the life of his father, John Kane.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-10\">The case was tried April 15th 1874, before Briggs, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-11\">The plaintiff gave evidence of the death of John Kane on the 26th of June 1872. The father had come from Ireland ; had lived in this country two or three years ; plaintiff paid $120 for bringing his father and family to this country ; $50 had been repaid him by the mother; the father intended to repay him, but had not; the father was a laborer; kept house from April to June 1872; was 55 years old when he died; left a widow, three sons and a daughter; the plaintiff paid through affection, but expected the father would have paid it had he lived; the money paid by him brought over the father, mother, brother's and sister-; he expected the father would compel the brothers to pay their passage-money back.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-12\">The defendants\u2019 points were,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-13\">1. If the jury find from the evidence that the plaintiff was, at the execution of the policy of life insurance, an adult son of John Kane, then as such he had no insurable interest in the father\u2019s life, and the verdict should be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-14\">2. If the jury find from the evidence that the plaintiff represented, at the time of his application, that he had an insurable interest in the life of John Kane, it is now incumbent upon him to satisfy the jury that he had such an interest, and if he has failed so to do, the verdict should be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-15\">3. Plantiff, as a creditor, can only recover in this case the amount of his outlay on behalf of his father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-16\">The court refused the points, and directed the jury to render a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of said policy, $2000, less six months\u2019 premium unpaid, and for the interest, amounting to $2085.34. The jury so found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The defendants took a writ of error, and assigned the refusal of their points and the instruction of the court, for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-6\"><em>H.

Maintenance of a father or mother unable to work is, therefore, a legal liability. When we add to this the feelings of natural affection and the desire produced by these feelings to provide for the comforts of parents, the right to effect an insurance on the life of the parent, to carry out these purposes, ought not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>be denied. It would be technical in the extreme to say that a son has no insurable interest in his father\u2019s. life. Poverty may overtake the father in his lifetime, and thus both father and mother be cast upon the son; or if the father die before her, the necessity may fall at once upon the son. Why then should he not be permitted to make a provision, by insurance, to reimburse himself for his outlays, past or future ? What injury is done to the insurance company ? They receive the full premium, and they know in such case, from the very relationship of the parties, that the contract is not a mere gambling adventure, but is founded in the best feelings of our nature, and on a legal duty which may arise at any time. We are of opinion that the policy is not void.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
