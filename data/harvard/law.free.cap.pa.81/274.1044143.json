Hay lane is five hundred yards from Fifty-eighth street; a whistling post below Hay lane; I whistled below Hay lane, at the whistling post, a signal whistle for the crossing at Hay lane ; * * * whistle can he heard sometimes better than others; I think it could be heard at Fifty-eighth street; I was on the right hand side of the locomotive ; was looking out; tracks straight from the post to Fifty-eighth street; I saw deceased when he was on the rise of the hill, coming out of the oil works.; I was about six or seven telegraph poles from the crossing when I first saw him, and was down on the grade, coming up; he was just about the foot of the rise ; I had got to the oil works; his horses were walking up, and when he got short distance from the track, he struck the horses with the lines, and horses jumped forward to the track, and ran in right ahead of us ; he was standing hack of the seat; was an open lumber wagon ; when I first saw him, he was about ninety feet from the track, at the foot of the rise; there was nothing between him and me, when I first saw him ; when I first saw him horses were walking, until he slapped the lines; the train was a short distance from the crossing, about fifty to one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>hundred feet, when he slapped the lines; I stopped the train as quick as I could ; I whistled for brakes ; * * * I was so excited, I whistled before I struck the horse; whistled as soon-as I saw him coming on track; train stopped in about nine car lengths; car is about ninety feet long, I think; we stop with two cars beyond the Fifty-eighth street crossing ; deceased was looking to the head of his horses when coming, when I first saw him \u2014 when I saw coming on the track ; stopped as quick as I could ; air brake took effect; he was at Fifty-eighth street; only whistling post for Fifty-eighth street is below Hay lane ; I judge it is sufficient whistle for Fifty-eighth street; signal whistle is a long whistle; if it was half a mile from post to Fifty-eighth street, and train going thirty miles an hour, would be a half of minute in reaching Fifty-eighth street; had a full view of the deceased from seventh telegraph pole; nothing to prevent my seeing him, and he could see me; he could not help seeing me; I had not the slightest idea of his intention to drive across the track; when he slapped the lines, I tried to stop; there was nothing to prevent his stopping. * * * The air brake took effect that morning instantaneously; I was on that train some length of time afterwards ; you might have a wet rail, and it would not hold the air brake ; it was a dry, cold morning ; had a dry rail; sometimes you can, and sometimes you cannot stop; when stopped at Fifty-eighth street, whole train had passed crossing; the hind car was two car lengths from the crossing when it stopped; * * * when I first saw deceased I did not whistle, and I did not sound the bell; the first whistle I gave was for brakes; when he dropped reins on back of horses, he was right near the track; might have been eight or ten yards from the track; he kept walking until he got eight or ten yards from the track, and then he slapped the lines ; the whistle approaching a station is to let conductor know we have heard bell, and not a signal whistle for crossing.

He walked his horses slowly up the gentle assent to the railroad, looking at them and turning to look neither to the right nor left. The track lay here on an embankment of about twelve feet in height, and the train could have been seen approaching for many hundred feet. The engineer, called by the plaintiff, testifies he saw the man and wagon about ninety feet off, he was going up slowly, and standing up in his wagon behind the seat. He came within a few feet of the track, and then, the train being near at hand, lashed his horses with the reins to force them across the track. Wagon, horses and man were caught, the wagon smashed, a horse and the man killed. This was all done with a train in full sight and in broad daylight. Standing up in his wagon he could see all around, and he therefore did not look to see, or with the most culpable recklessness he rushed on to his end.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Admit the possibility of his not hearing the train, and when he found himself almost at the road he lashed his horses to cross quickly, yet it was a culpable act to attempt to cross almost in front of a train moving with such celerity, about twenty-five miles an hour. We are unable to see anything to excuse him, and therefore the court was justified in nonsuiting the plaintiff, for the contributory negligence of the deceased. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
