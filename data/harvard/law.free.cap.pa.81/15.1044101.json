The goods were all paid up to May 3d 1870 by Richmond &amp; Co. The plaintiffs first knew of the agreement between Richmond &amp; Co. and the defendant, in February 1871. After the agreement with defendant, Richmond &amp; Co. proceeded to close out the business and agreed to dissolve the partnership; they had then enough to pay their debts. The furniture was in all. stages of progress ; furniture was made up after that time; defendant was there frequently through all the store; Richmond &amp; Co. were trying to get some one to go into business with them, but not having found any one, defendant said to one of the partners it was not policy in him to buy more goods'; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>be never authorized any of the firm to buy goods; he had no knowledge of their buying goods except from seeing them finishing goods and seeing the materials for finishing. Richmond &amp; Co. purchased large amounts of goods from others during the time covered by this account; this appeared by their books to which defendant had access; other persons who sold to Richmond &amp; Co. had no knowledge of defendant\u2019s interest. Richmond &amp; Co. closed out by sales at auction and at private sale; defendant received pai\u2019t of.the proceeds of the private sale, but not those from the auction sales; the proceeds not paid defendant were applied to paying the debts of the concern.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-6\">There was other evidence of the same character.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-7\">The plaintiffs having closed the court, Briggs, J., directed the entry of nonsuit, which the court in banc refused to take off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-8\">The plaintiffs assigned this for error, on the removal of the record to the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-9\"><em>W.

No credit was given the defendant; the credit was given to Richmond &amp; Co. as theretofore. Defendant was not a silent partner, and not even an absolute purchaser of the goods, which were assigned only as a collateral security and remained in possession, apparently, if not really, of Richmond &amp; Co. Nor did the defendant receive the entire proceeds. In no way could a contract to pay for the goods, taken up by Richmond &amp; Co., be raised by implication, and certainly there was none <em>by </em>express agreement or even express request.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
