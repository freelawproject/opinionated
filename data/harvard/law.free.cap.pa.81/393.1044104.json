If it appear that the testator meant the time of payment to be the period at which a legacy should vest, with a direction for'payment to the legatee at a definite period, although it be given in terms of immediate bequest, and the legatee die previously, he will have taken no interest in the legacy to transmit to his personal representatives, because the period of payment is of the essence of the bequest: 1 Roper on Legacies 557. The bequests became absolute at or upon the death of the testator\u2019s widow and not before. That part of testator\u2019s will, \u201c legal heirs,\u201d meant children : Umstead\u2019s Appeal, 10 P. F. Smith 365.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-9\"><em>A.

The only words are, \u201c to be equally divided among all my children or <em>their legal heirs.\u201d </em>If there were anything else in the will to evince the testator\u2019s meaning to be <em>children </em>when he used the words \u201clegal heirs,\u201d we might conclude th\u00e1t they were the legatees of the principal sum. But the form of the bequest to be \u201c equally divided among all my children,\u201d shows an evident intention to put all upon the same platform of ownership, which would carry a vested interest in all. The words following, \u201c or their legal heirs,\u201d evidently were used not to individuate grandchildren, but to supply a legal succession in the event of the death of any \u2018 one, and mean simply legal representatives. The legacies were therefore vested, and passed on the death of any one to his executors or administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
