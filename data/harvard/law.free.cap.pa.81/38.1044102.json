Water-mains were laid by the authorities of Philadelphia in the street in front of houses of Smith ; he connected with the main water-pipes to the houses; he paid the city for laying the main ; also the water rents for two years.

Such corporation is liable for injury resulting from the improper performance of work which it was its duty to perform: Mersey Docks <em>v. </em>Peirce, 11 H. of L. Cases 686; West. Sav.

F. Smith 420; Atchinson <em>v. </em>Challis, 9 Kansas 603; Mills <em>v. </em>Brooklyn, 32 New York 489. The act of the city was not the proximate cause: Penna. Railroad <em>v. </em>Kerr, 12 P. F. Smith 353.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"APO\">February 7th 1876,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court</p>\n<author id=\"b39-8\">Per Cdriam.</author>\n<p id=\"APyo\">The claim here is not for damages arising from the bursting of the water-pipes laid by the city, but for the loss of the water caused by the bursting of the pipes leading to the plaintiff\u2019s houses, from the action of frost. The real claim is for the' loss of the water, and this will not implicate the city in any loss beyond the consideration paid for its use, viz., the water-rents, and these were allowed. The introduction of water by the city into private houses is not on the footing of a contract, but of a license which is paid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
