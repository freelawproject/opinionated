F. Smith 55. The lien and claim show that it was based on contract dated in September or October 1872, signed by Mrs. A. Schriffer and Charles Schriffer, but not averring that this woman was the wife of Charles Schriffer. The averment in the lien that the building was constructed by virtue of one contract, could not be proved by offering in evidence a contract under seal, signed by Mrs. A. Schriffer, a married woman, for work done, or to be done. The variance was fatal: Cunningham <em>v. </em>Shaw, 7 Barr 401 ; Scott <em>v. </em>Horn, 9 Id. 407 ; Stump <em>v. </em>Hutchinson, 1 Jones 533.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-16\">A married woman cannot dispose of or charge her separate estate by an instrument under seal independently of her husband: Pettit <em>v. </em>Fretz, 9 Casey 118 ; Bear <em>v. </em>Bear, Id. 525 ; Murray <em>v. </em>Keyes, 11 Id. 384. The court could not enter judgment against this married woman, since there is no averment that it wras for the improvement of her separate estate, nor does it aver her coverture, nor that the contract was under seal. A mechanics\u2019 lien, to bind the separate estate of the wife, must show upon its face her cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ture, and that the work was done with her authority and consent. This lien shows none of these requisites, and is therefore radically and incurably defective: Dearie <em>v. </em>Martin, <em>supra. </em>She must be impleaded with her husband. An action against a married woman without naming her husband, and averring that it is for necessaries for her family, or the improvement of her separate estate, and judgment thereon, are void.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-5\"><em>II. N. Willard </em>and <em>W. U. Grearhart, </em>for defendants in error.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzX\">A reference to it (the contract) in the lien was unnecessary, mere surplusage: O\u2019Brien <em>v. </em>Logan, 9 Barr 99. If there had been defects in the lien, the plea cured them. Defects on the face of a claim are not raised by such a plea; they must be considered as waived. The invalidity of a lien cannot be taken advantage of under the plea of payment with leave: Lee <em>v. </em>Burke, 16 P. F. Smith 336; Lybrant <em>v. </em>Eberly, 12 Casey 347; Lewis <em>v. </em>Morgan, 11 S. &amp; R. 234; Abbott <em>v. </em>Lyon, 4 W. &amp; S. 38; Richabaugh <em>v. </em>Dugan, 7 Barr 394; Lehman <em>v. </em>Thomas, 5 W. &amp; S. 262.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Axy\">March 27th 1876.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b388-6\">Mr. Justice Gordon</author>\n<p id=\"Aky\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The claim, as filed by the plaintiff, was defective in two material points. 1. It did not set out the coverture of Mrs. A. Schriffer, but joined her with Charles Schriffer without indicating that he was her husband. Without more, that was sufficient to avoid the lien. In order to charge the property of a married woman, the fact of coverture should be set forth; and it must appear from the record that the debt which is sought- to be charged upon her separate estate is within the spirit and meaning of the Act of 1848 : Dearie <em>et ux. v. </em>Martin, 28 P. F. Smith 55. 2. The claim does not allege that the work and materials were done and furnished for and about the improvement of her separate estate. This also is a defect fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s lien ; for it must appear affirmatively that the debt was contracted, not only with the intent to apply the proceeds thereof to such improvement, hut that they were actually so applied: Heugh <em>v. </em>Jones <em>et ux., </em>8 Casey 432. In fine, it must appear from the record that the debt charged is within the letter or \u2022 spirit of some one of the exceptions of the Act of 1848: Mahon <em>v. </em>Gormley, 12 Harris 80; Murray <em>v. </em>Keyes <em>et ux., </em>11 Casey 384. An amendment was made within the six months allowed by the statute for filing the claim, setting forth the 'fact that Charles Schriffer was the husband of Mrs. A. Schriffer. This doubtless cured the first defect which we have pointed out, but not the second. As, however, this amendment was stricken off by a subsequent one, striking out the name of Charles Schriffer altogether, and as the judgment was rendered on the record as it thus stood, it is clear that the first amendment failed of its object. Indeed this last error was, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>possible, worse than the first; for as the proceedings now stand they not only fail to show -coverture, but they charge the defendant, confessedly a married woman, as a feme sole. It is manifest, from the above, that the contract between the defendant and the plaintiffs should not have been admitted in evidence; for the record failing to show such a condition of affairs as would charge her estate, her contract, however explicit, must count as nothing: Dearie <em>v. </em>Martin, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
