Leslie the sum of $2000, on a first mortgage, requested the defendant, then being recorder of deeds of Philadelphia, \u201cto certify every unsatisfied mortgage of a messuage and lot, or piece of ground situate on the north side of St. Albans Place, 207 feet 6 inches west of Twenty-third street, in the Twenty-sixth Ward of the said city of Philadelphia, containing in front on the said St. Albans Place 16 feet, and extending in depth northward 62 feet to a twelve-feet-wide alley; given by the said Charles M. S. Leslie since October 1st 1868 ; that the defendant, on the 21st of August 1871, negligently and falsely certified that there was no prior unsatisfied mortgage of the premises given by Leslie since the time mentioned, except one to Elizabeth C. Erwin, from the lien of which the premises mentioned had been released; that, relying on the truth of said certificate, the plaintiffs lent to Leslie the sum of $2000 on the security of his mortgage of the premises to the plaintiffs. The declaration averred that there was, at the time of giving the certificate, remaining of record in the recorder\u2019s office, a mortgage of the premises from Leslie to Alexander Smith, dated August 11th 1870, for $8000, and thereby the mortgage from Leslie to plaintiffs was worthless, and the $2000 lent to Leslie was lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-7\">Another count was that, on the 20th of December 1871, the plaintiffs, being about to lend to Leslie a further sum of $1600 on a mortgage to be given by him on a messuage and lot or piece of ground situate on the south side of St. Albans Place, 335 feet 6 inches west of Twenty-third street, in the Twenty-sixth Ward of the said city of Philadelphia, containing in front on the said St. Albans Place 16 feet, and extending in depth southward 62 feet to a twelve-feet-wide alley, and requested the defendant as recorder to certify every unsatisfied mortgage on said premises given by Leslie since October 1st 1868; that the defendant certified that there was no unsatisfied mortgage but that before mentioned to Elizabeth C. Erwin; that the plaintiffs, relying on the certificate, lent to Leslie the $1600, and took a mortgage from him dated December 19th 1871, on the last-mentioned premises. The declaration averred that there was at the time remaining on record in the recorder\u2019s office an unsatisfied mortgage on these premises from Leslie to Smith, dated October 27th 1870, for $2500: that thereby the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage was worthless, and the $1600 were wholly lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-8\">The case was tried October 28th 1874, before Lynd, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-9\">The plaintiffs gave in evidence the following papers :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>No. 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\">\u201cNo. 2327 St. Albans Place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\">\u201cPlease certify every unsatisfied mortgage of messuage and lot or piece of ground situate on the north side of St. Albans Place, 207 feet 6 inches west of Twenty-third street, in the Twenty-sixth Ward of the city of Philadelphia, containing in front, on the said St. Albans Place, 16 feet, and extending in depth northward 62 feet, to a twelve-feet-wide alley, given by Charles M.

That such a certificate was issued false in fact ; that it was ordered and paid for by the defendants, and that in consequence they suffered damages, were points not in dispute. That the recorder is prim\u00e1, facie liable to respond in damages for such false search, has been settled in McCaraher <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 5 W. &amp; S. 21, and is no longer an open question.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>It was decided by the present Chief Justice at Nisi Prius, in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Kellogg, 6 Phila. R. 90, that this liability is to the party who asks and pays for the search, and does not extend to his assigns or alienee.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The contention here all grows out of the fact that the search in this case, by the request of the 'conveyancer of the defendants, was ordered and paid for by the owner of the premises, in order that he might obtain a loan of money on mortgage from the defendants, and the certificate wTas so used, and the money so obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">It is urged, that by the employment of the owner as the agent for this purpose, the defendants are affected with this knowledge of the existence of the mortgage, which was omitted in the certificate. This is a very familiar principle and well settled. But it is equally well settled that the principal is only to be affected by knowledge acquired in the course of the business in which the agent was employed. This limitation of the rule is perfectly well established by our own cases, and it is not necessary to look further: Hood <em>v. </em>Fahnestock, 8 Watts 489; Bracken v. Miller, 4 W. &amp; S. 110 ; Martin <em>v. </em>Jackson, 3 Casey 508. It is a mistake to suppose that it depends upon the reason that no man can be supposed to always carry in his mind a recollection of former occurrences, and that if it be proved that he actually had it in his mind at-the time, the rule is different. It may support the reasonableness of the rule to consider that the memory of men is fallible in the very best, and varies in different men. But the true rea.son of the limitation is a technical one, that it is only during the agency that the agent represents, and stands in the shoes of his principal. Notice &gt;to him is then notice to his principal. Notice to him twenty-four hours before the relation commenced is no more notice than twenty-four hours after it had ceased would be. Knowledge can be no better than direct actual notice. It was incumbent on the plaintiff to show that the knowledge of the agent, to use the accurate language of one of our cases, \u201c was gained in the transaction in which he was employed.\u201d There was not only no evidence of this offer by the plaintiff, but it was plain that it had been gained before, and in an entirely different transaction. It is not necessary to consider in this view of the matter whether the alleged agent was really such, or only the servant or clerk of the conveyancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">It is urged that the conveyancer of the defendants, in the employment of the owner, who was the applicant for the loan, and interested, therefore, to obtain clear searches, was guilty of negligence, which is imputable to his constituents, and will, therefore, bar their recovery. But this is to maintain that a man is to presume fraud or forgery in one, whose character is good, and that if he does not he is prim\u00e1 facie negligent. When the scrivener received a clear certificate under the undoubted official seal of the recorder, he surely was not bound, to presume that a fraud had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>committed on the recorder or his clerk, nor was there any evidence from which such fraud could be inferred. If there was no such presumption, neither would there arise any presumption beforehand, that the owner would succeed in corrupting or deceiving the clerk or servant of the plaintiff. Without some such presumption, how can it be said that it was prim\u00e1. facie evidence of negligence ? that the owner was employed in the mere ministerial service of ordinary paying for and procuring the certificate ?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We are of opinion that the learned judge was right in directing a verdict for the plaintiffs below.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Judgment affirmed. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
