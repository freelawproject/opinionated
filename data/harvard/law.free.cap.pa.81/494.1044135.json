Wade directed us where to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>find the bag of silver and it was by information received from him that I had the search made in the creek; a month after the robbery found the bag of silver; * * * I took possession of all the papers of John McBride that I could find at the house; I got some promissory notes payable to John McBride from Powell\u2019s; I made a thorough search of the whole house for all that I could find;' I have examined all the papers ; these are all the papers, except a note or two not collected, payable to John McBride; the first claim made or notice I had of any claim was before the auditor on the eleventh of November last; Messrs.

An administrator is answerable, in his official character, for no cause of action that was not created by the. act of the decedent himself; the present action being brought against the defendant as administrator of John McBride, upon an alleged implied promise arising out of acts of the defendant personally since the death of John McBride, there can be no recovery in the present form of action, and the verdict must therefore be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-13\">Answer: \u201cIf this action is founded upon acts of the defendant personally since the death of John McBride, then the law would be as stated in this point, and the verdict must be for the defendant. But the plaintiff claims that the evidence does show that John McBride has the possession of assets belonging to the estate of Sarah Lusk, and that his estate is therefore liable to account for the same. This involves a question of fact which you must determine.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-14\">2. The plaintiff having failed to produce any evidence which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>would warrant the jury in finding that any part of the money or other personal property of which John McBride died possessed, and which came to the hands of the defendant as his administrator, belonged to Sarah Lusk, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, or that the said John McBride was liable to account to the said Sarah Lusk at the time of her death, or to her administrator since her death, for any moneys had and received by the said John McBride for the use of Sarah Lusk, he, the plaintiff, has not shown any right to recover in this action, and the verdict must therefore be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-6\">Answer: \u201c The evidence is for the jury. We decline to say peremptorily that there is no evidence which would warrant the jury in finding that any part of the money or other personal property which came into the hands of defendant as the administrator of John McBride, belonged to Sarah Lusk, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, but leave that as a question of fact for you to determine under the evidence, adding that it is incumbent on the plaintiff to establish that fact, to authorize a verdict in his favor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-7\">3. If the jury believe, from the evidence, that the death of John McBride and Isabella his wife occurred in such a manner and was attended with circumstances such as would make the occurrence generally and extensively known; that soon after the death of John McBride letters of administration upon his estate were issued to the defendant, who proceeded to make an inventory of the property; that defendant caused search to be made in the manner testified to by him for money supposed to have been stolen and secreted; that he afterwards made public sale, at the residence of John McBride, of his goods and chattels ; that he afterwards filed an account in the office of the register, charging himself, as administrator, with the money and property in dispute in this action ; that his account was confirmed, without any exception, by the heirs of Sarah Lusk ; and that an auditor was appointed by the Orphans\u2019 Court to distribute the balance in the defendant\u2019s hands ; and if they further believe that the death of Sarah Lusk occurred two years, or thereabouts, prior to that of John McBride; and that no claim was made by the heirs of Sarah Lusk upon John McBride, in his lifetime, nor the defendant, after his death, until this action was brought, the evidence to support the demand made here must be clear and satisfactory; and the plaintiff having failed to produce any such evidence, the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-8\">Answer: \u201cWe affirm this point, except the concluding clause, which assumes that the plaintiff has failed to produce any .such evidence.

The Orphans\u2019 Court of Lycoming county has exclusive authority to ascertain the amount of the property of John McBride, and to make distribution thereof, not only amongst the next of kin, but also amongst creditors; the plaintiff, therefore, cannot maintain this action, but must seek his remedy in the Orphans\u2019 Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-6\">The court reserved this point without answering it, and charged, * * * ._</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-7\">\u201c The controversy is one of fact chiefly; the plaintiff alleges that a portion of the money and other assets which fell into the hands of the defendant as of the estate of John McBride, belonged to the estate of Sarah Lusk, and asks a verdict for the value of the same. This is denied by the defendant, and his counsel insists that there is not sufficient proof in the cause to warrant such a verdict. There must be evidence sufficient to produce conviction upon your minds of the truth of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations to warrant a verdict in his favor. All verdicts must he founded on evidence. Juries are not at liberty to guess or judge without evidence what would be fair or equitable between parties, but of the value and weight of evidence you are the exclusive judges under the responsibility resting upon you as jurors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-8\">\u201c [It may not always be practicable for parties to produce proof positively and precisely defining amounts, quantities or values, yet if from an impartial consideration of all the evidence in the cause, a right of recovery is established to the satisfaction of a jury, and there is evidence from which they can substantially ascertain amounts, quantities or values, that is sufficient proof to warrant a verdict.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-9\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $4900.54.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-10\">The court afterwards entered judgment as follows on the reserved point:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-11\">\u201cAnd now, to wit, February 6th 1875, the question of jurisdiction raised by the defendant\u2019s fourth point, reserved for consideration by the court, is ruled by declining to give the instruction asked for, and maintaining the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas.

It is clear, that though McBride\u2019s possession might have been tortious originally, yet the plaintiff below had a perfect right to waive the tort and recover in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the court below for money McBride had received to the use of Sarah Lusk. It was an action to establish a debt against the estate of McBride, properly brought in a common-law court, and not involving the necessity of determining any question as to the amount of McBride\u2019s estate within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court: Sergeant <em>v. </em>Ewing, 6 Casey 76; Swain <em>v. </em>Ettling, 8 Id. 486; McLean\u2019s Ex\u2019rs <em>v. </em>Wade, 3 P. F. Smith 146. There was no error then in the decision of the court below, which forms the ground of the thirteenth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">It appeared that two brothers and four sisters, children of Patrick Lusk, lived together upon a farm, which they had derived from their father, who died in 1816, leaving other children as well as other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The brothers and sisters all died intestate and without issue. Sarah and Isabella survived the others. John McBride lived with them; reputed to have married Isabella. Sarah died in March 1872. John McBride and Isabella continued to live together on the farm until July 22d 1873, when they were robbed and both murdered by one Nelson E. Wade, who was afterwards tried and convicted for the crime. A considerable amount of money was found in different .parts of the house, which was taken possession of by the administrator of John McBride. . The endeavor of the plaintiff below was to show that this money was the money of the Lusk brothers and sisters, which they had acquired by a long course of labor and saving \u2014 that at least a moiety of it was the property of Sarah Lusk at the time of her death. Sarah Lusk had purchased of her brother, John Lusk, in 1859, a farm, which, on the 28th day of June 1871, she had conveyed to John McBride and Isabella McBride (formerly Isabella Lusk), for the consideration of $3000. Prim\u00e1 facie this consideration was paid, and it was urged that to that extent there was some evidence to sustain a claim by the estate of Sarah Lusk upon the estate of John McBride. In view of these facts, without referring to other details, it seemed very clear that there was evidence proper, to be left to the jury. It is evident then that the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth assignments of error, which are all of them predicated of the assumption that there was no sufficient evidence for the jury, must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">We think, however, that the first and second assignments of error must be sustained. Samuel Lusk and Martha Scudder, children of James Lusk, a deceased brother of Sarah Lusk, were offered as witnesses by the plaintiff below, objected to as interested in the event of the cause, and therefore incompetent, but the objection was overruled and the witnesses admitted. They would be entitled, as distributees, to a share of the estate of Sarah Lusk. They were directly interested, therefore, that the plaintiff should recover, and prior to the Act of April 15th 1869, Pamph. L.-30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u201c An act allowing parties in interest to be witnesses,\u201d were undoubtedly incompetent: 1 Grreenleaf on Evid. 392, and cases there cited ; Mishler <em>v. </em>Merkle, 10 Barr 509. It-must have been supposed by the learned court below that the act referred to rendered them competent. But this was an error. The act declares expressly that it \u201c shall not apply to actions by or against executors, administrators, or guardians.\u201d It can make no difference that both plaintiff and defendant are administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Even looking beyond the letter to the spirit of the act, that a living party shall not be heard to prove a claim against the estate of a decedent, who was also a party to the contract or transaction, whose lips are now sealed, the admission of these witnesses cannot be sustained. If Sarah Lusk, when living, would not have been competent against the administrator of John McBride, neither can those who stand in her shoes, and will be entitled to a part of the money when recovered. This was not a controversy between parties claiming by devolution under a deceased owner respecting the right of such owner. They claimed not from one but two parties, whose rights were adverse to each other. Neither was their evidence proposed to to be confined to facts occurring subsequently to the decease of John McBride, so as to be within the provision of the supplement of April 9th 1870, Pamph. L. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">We think, too, that the third assignment of error must be sustained. It was certainly no objection to the competency of the evidence offered, that the facts occurred more than thirty years ago, and were too remote. That might be an available ground of attacking the credibility of the witness, but that was for the jury. It was relevant to prove the intemperate habits of John McBride, but not in the way proposed, \u2014 that the Lusk family had given notice to a tavern-keeper not to trust him. That after all was mere hearsay. Nor was it at all relevant that McBride denied that Isabella was his wife. The plaintiff below was suing as the administrator of Sarah Lusk, who died before Isabella, and was suing to recover her property, not derived from Isabella. Whether Isabella was or was not the lawful wife of John McBride, was not a question relevant to the issue before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">We think there was error in admitting the evidence complained of in the fourth assignment. It was irrelevant that the claim had been made before an auditor in the Orphans\u2019 Court, and nothing to the issue why the case had been ordered to be placed at the head of the list.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">We think the court were right in admitting the evidence of the partition of the farm in Woodward township, between the six brothers and sisters, and that they took possession of their respective purparts, and on whose lands John McBride lived during his life. It had an evident bearing upon the main point, whether the money in the house belonged to the Lusks or to McBride. So, also, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>as to the sixth assignment, the evidence therein complained of being of the same character.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We think the court were right in rejecting evidence offered by the defendant of the declaration by Nelson E. Wade, the robber and murderer, of what he had taken from the house. It was, of course, mere hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">As to the fourteenth and last assignment, it is disposed of by Hall <em>v. </em>Rupley, 10 Barr 231, where it was held that although a withdrawn declaration and a bill of particulars delivered under it ought not to be taken out by the jury, yet the judgment will not be reversed if the declaration is in substance the same as the one on which the cause was tried, and the bill is but a statement of the claim of which evidence was given on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Judgment reversed and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
