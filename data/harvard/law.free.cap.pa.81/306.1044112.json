The estate of a married woman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>cannot be taken even on a judgment 'confessed by her for necessaries, or for improvements made to her estate, unless her liability appears from the record: Finley\u2019s Appeal, 17 P. F. Smith 453. A writ of error is available to set aside the judgment: Hartman <em>v. </em>Ogborn, 4 P. F. Smith 124. A married woman\u2019s estate is protected by the Act of 1848 from all claims against her husband ; is liable only for such debts as are established in the method provided by the act, and equity will prevent the use of process to deprive her of her estate, unless such process is authorized by law : Hunter\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 194. A sale on process issued in such a case will convey no title : Finley\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-5\"><em>B. P.

The claim is filed against the wife, and so appears upon the record, and this is all that is necessary to charge her estate: Finley\u2019s Appeal, 17 P. F. Smith 453. Even if the claim filed in this case is defective, the plaintiffs in error have no remedy by writ of error, the judgment in the case being entered upon an award of arbitrators. \u2022 There has never been 'any appeal from said award. It was then too late to ask the court below to interfere ; the award had become a judgment, and it was not then in the power of the court below to strike off the lien and set aside the judgment: Le Barron <em>v. </em>Harriott, 2 Penna. R. 154; O\u2019Donnell <em>v. </em>Lynch, 1 W. &amp; S. 283; Lloyd <em>v. </em>Barr, 1 Jones 41. From proceedings under the Compulsory Arbitration Act, there is no remedy by writ of error : Sullivan <em>v. </em>Weaver, 9 Barr 223 ; Royer <em>v. </em>Myers, 3 Harris 89; Drenkle <em>v. </em>Garber, 7 Watts 122; Sands <em>v. </em>Rolshouse, 3 Barr 458 ; Waage <em>v. </em>Weiser, 5 Whart. 307 ; Walls <em>v. </em>Wilson, 4 Casey 514.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A_3\">March 27th 1876.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b308-6\">Mr. Justice Gordon</author>\n<p id=\"Ago\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The mechanic\u2019s lien in this case is worthless, in that the claim on which it rests does not set forth that the work was done and the materials were furnished at the request or on the contract of Mrs. Lloyd. This very question has been but recently before us, in the case of Dearie and Wife <em>v. </em>Martin, 28 P. F. Smith 55. In that case, the claim though filed against the wife\u2019s property, failed to set forth the fact of coverture, or that the work and materials were furnished at her request. The defendant filed a plea of coverture in bar of the claim ; this was followed by a replication on part of the plaintiff, \u201c that the work and materials were done and furnished at the request, and on the authority of the said Margaret Dearie, as well as the said James Dearie, and were necessary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>convenient to the preservation and enjoyment of her said estate.\u201d Defendants demurred. The court below gave judgment for the plaintiff on this demurrer. The case was brought up to this court on writ of error, and reversed. <em>Held, </em>Williams, J., delivering the opinion, that the claim was incurably defective in that it did not set forth her coverture, and that the work and materials were done and furnished at her request, and that, as this did not appear in the claim, it did not matter that the work and materials were in fact furnished on her order.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">This was but following in the lead of Finley\u2019s Appeal, 17 P. F. Smith 453, in which it was held, per Agnew, J., that the divesture of a wife\u2019s title, under a mechanic\u2019s lien, must depend upon what appears by the record, and not upon proof that she had consented to the contract under which the claim was filed. So in Mahon <em>v. </em>Gormley, 12 Harris 80, it was said by Lewis, J., that where the <em>narr. </em>was on a promissory note, and contained no averment concerning the origin of the debt, a plea of coverture, on demurrer, must be held a good answer to it. If the plaintiff wished to avoid such effect, he must either reply setting forth the special circumstances on which he relies to bind her, or amend his declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">As a special plea could not have helped the plaintiff in this case, inasmuch as the lien is created by the claim filed, and all things necessary to its validity must appear in it, and as it is too late now to amend, it is apparent from the authorities above cited, that the plaintiff had no lien against Mrs. Lloyd\u2019s property, and should not have had judgment on his scire facias.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
