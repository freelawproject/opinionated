Pratt, againt George Patterson. After the case was at issue the death of defendant was suggested, and Lydia Patterson and Frederick Patterson, his executors, were substituted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-17\">The action was for the recovery of commissions for the sale of real estate by the plaintiff for the decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-18\">The case was tried March 12th 1874, before Mr. Justice Williams at Nisi Pi'ius.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-19\">A suit had been previously brought between the same parties for the same cause of action in the District Court of Philadelphia. On the trial of that suit both parties testified; a verdict was rendered on that trial which was set aside; the suit was then discontinued and this action instituted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>On the trial of this action the plaintiff was offered as a witness. He was objected to by the defendants as incompetent, was rejected by t'he court and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-6\">Plaintiff then offered in evidence the notes of his testimony taken on that trial; this offer was objected to by the defendants, rejected by the court and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-7\">W. W. Harding testified, that wishing to purchase the property, he ascertained from plaintiff that he could effect a sale; plaintiff told him the price was $140,000 and that it was useless to try to get it for less; he offered the plaintiff $135,000 for it; he said if witness would give $140,000 he could get it; witness agreed to give that sum, the name of one his clerks to he used in the agreement, which was drawn for $140,000 and signed by the clerk. Witness did not wish to be known as the purchaser as he was desirous of purchasing an adjoining property ; he was able and prepared to carry out the contract for $140,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-8\">Another witness testified that the plaintiff urged the decedent to take $135,000 ; that he refused and plaintiff then produced the agreement to sell for $140,000 ; decedent declined to sign the agreement, but said when the parties were ready to pay the money he would bring the deeds and papers ; decedent said that plaintiff was to receive $1400 commission. Henry C. Townsend, Esq., had been the counsel of the decedent, but witness did not know whether he had been consulted in this matter; decedent made no objection to the price $140,000, nor to the amount to be secured on the property; nothing was said about Harding being the purchaser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-9\">II. C. Townsend, Esq., testified that decedent had consulted him frequently about this property; he had prepared a paper containing brief terms of agreement for sale of the property; he had advised decedent to impose those terms on- all purchasers in any contract he might make. Witness had received a letter from Mr. Miller, counsel for the plaintiff, which he could not find, of which he thought a paper shown him was a copy; he had received also a letter to him from plaintiff, of which one shown him was a copy; he had searched for it but could not find it; he said also that a letter shown him was one written by himself to Mr. Miller; he could not recollect whether it had been shown to decedent. Mr. Miller\u2019s letter was to him as counsel for decedent for whom he was then acting; witness told decedent the substance of his reply which decedent thought was right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-10\">The plaintiff offered in evidence the copy of his letter to Mr. \u25a0Townsend; it was objected to by defendants because no notice had been given to produce the original, rejected by the court and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-11\">The plaintiff offered to show by \u2014 Alexander that $500 were tendered to decedent, and what Patterson said about this transaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>when he made the tender, and that Mr. Patterson treated the witness roughly and turned him away, saying that Mr. Pratt had lied to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-6\">The defendants objected to the offer, it was rejected by the court \u2022a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-7\">The \u201c brief of terms of agreement\u201d and the agreement offered to decedent were' given in evidence; they contain nothing important to the case.

Raymond 1009. The plaintiff was not offered to prove any fact not in evidence; ordering a nonsuit therefore worked no injury and there should be no reversal even if his rejection was improper : Wright <em>v. </em>Wood, 11 Harris 120; Winsor <em>v. </em>Maddock, 14 P. F. Smith 231. As to the rejection of the copy of plaintiff\u2019s letter he cited Milliken <em>v. </em>Barr, 7 Barr 23 ; Baldney <em>v. </em>Ritchie, 1 Starkie 338 ; Burton <em>v. </em>Payne, 2 Carr. &amp; Payne 520; Taplin <em>v. </em>Atty, 3 Bingh. 164.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A-4\">May 8th 1876.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b116-17\">Mr. Justice Mercur,</author>\n<p id=\"AZc\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b116-18\">The plaintiff brought this suit to recover commissions as a real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>estate broker. In a former suit between him and the testator, about the same subject-matter each party had testified and the testimony had been reduced to writing. The verdict in that case was set aside and the suit discontinued. This suit was afterwards brought between the same parties. Before the trial the defendant died and his executors were substituted. On the trial the notes of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony taken in the former suit were offered in evidence and rejected by the court. This is assigned for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The competency of this kind of evidence under similar circumstances, received a careful consideration in Evans\u2019s Adm\u2019x <em>v. </em>Reed, 28 P. F. Smith 415. That case differed in this. There the notes of testimony of the deceased party were held admissible in the same suit in which they were taken; here the testimony is that of a surviving party, offered in a subsequent suit involving the same subject-matter against the executors of the deceased party. There it was said \u201cif the deposition of a party be duly and regularly taken so as to be admissible in evidence in a pending case it is very clear that it would be admissible in a subsequent suit, between the administrators of the parties involving the same subject-matter.\u201d Here it is a subsequent suit, tried after the death of one of the parties, and involving the same subject-matter. The very case assumed there, substantially exists here. In each case the testimony was not only admissible when taken, but had actually been given in evidence. It must not be overlooked that the Act of 15th April 1869 is an enlarging, not-a restraining act. It makes no witness nor evidence incompetent that was competent before its passage. Sheetz <em>v. </em>Norris, antea, p. 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The first section of the Act of 28th March 1814, Purd. Dig. 625, pl. 24, declares: \u201c Any deposition taken or to be taken in any cause, which by the rules of law may be read in evidence on the trial of the cause in which it is or may be taken, shall be allowed tobe read in evidence in any subsequent cause wherein the same matter shall be in dispute between the said parties or persons, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns.\u201d The third section of the Act of 15th April 1869 authorizes the testimony of all witnesses made competent by that act to be taken \u201c by deposition or commission issued as the case may require.\u201d In Evans\u2019s Adm\u2019x <em>v. </em>Reed, supra, the notes of testimony are considered substantially as a deposition duly taken. Hence it was there held, evidence competent under the Act of 1869, when taken, is admissible under the Act of 1814.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">This evidence was taken on due notice, with ample opportunity for cross-examination. It was not testimony that could have been fabricated after the death of the party whose interest might be injuriously affected thereby. When taken the parties stood on an equal footing. Each had the right to perpetuate his own testimony. Each availed himself of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>All statutes -which provide for the perpetuation of evidence are in furtherance of justice and a due administration of the law. They should receive a liberal construction. This is not the case of the deposition of a person taken when he was not interested, but becomes so before it is offered in evidence. Here he was no more interested when his testimony was offered,than when it was first taken. His interest had remained unchanged. The second assignment is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The offer to put the plaintiff on the stand to testify in regard to matters which occurred in the lifetime of the defendant, rests on a different basis, and there was no error in rejecting the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The third assignment has no merit. If Townsend, as agent for the defendant, received and held the letter, notice to produce the original was necessary before a copy was admissible in evidence. If he was not such agent, the defendant could not be affected by the letter, inasmuch as, he had no knowledge of its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The time- when the tender was made, ,and what the defendant said material to the issue are not stated in the offer covered by the fourth assignment. It should be shown affirmatively, that the plaintiff was injured by the rejection of the evidence. We are unable to see any such effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">We would not disturb the judgment of nonsuit on the evidence before the court; but by reason of the rejection of the notes of testimony the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Judgment reversed and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
