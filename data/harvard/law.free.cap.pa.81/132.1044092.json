Shallcross and Lamira A. Shallcross his wife, entered into a joint bond for $7400, conditioned for the payment of $3700. The bond was secured by a mortgage of the same parties on the real estate of the wife. She \u2022died May 8th 1873. The real estate was sold under the mortgage, November 8th 1873, for $3188.54. On the 31st of March 1874, judgment was entered on the bond and warrant against Samuel S. Shallcross and Lamira A. Shallcross. Under a fieri facias issued February 20th 1875, on this judgment, the interest of Samuel S. Shallcross in certain real estate was levied on and condemned, and a vend. ex. issued, which was stayed. A rule was taken to strike off the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-14\">The court (Allison P. J.) discharged the rule, on the ground that the bond, though joint, was operative against the party competent to contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-15\">Shallcross took a writ of error, and assigned for error the decree discharging his rule.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b132-16\"><em>P.

Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ABg\">\u2014 The warrant of attorney and bond of Mrs. Shallcross were a mere nullity. The entry of judgment on it was not binding on her and can be stricken off. But it does not follow that the bond and warrant are void as to her husband, Samuel S. Shallcross. Being void as to her, it was his bond singly. We see no error in refusing to strike off the judgment as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
