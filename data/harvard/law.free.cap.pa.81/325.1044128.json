Erank Boyer, Esq., late of the city of Reading, died seised in his demesne as of fee of a certain house and lot'of ground, No. 1033 Penn street, in the city of Reading aforesaid, and left a will and testament, in and by which he provided, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows, viz.: (stating the clause as to the sale of this property on her desire.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-10\">\u201c Now, therefore, I, Lizzie Boyer, widow of the said B.

Baer, Esq., and Michael Haak, the executors named in said will, letters of administration <em>cum testamento annexo de bonis non </em>were granted, to sell the aforesaid property under and by virtue of the provisions of the will aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-11\">1'n consequence of the foregoing request the said Jerome L. Boyer advertised said house and lot of ground for sale (as No. 1) on the 19th of February, A. n. 1876, and on said last-mentioned day sold the same to C. R. Lantz, the defendant, for $16,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-12\">One of the conditions was:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-13\">\u201c The purchaser shall immediately after the sale, execute an agreement for the payment of the purchase-money in the following manner, viz.: On property No. 1, $500 forthwith, $5000 on April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>1st 1876, $5000 on October 1st 1876, and the balance on the 1st day of January 1877.\u201d * * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">Appended to the conditions of sale was the following agreement :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-7\">\u201cIt is hereby declared and agreed, by and between Jerome L. Boyer, administrator, and the vendor of the estate mentioned in the above conditions, and O. R. Lantz, the purchaser, that the said C. R. Lantz has become the purchaser of property No. 1 of the premises so sold, at the sum of $16,000.

Lantz refused to pay the $500, which, according to the terms of the agreement, were due and payable forthwith, upon the ground that the said Jerome L. Boyer, administrator as aforesaid, had not the power to vest in him, Lantz, the title to the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-9\">By the case it was agreed:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-10\">\u201c If the court shall be of opinion that the plaintiff is competent to vest in defendant the title of B.

L. 86, which provides that \u201c all and singular the provisions of this act relative to the powers, duties and liabilities of executors are hereby extended to administrators with a will annexed:\u201d Evans <em>v. </em>Chew, 21 P. F. Smith 47. It was held in that case, that it mattered not whether there was an absolute direction so as to work an immediate conversion, or the power was discretionary. It seems equally clear tha.t it makes no difference whether the distribution is to be. immediate or upon the expiration of a certain period of time, or upon the uncertain contingency of a life or lives. In the case before us, a life estate was given to the widow, and absolute direction to the executors to sell, if she should desire it, and the proceeds of the sale to be invested in good real estate security, the interest to be paid to the widow for her life, and a part of the principal, if she should desire, to be invested in a house for her use for life. Eventually, however, the testator provides, \u201c as to all the rest and residue of my estate, real, personal or mixed, it is my will that the same be distributed between my wife and children according to the intestate laws of this Commonwealth.\u201d Now the wife\u2019s share, when her life estate should expire, would certainly be a part of this residue. He makes a common fund of his estate, \u201c real, personal or mixedand by whom is the distribution to be made ? By his executors, certainly, and that <em>virtute officii. </em>This duty of distribution then devolved of necessity upon the administrator <em>de. bonis non cum testamento annexo. </em>If so, he must be entitled to receive and invest the fund, and hold it so invested until the period of final distribution shall arrive. We are of opinion then that the plaintiff below, Jerome L. Boyer, the administrator with the will annexed of B. Frank Boyer, deceased, is competent to vest in the defendant, C. R. Lantz, the title of B. Frank Boyer, deceased, to the premises, by deed executed by him in pursuance of the powers in the said will contained, and of said request of Lizzie Boyer, the widow of said B. Frank Boyer, deceased, and for the purposes in the said will mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
