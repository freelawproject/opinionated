S. and II., partners in a bakery, owned real estate which was used for partnership purposes ; they sold one-third of the interest in the firm to B., and afterwards conveyed to him one-third of the real estate. W. afterwards entered a judgment against B. S. died, and in proceedings in' equity by his administrators, against II. and B. as surviving partners, an account was decreed and a receiver appointed ; he petitioned the court, showing that the personal property was not sufficient to pay the debts, and asking for an order to sell the real estate, which was made, describing it as the property \u201c of the late firm of S., II. &amp; B.under it the real estate was sold to 1?. Under W.\u2019s judgment B.\u2019s interest in the real estate was sold by the sheriff to W., the jury found that it was not partnership property. Held, that the sale by the receiver did not pass B.\u2019s separate interest in the real estate discharged of W.\u2019s judgment, but that he took that interest under the sheriff\u2019s sale.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b377-6\">2.

J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-17\">The plaintiff after giving in evidence such of the foregoing facts as showed a prim\u00e1 facie title in him, rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-18\">The defendant called Pughe, the receiver, who testified that previously to May 1870, Schlager &amp; Hiller\u00e9 were doing business as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>partners in a steam-bakery on the property in question ; which was the only property they had in partnership ; after investigation into the business by the plaintiff and his son, Wesley D. Barnes, the son became a member of the firm about May 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">Defendant gave evidence also that the plaintiff, about the time he issued his original fi. fa., knew of the proceedings in equity against the firm for the appointment of a receiver, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-7\">Hillers, one of the partners, testified that the plaintiff and his son made an application to witness and Schlager to admit the son into the firm; they went over the establishment and examined it thoroughly, and also examined their books to ascertain the extent of the business; the old firm agreed to sell one-third interest for $10,000 ; this sum was not to go into the partnership, but was to be applied to the debts of Schlager &amp; Hillers, which they owed on therbuilding ; the real estate was to be held as partnership property, and the conveyance of the one-third of the real estate was in pursuance of the agreement for the partnership ; that agreement was prepared by the plaintiff; he furnished all the first payment, $5000 to his son. Schlager, Hillers &amp; Barnes used the property for partnership purposes as it had been previously used by Schlager &amp; Hillers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-8\">When the plaintiff was investigating into the business previously to his son entering the firm, he was shown the building, engines, &amp;c., all the stock of flour, and other materials for baking, as the partnership property ; the building covered the whole lot. except a small strip. The remainder of 'the purchase-money beyond the first $5000 was paid by the son, he took it out of the business and charged himself with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-9\">There was other evidence for defendant for the purpose of showing that the real estate was partnership property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-10\">The plaintiff testified that the one-third of the real estate was conveyed clear of encumbrance so that he could have a lien on it to secure his advance to his son, and that the' understanding was that it was not to be considered partnership property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-11\">The defendant\u2019s points and their answers were as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-12\">1. If the jury find that the lot in controversy was purchased for partnership property, and held and used for the purpose of carrying on the partnership business, and that the plaintiff knew that it was held as partnership property, the property so held and used was first liable to partnership debts, and the receiver\u2019s sal\u00e9 was good and valid to vest the property in the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-13\">Answer: \u201c If you are satisfied by clear, distinct and positive proof, that the plaintiff knew the transaction t\u00f3 be as stated in the point, notwithstanding the deed was to the contrary, the proposition is well put, and we affirm it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-14\">2. The decree for the sale of the real estate on the petition of the receiver, in the equity proceedings, was a judicial finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the realty to be personal property, and liable to partnership debts, and the sale vested title in the purchaser in the whole property. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\">Answer : \u201c We can hardly affirm that proposition in the broad terms in which it is couched. So far as it was partnership property, unquestionably the decree on the equity side of the court was conclusive, and bound every person in connection with the ownership. If it was partnership property, then, unquestionably, the title was conveyed, by the deed of the receiver, to Mr. Charles H. Foster; hut if it never was partnership property, but was held by the partners as tenants in common, then the adjudication referred to in the point was not conclusive as against the plaintiff. With this qualification we affirm the proposition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">3. The sale by the receiver under order of the court, was a judicial sale, made prior to the sheriff\u2019s sale on plaintiff\u2019s judgment, and vested title in the defendant, superior to any title acquired under the sheriff's sale, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">\u201c If the property was partnership property, we affirm the proposition ; if it never was partnership property, we decline to do so. If it was a tenancy in common, as claimed by the plaintiff, and as exhibited by the deed, and was levied upon, and sold by the sheriff to him, as is not denied, then the title vested in the plaintiff, and he is entitled to recover. If, on the other hand, you are satisfied by the showing, that it was partnership property, then the receiver\u2019s sale vested the title in Charles H. Foster, and your verdict should be for the defendant. But if it never was partnership property, but was held by the partners as tenants in common, the adjudication referred to in the point, was not conclusive as against the plaintiff. With this qualification we affirm the proposition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-9\">The court charged :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-10\">* * * \u201cThe controversy now relates to the real estate, and hence the question for you is, did the real estate partake of the characteristics of partnership property ? In other words, was the real estate and personal property, constituting the cracker-baking establishment, all partnership property ? If it was; if it all belonged to the partnership, as a whole, then the proceedings on the equity side of the court, and the sale by the receiver, to Charles II. Foster, vested in the latter a good title, and your verdict should be in his favor. But if the property was originally purchased by W. D. Barnes, as a tenant in common with Schlager &amp; Hillers\u2014 that fact being indicated by the deed to him, which, unless there is something further in the case, is the controlling evidence \u2014 then the entry of the judgment before referred to, and a subsequent sale by the sheriff thereon, and the purchase by the plaintiff, would vest the title in the latter, and he would be entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-11\">\u201c The defendant has exhibited articles of partnership between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Schlager, Hillers and W. D. Barnes, in which the personal property, and this real estate, are all recited; he relies upon this, as strong evidence of the character of the property, and as distinguishing the ownership from a tenancy in common. The agreement undoubtedly expresses the understanding of the parties ; but that it fixes this real estate as partnership property, so far as the plaintiff here is concerned, is quite another matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-6\">\u201c Gerard Hillers is one of the parties who executed the- deed. Ordinarily, he could not be a witness for the purpose of contradicting his solemn deed. He testifies that although the <em>deed </em>recognises a tenancy in common, yet, in fact, the property was partnership property and was so regarded and used. We may say to you, however, in this connection, that so far as the use of the property was concerned, it was not a controlling element, as to the ownership of these parties. The mere occupancy of the property by the partnership, would not warrant the assumption, by a creditor, that it was partnership property, for the reason that it might have been rented; and for the stronger reason, that upon the proper records of the county of Luzerne, a crowning evidence had been placed, that the property was held by Schlager, Hillers &amp; Barnes, not as partners, but as tenants in common.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-7\">The verdict was for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-8\">The defendant took a writ of error. He assigned for error the charge of the court and the answers to his points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-9\"><em>A. JRicJcetts </em>and <em>A. T. McQKntoolc, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aro\">\u2014 The articles of partnership were a solemn declaration by deed, on the part of Schlager &amp; Hillers, that the property occupied and used by them as a steam-bakery, both real and personal, was partnership property; and on the part of Wesley D. Barnes, that he purchased and held with them as partners, an undivided one-third interest in the same. And the plaintiff below had unquestionable notice of these articles. This was sufficient to notify the defendant in error, that this realty as well as the personalty, was partnership property : McDermot <em>v. </em>Laurence, 7 S. &amp; R. 438 ; Hale <em>v. </em>Henrie, 2 Watts 143; North Pennsylvania Coal Company\u2019s Appeal, 9 Wright 181.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-10\">The occupancy of the real property by the firm, was notice that it was the firm\u2019s property: Lewis <em>v. </em>Bradford, 10 Watts 67; Kerr <em>v. </em>Day, 2 Harris 112 ; Ebbert\u2019s Appeal, 20 P.

F. Smith 189.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-5\">The order of the court adjudicating the realty to be partnership property, was manifestly right; but even if it had been erroneous, that was a matter with which the purchaser, at the receiver\u2019s sale, had no concern. All that he was required to do was to ascertain that the court had jurisdiction, and exercised it, and made the order for the sale: Voorhees <em>v. </em>The Bank of the U. S., 10 Pet. 449, and cases cited; Grignon <em>v. </em>Astor, 2 How. 319; Gray <em>v. </em>Brignardello, 1 Wall. 627; McPherson <em>v. </em>Cunliff, 11 S. &amp; R. 422.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ARN\"><em>J.

F. Smith 122 and Ebbert\u2019s Appeal, 20 Id. 79. Or even that this fact was known to the purchaser : Hale <em>v. </em>Henrie, 2 Watts 145 ; Lancaster Bank <em>v. </em>Myley, 1 Harris 547; McCormick\u2019s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 54. A sale by a receiver to wind up a partnership conveys partnership property only, and neither he nor the creditors can claim as assets of the firm, property which the partners have elected to consider separate property : Gow on Partnership 255. The appointment of a receiver determines no right and in no way affects the title to the property : 2 Daniel Chan. Prac. 1431, note 3. When trust property of any kind is sold under an order of court, there is no implied warranty of title, the soundness, or the quality of the property sold: Storm <em>v. </em>Smith, 43 Miss. 497 ; Huber <em>v. </em>Armstrong, 7 Bush (Ky.) 590. In judicial sales of real or personal'property, there is no warranty: Freeman <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 10 Watts 9; Fox <em>v. </em>Mensch, 3 W. &amp; S. 444; Brown <em>v. </em>Wallace, 2 Bland (Md.) 479; United States <em>v. </em>Duncan, 12 Ill. 523. A sale made by order of a court of equity is, until final ratification, an executory contract, open to objection, and should not be enforced, if the enforcement would be inequitable and'against good conscience: Hunting <em>v. </em>Walter, 33 Md. 60; Bickley <em>v. </em>Biddle, 9 Casey 277; Vandever <em>v. </em>Baker, 1 Harris 126; 2 Leading Cases in Equity 72.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AT7y\">May 8th 1876.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b383-7\">Mr. Justice Sharswood</author>\n<p id=\"AOU\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>The verdict of the jury, under instructions from, the court, in which we find no error of which the plaintiff has any right to complain, has established that the premises never were the partnership property of Schlager, Hillers &amp; Barnes. This dispenses with the necessity of considering either that question or the knowledge or notice of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The question in the cause is then reduced to this, whether the sale by the receiver under the order of the court did pass the separate interest of Wesley D. Barnes, to the purchaser, clear and discharged of the lien of the judgment, in favor of the plaintiff below.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Undoubtedly on a judgment at law against a partnership for a firm debt, the separate property of each partner may be levied upon and sold, and the purchaser will take a title clear of the lien of judgments. The same result must follow in a sale under a decree of a court of equity for the payment of money. By the Act of Assembly of March 29th 1859, Pamph. L. 289, it is declared, \u201c that decrees in equity for the payment of money, shall be and constitute a lien on the real estate of the defendants or debtors named in the decree, in the manner, for the like period, and with the same force and effect as the lien of judgments rendered by and in the common-la,w courts of this Commonwealth.\u201d But the decree for the sale by the receiver in this case was special, \u201c the following described property of the late firm of Schlager, Hillers &amp; Barnes.\u201d As to the members of the firm who were parties to the bill, that decree was conclusive that the premises were partnership property. They could have been heard in opposition to the decree and to the confirmation of the sale. They would be estopped from alleging as against the purchaser that it was 'not partnership property, and the sale would of course pass whatever interest each one of them had in it. But how are the rights of the plaintiff below, whose judgment was a lien upon the undivided third of the property of one of the partners, held by him according to the paper title, and as the verdict establishes, as a tenant in common, to be affected ?' It is not pretended that it could have bound an adverse title. The title of a third person not a party to the proceeding could not have been divested by the sale. When the judgment of the plaintiff below was entered, its lien attached upon the title of Wesley D. Barnes, as a tenant in common of real estate. No act of Wesley D. Barnes, after that, could change its character so as to affect or injure the lien. If he had agreed and put it upon record, that the land should be partnership property, that could only affect subsequent creditors who w;ould have constructive notice of it. For all purposes connected with the partnership, e-xcept sale and conveyance under the stringent provisions of the Statute of Frauds, that change is from real to personal property. As to all third persons not parties to the proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>in equity, and not therefore bound by the decree, it remained an open question whether the premises sold under the order were or were not \u201c property of the late firm of Schlager, Hillers &amp; Barnes.\u201d The bill was merely for an account of the partnership business \u201c and to pay over to the complainant whatever may be justly due them therefrom, and that a receiver may be appointed to take charge of and wind up ,the said business.\u201d It is the equity of each of the partners that the partnership assets shall be applied in the first instance to the payment of partnership debts, that they may be relieved from their individual liabilities for those debts, which gives partnership creditors any right to priority of payment. The fund raised by the sale under this order must have gone to the payment of firm debts. William H. Barnes, the plaintiff below, would have had no right to participate in the fund. So far as he was concerned it was the same thing as if the sale had been of the right, title and interest of an entire stranger. The estoppel upon the parties to the bill, which concludes them from averring anything against the force and effect of the decree, does not close his mouth. On the whole, then, we find no error in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"AyW\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
