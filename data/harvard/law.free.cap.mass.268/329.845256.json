Jordan, in Swansea, for the purpose of relocating the so called Fall River-Seekonk Highway. Previously, on March 18, 1926, the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>brought a petition for the assessment of damages in which he named the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as the respondent. The Commonwealth appeared and answered, denying that it had ever taken any land of the petitioner. Thereafter the petitioner filed a motion in which he set forth that he had named erroneously the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as the respondent instead of the county commissioners of Bristol County, and moved that the petition be \u201cquashed or abated in accordance with the provisions\u201d of G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 17. The motion was allowed on March 5, 1928, and thereafter, on April 25, 1928, the present petition was filed. These respondents appeared, answered and pleaded in bar the statute of limitations. The case was tried by a judge and a jury. The petitioner\u2019s evidence tended to prove that entry on the premises was made on September 15, 1925. At the close of the respondents\u2019 case they moved that a verdict be directed for them for the reason that the petitioner had failed to bring his petition within the statutory period. This motion was denied and the respondents excepted. The jury found for the petitioner and assessed damages in the sum of $1,763. By agreement of the parties the case was reported to this court. According to the terms of the report, \u201cIf the action of the court in refusing to direct a verdict for the respondents as requested was right, judgment should be entered for the petitioner for one thousand seven hundred and sixty-three ($1763) dollars, with interest, and costs; otherwise, judgment for the respondents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\">The question for determination is whether this petition is barred by the statute. Since it did not appear to have been brought within one year after entry upon the premises, it was within the bar of the statute (G. L. c. 79, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 16; <em>McCarthy </em>v. Simon, 247 Mass. 514, 519) unless that bar was removed by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 17, which provides in part that \u201cIf a person petitions for an award or assessment of his damages within the time limited by law . . . and the petition is quashed, abated or otherwise avoided or defeated for any inaccuracy, irregularity or matter of form, . . . such petitioner . . . may begin such proceedings anew within one year after such abatement, reversal or other determination.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>According to the evidence, the petition against the Commonwealth was brought within one year after entry upon the premises, \u201cthe time limited by law.\u201d It failed, however, because it was brought against the wrong respondent. Was the petition, therefore, <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>quashed, abated or otherwise avoided or defeated for any inaccuracy, irregularity or matter of form\u201d within the meaning of the statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\">Provisions in limitation statutes somewhat similar to the provision now under consideration have been adopted widely (see <em>Watterson </em>v. <em>Owens River Canal Co. </em>190 Cal. 88, 94), and go back many years. See St. 21 Jac. 1, c. 16, \u00a7 4 (1623-4). In this Commonwealth in addition to this provision (G. L. c: 79, \u00a7 17; see St. 1847, c. 181, \u00a7 2; \u00a7 17 of c. 48A, added to the General Laws by St. 1918, c. 257, \u00a7 187), there are provisions in connection with the general statute of limitations (G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32; see Acts and Resolves of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, 1770-1, c. 9, \u00a7 3; St. 1793, c. 75, \u00a7 2), and in connection with the statute of limitations applicable to suits against executors and administrators. G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 12; see St. 1855, c. 157, \u00a7 1. These statutory provisions dealing with similar subjects as far as possible should be interpreted so as to be harmonious. See <em>Taft </em>v. <em>Stow, </em>174 Mass. 171, 174. They are to be construed favorably to the plaintiff or petitioner in order to carry out the remedial purposes of the Legislature. <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Cottle, </em>16 Pick. 383, 385. <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>1 Gray, 580, 583. <em>Cumming </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>130 Mass. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The present statute (unlike the Virginia statute considered in <em>Norfolk &amp; A. Terminal Co. </em>v. <em>Rotolo, </em>103 C.C.A. 197; 179 Fed. Rep. 639) does not in terms apply to petitions which failed because brought against the wrong respondents. Unless the bringing of the petition against the wrong respondent was an \u201cinaccuracy, irregularity or matter of form,\u201d the new petition is barred. These words have furnished the measure of the application of the part of the statute which is material here since it was enacted in 1847. Of this statute in an earlier codification Chief Justice Gray said in <em>Fall River Railroad </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>125 Mass. 483, 484, \u201cThe St. of 1874, c. 372, \u00a7 80 . . .is limited to cases in which proceedings . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>have been quashed or defeated for informality.\u201d Doubtless the words \u201cinaccuracy\u201d and \u201cirregularity\u201d were inserted originally in order that the statute should not be limited through a narrow interpretation of the words \u201cmatter of form\u201d to cases which were defeated because of \u201cthe manner in which parties . . . state their particular claims of grounds of defence,\u201d but should apply to all failures for \u201cinformality of proceedings.\u201d See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Sawtelle, 7 </em>Gray, 165, 166. The similar provisions in the other statutes in terms limit the bringing of new actions to cases where the old actions failed through informality, except so far as a new action is permitted specifically where the old' action failed because of insufficient service or return of the writ, or the death of the defendant. See G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 12; c. 260, \u00a7 32. Thus failure of the first petition because of \u201cmatter of form\u201d liberally construed is essential to the removal of the statutory bar against the maintenance of the new petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\">It is not essential that the first petition should have been disposed of on its merits in order to take it out of the class of petitions which fail for \u201cmatter of form.\u201d See <em>Cumming </em>v. <em>Jacobs, supra. </em>See also <em>Swan </em>v. <em>Littlefield, </em>6 Cush. 417. It was said in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Sawtelle, supra, </em>in interpreting Rev. Sts. c. 120, \u00a7 11 (now G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32), that \u201cthe signification of \u2018form/ when considered in reference to the prosecution of suits in courts of law . . . extends to what has been, by legislative enactment or other legitimate authority, made the stated method or particular mode in which they shall be conducted.\u201d There is no tendency in the opinion in <em>Cumming </em>v. <em>Jacobs, supra, </em>in which much of this language was quoted, page 421, to enlarge the definition though there is recognition that the \u201cstatute is remedial\u201d and that it is not to be \u201cconstrued unfavorably to the plaintiff.\u201d Under this statute an action brought in the wrong county was held to have failed for informality. <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>1 Gray, 580. So also it was held as to a proceeding at law which should have been brought in equity. <em>Taft </em>v. <em>Stow, </em>167 Mass. <em>363; S. C. </em>174 Mass. 171. However, plaintiff, cause of action and defendant cannot be regarded as \u201cform\u201d within this definition. They are matters of substance. Misnomer or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>misdescription of any of these substantive elements may be \u201cmatter of form\u201d but the mistaken choice of a defendant unrelated to the subject matter of the case is not merely a formal error. See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>120 Ga. 104; <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>88 Tenn. 578. There is no reason in the relation of the Commonwealth to the county commissioners of Bristol County or to the taking for which damages are claimed by the petitioner which takes the case out of this principle. The conclusion is that the first petition did not fail for such a cause that the petitioner is entitled to \u201cbegin such proceedings anew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\">The decisions to the effect that the court may permit a new defendant to be substituted by amendment after the statute of limitations has run (see <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>West End Street Railway, </em>186 Mass. 150; <em>Genga </em>v. <em>Director General of Railroads, </em>243 Mass. 101), are not controlling in this case. They were made under statutes (now G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 51) which permitted the allowance of any amendment \u201cin matter of form or substance\u201d so long as it enabled the plaintiff \u201cto sustain the action for the cause,for which it was intended to be brought.\u201d The substantive nature of the change effected by such an amendment therefore has statutory sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">It follows that the petition was barred by the statute of limitations. As the statute \u201cis a limitation of the right as well as a limitation of the remedy\u201d the trial court had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition, <em>(Nicklas </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>250 Mass. 471, 475), and it should have been dismissed. <em>Corbett </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>219 Mass. 351, 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
