Therefore these facts by \u00a7 85A, added to G. L. c. 231, by St. 1928, c. 317, \u00a7 1, constituted <em>\u201cprima facie </em>evidence that\u201d the motor vehicle was \u201cthen being operated by and under the control of a person for whose conduct the defendant was legally responsible, and absence of such responsibility\u201d became an \u201caffirmative defence to be . . . proved by the defendant.\u201d Motions for directed verdicts in favor of the defendant were denied and verdicts were returned in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">It is stated in the bill of exceptions that the only question is whether the motor vehicle of the defendant at the time of the accident was \u201cbeing operated by any one in the employ of or acting for the defendant.\u201d We interpret this to mean, whether the motor vehicle was being \u201c operated by and under the control of a person for whose conduct the defendant was legally responsible.\u201d A <em>prima facie </em>affirmative answer to that question is made by the statute already cited in view of the conceded facts of ownership and registration of the motor vehicle in the name of the defendant. The accident occurred before, but the trial after, the enactment of the statute. Since it relates to evidence and not to substantive law, the statute governed the trial of the present cases. The plaintiff called as witnesses the defendant and Carley, who was driving the motor vehicle of the defendant. From their testimony it appeared that the motor vehicle had been at the garage of Carley for repairs and after these were completed was being driven by Carley at the time of the accident to the place of business of the defendant with the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>of leaving it there. This testimony, even if given its face value, did not overcome the effect of the <em>prima facie </em>evidence established by the statute and might have been found to be consistent with it. Carley may have been the agent of the defendant in returning the repaired motor vehicle to the place of business of the defendant. See <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Boston District Messenger Co. </em>190 Mass. 189. The case is distinguishable from <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Sheehan, </em>237 Mass. 112. Moreover, by calling these witnesses the plaintiffs did not waive the <em>prima facie </em>evidence established in their favor by the statute. They still might rely upon that evidence even though it be assumed that the testimony of these witnesses was contradictory of the <em>prima facie </em>evidence established by the statute. A party by calling witnesses does not necessarily become bound by their testimony. <em>Priorelli </em>v. <em>Guidi, </em>251 Mass. 449, 450. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Bedard, </em>265 Mass. 408, 411, and cases cited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>251 Mass. 275, 278, 279. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 23. <em>Whiteacre </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>241 Mass. 163, 165, 166. <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Spector, </em>247 Mass. 110, 111. <em>Goodell </em>v. <em>Sviokcla, </em>262 Mass. 317, 319. <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Levinson </em>266 Mass. 264, 266, 267. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>224 Mass. 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">It could not have been ruled as matter of law that Carley was driving the motor vehicle solely on his own account and by virtue of the hen authorized by G. L. c. 255, \u00a7\u00a7 25, 26. There was no testimony to that effect. Even if there had been evidence of that nature, its weight would have been for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The case at bar is governed in its main aspects by <em>Thomes </em>v. <em>Meyer Store Inc. post, </em>587, this day decided, where the distinction between a presumption and <em>prima facie </em>evidence is pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
