The motion was denied and the contestants appealed. The decision of the judge of probate was made upon statements of counsel as to the evidence which they expected to be able to offer, and upon the testimony of several physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Many of the legacies given by the will were upon trust for the life or until the marriage of the female beneficiaries, respectively. There also was a gift in trust to pay the income thereof and the principal if required \"for the boarding during their respective lifetimes of such cats as maybe owned by me at the time of my decease.\u201d Gifts of income terminable upon marriage are familiar. Ordinarily the main purpose is to provide for the beneficiary while single and not to promote celibacy. See <em>Ruggles </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>213 Mass. 167, 171. See also <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>189 Mass. 208. Gifts for the benefit of animals are not uncommon, and if sufficiently general in character may be charitable. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>255 Mass. 155; <em>In re Dean, </em>41 Ch. D. 552. Neither type of gift is of itself evidence of lack of testamentary capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>In this case, however, the testatrix\u2019s physician testified that he had attended her professionally from 1923 until her death, and that he had had a number of conversations with her in which she had spoken of marriage as immoral, and of her fondness for her cats and had said that she thought more of them \u201cthan she did of her relatives, because she could talk and commune with those cats, more so than she could with any of her relatives, because . . . the spirits of her departed sisters were resident in those cats.\u201d He expressed the opinion that she was \u201cnot of sound mind,\u201d but was \u201csuffering from delusions due to the condition of her mind.\u201d In view of this testimony taken in connection with other testimony and statements, which need not be recited, and with the provisions of the will, we think that there was a \u201cgenuine and doubtful question of fact\u201d as to her testamentary capacity \u201csupported by evidence of a substantial nature,\u201d <em>(Gifford </em>v. <em>Patten, </em>265 Mass. 362, and cases cited), and that the issue should have been framed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The testimony of the testatrix\u2019s physician is not \u201cdeficient in particularity\u201d as were the statements of expected evidence in <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Charest, </em>268 Mass. 47, 50. The delusions testified to might be found to have affected the disposition by the testatrix of her property. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Creeley, </em>257 Mass. 21, 29. They <em>are </em>not necessarily to be explained away as merely unusual religious views. See <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Holmes, 225 </em>Mass. 68, 72, 73. The expected evidence in this case seems to us to go somewhat farther than that in <em>Union Trust Co. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Magenis, </em>259 Mass. 409, or that in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>265 Mass. 582, which cases we have said mark \u201cthe extreme limit beyond which the court is not inclined to go in upholding the probate judges in denying jury issues,\u201d <em>(Swift </em>v. <em>Charest, supra), </em>and much farther than that in the case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Talbot, supra, </em>relied on by the petitioner, in which an order directing that the issue of testamentary capacity be submitted to the jury was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The order of the Probate Court denying the issue of testamentary capacity is</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
