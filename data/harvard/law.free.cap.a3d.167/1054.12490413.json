On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court (1) abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal and (2) improperly denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he claimed that counsel in both his underlying criminal prosecution and his first habeas proceeding rendered ineffective assistance. Because the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal, we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts underlying the petitioner's convictions were set forth previously by this court. \"In early 2008, the petitioner was a defendant in a number of criminal and motor vehicle matters pending in the Superior Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 24, 2008, while the petitioner was representing himself, the state extended a plea bargain to him that would have resolved all pending charges in exchange for guilty pleas and a total effective sentence of forty years incarceration, execution suspended after fifteen years, to be followed by a five year\n   period of probation. The petitioner, who was free on bond, was given time to consider the offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Two days later, on September 26, 2008, the police executed a search and seizure warrant stemming from suspected drug trafficking activities at the petitioner's condominium. During the execution of the search warrant, the petitioner was arrested\n   after police found a large quantity of heroin in a bedroom.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of the additional charges, the state modified its original plea offer to reflect the new drug charges. Considering only the drug cases, the petitioner at trial would have faced forty-six years of mandatory minimum incarceration with a maximum sentence of life. The state's modified plea offer proposed that the petitioner actually serve twenty years as opposed to the original offer of fifteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"On October 1, 2008, the petitioner retained the services of Attorney Eugene Zingaro. Although the petitioner initially appeared willing to accept the state's modified plea offer, Zingaro ultimately was successful in restoring the original plea offer.\" (Footnotes in original.)\n   <em>\n    Bigelow\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415646\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/146/737/#p739\">\n    146 Conn.App. 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20A.3d%2084\">\n    80 A.3d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). During the sentencing hearing, the court thoroughly canvassed the petitioner, determined that his pleas were knowing, intelligent and voluntary, and accepted them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"On November 12, 2008,\n   the petitioner accepted the original offer, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to forty years incarceration, execution suspended after fifteen years, followed by five years of probation.\" Id., at 739-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20A.3d%2084\">\n    80 A.3d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following his convictions, the petitioner brought two petitions for writs of habeas corpus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner's second such petition was filed on July 5, 2012, and amended for the final time on September 14, 2014. In essence, the petitioner argued that his first habeas counsel, Melissa Toddy, rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise a claim regarding the deficient performance of his trial counsel, Zingaro. Specifically, the petitioner alleged that Toddy should have pursued such a claim because Zingaro rendered ineffective assistance in failing (1) to properly advise him regarding his guilty plea, (2) to file an application to participate in a drug treatment program on his behalf, (3) to seek jail credit for three days that he spent in local lockup, and (4) to properly investigate the death of an informant on whom the state relied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the second habeas trial, which is the subject of this appeal, the court heard\n   testimony from the petitioner, Zingaro, and Toddy. Following the trial, the court issued a memorandum of decision denying the petitioner's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. The habeas court subsequently denied the petition for certification\n   to appeal. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As an initial matter, we set forth the standard of review and the legal principles that guide our resolution of the petitioner's appeal. \"In\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"760025\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/178/#p187\">\n    229 Conn. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 187,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20601\">\n    640 A.2d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994), we concluded that [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-470 (b) prevents a reviewing court from hearing the merits of a habeas appeal following the denial of certification to appeal unless the petitioner establishes that the denial of certification constituted an abuse of discretion by the habeas court.

That testimony clearly conflicts with the statements that the petitioner made during the plea canvass. More importantly, however, the habeas court discredited the petitioner's testimony and concluded that \"Zingaro provided appropriate advice.\" These findings are supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Zingaro testified at the second habeas proceeding that his usual practice in 2008, the time he represented the petitioner, with respect to preparing his clients prior to a plea canvass, was that he would discuss with his\n   client the \"charges he was pleading to, the sentences, the total combined, the total effective sentence, which charges were mandatory, [and] which carried mandatory time.\" Zingaro further testified that he did not believe that the state's recitation of the facts during the petitioner's plea hearing were inaccurate. He also testified that if there was an error in the state's recitation of the facts or if the evidence did not support the charges brought against the petitioner, he would have raised those issues to the court. Moreover, Zingaro testified that the petitioner would have accepted the state's second offer of forty years imprisonment, suspended after twenty years, and had no second thoughts about accepting the third offer of forty years imprisonment, suspended after fifteen years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the basis of the court's canvass and its finding of guilty at the plea hearing, without objection from the petitioner, in addition to Zingaro's testimony at the habeas proceeding, we conclude that the habeas court's factual findings were not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Next, we briefly discuss the petitioner's argument that Zingaro failed to adequately investigate Larson's death. At the habeas trial, Zingaro testified that the state was not exclusively relying on Larson's testimony to prove its case because it had other evidence, including a written statement from Larson, and the testimony of several police officers who witnessed drug transactions between the petitioner and Larson. In Zingaro's opinion, the death of Larson did not significantly impact the state's case against the petitioner as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the habeas court stated: \"The evidence alleged to have been withheld by the prosecuting authority is the death of a Mr. Nicklaus Larson, the person to whom the petitioner sold drugs on his last arrest. Unfortunately for the petitioner's argument, the state clearly disclosed that fact in the\n   recitation of facts preceding the plea canvass\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   his plea was accepted.\" (Emphasis in original.) The court further stated: \"[T]he testimony by Mr. Larson was not critical to the state proving that charge, as there were several hand-to-hand transactions observed by the undercover police officers. It is clear that the trial defense counsel made due diligence in investigating and understanding the facts surrounding the state's obviously strong case against the petitioner. This cannot\n   form the basis for any complaint of ineffective assistance of trial defense counsel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We agree with the habeas court's conclusion relating to this claim and need only address the petitioner's failure to satisfy the prejudice prong under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . See\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489066\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/8/#p823\">\n    169 Conn.App. at 821-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489066\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/8/#p823\">\n    153 A.3d 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Other than the petitioner's own testimony, nothing in the record suggests that the petitioner would have opted for trial. At the time of the petitioner's guilty plea, the petitioner had several pending criminal cases that exposed him to significant jail time. The petitioner's guilty plea ultimately consolidated and disposed of his numerous pending cases into a sentence of forty years of imprisonment, execution suspended after fifteen years. The habeas court stated that \"[a]ccepting this pretrial offer was prudent,\" given the substantial jail time he would have otherwise faced. Moreover, although Larson's death certainly did not strengthen the state's case, there was significant evidence supporting the petitioner's convictions, including the testimony of several undercover officers who witnessed the petitioner engage in hand-to-hand drug transactions. Simply put, even if we were to assume that the petitioner and his counsel were unaware of Larson's death, the petitioner's claim that he would have pursued a jury trial is speculative at best. Accordingly, this argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The petitioner next argues that Zingaro rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion for examination for alcohol or drug dependency pursuant to the Connecticut Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission's diversionary program (CADAC).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, he contends that Zingaro rendered ineffective assistance because he should have investigated the petitioner's personal history pertaining to substance abuse and should have determined whether the petitioner would have benefited from the program. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court noted that \"in order to even be eligible for ... CADAC one must be addicted to substances at the time of the offense. This record before this court is devoid of any evidence, with the exception of the petitioner's own self-serving testimony, that the petitioner was even using drugs, much less being addicted to them. In addition, the testimony at this habeas trial from [Zingaro] and the testimony at the petitioner's first habeas trial clearly show that the instant proceeding is the first time that there has been any issue surrounding the petitioner's potential substance abuse addiction. This court, therefore, concludes that any allegation of drug addiction was never brought to the attention of the trial defense counsel, so there would not even have been any reason to consider a CADAC application. Furthermore, merely making an application for CADAC does not guarantee that such an application would have been accepted by the trial court. Given the large number of criminal files that the petitioner had amassed, his reputation as the major drug dealer in Danbury, the large bond placed upon him, and comments by the trial court, it would appear to be most likely, indeed almost a certainty, that a CADAC application would have been rejected by the\n   trial court, even had the examination shown he was addicted to substances at the time he committed his offenses (an unlikely finding based upon the totality of the evidence). The interests of justice would not have been served by treatment. To summarize, it is clear that [Zingaro] did not have a\n   good faith basis to make a request for a [diversionary program] examination and, further, had one been made it is unlikely that it would have been granted even if made.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   With respect to Zingaro's testimony, the court noted that he \"went to great lengths to describe his observations of the physical condition of the petitioner ... and his opinion that there was no way this man was a drug abuser. Second, the testimony by [Zingaro] is that no information was ever presented to him to support a suspicion that a [diversionary program] examination would reveal a substance abuse issue.\" The court expressly credited Zingaro's testimony and found that \"the statements by the petitioner are rejected as being unworthy of belief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"As an appellate court, we do not reevaluate the credibility of testimony, nor will we do so in this case. The habeas judge, as the trier of facts, is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony. ... Furthermore, we are entitled to presume that the trial court acted properly and\n   <em>\n    considered all the evidence.\n   </em>\n   \" (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Palmenta\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20Conn.%20App.%20702\">\n    152 Conn.App. 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707-708,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20A.3d%201254\">\n    99 A.3d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20941\">\n    314 Conn. 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20A.3d%20164\">\n    103 A.3d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court expressly credited Zingaro's testimony that his personal observations did not lead him to conclude that the petitioner was abusing drugs at the time Zingaro represented him. Further, the only evidence suggesting otherwise was the petitioner's testimony, which the\n   court declined to credit. Because the habeas court is the sole arbiter of credibility determinations, and nothing in the record suggests that the court did not consider all of the evidence, we thus conclude that the court's findings were not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal with respect to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, the petitioner argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because Zingaro failed to seek jail credit for three days that he spent in local lockup. This argument fails for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the habeas court rejected the petitioner's claim regarding jail credit and stated: \"It is true that the petitioner was arrested on [September 26, 2008] and held in the local lockup until his arraignment in court on [September 29, 2008]. It is also true that in order for the petitioner to receive any credit for those three days, his counsel should have requested it at the time of sentencing so the local lockup credit could have been noted on the mittimus. It is clear that [Zingaro] did not make such a request and that normally this court would have found that to be deficient performance. But since this local lockup credit applied\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to Docket No. CR-08-0133512 and the sentence on that docket was five years concurrent to the other sentences, this three day credit would not have resulted in any reduction of the time that the petitioner was required to serve. Consequently, there is no prejudice accruing to the petitioner.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The following legal principles guide our analysis. \"If more than one sentence is imposed on a prisoner, the\n   respondent calculates the incarceration period and discharge date by applying the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38(b), which provides in relevant part: Where a person is under more than one definite\n   sentence, the sentences shall be calculated as follows: (1) If the sentences run concurrently, the terms merge in and are satisfied by discharge of the term which has the longest term to run .... The merger concept embodied in this provision simply requires that the respondent compare the length of each sentence, after adjustment for its authorized credits, in order to ascertain which is the longest for the purpose of determining the prisoner's discharge date. ... The merger process does not alter the fact that concurrent sentences remain separate terms of imprisonment which the legislature has permitted to be served at one time.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2605056\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/271/808/#p819\">\n    271 Conn. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 819,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=860%20A.2d%20715\">\n    860 A.2d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Even if the petitioner received the claimed presentence confinement credit, that credit applied only to his sentence relating to Docket No. CR-08-0133512. As noted in the preceding paragraph, when sentences run concurrently, \"the terms merge in and are satisfied by discharge of the term which has\n   <em>\n    the longest term to run\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38(b). That merger process clearly precludes the petitioner from showing any prejudice resulting from any alleged deficient performance because his discharge date ultimately remains unchanged. See\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2605056\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/271/808/#p819\">\n    271 Conn. at 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=860%20A.2d%20715\">\n    860 A.2d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, the lockup credit, if applied, would not affect the petitioner's discharge date because the longest term to run was not his sentence relating to Docket No. CR-08-0133512. Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion as it relates to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, the petitioner has failed to establish that the issues he raised are debatable among jurists of reason,\n   that a court could resolve them in a different manner or that the questions he raised are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. See\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20Conn.%20App.%2030\">\n    150 Conn.App. 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 34,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.3d%201018\">\n    89 A.3d 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). In light of our foregoing conclusion that the petitioner's claims against his trial counsel are without merit, the claims pertaining to his first habeas counsel necessarily fail.
