The charges against the petitioner and Barjon arose from a single incident in which they allegedly were both involved, and therefore the petitioner's case and Barjon's case were factually related. The\n   petitioner also alleged that Skyers had an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected his representation of the petitioner because Skyers made no attempt to negotiate a plea offer that would have allowed the petitioner to receive a favorable sentence in his case in exchange for his testifying against Barjon. At the hearing on his motion to reargue, the petitioner emphasized\n   that his claim centered on how Skyers' alleged conflict of interest negatively impeded his ability to negotiate a plea agreement in exchange for a favorable disposition of the charges against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The habeas court found the following facts relevant to the adjudication of the petitioner's claim. From his first meeting with Skyers through his criminal trial, the petitioner's version of the events that took place on December 28, 2011, remained unchanged. The petitioner told Skyers that he knew Barjon and merely agreed to take a ride with Barjon, who was driving the other two men to the train station in New Haven. He did not know the other men in the car when Barjon picked him up. Instead of going to the train station, Barjon drove to Aldof's store and parked. The petitioner and Barjon remained in Barjon's car when Jean-Philippe got out of the car and went into the store. The petitioner did not know of a plan to rob the store or Aldof. The petitioner stated to Skyers that Barjon would corroborate his version of the events and was willing to sign a statement consistent with what the petitioner had told Skyers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Two or three weeks after the petitioner had retained him, Skyers met with Barjon, who confirmed the petitioner's version of events. Skyers believed that both the petitioner and Barjon were in the same position and agreed to represent Barjon as well. Although he intended to have the petitioner and Barjon sign waivers of any potential conflicts, he failed to do so. The petitioner and Barjon knew that Skyers was representing them simultaneously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Before the petitioner's case went to trial, Barjon agreed to plead guilty under the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine. See footnote 4 of this opinion. Although he disputed the state's version of his involvement in the underlying crime, Barjon was willing to accept legal responsibility for his part in the robbery and to testify at the petitioner's trial that the petitioner was not involved in the robbery. When it came time for Barjon to enter his guilty plea, however, he changed his mind. Skyers withdrew from representing Barjon. Judge Devlin then canvassed the petitioner about the fact that Skyers may have a conflict in representing him at trial because he could not be adverse to Barjon either in questioning or by using confidential information Skyers had received from Barjon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"In a case of a claimed conflict of interest ... in order to establish a violation of the sixth amendment the defendant has a two-pronged task. He must establish (1) that counsel actively represented conflicting interests and (2) that an\n   <em>\n    actual conflict of interest\n   </em>\n   adversely affected his lawyer's performance.... Where there is an actual conflict of interest, prejudice is presumed because counsel [has] breach[ed] the duty of loyalty, perhaps the most basic of counsel's duties. Moreover, it is difficult to measure the precise effect on the defense of representation corrupted by conflicting\n   interests.... Accordingly, an ineffectiveness claim predicated on an actual conflict of interest is unlike other ineffectiveness claims in that the petitioner need not establish actual prejudice....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    An actual conflict of interest is more than a theoretical conflict.\n   </em>\n   The United States Supreme Court has cautioned that the possibility of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction....

To demonstrate\n   an actual conflict of interest, the petitioner must be able to\n   <em>\n    point to specific instances in the record which suggest impairment or compromise of his interests for the benefit of another party\n   </em>\n   .... A mere theoretical division of loyalties is not enough....

The court also found that there was no evidence that the petitioner ever said or did anything to suggest that he had information that would implicate Barjon, which might be used to secure a favorable plea deal from the state. The court found it ironic that it was Barjon who agreed to implicate himself and to plead guilty so that he could then testify in support of the petitioner's defense. Even at the time of his unsuccessful\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea, Barjon insisted that he and the petitioner never went into the store, but remained in the car. Before Skyers withdrew from representing Barjon, he had negotiated a plea for Barjon that would have required him to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, and after\n   pleading guilty, to assist in the petitioner's defense. There was no impairment or compromise of the petitioner's interests for the benefit of Barjon or any of the other codefendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The habeas court found that the petitioner had failed to prove a single, specific instance in which Skyers' representation of him was compromised by the alleged conflict. The petitioner's hypotheses of what might have happened in plea negotiations had Skyers not also represented Barjon are theoretical and speculative. At most, the petitioner demonstrated that Skyers had a potential conflict of interest and, therefore, the petitioner had to meet both prongs of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   to prevail. \"To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a habeas petitioner generally must show that counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.

The court found no evidence that the petitioner was ever interested in a plea agreement. Moreover, the evidence established that it is likely that the state would have seen little value in any cooperation from the petitioner. Aldof told the police, and later testified, that four men entered the store and participated in the robbery. He specifically identified the petitioner, whom he knew, as being in the store and part of the robbery. The petitioner's version of events, in which he remained in the car while Jean-Philippe went into the store, was inconsistent with Aldof's version, and would have been of little use to the state in a trial against Barjon. The only testimony that the petitioner could have given that would have been of use to the state was testimony\n   that corroborated Aldof's, but the petitioner was never willing to incriminate himself. The court also found that the petitioner's story of events never changed from when he was arrested, to his criminal trial, to his habeas trial. There was no evidence that the petitioner knew anything that Skyers could have used to negotiate a favorable plea agreement for him. The habeas court, therefore, concluded that the petitioner failed to prove that any potential conflict created by Skyers' joint representation of the petitioner and Barjon prejudiced him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On the basis of our review of the briefs of the parties and their oral arguments in this court, we conclude that the habeas court properly determined, in a detailed and well reasoned decision, that no actual conflict of interest between the petitioner and Barjon existed and that the petitioner had failed to prove that he was prejudiced by any potential conflict created by Skyers' joint representation of him and Barjon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The petitioner's second claim is that the habeas court improperly determined that his constitutional right to\n   the effective assistance of counsel pursuant to the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9 of the constitution of Connecticut, was not violated.

The habeas court, however, found that the petitioner abandoned five of them by failing to brief them and by presenting little or no evidence as to them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, the habeas court addressed only the claims alleging that Skyers' representation was deficient in that he failed to conduct\n   an adequate and timely investigation, failed to present evidence that a firearm recovered near the scene of the robbery was not connected to the petitioner and his codefendants, failed to present evidence that the amount of money recovered from the petitioner and his codefendants was inconsistent with the amount of money alleged to have been taken,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   presented the testimony of Jean-Philippe, which he knew, or should have known, would be damaging to the petitioner's defense, and failed to present the testimony of Margarita Azcalt.

The court agreed that Skyers' representation was deficient for failing to conduct a timely investigation, but that the petitioner was not prejudiced by Skyers' deficient performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The habeas court made the following additional findings of fact. The petitioner was arrested on or about December 28, 2011, and after posting bond, met with Skyers on or about December 31, 2011. The petitioner then spoke with Barjon, a friend and codefendant, who was willing to speak with Skyers and provide a supporting statement for the petitioner. As discussed previously, Skyers also undertook to represent Barjon. On the basis of what the petitioner and Barjon told him, Skyers viewed their defenses as the same and not to be in conflict. In part because Barjon was willing to give a statement on the petitioner's behalf, Skyers negotiated a plea arrangement for Barjon. When Barjon and\n   Skyers appeared before Judge\n   Devlin, Barjon's plea canvass failed and his case was placed on the trial list. Skyers withdrew as Barjon's counsel, and Barjon obtained different counsel. Contrary to their original plan, Barjon exercised his right under the fifth amendment and would not testify at the petitioner's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Jury selection in the petitioner's criminal case was to begin in early October, 2012. Skyers only began to discuss the defense investigation with Joseph Marchio, then with JBM Private Investigations and Security, LLC (JBM firm), during jury selection. By October 4, 2012, six jurors and a number of alternates had been selected for the petitioner's case. Judge Kavanewsky advised Skyers that he should be prepared to present defense witnesses at 10 a.m. on October 17, 2012, and the matter was continued to October 16, 2012, for the presentation of the state's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On October 10, 2012, Skyers hired the JBM firm to investigate the petitioner's case. Julio Ortiz, an investigator with the JBM firm, prepared a memorandum detailing his investigation efforts from October 10 through October 18, 2012. Ortiz did not provide portions of his report to Skyers while he was conducting his investigation, but did provide Skyers with the entire report on October 18, 2012. The court found that by October 18, 2012, it was too late. The state had presented its case from October 16, 2012, into the next day, and Skyers presented defense witnesses from October 17, 2012, into the next day. Both the state and Skyers had rested and presented their closing arguments on October 18, 2012, before Skyers ever saw Ortiz' report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Skyers' focus for both the petitioner and Barjon was the pretrial phase, which included efforts to resolve both of his clients' cases via plea agreement. His strategy was to have Barjon plead guilty and then testify on\n   behalf of the petitioner. That strategy unraveled when Judge Devlin vacated Barjon's guilty plea, and Barjon obtained substitute counsel and declined to testify in support of the petitioner's defense. Although Skyers reviewed police reports, statements, and other related documents, and spoke to potential witnesses the petitioner identified, the court found no evidence that he conducted any other investigation prior to October 10, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   According to Skyers, his practice with regard to pretrial investigations is case dependent. In some cases he waits to the onset of trial to begin investigating. The short notice that is given when a case is called for trial is a factor that affects the timing of an investigation. Other factors that affect his investigations are the severity of the criminal charges and the likelihood the matter will be settled by a plea agreement. In the petitioner's case, Skyers thought the investigation would be relatively simple. Although he thought it important to have the results of the investigation before he presented the petitioner's case, he did not receive the results of the investigation until after he had made his final argument. Aside from the jury's rendering its verdict, the trial was over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The court found that because the petitioner and Barjon were in similar positions and their defenses were essentially identical, Skyers never considered that an investigation might uncover information that was helpful to one of his clients but not the other. He ignored that possibility despite the fact that the petitioner never indicated any interest in resolving the matter by way of a plea agreement. The petitioner intended to go to trial, which Skyers knew from the beginning of his representation of the petitioner. Nevertheless, Skyers acted as if his primary duty was to resolve the criminal case by means of a plea agreement because he thought that was in the petitioner's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The court was familiar with the standards applicable to claims that counsel rendered ineffective assistance for failing to conduct an adequate investigation. \"[I]t is well established that [a] criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to adequate and effective assistance of counsel at all critical stages of criminal proceedings.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gaines v.

The benefit of an investigation could have been used in attorney-client discussions, plea negotiations, and trial preparation. Had Skyers investigated earlier, he may have garnered information that the petitioner's and Barjon's defenses were not as aligned as he initially thought. The same duty that Skyers thought obligated him to pursue plea negotiations should also have compelled him to investigate the matter earlier in his representation of the petitioner. The court found no reasonable strategic reason for Skyers to have delayed investigating and no reasonable decision that made the investigation unnecessary. The court, therefore, found that the petitioner had met the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The court then analyzed the second, or prejudice, prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . The petitioner alleged that he was prejudiced because Skyers (1) did not call Azcalt to testify at the criminal trial and (2) presented damaging testimony from Jean-Philippe. The court found, however, that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by Skyers' alleged deficient performance. \"To prove prejudice, a\n   petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

We agree with the habeas court that the failure to call Azcalt did not undermine the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The court found the following facts. Azcalt was working in the laundromat where Aldof ran when he left the store and she saw him bar the door to the man who was chasing him. As to his investigation, Ortiz met with Azcalt at 7 p.m., on October 18, 2012, while the jury was deliberating, and stated that she was working in the laundromat and monitoring the surveillance camera. She noticed Aldof walking on the sidewalk when he ran into the laundromat and held the door shut to prevent a single black man from entering. Aldof asked her to call the police because he was being robbed. Azcalt only saw one man trying to get into the laundromat and did not see a weapon. Azcalt did not testify at the habeas corpus proceeding, and therefore the only evidence the petitioner presented of what she may have testified to was in Ortiz' summary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Azcalt's statement to Ortiz was consistent with Aldof's testimony that he fled to the laundromat and held the door closed to prevent one man from entering. Notably, Aldof did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   testify that the four men in the store followed him. Santora testified that she saw only one man fleeing on foot when Aldof flagged her down. Azcalt's testimony, therefore, would not have undermined Aldof's testimony about what happened in the\n   store, a place she had never been. Skyers was concerned, however, about the statement Azcalt gave to the police in which she stated that she saw three men outside the laundromat, which conflicted with the petitioner's and Barjon's version of events that they remained in the car. The court concluded that even if Skyers had called Azcalt to testify at the criminal trial, and she testified in accord with the statement she gave Ortiz, she would not have undermined Aldof's testimony regarding the events that took place in his store. The court therefore concluded that the petitioner failed to prove prejudice. Having undertaken a plenary review of the petitioner's claim, we agree with the court's well reasoned analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The petitioner also claims that the habeas court improperly concluded that he was not prejudiced by Skyers' calling Jean-Philippe as a defense witness at trial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The court found that Skyers was obtaining authorization for Ortiz to interview Jean-Philippe on October 12, 2012. Ortiz met with Jean-Philippe on October 15, 2012, at which time Jean-Philippe gave him a written statement. In his statement, Jean-Philippe stated that he entered the store alone and unarmed to collect money he had won on a bet. On October 17, 2012, Jean-Philippe testified at the petitioner's criminal trial that he got out of the car alone and went into the store to collect his winnings, and that the petitioner remained\n   in the car, which was consistent with the petitioner's version of events. The damaging part of Jean-Philippe's testimony occurred on cross-examination when he testified that he was from New Jersey and that he had a criminal record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court found that the petitioner exaggerated the harm he attributes to Jean-Philippe's testimony. The jury obviously credited Aldof's version of\n   the robbery that four men entered his store and that he identified the petitioner, whom he knew, as one of those men.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The court found that Jean-Philippe's testimony did not undermine its confidence in the outcome of the criminal trial. It therefore concluded that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate that he had been prejudiced by Jean-Philippe's testifying as a result of the untimely investigation Skyers initiated. The petitioner therefore failed to meet the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . We have reviewed the record, including Jean-Philippe's statement and his testimony at the petitioner's criminal trial, and agree with the habeas court's conclusion. Although Jean-Philippe testified on cross-examination that he was from New Jersey and that he had a criminal record, which was not helpful to the petitioner,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   he testified that he alone entered the store, which was consistent with the petitioner's version of events. Counsel was faced with a difficult problem given Aldof's testimony that he recognized the petitioner as one of the four men who entered the store. We agree with the habeas court that the petitioner was not prejudiced by Skyers presenting Jean-Philippe's testimony because he knew or should have known it would have been damaging to the petitioner. Jean-Philippe testified in accordance with the petitioner's theory of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Although our Supreme Court dismissed the petitioner's direct appeal prior to oral argument on the petitioner's habeas corpus appeal, neither party brought that fact to this court's attention.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The petitioner raised four claims in his direct appeal, including a claim that \"the trial court [\n    <em>\n     Devlin, J.\n    </em>\n    ] violated his sixth amendment right to conflict free counsel by inadequately canvassing him as to his desire to proceed with retained counsel who had previously represented both him and one of his codefendants in the case ....\"\n    <em>\n     State v.
