The plaintiffs, George Northrup and Helen Northrup,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the owners of the property at issue, appeal from the summary judgment rendered by the trial court in favor of the defendants-the borough of Naugatuck (town); Henry J. Witkowski, Jr., the town's former superintendent of streets; James Stewart, the former town engineer and, later, the town's director of public works;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Robert A. Mezzo, the town's mayor\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -upon its determination that all\n   counts of the plaintiffs' complaint were barred by governmental immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiffs claim on appeal that the court improperly determined that (1) the defendants were entitled to governmental immunity on all counts as a matter of law because the acts or omissions of which they complained were discretionary rather than ministerial in nature, (2) the identifiable person-imminent harm\n   exception to governmental immunity did not apply to the flooding at issue because the plaintiffs were not subject to imminent harm, and (3) the allegations of recklessness directed against the individual defendants could not be sustained as a matter of law. We disagree with the plaintiffs and, for the reasons that follow, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record before the court, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs as the nonmoving party, reveals the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiffs reside on property located in the town at 61 Nettleton Avenue. On eight different occasions between 2009 and 2012, the plaintiff's property was damaged when surface rainwater and/or \"black water\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   inundated the property because the single catch basins in the area routinely became clogged or inadequately redirected water away from the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the first occurrence in July, 2009, Helen Northrup contacted Stewart, who, at that time, was the town's supervisory engineer. He told her that the flooding was the result of a rare storm and that it would not happen again. Despite his assurance, however, flooding occurred again in October and December of that year. The plaintiffs continued to contact Stewart, to no avail. The plaintiffs made several requests to the town for sandbags; one such request was granted, but others were denied or simply ignored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The town received a report in October, 2009, from an engineering firm about the Nettleton Avenue neighborhood. The report indicated that, over the past forty years, many residences in the neighborhood had experienced periodic flooding of their properties following periods of heavy rainfall. It further indicated that the\n   drainage system in the area was likely to experience flooding after rainfalls of two inches or more, which could occur several times a year. The report attributed the flooding to the fact that runoff was required to flow through relatively narrow drainpipes that were in poor to fair condition and that the majority of catch basins in the area were old and had small openings that often became overgrown with vegetation or obstructed by trash. The report recommended that the town construct new, larger storm drains to handle the storm runoff in the area, but the town failed to adopt that proposal. The plaintiffs' property flooded again in July of 2010, March and August of 2011, and June and September of 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiffs commenced the underlying action in February, 2010. They filed an amended complaint on March 11, 2013. The amended complaint contained nine counts. Counts one, two, and six sounded in negligence against Witkowski, Jr., Stewart, and the town. Counts three through five alleged common-law recklessness against the individual defendants. Counts seven through nine alleged negligent infliction of emotional distress against Witkowski, Jr., Stewart, and the town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 5, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to strike all but the negligence\n   counts. Specifically, the defendants argued that the counts alleging common-law recklessness against the individual defendants should be stricken because they failed to set forth allegations of conduct that would give rise to a finding of recklessness. Further, the defendants argued that the counts sounding in negligent infliction of emotional distress should be stricken because such a cause of action cannot arise from allegations of damage to property only. The plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to strike alleging that all causes of action were sufficiently pleaded given those allegations that were expressly pleaded as well as those necessarily implied.\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    Frechette, J.\n   </em>\n   , issued an order denying the motion to strike as to the recklessness counts, but granting the motion as to those counts alleging negligent infliction of emotional distress. The court stated in its order that \"[t]aken as admitted, the plaintiff's allegations of recklessness are sufficient.\" The court nevertheless agreed \"with the vast majority of Superior Court decisions which hold that Connecticut does not recognize a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress arising solely out of a property damage claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 4, 2013, the plaintiffs filed the operative second amended complaint, in which, among other things, they repleaded their counts alleging negligent infliction of emotional distress. The defendants filed a revised answer on February 27, 2014, in which they raised special defenses of contributory negligence, governmental immunity, and failure to mitigate damages. A certificate of closed pleadings and a claim for the trial list was filed on May 4, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 30, 2015, the defendants filed the motion for summary judgment underlying the present appeal. The defendants submitted a supporting memorandum of law, attached to which were partial transcripts from the depositions of Helen Northrup and the individual defendants, as well as an affidavit by Stewart. The defendants argued that the negligence counts, including those alleging negligent infliction of emotional distress, were barred by governmental immunity because they involved acts or omissions that required the exercise of judgment or discretion, and no other recognized exception to governmental immunity applied. The defendants further argued that the recklessness counts brought against the individual defendants also failed as a matter of law because, on the basis of the allegations and evidence presented, no reasonable fact finder could\n   determine that the individual defendants had engaged in demonstrably reckless conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiffs filed an objection to the motion for summary judgment on November 18, 2015, arguing with respect to the negligence counts that there remained genuine issues of material fact as to whether the defendants were exercising ministerial or discretionary duties and, if discretionary, whether the identifiable person-imminent harm exception to governmental immunity applied. With regard to the recklessness counts, the plaintiffs argued that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the conduct of the individual defendants rose to the level of recklessness. The plaintiffs attached a number of exhibits to their objection, including portions of the deposition testimony of Helen Northrup, Stewart, and Witkowski, Jr.; an affidavit from Helen Northrup; a copy of the \"October, 2009 Stormwater Management Report for the Nettleton Avenue Neighborhood\"; a copy of chapter 16, article II, \u00a7 16-32 of the town's code of ordinances; Witkowski, Jr.'s and Stewart's answers to the plaintiffs' interrogatories; and copies of sewer\n   back-up reports and citizen complaints regarding problems at nearby properties. The defendants filed a reply memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Oral argument on the motion was heard by the court,\n   <em>\n    Blue, J.\n   </em>\n   , on January 4, 2016. During argument regarding whether there were sufficient facts in evidence to submit the recklessness counts to a jury, the court asked the plaintiffs' counsel whether he knew of \"any case in Connecticut or elsewhere where a town or town official has been held liable in recklessness\" in a situation similar to the present case. Counsel answered in the negative, but asked for an opportunity to submit a supplemental brief addressing the court's question. The court agreed, with the consent of the defendants' counsel, and continued the matter to January 19, 2016, for supplemental argument on the recklessness counts. The\n   plaintiffs submitted their supplemental brief on January 8, 2016, and the defendants filed a brief in response on January 15, 2016. Argument on the motion for summary judgment resumed on January 19, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 20, 2016, the court issued a memorandum of decision granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts. With respect to the negligence counts, including those counts alleging negligent infliction of emotional distress, the court concluded that the plaintiffs' specifications of negligence amounted to a \"litany of discretionary omissions\" and that their \"allegations boiled down to a claim that the defendants failed to perform their municipal duties in an appropriate manner.\" The court determined that the city ordinance on which the plaintiffs relied in opposing summary judgment only set forth the general duties of the street department without any specific directions or mandates as to how those duties should be discharged. Accordingly, the court concluded that the defendants' acts or omissions in maintaining the town's drainage system were discretionary in nature. Furthermore, the court concluded that the identifiable person-imminent harm exception to discretionary act immunity was inapplicable as a matter of law because the risk of the property flooding at any given time was indefinite and, thus, did not constitute an imminent harm. The court also granted summary judgment with respect to the recklessness counts, concluding that they also were barred by governmental immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiffs filed a motion to reargue and for reconsideration, which the defendants opposed. The court denied the plaintiffs' motion, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We begin with the standard of review we employ in appeals challenging a court's decision to grant summary judgment. \"Practice Book \u00a7 [17-49] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that\n   there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ... In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. ... The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue [of] material facts which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law ... and the party opposing such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. ...

With these general principles in mind, we turn to the plaintiffs' claims on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiffs first claim on appeal that the court improperly determined as a matter of law that the defendants were entitled to governmental immunity on all counts because the acts or omissions of which the plaintiffs complained were discretionary in nature rather than ministerial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In arguing that the alleged negligent acts or omissions of the defendants in the present case were ministerial in nature rather than discretionary, the plaintiffs rely upon \u00a7 16-32 of the town's code of ordinances and our\n   Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Spitzer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waterbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1543064\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/113/84/\">\n    113 Conn. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20A.%20157\">\n    154 A. 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1931). We are not persuaded, however, that any language found in \u00a7 16-32 imposes a ministerial duty on the defendants with respect to maintaining and repairing the town's storm water drainage systems or that the language the plaintiffs have culled from the discussion in\n   <em>\n    Spitzer\n   </em>\n   necessarily supports a contrary conclusion. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As previously set forth, our courts consistently have adhered to the principle\n   that to demonstrate the existence of a ministerial duty on the part of a municipality and its agents, a plaintiff ordinarily must point to some statute, city charter provision, ordinance, regulation, rule, policy, or other directive that, by its clear language, compels a municipal employee to act in a prescribed manner, without the exercise of judgment or discretion.

In the present case, the plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 16-32 of the town's code of ordinances, which assigns responsibility for the care, management, and maintenance of the town's storm water drainage system to the town's street commission, contains such language. Specifically, the plaintiffs insist that \u00a7 16-32 imposed a ministerial duty on the defendants to keep the storm drains and drainage pipes near their property in a safe and operable condition, and their failure to exercise that duty in a reasonable manner led to the flooding of the plaintiffs' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 16-32 of the town's code of ordinances provides as follows: \"Except as otherwise provided in this article, the streets commission shall be responsible for\n   the care and management of all streets, avenues, high-ways, alleys and bridges, and the opening, grading improving, repairing and cleaning of the same; of the construction, protection, repair, furnishing, cleaning, heating, lighting and general care of all public streets and appurtenances, except such as are by the express terms of the Charter under the control of some other officer or department; of the construction, repair, cleaning and general care of all drains, culverts, sluiceways and catch basins, and the collection and disposing of ashes, garbage and refuse. The streets commission shall make all suitable rules and regulations in regard to the department and the conduct of its business.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Naugatuck Code of Ordinances, c. 16, art. II, \u00a7 16-32.\n   It is indisputable that the ordinance places the responsibility of cleaning, maintaining and repairing the town's catch basins and other elements of the storm water sewer squarely in the hands of the streets commission.

In discussing imminent harm in\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court discussed our decision in\n   <em>\n    Silberstein\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    54 Hillcrest Park Associates, LLC\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6779701\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/135/262/\">\n    135 Conn.App. at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20A.3d%201147\">\n    41 A.3d 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which also involved a claim of repeated flooding during periods of heavy rainfall over the course of several years. The Supreme Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   that the risk of harm in\n   <em>\n    Silberstein\n   </em>\n   was not imminent \"because it was not apparent to the municipal defendant that the risk of harm was so great that the defendant's duty to\n   act immediately to prevent the harm was clear and unequivocal.\"\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Middletown\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20303\">\n    314 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   322 n.14,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=101%20A.3d%20249\">\n    101 A.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, because there was not a high probability that damaging flooding would occur at any particular time, there was no clear and urgent need for action on the part of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Furthermore, our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bonington\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Westport\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087498\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/297/297/#p308\">\n    297 Conn. at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=999%20A.2d%20700\">\n    999 A.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , also supports our conclusion that the harm at issue in the present case was not imminent harm for purposes of the identifiable person-imminent harm exception. The court in\n   <em>\n    Bonington\n   </em>\n   rejected the plaintiff landowners' argument that the risk of flooding caused by excess surface water runoff during periods of significant rainfall was an imminent harm. The court indicated that such a risk fell \"short of the limited circumstances under which imminent harm may be established.\" Id., at 314,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=999%20A.2d%20700\">\n    999 A.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the court explained: \"Although the plaintiffs' property undoubtedly constitutes a discrete place, and rainfall inevitably would occur at that site at some point in the future, a significant rainfall causing excessive surface runoff necessarily would occur at an indefinite point in time. Such harm is not imminent.\" Id., at 315,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=999%20A.2d%20700\">\n    999 A.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Bonington\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the risk at issue here did not rise to imminent harm under the test established in\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, the court properly rejected the plaintiffs' claim that the identifiable person-imminent harm exception was applicable under the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly raised sua sponte whether the plaintiff's allegations of recklessness directed against the individual\n   defendants could be maintained against them as a matter of law, and ultimately decided adversely to the plaintiffs that the counts alleging recklessness against the individual defendants were barred by governmental immunity. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the court's decision to grant summary judgment on these counts, albeit on the basis of an alternative ground briefed by the parties.

The court, however, later raised sua sponte and asked for briefing on whether claims of recklessness against a municipality or its agents could be maintained as a matter of law. In reaching its conclusion, it appears that the court made a subsidiary determination that the plaintiffs had sued the individual defendants only in their official capacities as town employees and that claims of reckless conduct against a municipality directly or against town officials in their official capacity are not legally cognizable because of governmental immunity.

We conclude on the basis of our plenary review of the pleadings and evidentiary submissions in support and in opposition to summary judgment that there was no factual basis for the recklessness counts and, therefore, summary judgment on these counts was proper, albeit for a different reason. Accordingly, we need not reach whether the individual defendants were sued in their personal or official capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"Recklessness requires a conscious choice of a course of action either with knowledge of the serious danger to others involved in it or with knowledge of facts which would disclose this danger to any reasonable man, and the actor must recognize that his conduct\n   involves a risk substantially greater ... than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent. ...

Although we must acknowledge that it is possible for an allegation of negligence to sometimes also describe reckless conduct, the plaintiffs' allegations in the present case cannot reasonably be characterized as rising above mere negligence. Even accepting all allegations as true, they do not, as a matter of law, support submitting the recklessness counts to a jury, and, therefore, summary judgment in favor of the individual defendants is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Generally, the plaintiffs allege that the individual defendants failed to maintain and keep the storm drainage system in a reasonably operative condition, and that they had notice of the flooding that was occurring in the Nettleton Avenue area but failed to warn the plaintiffs and adopted a laissez faire attitude in addressing the situation. There is no evidence in the summary judgment record, however, that the defendants were aware of any existing drainage problem specifically involving the plaintiff's particular property prior to the first reported incident of flooding. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the flooding in the neighborhood involved a situation of such a high degree of danger that the failure to take immediate action to prevent its recurrence demonstrated a conscious disregard for the safety of the plaintiffs' or the neighborhood generally. Although the plaintiffs' frustration with what they viewed as ineptness and a lack of urgency by\n   the town and\n   the individual defendants to alleviate the flooding situation in their neighborhood is understand-able, there is nevertheless undisputed evidence that some action was taken to improve the drainage in the Nettleton Avenue area, albeit perhaps insufficient and not before additional flooding occurred. The record simply cannot support a finding that any of the individual defendants acted or failed to act with the type of wanton disregard that is the hallmark of reckless behavior. Moreover, in opposing summary judgment on the recklessness counts, the plaintiffs failed to submit any evidence that would alter that conclusion. Once the defendants established that no genuine issue of material fact existed that the recklessness allegations were unsupported by evidence, the burden shifted to the plaintiffs to produce that evidence. They failed to do so. Accordingly, the defendants were entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Helen Northrup also brought the action as next friend on behalf of her minor son, Timothy Northrup.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Through 2009, the superintendent of streets was the official responsible for the care and management of the town's streets.
