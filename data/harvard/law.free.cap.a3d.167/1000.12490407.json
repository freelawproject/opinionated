On appeal, the\n   defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) instructed the jury on reasonable doubt and (2) denied his motion to suppress evidence. We reject both of these claims and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On December 11, 2012, the narcotics unit of the Middletown Police Department executed a search and seizure warrant on the residence of Rachel Sweeney at 165 South Main Street in Middletown. Sweeney was arrested on drug possession charges as a result of the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the time the warrant was executed, the defendant and another person were\n   sitting in a car parked in the area behind 165 South Main Street. One officer detained the defendant while others searched Sweeney's residence. After police completed the search, David Skarzynski, a parole officer who had assisted the Middletown officers in executing the warrant, was alerted to the defendant's presence outside the residence. Skarzynski recognized the defendant as a parolee who previously had been under his supervision. Skarzynski asked the defendant for permission to search his residence at 29 Avon Court in Middletown. The defendant consented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Skarzynski and officers with the narcotics unit traveled to the defendant's residence. Upon conducting a search of the defendant's bedroom, the officers recovered, among other items, 16.529 grams of crack cocaine from a locked safe located underneath the defendant's bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant was arrested and charged with possession of a narcotic substance with the intent to sell in violation of \u00a7 21a-278(b). After a jury found the defendant guilty of that offense,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court sentenced him\n   to ten years incarceration, five years of which were mandatory, followed by eight years of special parole. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   REASONABLE DOUBT INSTRUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant's first claim is that part of the court's instruction on reasonable doubt was improper. Specifically, he argues that the court erred in describing reasonable doubt as follows: \"[Reasonable doubt] is such a doubt as, in serious affairs that concern you, you will heed; that is, such a doubt as would cause reasonable men and women to hesitate to act upon it in matters of importance.\" The defendant asserts that the language used in this part of the court's charge was defective in two respects. We address both of his linguistic challenges herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The gravamen of the defendant's first challenge is that the \"insertion ... of the prepositional phrase 'upon it' render[ed] the instruction nonsensical,\" causing it to \"mean the opposite of what it should.\" He argues that reversal is required because this part of the instruction effectively diluted the state's burden of proof by \"muddl[ing] the description of what a reasonable doubt is\" and by failing to \"impress ... upon the [jury] the need to reach a subjective state of\n   <em>\n    near certitude\n   </em>\n   of [the defendant's] guilt.\" (Emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The state responds that the defendant concedes that our appellate courts have upheld instructions\n   employing the \"upon it\" language. Therefore, it contends that this court, as an intermediate court, is constrained to following that controlling precedent. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We begin by identifying our standard of review and outlining the relevant legal principles. \"It is fundamental that proof of guilt in a criminal case must be beyond a reasonable doubt. ... The [reasonable doubt concept] provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence-that bedrock axiomatic and elementary principle whose enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law. ... At the same time, by\n   impressing upon the [fact finder] the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused, the [reasonable doubt] standard symbolizes the significance that our society attaches to the criminal sanction and thus to liberty itself. ... [Consequently, the defendant] in a criminal case [is] entitled to a clear and unequivocal charge by the court that the guilt of the [defendant] must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jackson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730520\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/283/111/#p116\">\n    283 Conn. 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 116-17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=925%20A.2d%201060\">\n    925 A.2d 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Because our system entrusts the jury with the primary responsibility of implementing the substantive protections promised by the reasonable doubt standard, reasonable doubt jury instructions which appropriately convey [the reasonable doubt concept] are critical to the constitutionality of a conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Doyle,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11889965\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/130/523/#p535\">\n    130 F.3d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535 (2d Cir. 1997).

At the time it instructed the jury, the court provided the jurors and counsel with typewritten copies of its instructions. The court informed the jury that it would deliver its instructions by reading the typewritten version aloud: \"As you see, I'm reading these instructions. I do that because they were prepared in advance, and I want to make sure that I say exactly what I intend to say. Do not single out any sentence or individual point or instruction in my charge and ignore the others. You are to consider all the instructions as a whole, and consider each, in light of all the others.\" The jurors had copies of the written instructions during their deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the typewritten version of the instructions, reasonable doubt was described, in relevant part, as a \"doubt, as in serious affairs that concern you, you\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   heed.\" (Emphasis added.) However, the transcript of the trial court proceedings indicates that the court's oral instruction described reasonable doubt as \"a doubt, as in serious affairs that concern you, you\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   heed.\" The defendant never took an exception to the court's use of the word \"will\" in its oral instructions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, there is no indication in the record that the jury, the court, or counsel noticed the discrepancy between the oral and written instructions. Moreover, the jury did not request clarification as to that discrepancy or on any of the court's instructions pertaining to reasonable doubt and the burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We next set forth our standard of review and the relevant legal principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[U]nder\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review, as modified in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Polanco,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485327\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/230/#p572\">\n    165 Conn.App. 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 572,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485327\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/230/#p572\">\n    140 A.3d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485136\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/708/12485136/\">\n    322 Conn. 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485136,12485135\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/708/\">\n    139 A.3d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

The defendant contends that such evidence was obtained in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and article first, \u00a7 7, of\n   the Connecticut Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, he contends that a warrantless search of a parolee's residence that fails to comply with administrative directives promulgated by the Department of Correction (department) is unconstitutional, even if the parolee had previously executed an agreement authorizing such searches as a condition of his parole. The state's principal response is that we should not review the defendant's federal and state constitutional claims because they are moot. Specifically, it argues that on appeal the defendant fails to challenge an independent basis supporting the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress, namely, the trial court's finding that the defendant verbally consented to the search. We agree with the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence that was seized in a warrantless search of his residence, including 16.529 grams of crack cocaine. In that motion, the defendant's principal argument was that the search was unconstitutional because it was made without a warrant and did not comply with administrative directives promulgated by the department. He also asserted that he had not consented, verbally or in writing, to the search. After a two day evidentiary hearing, the trial court made the following factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"On December 11, 2012, [in the course of executing a search and seizure warrant for the residence of ... Sweeney, members of the Middletown police force] encountered a vehicle being operated by [the defendant]. ... Parole Officer Skarzynski, who assisted in the execution of the search and seizure warrant, knew [the defendant,] as [the defendant] was previously on his caseload. ... [Skarzynski also] was aware that [the defendant] was on lifetime parole. ... Skarzynski spoke with [the defendant] and obtained his verbal consent to ... conduct a search of his residence. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"Middletown police officers transported [the defendant] to his residence and room within his boarding house. ... Skarzynski made a phone call to his ... supervisor, [the defendant's] current parole officer, and [the supervisor of the defendant's current parole officer,] requesting their authorization to search [the defendant's] room. ... [A]ll [three] gave their verbal consent. When inside the residence ... Skarzynski ... [and] Middletown police detectives ... conducted a search of [the defendant's] bedroom. [U]nder the bed a safe was located ... where a large amount of crack cocaine was found.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In a written memorandum of decision, the court denied the defendant's motion to suppress the seized evidence. The court articulated two grounds in support of its ruling. First, it rejected the defendant's argument that a warrantless search of a parolee's residence that fails to comply with the department's administrative directives is unconstitutional, even if the parolee had previously executed an agreement authorizing such searches as a condition of his parole. Beginning with a review of the relevant case law, the court noted that \"[a]s a parolee, a defendant has a reduced expectation of privacy which allows a warrantless search of his person and residence by his parole officer.\" The court then found that the defendant gave written consent to\n   the search by executing an agreement called \"Conditions of Parole,\" which was submitted by the state as an exhibit. That agreement, which was signed by the defendant on February 25, 2010, provided in relevant part: \"You shall be required to submit to a search of your person, possessions, vehicle, business, residence, or any area under your control at any time, announced or unannounced, with or without cause by parole or its agent to verify your compliance with the conditions of your parole.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court's second ground for denying the defendant's motion to suppress was its finding that the defendant verbally consented to the search: \"[The defendant] not only consented in writing to the warrantless search of his residence as a condition of his parole on February 25, 2010, he also gave his verbal consent to ... Skarzynski on December 11, 2012.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On appeal, the defendant challenges only the first of the trial court's two grounds for denying the motion to suppress. That is, he again presents the argument that a warrantless search of a parolee's residence that fails to comply with the department's administrative directives is unconstitutional, even if the parolee previously had executed an agreement authorizing such searches as a condition of his parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant does not challenge, however, the court's finding that he verbally consented to the search. Because the finding regarding the defendant's verbal consent constitutes an unchallenged independent basis for the court's ruling, we are compelled conclude that the defendant's claim on\n   appeal is moot. Accordingly, we decline to review the defendant's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We set forth the relevant legal principles regarding mootness. \"Mootness is a question of justiciability that must be determined as a threshold matter because\n   it implicates [this] court's subject matter jurisdiction. ... The fundamental principles underpinning the mootness doctrine are well settled.

(3) that the matter in controversy be capable of being adjudicated by the judicial power ... and (4) that the determination of the controversy will result in practical relief to the complainant. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"[I]t is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from\n   <em>\n    the determination of which no practical relief can follow.\n   </em>\n   ...

That is, once the defendant verbally consented to the search, the need for law enforcement to obtain a warrant or comply with\n   the department's administrative directives was obviated.

The defendant does not challenge the court's finding that he verbally consented to the search in this appeal. Consequently, because the defendant has failed to challenge that independent basis supporting the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress, even if this court were to rule in his favor on the claim he presents on appeal, we could grant him no practical relief. Accordingly, the defendant's claim is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The appeal is dismissed as moot with respect to the defendant's claim that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence; the judgment is affirmed in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    It appears that there was some confusion in the trial court proceedings regarding the defendant's first name.

The trial court stated at the sentencing hearing: \"Several discrepancies have arisen regarding Mr. Holley's name, he's been using his dead brother's name of James as an alias for decades,\n    <em>\n     but his birth name is Ever Lee Holley.\"\n    </em>\n    (Emphasis added.)
