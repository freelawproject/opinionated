Medeiros, appeals from the judgment of the trial court finding him in contempt for violating an order providing the plaintiff, Christine Medeiros, with access to their minor child. The defendant claims that the court committed error in (1) failing to allow him a fair opportunity to present a defense to the plaintiff's motion for contempt; (2) failing to require that the evidence establishing its finding of contempt met the required clear and convincing standard of proof; (3) preventing the defendant from testifying as to statements made to him by the minor child about events occurring during a visit with the plaintiff; and (4) imposing certain sanctions, including monetary fines. We agree with the defendant that the monetary fines\n   imposed on him by the court were improper, accordingly, we reverse that part of the judgment of the trial court. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as determined by the trial court in its oral decision of June 3, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The parties were divorced on February 28, 2013. There is one child issue of the marriage, who was born in 2007. A parental responsibility plan, agreed to by the parties, was incorporated into the judgment of dissolution. That plan awarded joint legal custody and shared physical custody of the child to the parties. Subsequent to the date of the judgment of dissolution and prior to the contempt hearing that is the subject of this appeal, there were five separate modifications of the judgment affecting the orders pertaining to custody and access to the child. The first two of these subsequent modifications awarded the defendant sole legal custody of the child and required that the plaintiff's visitation with the child be supervised, but the final modification, issued by the court,\n   <em>\n    Boland, J.\n   </em>\n   , on April 7, 2015, restored the parties' joint legal custody, and the plaintiff was afforded access consisting of unsupervised visits, with overnight visits resuming effective July 30, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The order also noted\n   that the\n   child's court appointed guardian ad litem, Tracie Molinaro, would be discharged effective July 30, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 13, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion for contempt alleging that on May 12, 2015, in violation of the April 7, 2015 order, the defendant refused to allow her access to the child and had threatened to stop all visitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion was heard by the court,\n   <em>\n    dos Santos, J.\n   </em>\n   , on June 3, 2015. The court heard testimony from the plaintiff and the defendant. At the conclusion of the hearing, following a recess, the court issued its oral decision setting forth the factual basis for its finding\n   that the defendant was in wilful contempt of the April 7, 2015 order. The court stated: \"The court finds that the [plaintiff] did not access visitation, as ordered by Judge Boland, and the denial of access visitation occurred on May 12, on May 15, and May 17, and that the denial was without justification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"There was an incident, while the child was in [the plaintiff's] custody/visitation/access, where [the plaintiff] disciplined the child. The court finds, based upon the credible testimony, that [the plaintiff] acted appropriately in disciplining the child. And the court also further finds that the child was not physically disciplined by [the plaintiff]. The court finds that the child acted unruly, and the [plaintiff] appropriately disciplined the child. The court notes that, in this instance, the child does not have a say on whether or not he wants to visit with [the plaintiff].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The court finds that [the defendant's] actions in utilizing the recommendations of the [guardian ad litem] and the child's counselor are being used to alienate the ability of [the plaintiff] to parent this child, and that [the defendant's] actions are in wilful disregard of the orders that were imposed by, only a short time ago ... Judge Boland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The court notes in making its findings that the [defendant] did not notify the police until he decided that he was going to stop visitation, that he did not contact [the Department of Children and Families] if [the defendant] was so concerned about the child's welfare and well-being. And the\n   court cannot find that [the plaintiff] exposed the child to unsafe conditions or situations.\" (Footnote added.)\n   The court then imposed sanctions. It ordered that the defendant be incarcerated for a period of ten days; that he be fined for each day that he denied the plaintiff access to her child at the rate of $100 per day, for a total of $300; that he be fined for violating the court's order in the amount of $500; and that he pay the plaintiff attorney's fees of $2500 and marshal fees for service in the amount of $143 within sixty days. With respect to the ten day order of incarceration, the court stated: \"Now, insofar as the ten days ordered incarceration, the court will not, at this point, incarcerate the defendant, but give him an opportunity to allow the court-ordered visitation, that was ordered by Judge Boland, to take place. So, the court will not impose the incarceration at this time, but it is there, and the court, then, will consider whether or not to vacate it entirely upon successful-upon the court being satisfied that [the defendant] has complied with the court-ordered visitation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 3, 2015, the court also issued a written order reiterating, without reference to the factual findings it had made in its oral decision that same day, its finding of wilful contempt and the sanctions it had imposed, and adding that all of the fines imposed were to be paid within twenty days. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We address the defendant's first and third claims together because they both relate to claimed error on the part of the court in not permitting him to present a defense to the motion for contempt. The defendant's first claim is that the court erred in failing to allow him a fair opportunity to present his defense, and his third claim is that the court erred in failing to allow him to\n   testify as to statements made to him by the child about events occurring during a visit on May 10, 2015, with the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the defendant asserts that after allowing the plaintiff to testify as to what had occurred on May 10, 2015, during her visit with the child, including statements that she testified the child had made to her,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   he was not permitted to testify as to what the child\n   told him when the child returned to the defendant's home after the visit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review for evidentiary claims. \"To the extent [that] a trial court's admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the Code of Evidence, our standard of review is plenary. For example, whether a challenged statement properly may be classified as hearsay and whether a hearsay exception properly is identified are legal questions demanding plenary review. ... We review the trial court's decision to admit evidence, if\n   premised on a correct view of the law, however, for an abuse of discretion. ... In other words, only after a trial court has made the legal determination that a particular statement is or is not hearsay, or is subject to a hearsay exception, is it vested with the discretion to admit or to bar the evidence based upon relevancy, prejudice, or other legally appropriate grounds related to the rule of evidence under which admission is being sought.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Miguel C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%20562\">\n    305 Conn. 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571-72,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20A.3d%20126\">\n    46 A.3d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"In a civil case, the appellant has the burden of establishing the specific harmfulness of the error by demonstrating the likelihood that the evidentiary ruling had affected the result.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059292\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/111/413/#p420\">\n    111 Conn.App. 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 420,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=959%20A.2d%20637\">\n    959 A.2d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Relative to the issue of whether the court erred in sustaining the plaintiff's objections to the defendant's testimony as to what the child reported to him after the May 10, 2015 visit, the following testimony occurred during the direct examination of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[The Defendant's Counsel]: Mr. Medeiros, you were in court April 7 when Judge Boland entered orders for visitation, correct?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[The Defendant's Counsel]: And keep your voice up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[The Witness]: Okay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[The Defendant's Counsel]: Either that or I'll stand at the back of the courtroom and you'll have to yell at me.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"[The Witness]: Okay.

Why was he given a cell phone?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[The Witness]: [The child] was given a cell phone on the recommendation, actually, of Judge Boland, where [the child] could have a safety phone. If he felt uncomfortable he could-or if something wasn't-if he needed to-if he needed some reassurance or if he needed to\n   come home he could call. It was his safety phone. He discussed that with his counselor as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"[The Defendant's Counsel]: All right.

Absolutely.\" (Footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The defendant claims that the court prevented him from explaining why his reaction to the child's report to him of what had occurred during the visit with the plaintiff on Sunday, May 10, 2015, was reasonable and, thus, did not constitute a wilful violation of the court's order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   He maintains that the court improperly sustained the plaintiff's objections to the admission of evidence of what the child reported to him as hearsay although he had offered it not for the truth of the child's statements, but to show the child's state of mind after the visit on May 10, 2015, which resulted in his reasonably justified decision to prevent visits from taking place on May\n   12, May 15, and May 17, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff argues that the testimony was hearsay. We agree\n   with the defendant that the court should have allowed the child's May 10, 2015 statements to him into evidence under the state of mind of the declarant exception to the hearsay rule, but, in light of the testimony the court eventually did hear from the defendant about the child's reported reaction to that visit, without objection from the plaintiff, we conclude that the error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   State of mind is an exception to the hearsay rule, referred to in our Code of Evidence as then-existing mental or emotional condition. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3 (4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Several times during his testimony, the defendant indicated that the child had returned from the May 10, 2015 visit with the plaintiff \"very upset, very scared,\" and \"very distraught.\" The defendant's testimony was admissible to show the child's state of mind and emotional condition at the time rather than to prove the truth of what the child stated had occurred. The defendant was offering the statements of the child to explain the reasons the child provided for his emotional distress. Such evidence was relevant to whether the defendant's conduct in disallowing the next three visits was reasonable under the circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The record, however, reveals that subsequent to the three times the court sustained the plaintiff's objections to the offer of the child's statements as hearsay, the court, without objection, heard testimony from the defendant that effectively conveyed the gist of the information he previously had attempted, unsuccessfully, to introduce. He was able to relay to the court that the child returned from the May 10, 2015 visit distraught and upset and had explained many things to him, including not being allowed to telephone the defendant when he felt unsafe, and being picked up and put in a chair physically. The court also heard evidence that after police officers spoke with the child at his school on May 15, 2015, they determined that rather than have a visit occur with the plaintiff, it was best that he go home with the defendant. The defendant also testified that he had concerns for the child's safety. Ultimately, the defendant was able to convey these points to the court. The court, however, found the plaintiff's testimony that she had appropriately disciplined the child more credible\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and determined that the defendant's conduct in depriving the plaintiff of three subsequent visits was not justified.

A contempt is considered civil when the punishment is wholly remedial, serves only the purposes of the complainant, and is not intended as a deterrent to offenses against the public. ...

Because the grounds for the motion for contempt and sanctions in the present case were to serve the purposes of and to compensate the plaintiff, we conclude that the contempt was properly classified as civil, rather than criminal, in nature. \"Contempt is a disobedience to the rules and orders of a court which has power to punish for such an offense. ... Contempts of court may also be classified as either direct or indirect, the test being whether the contempt is offered within or outside the presence of the court.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Edmond\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Foisey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059375\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/111/760/#p769\">\n    111 Conn.App. 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 769,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=961%20A.2d%20441\">\n    961 A.2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).

The record reveals that on June 24, 2015, the court vacated its order of incarceration, which had been stayed. Neither of the parties brought this fact to our attention in their respective briefs. On February 22, 2017, we ordered the parties to file simultaneous supplemental briefs to address the following issue: \"If this court determined that the contempt finding was proper, in determining the propriety of the sanctions that were imposed, should this court dismiss that portion of the appeal challenging the imposition of the incarceration order as moot?\" Having reviewed the supplemental briefs, we conclude that the issue of the propriety of the incarceration order satisfies an exception\n   to the mootness doctrine because it is capable of repetition yet evading review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \"Mootness is a question of justiciability that must be determined as a threshold matter because it implicates [this] court's subject matter jurisdiction ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Rocque\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Design Land Developers of Milford, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5162321\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/82/361/\">\n    82 Conn.App. 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=844%20A.2d%20882\">\n    844 A.2d 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). \"If there is no longer an actual controversy in which [this court] can afford practical relief to the parties, we must dismiss the appeal.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Fiddelman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Redmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1047957\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/59/481/#p483\">\n    59 Conn.App. 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=757%20A.2d%20671\">\n    757 A.2d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). \"In determining mootness, the dispositive question is whether a successful appeal would benefit the plaintiff or defendant in any way.\"\n   <em>\n    Hechtman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Savitsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"130420\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/62/654/#p659\">\n    62 Conn.App. 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=772%20A.2d%20673\">\n    772 A.2d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). We recognize that an appeal challenging the validity of a court's finding of contempt, even when purged by making payments, is not moot because a contempt finding has collateral consequences in that it may impact the contemnor's future status in the action. \"For example, a future citation for contempt, given the first finding of\n   contempt which is the subject of [the same] case, would make the defendant appear more recalcitrant than he might be, in fact. Such an impression is likely to affect a trial court's determination of the penalty attendant on any future finding of contempt in this [same] case.\"\n   <em>\n    Sgarellino\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hightower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1969058\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/13/591/#p594\">\n    13 Conn.App. 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594-95,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=538%20A.2d%201065\">\n    538 A.2d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). In the present case, however, having found no error in the court's finding that the defendant was in contempt, the collateral consequences of that finding remain attached regardless of the propriety of the sanctions imposed. Accordingly, there would be no reason to review the propriety of the sanctions on the basis of collateral consequences that will continue to flow from the contempt finding regardless of whether some of the sanctions ordered upon a valid finding of contempt were improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   If a controversy is moot, however, it is still justiciable if it meets the requirements of the \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" doctrine, an exception to the mootness doctrine. See\n   <em>\n    Sweeney\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sweeney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2605713\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/271/193/#p201\">\n    271 Conn. 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 201,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=856%20A.2d%20997\">\n    856 A.2d 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Our Supreme Court has articulated the following three requirements for an otherwise moot controversy to be justiciable under this exception. \"First, the challenged action, or the effect of the challenged action, by its very nature must be of a limited duration so that there is a strong likelihood that the substantial majority of cases raising a question about its validity will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded. Second, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the question presented in the pending case will arise again in the future, and that it will affect either the same complaining party or a reasonably identifiable group for whom that party can be said to act as surrogate. Third, the question must have some public importance.\"\n   <em>\n    Loisel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rowe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"767771\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/233/370/#p382\">\n    233 Conn. 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 382,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=660%20A.2d%20323\">\n    660 A.2d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   With respect to the first requirement, we recognize that most incarceration sanctions imposed pursuant to a finding of contempt in a family case, even if incarceration is stayed, are of limited duration. An incarcerated person will either purge the contempt and be released from imprisonment or be released when the court concludes, upon further review, that the contemnor is unable to purge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Where the\n   order is stayed to monitor compliance, such monitoring in most cases will occur over the span of, at most, a few continuances unless the continued failure to comply results in further contempt findings and sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   As to the second requirement, the defendant notes that there is a reasonable likelihood that the question presented in this case will arise again in the future between the same parties and may affect him. The custody and visitation issues in this case have generated considerable court business since the date of the judgment of dissolution in 2013. We take judicial notice of the trial court file in this case, which indicates that disputes concerning the plaintiff's access to the child are ongoing. The defendant filed a motion to suspend all of the plaintiff's visits on July 10, 2015, barely a month after the contempt ruling at issue in this appeal was issued. Subsequently, after the court ordered coparenting counseling on October 27, 2015, the plaintiff filed two motions for contempt concerning the defendant's refusal to participate. The defendant also can be said to be representative of all alleged contemnors in questioning the authority of a court to issue an incarceration\n   order upon a finding of contempt, but stay that incarceration to monitor future compliance with the order that the contemnor was found to have violated. This is not an isolated incident not likely to be repeated in the foreseeable future in the present case or in other future cases involving contempt of parental access orders. See\n   <em>\n    Shays\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Local Grievance Committee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"695361\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/197/566/#p574\">\n    197 Conn. 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=499%20A.2d%201158\">\n    499 A.2d 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Finally, we consider the issue of whether a court appropriately may employ a stayed incarceration order to monitor ongoing future compliance with a visitation order that has been violated to be a matter of sufficient public importance. Ensuring compliance by a custodial parent with appropriate orders granting visitation to the other parent can be a particularly vexing dilemma that must be addressed to protect both the best interests of the child and the visiting parent's fundamental \"right to family integrity, including the right to the care, custody, companionship and management of one's children ....\"\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Weston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"360129\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/259/202/#p210\">\n    259 Conn. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 210,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=789%20A.2d%20431\">\n    789 A.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). We further recognize that cases regularly arise where the custodial parent displays a blatant disregard of a court order providing the other parent with meaningful contact with the child. We think it is important to determine whether the particular weapon of a stay of incarceration to monitor future compliance for a limited duration should properly remain in the trial courts' arsenal for enforcing their orders. Therefore, we conclude that the exception to the mootness doctrine applies in the present case and determine that the issue as to the propriety of the incarceration order is capable of repetition, yet evading review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Having determined to review the issue, we agree with the plaintiff that the stayed incarceration order was not improper. Although the defendant might have resumed his compliance with the plaintiff's parental access order in the few weeks immediately preceding the contempt\n   hearing, he had begun violating the order almost immediately after the court,\n   <em>\n    Boland, J.\n   </em>\n   , had concluded a contested hearing and modified the visitation orders to expand what previously had been the plaintiff's very limited access to the child. This resulted, almost immediately, in the plaintiff having to expend further sums of money and time to enforce rights that she only recently had obtained after a contested hearing. The defendant claims that the incarceration order was punitive because he had no ability to purge his contempt because if he was incarcerated for ten days, he would not be able to adhere to the visitation schedule. This misrepresents the nature of the order. The court gave him the ability to purge himself of the threat of incarceration by complying with the visitation orders for a limited duration. The defendant, therefore, had the ability to prevent his incarceration altogether if he continued to remain compliant, which he did, resulting in the vacating of the incarceration order only a few weeks after it was entered. Such an order also enabled the plaintiff to await the outcome of this conditional test of the defendant's continued willingness to comply without having to immediately resort to the expense of initiating another motion for contempt and serving another citation on the defendant. The defendant was provided with the keys to continuing freedom from incarceration by exhibiting a short period of full compliance. As a result of such compliance, the court would have no justification for vacating the stay and imposing a ten day term of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Civil contempt sanctions are intended to operate in a prospective manner and are \"designed to compel future compliance with a court order ... and avoidable through obedience ....\"\n   <em>\n    International Union, United Mine Workers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bagwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39687\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/821/#p827\">\n    512 U.S. 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 827,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39687\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/821/#p827\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39687\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/821/#p827\">\n    129 L.Ed. 2d 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). We decline to deprive our trial courts of the useful sanction of a stayed\n   incarceration order and conclude that a court, confronted with a contemnor who has displayed unsatisfactory reasons for his refusal to follow the court's orders, should have the authority, as part of the contempt process, to require, as a condition of a stayed order of incarceration, the contemnor's continued appearance before the court for the purpose of monitoring his future compliance for a reasonable time period. We acknowledge that in the event the contemnor returns to court on a future date for the purpose of monitoring his compliance and is shown to have persisted in his noncompliance, there is a legitimate question as to whether the court could immediately impose the stayed incarceration without further process by providing the contemnor with an opportunity to be heard and the imposition of a newly crafted sanction that would provide him with the ability to purge his contempt. If the court imposed the ten days of incarceration previously stayed, there would have to be an additional order with which the defendant could comply to secure his release or to reduce the length of his imprisonment, or the incarceration \"[will] not have been coercive, it [will] have been a purely punitive sanction for a previous ... violation.

The plaintiff claims that the court's consideration of the statutory criteria and the defendant's ability to pay the attorney's fees is implicit in its earlier determination, which occurred during the\n   same hearing on June 3, 2015, that the defendant had the ability to pay 90 percent of the $1500 fee retainer for the newly appointed guardian ad litem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The defendant does not contest the reasonableness of the amount of the attorney's fees requested by the plaintiff, which was supported by the bare representations of the plaintiff's counsel, not an affidavit, that he spent ten hours prosecuting the motion for contempt at a rate of $250 an hour. Rather, the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion by failing to consider his ability to pay the fees. Our careful review of the record reveals that the defendant not only failed to bring this objection to the attention of the court at the time that it considered the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees, but he also failed to raise any objection to that request. On this record, we conclude that the defendant waived his right to raise the present claim on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2629522\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/267/456/#p481\">\n    267 Conn. 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 481,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=839%20A.2d%20589\">\n    839 A.2d 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), our Supreme Court reasoned: \"[A]lthough a bare request for attorney's fees, without more, ordinarily would not suffice ... we conclude that a reversal of the award in the present case is not justified in light of the defendants' failure, prior to this appeal, to interpose\n   <em>\n    any objection whatsoever\n   </em>\n   to the plaintiffs' request for attorney's fees.

Nor did the defendant take any additional steps to obtain a decision in compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (a). In some cases in which the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (a) have not been followed, this court has declined to review the claims raised on appeal due to the lack of an adequate record. Despite the absence of a signed transcript of the court's oral decision or a written memorandum of decision, however, our ability to review the claims raised on appeal is not hampered because we are able to readily identify a sufficiently detailed and concise statement of the court's findings in the transcript of the proceeding.

Our thorough review of the defendant's arguments on appeal reflects that, in his principal brief, the defendant failed to rely on this argument. For the first time in his reply brief, the defendant argues that the child's statements were \"related to the defendant's belief that it was unsafe for the ... child to visit with the plaintiff at her home.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    To the extent that the defendant's reply brief invites this court to consider whether the evidence was admissible to demonstrate its effect on him, the hearer, we decline to address such argument for two reasons. First, we observe that the argument is not supported by any citation to or analysis of relevant law. \"We repeatedly have stated that [w]e are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. ... Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly. ... [F]or this court judiciously and efficiently to consider claims of error raised on appeal ... the parties must clearly and fully set forth their arguments in their briefs. ...

Second, \"[i]t is well established ... that [c]laims ... are unreviewable when raised for the first time in a reply brief. ... Our practice requires an appellant to raise claims of error in his original brief, so that the issue as framed by him can be fully responded to by the appellee in its brief, and so that we can have the full benefit of that written argument.
