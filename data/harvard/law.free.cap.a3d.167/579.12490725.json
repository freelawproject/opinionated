Two months later, Mr. McGeehan filed for divorce in the Circuit Court for Howard County, and an acrimonious debate ensued, which culminated in a divorce in December of 2015. The one year battle consumed volumes of the record, but our analysis will be focused on only that which engenders the discussion of three pieces of real property: property located on Embassy Park Road in Washington, DC (\"Embassy Park\"), purchased in December of 1998 and titled initially in both names as tenants by the entirety; another property located in Mason Neck, Virginia (\"Mason Neck\"), purchased in 2000 and titled initially in the husband's name; and property located on Farside Road in Ellicott City, Maryland (\"Farside\"), purchased in 2002 and titled as tenants by the entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A fourth property located at Log Jump Trail in Ellicott City, Maryland (\"Log Jump\"), purchased in September of 2013\n   by the McGeehans and titled as tenants by the entirety is relevant, because proceeds of sales of the Farside and Embassy Park properties apparently were rolled into the Log Jump purchase. Only the Log Jump and Mason Neck properties were owned by the parties at the time of their divorce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The present dispute between the parties before us was queued up in April of 2005 when a series of events occurred that were encapsulated by the Circuit Court Judge in her findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [I]n the year 2000, wife learned the husband had taken $50,000 out of her sole bank account without her knowledge or permission to purchase a piece of property\n   in [Mason Neck], Virginia. Husband told her afterward he had taken the money to purchase the property but wife now says she doesn't know if that's why he took the money.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The judge then discussed Mr. McGeehan's stock trading, which ultimately lead to the April 2005 real property transactions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Husband testified he accessed many of wife's accounts and that she was aware that he did so since it was he who handled the family finances. In addition, he had changed the document that wife had signed to allow him to take $5,000 out of her premarital security account and he changed it to read $15,000. Throughout the parties' marriage, from time to time-from the time husband worked for Merrill Lynch, husband would invest in the stock market. He made a lot of money early on but lost as much as he had earned when the dot com bubble burst. Husband discontinued stocking trading for a period of time when the family lived in Europe but resumed in about 2008 and continued to trade for several years. His last trade was about six months ago. It appears from the evidence that husband has lost significantly more in the stock market than he has profited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The judge then described the circumstances of the transfer in April of 2005 that lead to this embroilment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2005, wife discovered that husband had been trading her premarital stock account and she discovered that when she got a tax bill from the State of Virginia for over $592,000. This was a time of crisis for the couple and at that time it led them both to contemplate the future of their marriage. Wife made a new will leaving everything to her children and had her family's estate attorney write up a waiver of the statutory share for her husband to sign. Wife lost trust in husband, demanded that he transfer the parties' Embassy Park Drive home, Farside home in Ellicott City and the property in Virginia into her sole name. Husband alleges that this was done for estate planning purposes due to his risky employment but it's more credible that it was done to appease wife who was distraught over losing her inherited stock portfolio. The parties continued in the marriage after this. Husband continued to be in charge of the parties' finances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The judge also found that, \"All of the premarital funds had been co-mingled at that point.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The gravamen of the question raised by Ms. McGeehan, however, arises as a result of the judge's determination that the Mason Neck property retitled in 2005 to Ms. McGeehan's name was marital property:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The [Mason Neck], Virginia property was disputed property. It was initially titled in husband's name. It was transferred to wife's name in 2005 at a time when wife had recently learned her premarital estate had been traded away in the stock market. It would seem that it was the parties' mutual agreement that the property would be wife's property. Under the law of Maryland, even though property is titled in the name of one party or another party, it remains marital property and can be excluded by agreement of the parties. But the law is clear that to do that, and I just learned this, the agreement has to be specific not just that it's my sole and separate property but it is my sole and\n   separate property and will be excluded from marital property in the future. It has to be explicitly stated. It was not explicitly stated. I've seen no evidence that it was. So, under the cases of\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Golden versus Golden\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Falise versus Falise\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , the\n   property is now marital. However, it's titled in wife's name. Wife is the only person as the titled owner who can give an opinion as to its value and since the property was not appraised, I have to find that the value of that property is $600,000.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Judge also determined that the Log Jump property, titled as tenants by the entirety upon purchase, was marital property, without any discussion of whether any portion of it was excluded by valid agreement or any consideration of its financial underpinnings or source of funds\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   There is a house on Log Jump Trail, 11640 Log Jump Trail. It is titled tenants by the entireties. It is marital property. Its value is $1,568,200.00. There is a debt against\n   that property of $445,000. So the value of that property is ... $1,123,200.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The \"gift deed\" executed and recorded in 2005 between the McGeehans with respect to the Mason Neck property conveyed the property to Ms. McGeehan as her \"sole separate and equitable estate\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS DEED\n   </strong>\n   , made and entered into this 11th day of April, 2005, by and between Michael S.

Now, concerning the property on Embassy, there came a time when you sold that, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q. The D.C. property. And to the best of your recollection, approximately when was that home sold?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. To the best of my recollection, around it was the summertime, it was either 2012 or 2013. And then it went\n   into escrow, the proceeds, while I looked for an investment property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q. Now and do you remember what the approximate amount was from the proceeds of the sale of that property?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A. Approximately $440,000.00. Around $400,000.00, a little bit more than $400,000.00. We had purchased it for $200,000.00 something it was ... sold for about $650,000.00 and there was-and uh, yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Ms. McGeehan further testified that Farside was sold in 2014, and the proceeds of Embassy Park and Farside were used to purchase Log Jump:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q. And with regard to the purchase of your current property [Log Jump], were there uh, was any portion of the-well the property was sold, correct? The [Farside] property was sold?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A. Yes it was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q. And do you remember the approximate amount it was sold for?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A. It was approximately sold, approximately $800,000.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q. And when it was sold do you know how the proceeds were applied, if at all, to the purchase of the Log Jump property?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A. My husband told me that we were rolling all of the proceeds into the Log Jump property because the Log Jump property was about-it's $400,000.00 more expensive and that was the same amount of the $439,500.00 proceeds. So we were combining in the two ultimately to move them -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q. When you say combining the two, what two are you referring to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A. In other words, the [Embassy Park] property, the properties are listed on my-the [Embassy Park] property, the properties are listed on my-the [Embassy Park] and the 11777 [Farside] Road. Both of those properties were sold. And both my understanding and what my husband definitively told me is that the full sum of those two properties which were in my name, would be transferred\n   into the property to have a bigger house for the kids, you know, for us to live in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The issue raised by Ms. McGeehan before us is, thus, queued up. Did the 2005 Mason Neck gift deed from Mr. McGeehan act not only to transfer title to Ms. McGeehan but also to remove Mason Neck from consideration as marital property? Likewise, did the 2005 deeds from husband to wife relating to Embassy Park and Farside make them nonmarital property, such that their subsequent sales and contribution of their proceeds to the purchase of Log Jump render any portion of the value of Log Jump nonmarital?

He argued that there was no evidence of an explicit agreement to designate Mason Neck as \"nonmarital\" and that, not only did the trial judge expressly find that Log Jump had been purchased with co-mingled funds, but, even if Farside and Embassy Park were wife's nonmarital property, the\n   trial court had the discretion to ignore that fact in the determination of the monetary award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals agreed with Mr. McGeehan and relied on the trial court's rationale for its observation that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Although, as the trial court noted, the deed for the property and the oral agreement between the parties evidenced an intent to transfer the property into [Ms. McGeehan's] name alone, they did not express an intent to remove the Mason Neck property from marital property status or to exempt it from application of the Marital Property Act. The trial court, citing\n   <em>\n    Golden v. Golden\n   </em>\n   , carefully noted that an agreement must explicitly state that the property is to be excluded from marital property and that the agreement between [Ms. McGeehan] and Mr. McGeehan had no such statement. The trial court concluded that the testimony and the documents did not support a finding that the parties were contemplating the future division of property and wanted to remove the Mason Neck property from the scope of the Marital Property Act. Similarly, the trial court did not believe that Ms. [McGeehan's] use of gift funds to pay off the mortgage converted Mason Neck into nonmarital property. We see no error in the trial court's analysis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    McGeehan v. McGeehan\n   </em>\n   , September Term, 2015, No. 2445, at 13-14 (October 26, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Before us, Ms. McGeehan argues that the trial court misapplied\n   <em>\n    Golden\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Falise\n   </em>\n   to require that the deeds needed to specify that the properties would be nonmarital and that the words \"sole\" and \"separate\" as well as \"sole owner\" contained in the deeds were not sufficient to exclude the properties from marital property. Mr. McGeehan, on the other hand, maintains that the transfers of the three properties to Ms. McGeehan\n   did not constitute a valid agreement to exclude any portion of the value of the properties or proceeds from the sale of the properties from the marital cauldron, because the deeds and oral agreements were not specific enough to exempt them from marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The gravamen of the Maryland property division scheme upon divorce is an attempt to ensure that the value of both real and personal property is distributed in a fair and equitable manner.

The separation agreement in issue had provided that both spouses agreed to waive \"all rights, title, interest and claims which said parties might now have or may hereafter have as the husband, wife ... or otherwise, in and to any property, real or personal, that either of said parties may own or hereafter acquire. ...\"\n   <em>\n    Falise\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2264141\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/63/574/\">\n    63 Md.App. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   578 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2264141\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/63/574/\">\n    493 A.2d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Regardless of the parties' intentions, however, our intermediate appellate court emphasized that the clause in the separation agreement could not anticipate the passage of the Marital Property Act. As a result, then, the Marital Property Act was in play, and the absence of reclassification language of the property as nonmarital was determinative that a valid agreement to exclude did not exist:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   The only real significance of the Agreement is in the relationship of [the clause] to the tract of land in Howard County upon which the Falises constructed the home at issue,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the tract itself constitutes marital or nonmarital property.

Marital property is merely a term created by the legislature to describe the status of property acquired during the marriage, however titled (as defined in Md. Family Law Code Ann. \u00a7 8-201(e) (1984)), title to which may have given rise to a potential inequity, upon dissolution of the marriage. That inequity, conceptually, may be corrected via a different legislative creature called the \"monetary award.\" Thus, the only function of \"marital property\" is to form a base for a \"monetary award.\" The legislature never intended that either spouse could have a legal interest in the \"marital\n   property\" of the other since it merely intended to cure the title created inequity through the issuance of a \"monetary award.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2041165\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/319/466/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The holding in\n   <em>\n    Falise\n   </em>\n   then followed: \"In order to exclude property 'by valid agreement' from the reach of a monetary award, we believe that the parties must specifically provide that the subject property must be considered 'non marital' or in some other terms specifically exclude the property from the scope of the Marital Property Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2264141\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/63/574/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2264141\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/63/574/\">\n    at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2264141\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/63/574/\">\n    493 A.2d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Supplementing his words, appellant's conduct also reflected that he was offering to give up his marital rights to be free of his marital obligations, just as he was willing to give up property rights to be\n   free of his debts. The supportive evidence is ample. The note and the transcript speak with unmistakable clarity. And appellant's actions provide the exclamation point: he was fully aware of the parties' assets; his leaving was volitional, not coerced; aside from leaving without a hint of warning, so far as the record reveals, during the more than two years from departure to the filing of his answer to appellee's divorce action and his counter-bill for divorce, he never communicated with appellee; and, even more to the point, he neither inquired nor evidenced any concern about the property he now claims to be marital property. Furthermore, appellant himself testified that before leaving, among other things, he\n   decided his marriage was over and should be dissolved and, having made that decision, he left.

A spouse about to remarry may have gone through a tumultuous divorce; he or she may desire a premarital agreement to avoid the emotional and financial costs that\n   accompany divorce litigation over property and support rights, should another divorce occur.
