We disagree with the defendants' claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as found by the court, and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendants' claims. On April 1, 2013, Arroyo underwent a\n   vasectomy performed by Dr. Albertsen at the health center. Immediately after the procedure, Arroyo suffered pain that continued, unabated, for several days. Subsequently, on April 4, 2013, he went to the emergency room at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center (hospital), where it was discovered that his left testicle was necrotic\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   because of a lack of blood flow through the testicular artery. This required Arroyo to undergo an orchiectomy, or surgical removal of the testicle, that same day. The surgery was performed by Dr. Marlene A. Murphy-Setzko, a urologist at the hospital. This procedure resulted in discomfort and pain for Arroyo from protruding sutures and infection, which, in turn, required him to undergo further treatments over a period of five months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Sovereign immunity generally prevents a litigant from suing the state for money damages without its consent.

Thus, in order to obtain permission to sue the defendants for money damages, the plaintiffs filed a notice of claim on September 13, 2013, with the commissioner pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-147.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The notice was accompanied by a certificate of good faith, as required in medical malpractice claims brought against the state pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides in relevant part: \"In any claim alleging malpractice against the state, a state hospital or against a physician, surgeon ... or other licensed health care provider employed by the state, the attorney or party filing the\n   claim may submit a certificate of good faith to the Claims Commissioner in accordance with section 52-190a. If such a certificate is submitted, the Claims Commissioner shall authorize suit against the state on such claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In their notice of claim filed with the commissioner, the plaintiffs alleged that \"[d]uring the procedure Dr. Albertsen failed to identify, dissect and ligate the vas deferens, but instead he incorrectly dissected and ligated surrounding vascular structures thereby depriving, restricting and severing blood flow to [Arroyo's] left testicle.\" In an order dated November 6, 2013, the commissioner granted the plaintiffs permission to sue the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Subsequently, the plaintiffs commenced the present action against the defendants in Superior Court on January 29, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The complaint, which was accompanied by a certificate of good faith as required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   contained two counts, the first sounding in medical malpractice on behalf of Arroyo and the second sounding in loss of consortium on behalf of Marie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Count one mirrored the language used in the notice of claim filed with the commissioner, alleging that \"Dr. Albertsen failed to identify, dissect and ligate the vas deferens, but instead he incorrectly dissected and ligated surrounding vascular structures, thereby depriving, restricting and severing blood flow to the plaintiff's left testicle.\" It also alleged that Dr. Albertsen was negligent in one or more of six ways, those being that he failed \"[1] to properly identify the anatomy of the testicle, both before and during the procedure, by all means available to him, including palpation and visualization, to ensure that he adequately identified the spermatic cord and the vas deferens prior to his attempt to dissect the vas deferens ... [2] to properly isolate and free the vas deferens from the surrounding anatomical structures prior to attempts to dissect the vas deferens ... [3] to properly confirm that he had, in fact, identified the vas deferens by all means available to him, including palpation and visualization, before his attempts to dissect the vas deferens ... [4] to dissect and ligate the vas deferens, and instead he incorrectly dissected and ligated surrounding blood vessels and vascular structures, thereby depriving, restricting and severing blood flow to the left testicle ... [5] to timely and properly realize that he had, in fact, failed to dissect the vas deferens, but instead had dissected vascular structures in the testicle, and proceeded to conclude the procedure and discharge the patient from the facility; and ... [6] to properly respond to and investigate the patient's repeated complaints of unusual and inordinate pain, both during and following the procedure in question, which investigation in all likelihood would have led him to the realization that he had failed to sever and dissect the appropriate vas deferens and instead severed and dissected vascular structures necessary for the continued viability of the left testicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The case progressed to pretrial discovery. During this time, the plaintiffs disclosed Dr. Michael Brodherson\n   as their expert witness, and the defendants disclosed Dr. Wayne Glazier as their expert witness. The parties deposed both experts prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thereafter, on November 4, 2015, the trial commenced. The court heard testimony from several witnesses, including Dr. Albertsen, Dr. Brodherson, and Dr. Glazier. The evidence showed that during Arroyo's vasectomy, Dr. Albertsen failed to\n   properly identify, dissect, and ligate the vas deferens in the left testicle and, instead, dissected and ligated a section of \"vascular structures.\" There was no disagreement that the blood flow to the left testicle had been obstructed at the time that Arroyo was seen by Dr. Murphy-Setzko at the hospital on April 4, 2013, and that the loss of blood flow caused the necrosis of Arroyo's testicle. Rather, the parties disputed the cause of the injury. The plaintiffs argued that the injury to the testicular artery occurred during the vasectomy on April 1, 2013, and the defendants argued that testicular torsion\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   caused the loss of blood flow, meaning that the injury occurred sometime after the vasectomy, between April 1 and 4, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a short memorandum of decision dated November 19, 2015, the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. Specifically, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had established by a fair preponderance of the evidence that Dr. Albertsen was negligent in his treatment of Arroyo in that he \"deviated from the standard of care of a board certified urologist in not isolating the vas deferens and [thereby] injuring the testicular artery to the left testicle of [Arroyo] during his performance of a vasectomy....\" This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendants claim for the first time on appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the court improperly rendered judgment for the plaintiffs on a theory of liability materially different from that which was alleged in their notice of claim filed with the commissioner and, thus, from that which they had received a waiver of sovereign immunity. Specifically, the defendants argue that in alleging that Dr. Albertsen \"dissected and ligated ... vascular structures, thereby ... severing blood flow to [Arroyo's] left testicle,\" the \"vascular structure\" to which the plaintiffs must have been referring in their notice of claim was the testicular artery because the only \"vascular structure\" that could have resulted in a lack of blood flow to the testicle was the testicular artery. The defendants then reason that because the plaintiffs' theory of liability presented at trial was that Dr. Albertsen dissected and ligated a\n   <em>\n    vein\n   </em>\n   , not the testicular artery, and injured the nearby testicular artery in turn by unintentionally\n   <em>\n    cauterizing\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   it, the plaintiffs did not obtain a waiver of sovereign immunity for the claim presented to the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The principle that the state cannot be sued without its consent, or sovereign immunity, is well established under our case law.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Morneau\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20Conn.%20App.%20237\">\n    150 Conn.App. at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20A.3d%201003\">\n    90 A.3d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In doing so, the defendants principally rely on\n   <em>\n    Morneau\n   </em>\n   for support.\n   In\n   <em>\n    Morneau\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff filed a notice of claim with the commissioner, seeking to sue the state, among other defendants, for claims grounded in the alleged improper conduct of state marshals.

We are unconvinced for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First,\n   <em>\n    Morneau\n   </em>\n   involved an adjudication by the commissioner as to whether, in his or her\n   <em>\n    opinion\n   </em>\n   , a particular claim is \"just and equitable\" pursuant to \u00a7 4-160 (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such an adjudication necessarily depends on the nature\n   of the specific claim at hand and the facts that support it. In contrast, the present case, being a medical malpractice action, is subject to \u00a7 4-160 (b), which, as previously discussed, strips the commissioner of his discretionary decision-making power to authorize suit for such claims against the state if a certificate of good faith in accordance with \u00a7 52-190a has been submitted.\n   <em>\n    D'Eramo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5708636\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/273/610/#p622\">\n    273 Conn. at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=872%20A.2d%20408\">\n    872 A.2d 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is to say, the commissioner is\n   <em>\n    obligated\n   </em>\n   , without engaging in any discovery or adjudicatory processes, to authorize suit in all such cases.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=872%20A.2d%20408\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, the plaintiffs properly filed a timely notice with the commissioner, sought permission from the commissioner to pursue a medical malpractice action against the defendants, and attached a certificate of good faith. By virtue of the way in which this state's system for obtaining a waiver of sovereign immunity functions, the commissioner was, therefore, required to grant the plaintiffs' motion for permission to sue under the circumstances, regardless of how the plaintiffs precisely worded the basis of their medical malpractice claim in their notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In fact, the plaintiffs theoretically could have alleged more generally in their notice of claim that \"Dr. Albertsen negligently\n   performed a vasectomy,\" and, as long as they submitted a good faith certificate, the commissioner would have been obligated to grant a waiver of sovereign immunity to sue. The fact that the plaintiffs' actual notice of claim here included\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   details, which, as discussed further herein, did not conflict with the theory pursued at trial, is not fatal to their case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Furthermore, in our view, the defendants' reading of\n   <em>\n    Morneau\n   </em>\n   is overly broad. Specifically, the defendants point to language in\n   <em>\n    Morneau\n   </em>\n   that provides that the plaintiff \"needed to include information that would clarify\n   <em>\n    the nature of\n   </em>\n   the waiver sought and ensure that the\n   [commissioner] ... would have an understanding of\n   <em>\n    the nature of\n   </em>\n   that waiver.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Morneau\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20Conn.%20App.%20237\">\n    150 Conn.App. at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20A.3d%201003\">\n    90 A.3d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, this concern about apprising the commissioner of \"the nature of the waiver\" has no applicability because of the mandatory obligation of the commissioner to grant the waiver in all medical malpractice actions that are accompanied by a good faith certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, putting aside any comparisons with\n   <em>\n    Morneau\n   </em>\n   , we simply do not agree with the defendants' argument that the basis of the claim contained in the notice filed with the commissioner is materially different from the basis of their claim at trial. As previously stated, the plaintiffs' notice of claim alleged that \"Dr. Albertsen failed to identify, dissect and ligate the vas deferens, but instead he incorrectly dissected and ligated surrounding vascular structures thereby depriving, restricting and severing blood flow to [Arroyo's] left testicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At trial, the court admitted the pathology reports from the health center and the hospital that showed that Dr. Albertsen definitively had dissected and ligated a \"section of muscular structure consistent with sections of a medium size vein\"/\"[p]ortion of [b]enign [v]ascular [c]onnective [t]issue\" instead of the vas deferens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, that portion of the notice alleging that Dr. Albertsen incorrectly dissected and ligated \"vascular structures\" was, in fact, presented to the court. Moreover, the plaintiffs argued at trial that \"[Dr. Albertsen] proceeded to cut around [the vascular] structures with blunt and sharp dissection and cauterization,\" and \"[i]n so doing, he injured the testicular artery with the cautery,\" thereby cutting off the blood flow to the left testicle. In other words, they argued that Albertsen's act of mistakenly dissecting and ligating the vascular\n   structures eventually resulted in the loss of blood flow to Arroyo's left testicle, as they also alleged in the notice. Accordingly, the plaintiffs' theory of liability in their notice accurately sums up the theory of liability presented at trial, albeit in a truncated manner that omits any express mention of cauterization in the causal chain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Admittedly, the basis of the claim in the notice to the commissioner was not as particularized as it might have been, but this fact is unsurprising because the plaintiffs did not have the benefit of months of discovery prior to drafting it. In other words, because discovery had not yet been allowed, the plaintiffs were essentially hamstrung at the outset with how detailed they could be in setting forth their medical malpractice claim.

More specifically, they argue that the judgment should be reversed on the ground that the plaintiffs offered insufficient evidence on the issue of causation, being that the evidence they did offer of the cauterization theory was merely \" 'surmise or conjecture' ....\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history guide our resolution of this claim. As previously discussed, a substantial part of the evidence presented by both parties at trial came in the form of expert testimony from Dr. Brodherson, the plaintiffs' expert, and Dr. Glazier, the defendants' expert. Both experts testified on the issue of causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Dr. Brodherson began his testimony by explaining how a vasectomy is performed. In general, the surgery is designed to prevent the flow of sperm through the vas deferens, which is the duct that conveys the sperm, produced in the testis, from the epididymis to the urethra. First, the physician must locate and identify the\n   vas deferens through the skin of the testicle by manual palpation. Once he or she has done so, the physician makes a small incision in the skin to access the structure. Before the physician can dissect and ligate\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   the vas deferens, however, he must isolate, or \"strip,\" the vas deferens from all of the surrounding structures, such as the veins and the testicular artery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   This occasionally results in bleeding, which the physician controls through either cauterizing or tying the vas deferens. Once the vas deferens is successfully isolated, the physician then dissects, or cuts, the vas deferens in two places, while at the same time removing a small sample to send to pathology for testing to confirm that the correct anatomical structure was cut. Thereafter, the physician will ligate each of the cut ends of the vas deferens, that is, either \"tie it, clip it, however the doctor wants to do it, just to make sure that it's permanent,\" before placing it back into the testicle and closing up the incision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The parties' experts generally agreed that during Arroyo's vasectomy, Dr. Albertsen engaged in the previously mentioned procedure, except that instead of isolating, dissecting, and ligating the vas deferens, he performed these procedures on a portion of \"vascular structures,\" i.e., a vein. Dr. Brodherson testified that, generally speaking, if blood flow to one of the multiple veins in the testicle becomes impeded, the testicle is not at risk of necrosis because of the many other veins that are still able to carry blood from the testicle. In contrast, if the blood flow through the testicular artery becomes impeded, the testicle will eventually die\n   because this artery provides the organ with all of its essential nutrients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Despite their agreement on the foregoing principles, the parties' experts disagreed on a critical point: how the lack of blood flow to Arroyo's left testicle, as reflected in the hospital's April 4, 2013 ultrasound results, occurred. On this issue, Dr. Brodherson testified: \"[W]hen you're getting the vas [deferens] isolated, you've got\n   to do some damage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   And when you cut it, you have to clean up the damage. ... [B]ut [Dr. Albertsen] wasn't isolating the vas [deferens]; he was isolating a medium-sized vein. And that is where he got into trouble. ... [T]he vein and the arteries certainly run together [in the same sheath]. And in the process of isolating a vein, I'm sure some bleeding was provoked, which we expect. ... And in the process of that, I'm sure anything bleeding in the area was cauterized to prevent-to effect hemostasis, which he says he did at the end of the procedure. And in one of the cauterization procedures, I'm sure the [testicular] artery was cauterized. ... And there would have been no reason in his mind to think that was the testicular artery because he believed he was working on the vas [deferens].\" (Footnote added.)\n   Dr. Brodherson explained that the testicular artery is more at risk if the physician is working on a vein instead of the vas deferens, stating: \"When we do varicocele surgery and we remove veins, which is a procedure done for infertility, we use a dopplar in the operating room to make sure that it's a vein and not an artery. That's how delicate these things are. You can't really see them. And it's very possible to cut an artery or to sever an artery. ... [W]e use the dopplar to identify the [testicular artery]. So, of course, if he had a dopplar-but he didn't know he was on a vein. He was dissecting a vein. He wasn't dissecting a vas [deferens]. Completely different structure.\" Because of Dr. Albertsen's wrong assumption about the structure he was working on, Dr. Brodherson reasoned that \"he destroyed vital tissue because he was in the wrong part of that tiny area. ... [T]he vas [deferens], well, that's a different neighborhood. And the artery unfortunately took a hit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On the other hand, Dr. Glazier testified that the injury to Arroyo's testicular artery could not have occurred during the vasectomy on April 1, 2013, because the reported blood loss was too small and that the injury was the result of torsion that had occurred \"a day or two following his vasectomy.\" Specifically, he testified that if Dr. Albertsen had destroyed the testicular artery during the vasectomy, there would have been \"[s]ignificantly more\" blood loss than the estimated \"less than one milliliter\" that he reported in his notes, because although the testicular artery is \"not a huge artery,\" \"[i]t's big enough. And if the patient had normal blood pressure, the pulsatile nature of the artery would break through the cautery seal and the patient will continue to bleed; if not at that moment, certainly within a short period of time.\" In contrast, Dr. Brodherson testified regarding the blood loss that a physician might not know if he had cauterized or otherwise injured an artery\n   because of its small size and the fact that it may go into spasm, or \"close down [its blood flow] for a second,\" upon any slight manipulation by the physician.\n   Dr. Glazier further opined that the necrosis of the left testicle must have been the result of torsion, which \"is a sudden loss of blood supply to the testicles usually by [the] twisting of the cord structures right above the testicle so that the blood flow is progressively diminished and subsequently cut off,\" that must have occurred sometime after the vasectomy on April 1, 2013, and before Arroyo went to the hospital on April 4, 2013. Dr. Brodherson testified, however, that he was \"[a]bsolutely 100 percent\" sure that this theory was not accurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   More specifically, Dr. Brodherson testified that if torsion had occurred, the twisting of the cord would have killed \"everything, the whole scrotal contents\" of the left testicle, including the blood supply to the epididymis, a coiled structure on the top of the testicle that is a conduit for sperm. Because Dr. Murphy-Setzko, the physician who performed the orchiectomy on Arroyo, noted in her surgical pathology report and testified during her deposition that she observed Arroyo's epididymis as appearing \"tan to pink and soft\" and, thus, healthy on April 4, 2013, Dr. Brodherson reasoned that the blood supply to the epididymis was not affected by the injury, and, therefore, torsion could be ruled out as a potential cause of the necrosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Dr. Brodherson also pointed to several other factors that informed this opinion, including (1) Dr. Murphy-Setzko's operating notes expressly stating that the ultrasound suggested \"lack of blood flow versus torsion,\" (2) her deposition testimony that she \"did not see torsion\" in the testicle,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) the age of Arroyo. With\n   regard to Arroyo's age, she stated that torsion is \"out of the age group. I mean, it would be very unusual for a thirty-eight year old man, or forty, thirty-nine, whatever he was at the time. They don't get torsion. ... I mean, you may get one in a million with torsion, but then you're just assuming this is the guy [who] just had a vasectomy and got torsion. And, you know, it's pretty coincidental. As you say, counselor, it stresses credulity. It's just ridiculous. Maybe one in-say, one in twenty, thirty, 40,000. So, you're telling us that this guy, poor gentleman not only just had a vasectomy, but then he-they're trotting out this diagnosis that doesn't even happen as a second coincidence? It just doesn't fit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We next set forth the applicable standard of review and guiding principles of law for this claim. \"Because the ... claim challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, which is based on the court's factual findings, the proper standard of review is whether, on the basis of the evidence, the court's finding ... was clearly erroneous. ... In other words, a court's finding of fact is clearly erroneous and its conclusions drawn from that finding lack sufficiency when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. ... Moreover, we repeatedly have held that [i]n a [proceeding] tried before a court, the trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony. ...

We are unpersuaded by this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, Dr. Brodherson's testimony on causation relied on substantial evidence\n   that was largely unchallenged by the defendants. Specifically, it was undisputed that Dr. Albertsen mistook a vein for the vas deferens during the vasectomy, as proven by the results of the two\n   separate pathology reports admitted at trial. It was also uncontroverted by the results of the ultrasound performed at the hospital on April 4, 2013, that there was no blood supply to the left testicle, which is \"tantamount to testicular death,\" and, as Dr. Brodherson testified, the testicle's main source of nutrients via blood supply is the testicular artery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Furthermore, the plaintiffs showed that as a result of Dr. Albertsen's misidentification of the vas deferens, he was working perilously close to the testicular artery. The defendants assert in their brief that Dr. Brodherson \"provided no explanation as to why mere proximity to the veins was sufficient to conclude that the artery was injured.\" To the contrary, Dr. Brodherson explained several times during his testimony why the testicular artery is significantly more at risk if one is performing surgery on a vein as opposed to the vas deferens, emphasizing that the veins and artery run close together in the same sheath in the spermatic cord. He testified that the artery is extremely delicate and that it is so small, \"[y]ou can't really see [it].\" He also described in detail the highly specialized piece of equipment, i.e., a dopplar, that physicians utilize when they are operating on the veins near the artery for other types of urologic procedures, such as a varicocelectomy. Dr. Brodherson explained how the dopplar helps physicians to identify and visualize the artery so that they are able to protect it from dissection and cauterization during these procedures, and stated that Dr. Albertsen, in the present case, essentially \"[performed] a varicocelectomy without having a dopplar,\" a very precarious act because of the risk of loss of blood flow posed to the testicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Ultimately, Dr. Brodherson supported his opinion on causation through the process of \"differential diagnosis,\" which is \"a method of diagnosis that involves a determination of which of a variety of possible conditions is the probable cause of an individual's symptoms,\n   often by a process of elimination.\"\n   <em>\n    DiLieto\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    County Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Group, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088690\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/297/105/\">\n    297 Conn. 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 114 n.13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=998%20A.2d%20730\">\n    998 A.2d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). The only two possible causes of Arroyo's necrotic left testicle that were offered by the experts at trial were the cauterization theory testified to by Dr. Brodherson and the torsion theory. As previously discussed herein, Dr. Brodherson considered and rejected the latter as a possible cause of the injury based soundly on the evidence that the epidydimis contained blood flow at the time Dr. Murphy-Setzko performed the orchiectomy on April 4, 2013. As Dr. Brodherson testified, Arroyo's healthy epidydimis \"is the nail that ... shuts the coffin. Because the epididymis would have been dead had it been torsion.\" In other words, Dr. Brodherson established the causal relation between the injury and its later physical effects \"by his deduction by the process of eliminating causes other than the traumatic agency,\" as is permitted by our case law.

Dr. Brodherson's testimony, however, refuted that there always will be significant bleeding if the artery is injured because, in some cases, the artery will be in spasm, and,\n   thus, less blood will be flowing through it. The court was free to credit Dr. Brodherson's explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Dr. Glazier also opined that the most likely explanation was torsion because there was no indication during the orchiectomy that the artery was severed, as there was no indication that Dr. Murphy-Setzko had observed\n   the testicular artery at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast to this, however, Dr. Brodherson testified that the fact that Dr. Murphy-Setzko stated that she could not find the artery during the procedure is \"a complete diversion\" and did not surprise him \"[b]ecause it had been previously injured, cauterized. And-first of all, why would you look for it? And second of all, you're never going to find it. The thing died four days ago. It's retracted in. It's black like everything else.
