The board concluded that evidence in the record found persuasive and credible by the commissioner supported that determination. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the commissioner improperly failed to (1) apply credible evidence in accordance with the applicable law, specifically General Statutes \u00a7 31-349, and (2) perform an analysis of the plaintiff's total disability consistent with the precedent in\n   <em>\n    Osterlund\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1618822\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/135/498/\">\n    135 Conn. 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20A.2d%20363\">\n    66 A.2d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1949), and, therefore, the board improperly affirmed the decision of the commissioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After careful review of the record, including the board's well reasoned decision, and the parties' appellate briefs, we conclude that the plaintiff's claims on appeal are without merit. The board properly affirmed\n   the commissioner's determination that the plaintiff's chronic and degenerative medical condition was not caused\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   by his compensable toe injury. \"[O]ur role is to determine whether the review [board's] decision results from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them .... [Therefore, we ask] whether the commissioner's conclusion can be sustained by the underlying facts.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Jodlowski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stanley Works\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487859\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/741/#p108\">\n    169 Conn.App. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 108,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487859\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/741/#p108\">\n    147 A.3d 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). In this case, the answer to that question is yes, the commissioner's conclusion can be sustained by such facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The decision of the Workers' Compensation Review Board is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    The defendants to this appeal are the named defendant, CVS, which was the plaintiff's employer, and Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc., the insurance administrator.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
