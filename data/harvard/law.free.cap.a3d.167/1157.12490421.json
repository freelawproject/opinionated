The plaintiff, Joseph Cohen, brought this action against the defendants, Robert M. Meyers and Robert M. Meyers, Inc. (RMMI), stemming from a contract for the construction of a new home to be built by RMMI on a lot of land that Cohen had owned for many years prior to entering into said contract. Cohen's nine count revised complaint alleged the following claims against Meyers: breach of contract, fraud,\n   unjust enrichment, violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., statutory theft in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-564, and conversion. Cohen alleged the following claims against RMMI: breach of contract, rescission, and violation of CUTPA. The defendants filed an answer denying Cohen's allegations or leaving him to his proof, set forth various special defenses, and asserted counterclaims for breach of contract, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Cohen denied the special defenses advanced by the defendants in response to his complaint. Cohen also denied or left the defendants to their proof as to their counterclaims and asserted special defenses to those counterclaims, claiming abandonment and fraud as to the breach of contract counterclaim, and truth and privilege as to the defamation counterclaim. The defendants denied Cohen's special defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After a bench trial, the court,\n   <em>\n    D. Sheridan, J.\n   </em>\n   , filed a memorandum of decision in which it found in favor of Cohen on his CUTPA claim against RMMI, and awarded damages on that claim in the amount of $54,750. The court rejected all of Cohen's additional claims against the defendants. The court found in favor of RMMI on its counterclaim for breach of contract, but found that it had failed to prove damages resulting from that breach, and thus awarded it nominal damages in the amount of $1. The court found for Meyers on his defamation claim and awarded him noneconomic damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found in favor of Cohen on the defendants' counterclaim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress. The\n   court declined to award punitive damages to either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, Cohen challenges the court's judgment in favor of Meyers, individually, on his claims for fraud and violation of CUTPA, asserting that the court erred in declining to pierce RMMI's corporate veil. Cohen\n   also claims that the court improperly held him liable for defamation because his speech was protected by the first amendment, he did not make any of the allegedly defamatory statements against Meyers with actual malice, the court employed the wrong legal standard in determining the issue of malice, and each of his allegedly defamatory statements was substantially true even though the burden of proof was assertedly on Meyers to prove that they were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In their cross appeal, the defendants first claim that the court erred in awarding damages on the plaintiff's CUTPA claim against RMMI because he failed to prove that he suffered any actual loss or injury as a result of the CUTPA violation. Meyers also claims that the court erred in failing to award punitive damages on his defamation claim and in rejecting his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court found the following relevant facts. \"In October, 1999, Cohen bought a parcel of undeveloped land within the town of Chester ... known as 11 Kings Highway, with the intention of someday building a single-family home upon the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"At the time of Cohen's purchase of ... 11 Kings Highway, a 'driveway' surfaced with sand and crushed gravel and protected by adjacent drainage swales, had been in place since 1987. When Cohen bought the lot in 1999, his 'understanding' was that the land was 'a fully buildable lot,' with approvals in place. Cohen also referred in his testimony to the property as an 'approved building lot.' The only additional permit or approval he understood he needed prior to commencing construction was for a septic system, which would require a satisfactory percolation test. Cohen testified that, based on discussions with the Chester zoning enforcement officer, which occurred in 1999 and again in 2002, he\n   continued to believe that-except for septic-all approvals were in place and he 'had no concerns' about his ability to build a house on the property using the existing driveway for access and the existing drainage swales for erosion control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"In 2005, the town of Chester Planning and Zoning Commission adopted new driveway regulations. While the existing driveway on the 11 Kings Highway property in Chester met the town's driveway requirements in place from 1987 to 2005, it did not comply with the requirements adopted in 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"In April, 2009, Cohen undertook to obtain a percolation test and septic design for the property, which was later approved. Around the same time, Cohen hired designer Brian Buckley to prepare plans for a single-family home to be built on his property in Chester. Buckley provided Cohen several names of general contractors to consider for the construction of the home, one of which was RMMI. At that time, in April, 2009, RMMI possessed a valid new home construction contractor ('NHCC') registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Robert M. Meyers is the president and sole shareholder of RMMI. At all times RMMI acted through Meyers, and Meyers has admitted that he had 'complete control and domination of all business and fiscal policies and procedures' of the corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Beginning in April, 2009, there was an exchange of e-mail correspondence between Cohen and Meyers, on behalf of\n   RMMI, which continued sporadically through January, 2010. During that time period, on October 1, 2009, RMMI's NHCC registration lapsed. Additional e-mails were exchanged from January 19, 2010 through July 28, 2010. During this time period, the parties worked out the basic aspects of their agreement, and RMMI provided a draft of a contract to Cohen. Of course, RMMI did not possess a valid NHCC registration\n   while making any of these communications or conducting these negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"In the last days of July, 2010, it became apparent that Cohen prepared to move forward with the building of the house. In preparation for the anticipated contract with Cohen, Meyers, on behalf of RMMI, took several actions. First, he reached an agreement with Cohen that the additional costs of land-clearing beyond that specified in their proposed written agreement would be split fifty-fifty. Cohen paid the sum of $1250 directly to the contractor, Stanley Burr, for one half the additional cost of the site-clearing cost of the property. Second, on July 30, 2010, Meyers renewed RMMI's NHCC registration. Third, on July 30, 2010, Meyers opened a commercial checking account at Citizens Bank in the name of RMMI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"On August 2, 2010, Cohen and RMMI signed the written 'Agreement,' which is appended to the complaint and was exhibit 1 at the trial. The first paragraph of the agreement clearly and explicitly states that the contracting parties are Cohen and RMMI:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"AGREEMENT\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"This Agreement, made on this 2nd day of Aug. 2010, by and between Joseph M.

The property is an approved building lot and the builder will be able to obtain a building permit upon application and without having to comply with any special requirements of Planning and Zoning, inland-wetlands commission, or any other governmental or quasigovernmental agency having jurisdiction over this property except as set forth in this agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"At the time of the signing of the agreement, Cohen issued a check to RMMI for $50,000 in accordance with the 'PRICE AND PAYMENT SCHEDULE' of the agreement. The check was deposited into the Citizens Bank commercial checking account that had been opened a few days earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"Prior to entering into the agreement, RMMI did not provide the plaintiff a written notice pursuant to the New Home Construction Contractors Act [ (NHCCA) ],\n   Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 20-417d (A), advising [Cohen] to (a) contact the Department of Consumer Protection regarding the contractor's registration status; (b) to inquire into whether any complaints had been filed against the contractor; and (c) to request a list of consumers of new homes constructed to completion by the contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"At the time the agreement was signed, RMMI had been the subject of new home construction complaints to the Department of Consumer Protection ... in 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"After signing the contract and receiving the first payment, RMMI commenced work at the site, including land-clearing, blasting, excavation, and placement of temporary forms. When laying out and excavating for the foundation footings for the house, RMMI rotated or 'pivoted' the axis of the foundation to avoid a rock outcropping. When Cohen learned of this, he expressed great concern, since the orientation of the house had been precisely planned so as to maximize the view from the house over the Connecticut River valley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"On August 31, 2010, after receiving Cohen's concerns and complaints about the rotation of the foundation, Meyers informed Cohen in an e-mail that, 'Joe, if you want the foundation moved back, I will call the concrete contractor and have him move it back.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"On August 10, 2010, Meyers went to the Chester town hall to file an application for a building permit. The Chester zoning enforcement officer, Judith R. Brown, informed Meyers that a building permit could not be issued because a driveway permit was required in order to obtain a building permit. Brown also required that Meyers file applications for a zoning permit and a driveway permit. A great deal of communication between Cohen and various town officials ensued, with Cohen pleading his case to all involved that the driveway\n   should be 'grandfathered' and he should not be required to obtain a driveway permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"Despite Cohen's efforts, on September 1, 2010, the application for a driveway permit was denied because it did not meet the driveway standards set forth in the 2005 driveway regulation. On September 7, 2010, after meeting with the town engineer, Cohen sent an e-mail to the various town officials requesting a waiver of the driveway regulations. On September 13, 2010, Cohen filed a formal application for the driveway waiver with the Board of Selectmen of the town of Chester.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"On September 21, 2010, the driveway waiver application was considered at a Board of Selectmen meeting that was attended by Cohen and Meyers. The waiver was denied pending information regarding turning radius requirements for emergency vehicles. On October 5, 2010, the waiver of the driveway regulations was approved at a meeting of the Board of Selectmen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"On October 6, 2010, [Brown] wrote a letter to Cohen stating that the waiver was approved, but that before he could start driveway improvements, he was to arrange a preconstruction meeting with the driveway contractor, herself, and the town engineer, pay a $25 application fee, post a driveway bond in the amount of $1500, and provide a certificate of insurance prior to the issuance of a zoning permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"On October 8, 2010, Cohen sent an e-mail to Meyers, which attached a detailed list of 'issues for discussion' before restarting construction on the project. The list included driveway issues, building permit 'problems,' and various other items that Cohen claimed had increased the project cost by 5 to 10 percent. Cohen's list suggested a variety of paths to 'move forward,' ranging from shutting down construction temporarily or permanently, to completing the construction as quickly as possible, to entering into a new contract. In reply to\n   Cohen's e-mail, Meyers stated that he was not responsible for the delay or the permit or driveway issues, and declared that Cohen was in breach of the contract, stating: '[t]his delay is costing me time and money. Reminder: You represented to me by contract that you have [an] approved building lot and that I should not have to be caused a delay from the town government. ... Without a building permit, approved site plan and adjusted contract, this job is [stopped] and you remain in breach of contract.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"For the next week, Cohen and Meyers continued to exchange e-mails blaming each other for various delays, discrepancies, problems, and cost overruns on the project. Cohen attempted to get Meyers to meet with the town and restart the building process, but Meyers refused to do so unless he could move forward with the existing contract 'without issues.' He interpreted Cohen's insistence on discussing topics such as delay and increased cost as 'nothing more than you trying to get me to pay for your misfortune.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"On October 25, 2010, Cohen sent a certified letter to Meyers stating that the contract was 'under review' and directing him not to perform any additional work,\n   make any expenditures, or order materials or services related to 11 Kings Highway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"On November 10, 2010, [Brown], the Chester zoning enforcement officer, returned the building permit application and checks to Meyers because she had been advised by Cohen that 'he will not be going forward with his plans to build at 11 Kings Highway at this time.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"Ultimately, on December 1, 2010, Cohen notified RMMI via certified letter that the contract was terminated for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"Cohen then embarked upon a relentless pursuit of his grievances against Meyers that has continued\n   unabated to the present. The catalog of e-mails, letters, newspaper articles, and other writings which memorialize long and bitter conflict is impressive in its dimensions and in its vitriol. What follows are excerpts which are particularly relevant to the issues in this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"On January 17, 2011, in an e-mail to Mr. Meyers, Mr. Cohen stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \" 'Please share the following with your wife and your attorney: Time is up-this week I begin filing formal complaints and notifying officials in all Connecticut River Valley Durham and surrounding towns about my dispute with you. I also intend to [take out] an ad in the Middletown Press and other publications (I am 100 [percent] serious). When I call you out as a liar, cheat, thief and lawbreaker-it will all be true! When your wife comes home from work at Middlesex Memorial saying she is humiliated; when your children ask what is wrong with you; when your neighbors (who I contact by mail) start staring at you strangely, you will know you blew your last chance to fix things. And every building official and state official in the Durham-Meriden-East Haddam corridor will have your number. As for being a licensed building inspector-I doubt it since I will track you and make sure every community gets a full accounting of your track record .... I will be visiting officials with formal letters of complaint in East Haddam, Durham and Meriden as soon as possible. You are going to be under the gun of officials and the public. ... [You have] left me no choice but to make you pay for it.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \"On January 18, 2011, Mr. Cohen began exchanging e-mails with George P. Gombossy, a syndicated consumer columnist for numerous Connecticut newspapers. Cohen told Gombossy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \" 'thanks for getting involved in this. meyers' llc includes his wife, so I am going to put her name and work affiliation in everything I do going forward. i have a feeling when middlesex memorial sees their name getting trashed with an employee's they may put the screws to her.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"(Lowercase in original.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"On January 19, 2011, Cohen sent another e-mail to Meyers, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \" 'Your stupidity is overwhelming. I have tried to be nice to you because you are a small man without much of a life. What little you have is about to be diminished.... When you are sitting around with no work or selling light bulbs at the local store, remember you blew any chance you had to salvage your reputation.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"In the wake of these e-mails, as he suggested he would, Cohen began communicating with various state and local officials regarding Meyers. He also, as he suggested he would, began to include Meyers' wife, Christine A. Meyers, as part of his communications and requests for information. Cohen justified his efforts directed at Christine Meyers because she was a secretary of RMMI and Meyers' 'business partner.' The former is true, but as to the\n   latter, no competent evidence was submitted as to any active participation by Mrs. Meyers in any of the business affairs of RMMI, or in the construction project at 11 Kings Highway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \"On January 19, 2011, Cohen forwarded a Freedom of Information Act ('FOIA') [ General Statutes \u00a7 1-200 et seq. ] request to Richard McManus, building official for Durham (copied to Laura Francis, first selectman), requesting any and all building permits or other permits for construction or renovations issued or requested by Robert M. Meyers, Robert M. Meyers Inc., LLC, Robert\n   Meyers, and Christine A. Meyers. Thereafter, Cohen met personally with McManus. Cohen also met with Keith Darin, then building official for East Haddam, to review files of houses built by RMMI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \"Cohen made a FOIA request directed to the Department of Consumer Protection, asking for all complaints against RMMI and Meyers. On January 31, 2011, Cohen filed a complaint with the Department of Consumer Protection related to the construction at 11 Kings Highway in Chester, but also alleging that Meyers performed new home construction, while not registered, at 24 Alger Road, in East Haddam.... [Cohen] began to exchange e-mails with Terence Zehnder, the investigator for the Department of Consumer Protection, and in a March 29, 2011 e-mail to Zehnder, stated, 'Meyers is stubborn, not smart, arrogant and has gotten away with pulling crap for years.' To resolve [Cohen's] complaint, RMMI provided an assurance of voluntary compliance to the commissioner of the Department of Consumer Protection and paid a civil penalty of $250 on April 19, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"On January 3, 2012, Cohen sent a three page letter to the Middlefield Board of Selectmen, stating, '[i]t is my belief [Meyers] is a liar, cheat, commits fraud, steals, is not competent as a builder, and lacks proper respect for the law. Robert Meyers has ... [w]orked (in 2009/ 2010) as a builder while not registered/licensed (a criminal offense) ...

Meyers has disdain for the law, the court system and the truth. ... [I]t is my experience and\n   belief Robert M. Meyers is a dishonest, deceitful, incompetent contractor.' Cohen thereafter went to a Middlefield Board of Selectmen meeting to read aloud the content of his letter, and that appearance was reported by the press. On January 13, 2012, an article appeared in the 'Town Times' headlined, 'Chester Resident Complains about Middlefield Building Inspector at Selectmen's Meeting,' reporting that Cohen stated that 'Meyers does not have respect for the law, authority or the truth and felt he was fundamentally dishonest and deceitful.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \"On September 7, 2012, Cohen sent a letter to Joseph V.

Rubenstein, commissioner of the Department of Consumer Protection. In the letter, Cohen stated: 'I believe Mr. Meyers may have obtained his building inspector's license under false pretenses and/or is not qualified to be licensed by the state of Connecticut.' Cohen also stated that Meyers was guilty of 'a serious criminal violation' when he built and sold a new house at 24 Alger Road in East Haddam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In the letter, Cohen states that Meyers is 'an alleged liar, cheat and thief-an admitted criminal who violated state building and consumer protection laws'; and [that] Meyers is 'something of a Jekyll and Hyde personality: Charming until he gets your money, then a sociopath who enjoys taunting and threatening in response to legitimate questions about business practices, competence and integrity.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \"On September 27, 2012, Meyers was disclosed as an expert witness who was expected to be called at the trial of this case.

Mr. Meyers may also give his opinion that the town of Chester did not have any governing rules or regulations which would have resulted in a violation of the work done at the property prior to the issuance of a building permit by the town of Chester.' ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \"Upon learning of this expert disclosure, Cohen began a new, more aggressive and more strident round of communications with state and local officials, purportedly 'to ascertain information related to Cohen's prosecution in this case.' ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \"Cohen made a FOIA request to the [Department of Construction Services] (the state building inspector's office) for documents related to Meyers' service as a building official in East Haddam.

He complained that Meyers 'stole most of the $53,500 I gave him ....' He expressed a 'personal belief' that 'Mr. Meyers is a liar, cheat, thief and incompetent as a builder and would not be deserving of a job in public service.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \"On October 16, 2012, Cohen spoke at a meeting of the Middlefield Board of Selectmen, stating, among other things, that Meyers was not registered as a new home construction contractor in 2009/2010 when he built a home at 24 Alger Road, a criminal violation of state law for which he was not prosecuted, and that at the time he passed the state test for the building official, he was not licensed and was in 'serious criminal violation of the very rules he was charged with upholding.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \"On October 23, 2012, Cohen sent a letter to the first selectman of the town of Middlefield stating that Meyers had lied on his job application.

Meyers testified that he often goes home, closes the blinds, seals himself in and pulls a blanket over his head. He admitted to thoughts of suicide as a way to 'stop all of the pain.' He summed up his situation by remarking that Cohen's accusations of him killing a man, and being a liar, a thief and a criminal have turned his life into 'a pile of crap.'

RMMI's failure to provide the plaintiff with the written notice required by \u00a7 20-417d (A) prior to entering into the agreement is also a violation of the NHCCA. A violation of the NHCCA, General Statutes \u00a7 20-417a et seq., constitutes a per se violation of [CUTPA]. As a result of the CUTPA violation established in count seven, the plaintiff is entitled to 'actual damages' under\n   General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a).\" The court credited Cohen's testimony that \"he would have acted differently had he received proper NHCCA disclosures from RMMI,\" and thus [rendered] judgment in favor of Cohen against RMMI, and awarded him actual damages in the amount of $54,750 on his CUTPA claim. The court found in favor of RMMI on its counterclaim for breach of contract, but found that damages were not proven and thus awarded nominal damages in the amount of $1. The court found in favor of Meyers against Cohen on his defamation claim and awarded Meyers noneconomic damages in the amount of $100,000. The court rejected the parties' remaining claims against each other.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The parties thereafter filed motions to reargue. First, Cohen sought reargument, inter alia, on the grounds that the court erred in summarily dismissing his claims for fraud, unjust enrichment, statutory theft and conversion against Meyers individually. Cohen argued that the court erred in declining to pierce the corporate veil and to hold Meyers individually liable for his conduct, and that its decision was inconsistent, in that it \"concluded that RMMI violated a statutory duty by failing to comply with the NHCCA in violation of CUTPA [but] .... that Meyers did not use the corporate form to violate a statutory duty or perpetuate a fraud.\" Cohen argued: \"[T]he court's express findings that Meyers had complete control and domination over RMMI, that RMMI violated an express statutory duty and engaged in unfair and deceptive practices, and that such violation was the cause of the plaintiff's damages, necessitates a finding that Meyers used the corporate form to violate a statutory duty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The court disagreed, and issued an order on December 3, 2015, holding, inter alia: \"[T]he court rejects [Cohen's] contention that the facts found by the court in its memorandum of decision necessarily compel a finding that Meyers used his control and domination of the corporation to commit fraud or wrong, to perpetrate the violation of a statutory or other positive legal duty, or a dishonest or unjust act in contravention of [Cohen's] legal rights.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Meyers sought reargument of the court's refusal to award him punitive damages on his defamation claim and challenging the court's finding that Cohen's actions were not so extreme and outrageous as to support a claim of intentional infliction of\n   emotional distress.

But, the fact\n   that a sole stockholder of a corporation is in exclusive control of the company's finances and business practices, standing alone, is an insufficient basis in itself to pierce the corporate veil. While control is a factor, '[o]f paramount concern is how the control was used, not that it existed.' ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \"In this respect, [Cohen] has failed completely to offer any evidence that Robert M. Meyers, the individual, used the corporate\n   form to perpetrate a fraud. The evidence offered by [Cohen] does not justify transforming a breach of contract claim against a corporation into a personal obligation of the corporation's principal....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \"[Cohen] offered no evidence to suggest that Meyers did not respect and observe the laws which afford him the right to form and manage a corporation of which he was the sole shareholder. RMMI had its own accounts, made payments to and from those accounts and conducted regular business as a general contractor, and apparently existed for years on its own, separate and distinct from ... Meyers as an individual. Granted, the plaintiff offered evidence that funds from the RMMI account were used to pay bills of Meyers that he should have paid personally. But, Robert Gollnick ... RMMI's accountant, testified that all those payments were accounted for and reflected on the balance sheet as loans to a company officer. Eventually, Meyers had to put money back into the corporation to offset the personal payments that were made from [the] corporation. In sum, [Cohen]'s evidence that ... Meyers used the corporate form as a vehicle to commit fraud or dishonest acts consists of vague allusions and speculation, and thus was completely unpersuasive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The court thus concluded that Cohen had \"offered insufficient evidence to satisfy ... the instrumentality ... test,\" and thus rejected his attempt to pierce RMMI's corporate veil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   On appeal, Cohen claims that he satisfied the instrumentality test, and thus that the court should have pierced the corporate veil and held Meyers individually liable for violating CUTPA. Cohen's claim is based upon the same argument that he raised in his motion to reargue-that the trial court's determination that he failed to prove that Meyers exercised his control over RMMI to commit fraud or wrong or to perpetrate the violation of a statutory or other positive legal duty is inconsistent with its determination that RMMI, while under the control of Meyers, violated a statutory duty to Cohen under the NHCCA. In other words, Cohen contends that the trial court's own factual findings proved that he satisfied the instrumentality test. The court summarily rejected \"[Cohen's] contention that the facts found by this court in its memorandum of decision necessarily compel a finding that Meyers used his control and domination of the corporation to commit fraud or wrong, to perpetrate the violation of a statutory or other positive legal duty, or a dishonest or unjust act in contravention of [Cohen's] legal rights.\" Although the court determined that RMMI had failed to comply with the NHCCA, and that that failure constituted a violation of CUTPA, the court concluded: \"The plaintiff's proof in this case did not establish wilful, malicious, immoral or deceitful conduct.\" The court's determination that Cohen failed to satisfy the instrumentality test is supported by the record and he fails now, as he did before the trial court, to demonstrate that RMMI \"did not serve a legitimate business purpose, or that failing to pierce its corporate veil and hold [Meyers] personally responsible would perpetrate a fraud or other injustice.\" We therefore cannot conclude that the court's ruling was clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Cohen also challenges the court's judgment against him on Meyers' counterclaim for defamation. By way of\n   special defense to Meyers' counterclaim, Cohen alleged that he should not be held liable for defamation because his remarks concerning Meyers were true. Cohen also alleged that his remarks were privileged based upon his \"right to bring forth complaints\n   to the Department of Consumer Protection regarding the unscrupulous and unlawful actions of [Meyers] which violate consumer protection statutes\" and his right to make such statements in prosecuting this action. Cohen also argued, in his posttrial brief, that his statements regarding Meyers involved matters of public concern and thus were constitutionally protected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court found that Cohen's statements regarding Meyers were defamatory per se. The court further found that Cohen's arguments in defense of those statements unavailing. We agree with the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   We begin by setting forth the general principles of law that are pertinent to our analysis of Cohen's challenge to the trial court's defamation ruling against him. \"A defamatory statement is defined as a communication that tends to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gleason v.

The statements, considered separately or in combination, would certainly expose a person to scorn or contempt, cause him to be avoided, or injure him in his business or trade.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The court parsed Cohen's various statements regarding Meyers into three categories: those that accused\n   him of a \"crime involving moral turpitude or to which an infamous penalty is attached (e.g., 'thief,' 'admitted criminal,' or that he caused the death of a customer); those that accused him of improper conduct or lack of skill or integrity in his profession or business (... 'cheat,' 'liar,' and an incompetent building contractor)'; and those that fall into a grey area-namely, that Meyers cheated on his wife or contracted venereal disease.' \" The court found that Cohen's statements concerning Meyers were defamatory per se.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Turning to Cohen's defense that all of his statements concerning Meyers were true or substantially true, the court first rejected Cohen's argument that Meyers bore the burden of proving the falsity of the defamatory statements at issue herein, explaining that, having asserted truth as a special defense, it was his burden to prove the truth or substantial truth of those statements. The court then found: \"Several defamatory statements of Cohen stretch the test for 'substantial truth' past its breaking point.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court thus concluded\n   that\n   Cohen had not met his burden of proof as to the special defense of truth, and that recovery for defamation was not precluded on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The court then went on to address Cohen's claims of privilege. The court rejected those claims, finding as\n   follows: \"The court believes that the direct and circumstantial evidence in the record of this case abundantly supports a finding that Cohen's statements regarding Meyers stealing, committing criminal acts, causing a death, contracting venereal disease, and having extra-marital affairs were made with actual knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard for whether they were false.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court further concluded:\n   \"Having\n   patiently and exhaustively reviewed the entire record, the court is persuaded that Cohen's departures from the truth were in fact motivated by spite or ill will-a burning desire to destroy Meyers personally and professionally that went far beyond aggressive litigation tactics or a good faith interest in protecting the public good. This is reflected at the very outset of this dispute in the January, 2011 e-mails he sent to Meyers and others when he promised to 'call you out as a liar, cheat, thief and lawbreaker. ... You are going to be under the gun of officials and the public. ... [You have] left me no choice but to make you pay for it' and continues throughout, right up until the vehement and caustic text of the 'Housebuilder from Hell' website. That publicly expressed intent to inflict harm, coupled with the fact that Cohen-when he wanted to-was fully capable of restricting his comments about [Meyers] to statements that were true, persuades the court that the accusation [that] Meyers 'caused' a death was deliberately made in purposeful avoidance of the truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \"Without discussing in detail, the court finds that a similar analysis applies to Cohen's deliberate use of the terms 'thief' and 'criminal' to refer to Meyers, and his website's disclosure that Meyers 'cheated on his wife' and 'contracted a venereal disease.' These statements were all made in reckless disregard for whether they were false and in purposeful avoidance of the truth, as part of a cruel and vindictive effort to inflict injury upon Meyers. Actual malice has been proven to the court by a preponderance of the evidence; therefore, any conditional privilege has been lost, and recovery for defamation is not precluded.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In his posttrial brief, Cohen also claimed that his comments about Meyers were constitutionally protected because they were matters of public concern\n   \"relating to both Meyers as a builder with whom multiple consumers had made prior complaints and a lawsuit, and Meyers as a building official using his office to obtain building code interpretations for his own benefit.\" The court also rejected that claim, finding as follows: \"[H]aving reviewed the entirety of the record and heard the testimony, the court concludes that, despite the important setting in which the statements were made, the content of the message and the context in which they were published makes it clear that they [were] not in furtherance of an uninhibited, robust, and wide open debate on matters concerning public affairs. Their purpose was solely to harass and humiliate Meyers and perhaps induce the town of Middlefield to prematurely end his employment, perhaps so as to avoid a public relations embarrassment. The statements were published against the background of a private business dispute that had mushroomed into a contentious, vitriolic, and extremely uncivil lawsuit. The court finds that Cohen's remarks were part of an extended campaign of retaliation and revenge against Meyers that had everything to do with their private dispute, and little if anything to do with Meyers' employment as building official or, for that matter, building officials in general. ... [T]he statements were not 'intended to persuade ... with regard to a matter of public concern, [but] rather [to] merely torture\n   [him] gratuitously with regard to a purely private matter.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The court thus concluded: \"[T]he court finds that the speech in question is solely a contrived means for malicious harassment on a matter of private concern, and is therefore not entitled to protection under the first amendment to the [United States] constitution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   On appeal, Cohen claims that the court improperly held him liable for defamation because his speech was protected by the first amendment, he did not make any of the allegedly defamatory statements with actual\n   malice, the court employed the wrong legal standard in determining malice, and that he had proven that each of the allegedly defamatory statements was substantially true even though the burden of proof was on Meyers to prove that they were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   We have examined the record on appeal and considered the briefs and the arguments of the parties, and conclude that the trial court properly ruled in favor of Meyers on his defamation claim against Cohen. Because the trial court thoroughly addressed the arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt its well reasoned decision on the defamation claim, as quoted extensively herein, as a proper statement of the facts and legal analysis on the issues raised in this appeal.

The defendants argue that any injury suffered by Cohen was caused, instead, by his own refusal \"to submit the driveway permit fee, bond and certificate of insurance in order to obtain a building permit and continue construction,\" and not their failure to make NHCCA disclosures. The defendants thus claim that the court erred in awarding damages on Cohen's CUTPA claim because he failed to prove that he suffered an injury or actual loss as a result of the CUTPA violation. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The trial court determined that, as a result of RMMI's CUTPA violation, Cohen was entitled to actual damages pursuant to \u00a7 42-110g (a), which provides in relevant part: \"Any person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a method, act or practice prohibited by section 42-110b, may bring an action in the judicial district in which the plaintiff or defendant resides or has his principal place of business or is doing business, to recover actual damages. ...\" The court noted: \"Actual damages under CUTPA have been defined to include loss and expenses incurred by the CUTPA plaintiff as a result of a violation of the act.\n   <em>\n    Prishwalko v.

The court's conclusion is supported by the trial record.

The court did not otherwise set forth the specific legal or factual bases for that decision. The court denied reargument sought by Meyers on his claim for punitive damages, explaining that reargument was unnecessary because it had\n   already considered all of the factual and legal issues raised by Meyers in his motion to reargue when it rendered its November 12, 2015 decision.

'I know Bob Meyers at one point was trolling the Internet for women ....' Evidently, Cohen based this statement upon entries in the medical records of Meyers (obtained during discovery in this case) that showed he had undergone cauterization of genital warts, which, in the opinion of the doctor, were most likely caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). True, HPV is primarily spread by sexual intercourse. But it also true that the majority of sexually active adults will be infected by HPV at some point in their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    \"There is a vastly different impression upon the listener upon learning that a person 'had treatment for genital warts ' as opposed to 'contracted a venereal disease.' In fact, putting aside the fact that all of this has nothing to do with Meyers' competence as a builder, the court concludes that inflicting the stigma, humiliation and scorn attached to a 'venereal disease ' upon Mr. Meyers, as opposed to relating any true state of facts, was exactly what Cohen intended by his statement. [Cohen] has failed to meet his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the statement [that] Meyers 'contracted a venereal disease ' is substantially true, as that concept has been defined in the relevant case authority.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    \"In a similar fashion, Cohen's repeated accusations that Meyers was a 'thief' were based on his sophism that Meyers 'stole' the $53,500 payment under the contract.

A reasonable person would understand the descriptive term, 'thief,' to apply to a person who commits the crime of theft; someone who wrongfully, stealthily-and sometimes violently-takes the property of another. A reasonable person would not ascribe the term, 'thief,' to a contracting party who has retained funds freely and voluntarily paid to it because of a dispute over who has breached the contract. The use of the word, 'thief,' by Cohen is fully intended to bring down more scorn and contempt upon Meyers than would be occasioned by a statement of the literal truth: 'a defendant in a lawsuit where a breach of a contract to build a house is alleged.' Other than the fact that Meyers retained the initial payment under the contract, the plaintiff offered no other evidence of 'thievery' by Meyers. The plaintiff has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the substantial truth of his many public statements that Meyers is a 'thief.'\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    \"Cohen's repeated references to Meyers committing 'criminal acts' or 'criminal violations,' or being an 'admitted criminal' or even that his contracting business was 'an ongoing criminal enterprise' are based on another fallacious argument. Because the New Home Construction Contractors Act provides for the imposition of criminal penalties in certain cases, and because Meyers has admitted he failed to comply with the NHCCA, Cohen stated that he is an 'admitted criminal'; that he has committed a 'criminal act'; and that his business is a 'criminal enterprise.' But the plaintiff offered no evidence that Meyers had ever been charged with a crime by any law enforcement agency, much less been convicted of a crime. An accusation that a person is 'a criminal' has always been a serious matter in our society. It is associated with behavior that is immoral, antisocial, evil, shameful and fundamentally wrong. Labeling Meyers as an 'admitted criminal' would create an impression in the mind of the listener many times more damaging than a literally true disclosure of the complete facts as to his violation of the NHCCA and the lack of any criminal charges or convictions.

But, in a familiar pattern that would be seen in other contexts, Cohen's subsequent communication about the subject strays farther and farther from the objective facts until, in the end, there is little truth in them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    \"In an April 10, 2013 letter to Angie Martinez of the Department of Consumer Protection, Cohen stated that the lawsuit between Meyers and the Christophers 'came to a conclusion when Mr. Christopher died fairly suddenly, perhaps in part because of Mr. Meyers' actions.' In vivid language from his website, 'Housebuilder from Hell,' Cohen tells of 'law-breaking, building code violations, losses totaling many hundreds of thousands of dollars, the death of an aggrieved, home buyer, an alleged threat of extreme violence-and one man at the center of it all-contractor and state-licensed building inspector Robert M. 'Bob' Meyers.' In a June 18, 2013 letter to the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Protection, Cohen stated that 'Meyers has caused not just terrible problems for consumers, but death, mayhem and other horrors.' The manner and context in which these statements were delivered-in a writing (e-mail) as opposed to speech, and on multiple occasions, persuade this court that this was not a negligent misstatement of fact.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
