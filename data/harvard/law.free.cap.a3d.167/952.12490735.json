Nelson, filed this habeas action alleging that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at two criminal jury trials, both of which resulted in convictions and lengthy prison sentences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, moved to dismiss the action pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 (5),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   based on the terms of a stipulated judgment, filed by the petitioner and the respondent in connection with a previous habeas action concerning the same two trials, that barred the petitioner from filing any further such actions pertaining to those trials. The habeas court granted that motion, and the petitioner appeals,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   claiming that he did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the stipulated judgment and, therefore, that the habeas court improperly granted the\n   respondent's motion to dismiss. We conclude that the petitioner did not properly raise his challenge to the enforceability of the stipulated judgment in the habeas court and, further, that the stipulated judgment was a legally sufficient ground for dismissal of the present habeas action. We therefore affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The petitioner was charged with two counts each of kidnapping in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, and burglary in the first degree, and with one count each of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, assault in the first degree, and larceny in the first degree after he and an accomplice allegedly broke into a\n   Wethersfield home and proceeded to assault, rob and kidnap the occupant. Following a jury trial, the petitioner was found guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree and not guilty of larceny in the first degree. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the remaining charges, however, and the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Vitale, J.\n   </em>\n   , declared a mistrial with respect to those charges. The court thereafter rendered judgment of conviction and sentenced the petitioner to a term of imprisonment of eighteen years, and, on appeal, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.

The petitioner then filed a timely application under General Statutes \u00a7 51-195\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   with the sentence review division of the Superior Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking a reduction of his sentence. The sentence review division, however, denied the petitioner's request and upheld his sentence. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Docket No. CR-05-220383-A,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202746485\">\n    2008 WL 2746485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (June 24, 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The petitioner subsequently was retried on certain of the charges for which a mistrial had been declared in his first trial, and the jury found him guilty of the kidnapping, assault, and burglary charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court,\n   <em>\n    D'Addabbo, J.\n   </em>\n   , sentenced the petitioner to fifty-five years incarceration, to run concurrently with the eighteen year sentence that had been imposed following the petitioner's first trial. On appeal, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court's judgment in part on double jeopardy grounds, remanding the case to the trial court with direction to merge the petitioner's two kidnapping convictions and to vacate the sentence imposed for the conviction of one of those counts. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058208\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/118/831/#p853\">\n    118 Conn.App. 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 853-54, 862,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=986%20A.2d%20311\">\n    986 A.2d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304464,4304314,4304960\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/911/\">\n    295 Conn. 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=989%20A.2d%201074\">\n    989 A.2d 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment in all other respects.

The petitioner failed to apply for sentence review within thirty days, as required by \u00a7 51-195.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In addition to his direct appeals from the judgments of conviction that were rendered following his two trials,\n   the petitioner filed two separate habeas petitions as a self-represented party, one on August\n   6, 2007, and a second petition on April 16, 2008. The two actions were consolidated, and, on April 8, 2011, the petitioner's then newly appointed counsel filed an amended petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel at both of the underlying criminal trials. Thereafter, the petitioner and the respondent jointly moved for a stipulated judgment, and the habeas court granted the parties' motion. Under that stipulated judgment, the respondent agreed to the reinstatement of the petitioner's right to file an application with the sentence review division for a reduction of the fifty-five year term of imprisonment that the petitioner received following his second trial. For his part, the petitioner agreed to be foreclosed from filing any future civil actions challenging the judgments of conviction arising out of his first and second trials and, further, that the remaining counts of the then pending habeas petition were to be stricken with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, consistent with the terms of the stipulated judgment, the petitioner filed an application for sentence review pursuant to \u00a7 51-195, seeking a reduction of his fifty-five year term of imprisonment. In his application, the petitioner sought credit for his cooperation as a state's witness in a murder case, cooperation that had occurred following the imposition of the fifty-five year sentence. Again, however, the sentence review\n   division declined to modify the petitioner's sentence. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Docket No. CR-05-220383-A (November 2, 2012) (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20904\">\n    54 Conn. L. Rptr. 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In reaching its decision, the sentence review division explained that it could not lawfully consider the petitioner's cooperation with the state because that cooperation did not take place until after the petitioner's sentencing, and, therefore, the sentencing court could not have known about it.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20904\">\n    54 Conn. L. Rptr. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   905 ; see General Statutes \u00a7 51-196 (a) (\"[t]he review division ... may order such different sentence or sentences to be imposed\n   <em>\n    as could have been imposed at the time of the imposition of the sentence\n   </em>\n   under review\" [emphasis added] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Several months later, on February 14, 2013, the petitioner brought the present habeas action, once again alleging various deficiencies in the underlying judgments of conviction. Subsequently, on August 26, 2015, the respondent moved to dismiss the action under Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 (5), on the ground that it was barred by the plain terms of the stipulated judgment. The petitioner objected to the motion and filed a memorandum of law challenging, for the first time, the validity of the stipulated judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In that memorandum of law, the petitioner explained that, while his previous habeas petitions were pending, he had testified as a state's witness in a murder trial in exchange for the state's promise to support a modification of his sentence from a fifty-five year term of imprisonment to one of thirty years. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39 (b) (providing that sentencing court may modify sentence for \"good cause\n   shown\" at \"[a]ny time during the period of a definite sentence of more than three years, upon agreement of the defendant and the state's attorney to seek review of the sentence\");\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dupas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763907\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/778/#p781\">\n    291 Conn. 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781-82,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=970%20A.2d%20102\">\n    970 A.2d 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (trial court properly considered defendant's postconviction\n   testimony against codefendants pursuant to modification agreement by state and defendant under \u00a7 53a-39 ). The petitioner further explained that, after his testimony on behalf of the state in that murder case, he had agreed to the stipulated judgment, resolving the consolidated habeas petitions in the belief that he would be able to obtain the agreed on sentence reduction by way of his application to the sentence review division for a sentence modification. According to the petitioner, however, the state, upon learning that he had sought sentence review by the sentence review division, rescinded its promise to support a reduction of his prison sentence from fifty-five years to thirty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The petitioner further claimed that he would not have agreed to the stipulated judgment if he had known either (1) that seeking a sentence modification in the sentence review division, rather than a reduction of his sentence in the trial court, would cause the state to rescind its promise to him, or (2) that the sentence review division would be unable to consider his cooperation with the state as a witness in the murder trial. He blamed his ignorance of these facts on the allegedly ineffective assistance that he received from the two attorneys working simultaneously on his case-one representing him in pursuing a sentence reduction under \u00a7 53a-39 (b) and the other representing him in connection with the habeas petition that ultimately was resolved by the stipulated judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Notwithstanding these assertions, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Oliver, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the respondent's motion to dismiss the present action, explaining, in response to the petitioner's subsequent motion for articulation, that, \"in exchange and for the consideration of the restoration of his right to file an application for sentence review, [the petitioner] agreed that he is foreclosed from future civil litigation challenging the convictions related to [the instant habeas petition].\" The court did not address\n   the petitioner's argument-raised solely in his memorandum of law in opposition to the respondent's motion to dismiss-that the stipulated judgment was invalid because the waiver of his rights contained therein was not knowing and voluntary due to the failure of counsel to inform him of the apparent consequences of entering into the stipulated judgment, in particular, that the sentence review division would not consider a reduction of his sentence based on his cooperation with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court, in ruling on the respondent's motion to dismiss, should have construed his memorandum of law and the facts asserted therein in the light most favorable to the petitioner, just as it would have construed the facts alleged in the habeas petition. The respondent contends that the habeas court properly dismissed the action in accordance with the express terms of the stipulated judgment because the petitioner's challenge to the validity of that judgment, which the petitioner raised for the first and only time in his memorandum of law, should have been raised in the petition itself and, therefore, was not properly before the habeas court on the respondent's motion to dismiss. We agree with the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It is well established that, when a habeas court considers a motion to dismiss a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, \"[t]he evidence offered by the [petitioner] is to be taken as true and interpreted in\n   the light most favorable to [the petitioner], and every reasonable inference is to be drawn in [the petitioner's] favor.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Ham\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20Conn.%20App.%20212\">\n    152 Conn.App. 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223-24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20A.2d%2081\">\n    98 A.2d 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20932\">\n    314 Conn. 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20A.3d%2083\">\n    102 A.3d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Orcutt\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3957231\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/724/#p739\">\n    284 Conn. 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=937%20A.2d%20656\">\n    937 A.2d 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   A.29 656 (2007). It is equally well settled that \"[t]he petition for a writ of habeas corpus is essentially a pleading and, as such, it should conform generally to a complaint in a civil action ... [and it] is fundamental\n   in our law that the right of a plaintiff to recover is limited to the allegations of his complaint.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Thiersaint\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%2089\">\n    316 Conn. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20A.3d%20829\">\n    111 A.3d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Thus, \"[w]hile the habeas court has considerable discretion to frame a remedy that is commensurate with the scope of the established constitutional violations ... it does not have the discretion to look beyond the pleadings and trial evidence to decide claims not raised.... The purpose of the [petition] is to put the [respondent] on notice of the claims made, to limit the issues to be decided, and to prevent surprise.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Newland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486170\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/1095/#p678\">\n    322 Conn. 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486170\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/1095/#p678\">\n    142 A.3d 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). In the present case, it is undisputed that the petitioner's habeas petition did not allege ineffective assistance predicated on counsel's failure to properly advise the petitioner regarding the waiver of his habeas rights under the stipulated judgment, nor did the petition allege any other defect in the stipulated judgment. As a result, the habeas court properly declined to consider those issues in connection with the respondent's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We disagree with the petitioner that the assertions contained in his memorandum of law were on equal footing with the allegations contained in the habeas petition and, therefore, should have been taken as true and viewed in the light most favorable to the petitioner. It is clear that a memorandum of law is not a proper vehicle for supplementing the factual allegations in a complaint; see, e.g., Practice Book \u00a7 10-31 (party responding to motion to dismiss shall have thirty days to file \"a memorandum of law in opposition\n   <em>\n    and, where appropriate, supporting affidavits as to facts not apparent on the record\n   </em>\n   \" [emphasis added] );\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Independent Utility Workers, Local 12924\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Public Utility Control\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20265\">\n    312 Conn. 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 281,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20A.3d%20247\">\n    92 A.3d 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (\"[T]o the extent that the plaintiffs contend that memoranda of law or exhibits submitted to the trial court cured any potential deficiencies in their allegations, they are mistaken....

By contrast, the nature of the decision of the prior habeas court in the present case was clearly set forth in the stipulated judgment and is not disputed: the parties agree that the prior judgment by its terms barred further habeas actions relating to the petitioner's two trials.
