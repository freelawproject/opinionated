On January 6, 2016, the plaintiff filed an application for an order of civil protection against the defendant. In her application, she alleged in relevant part that she had been the victim of stalking. In her application, she described two occasions in which she was subjected to what she characterized as \"immature behavior\" by the defendant. On one occasion, the defendant yelled at her and almost overturned a table in her direction. On the other occasion, the defendant shoved her using both hands. She alleged that other encounters had occurred, but did not provide details about them. The plaintiff requested that the court order that the defendant (1) not assault, threaten, abuse, harass, follow, interfere with or stalk her; (2) stay away from her home; (3) not contact her in any manner; and (4) stay 100 yards away from her. The court granted the application and issued an ex parte civil protection order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The court held a hearing on the application on January 19, 2016. This was a joint hearing during which the court also considered an application for a civil restraining order against the defendant that was brought by the plaintiff's boyfriend, the court's denial of which is not a subject of this appeal. It was not disputed that the plaintiff's boyfriend is the defendant's former boyfriend. At the hearing, the plaintiff testified with respect to four separate and distinct incidents, which occurred during an approximately three year\n   period of time, involving herself and the defendant: the first incident occurred at a restaurant referred to as the Harp and Dragon in December, 2015; the second incident occurred at a restaurant referred to as Hot Rod's in December, 2014; the third incident occurred at an establishment referred to as the Oasis Pub; and the fourth incident occurred at a friend's house in the summer of 2014. At the hearing, the court heard testimony from the plaintiff, the plaintiff's boyfriend, the defendant, and a mutual friend of the parties. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court granted the plaintiff's application. The court ordered that the defendant \"not assault, threaten, abuse, harass, follow, interfere with or stalk the [plaintiff] with regard to that matter. That order is [going to] be in effect for six months from this date ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant argues that, in granting the plaintiff relief under General Statutes (Rev. to 2015) \u00a7 46b-16a,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court erroneously\n   found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that she committed acts to warrant issuance of the civil protective order and that she will continue to commit such acts or acts designed to intimidate or retaliate against the applicant. The defendant argues that the court \"erred in its interpretation of and application of the law to the facts.\" In so doing, the defendant first argues that it is reasonable to infer that the court based its decision on a finding that she committed acts constituting stalking in the second degree as described in General Statutes (Rev. to 2015) \u00a7 53a-181d,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, she argues, the evidence presented at the\n   hearing did not support such a finding. Second, the defendant argues that \"[n]o evidence was presented by either party that would indicate that [she] would continue to commit the acts she has been accused of.\" The defendant asks this court to reverse the court's judgment and to remand the case to the trial court with direction to deny the plaintiff's application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Initially, we observe that the defendant's appendix does not contain a copy of the trial court's decision. \"It is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate\n   record for review. The appellant shall determine whether the entire record is complete, correct and otherwise perfected for presentation on appeal.\" Practice Book \u00a7 61-10(a) ; see also Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 (\"[i]t is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review as provided in [\u00a7] 61-10\"). The appellant bears the responsibility for providing this court with an appendix that, in part one, \"shall contain ... opinions or decisions of the trial court ....\" Practice Book \u00a7 67-8(b)(1). For reasons that should be obvious, this noncompliance with the rules of appellate procedure is an impediment to this court's review of the defendant's brief as well as the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Next, we observe that a copy of the trial court's decision does not appear in the court file. The court's rendering of judgment in favor of the plaintiff in this matter constitutes a final judgment. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 64-1(a), the trial court was required \"[to] state its decision either orally or in writing .... The court's decision shall encompass its conclusion as to each claim of law raised by the parties and the factual basis therefor. If oral, the decision shall be recorded by a court reporter, and, if there is an appeal, the trial court\n   shall create a memorandum of decision for use in the appeal by ordering a transcript of the portion of the proceedings in which it stated its oral decision. The transcript of the decision shall be signed by the trial judge and filed with the clerk of the trial court. ...\" Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 64-1(b), \"[i]f the trial judge fails to file a memorandum of decision or sign a transcript of the oral decision in any case covered by subsection (a), the appellant may file with the appellate clerk a notice that the decision has not been filed in compliance with subsection (a). The notice shall specify the trial judge involved and the date of the ruling for which no memorandum of decision was filed. The appellate clerk shall promptly notify the trial judge of the filing of the appeal and the notice. The trial court shall thereafter comply with subsection (a).\" Our review of the court file reflects that the defendant did not attempt to rectify the record by filing a motion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 64-1(b) with the appellate clerk. The defendant's failure leaves this court without a ready means of identifying the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant has failed to obtain a memorandum of decision from the court and has failed to include it in the appendix to her brief. The defendant, however, has filed with the appellate clerk a transcript from the court proceeding on January 19, 2016. In challenging the factual and legal basis of the court's decision, the defendant cites to the transcript and refers to statements made by the court that appear in the transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"When the record does not contain either a memorandum of decision or a transcribed copy of an oral decision signed by the trial court stating the reasons for its decision, this court frequently has declined to review the claims on appeal because the appellant has failed to provide the court with an adequate record for review.... Moreover, [t]he requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 are not met simply by filing with the appellate\n   clerk a transcript of the entire trial court proceedings.... Despite an appellant's failure to satisfy the requirements of ... \u00a7 64-1, this court has, on occasion, reviewed claims of error in light of an unsigned transcript as long as the transcript contains a sufficiently detailed and concise statement of the trial court's findings.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Stechel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235765\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/125/441/#p445\">\n    125 Conn.App. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 445,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20A.3d%20545\">\n    8 A.3d 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776682,6776731,6776646\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/300/904/\">\n    300 Conn. 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20A.3d%20572\">\n    12 A.3d 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) ; see also\n   <em>\n    JP Morgan Chase Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gianopoulos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4263704\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/131/15/#p20\">\n    131 Conn.App. 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20-21,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20A.3d%20697\">\n    30 A.3d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (court may determine that unsigned transcript contains sufficiently detailed and concise statement of trial court's findings), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=302%20Conn.%20947\">\n    302 Conn. 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20A.3d%202\">\n    30 A.3d 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Our review of the transcript does not reveal a sufficiently detailed and concise statement of the court's findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"It is well settled that [w]e do not presume error; the trial court's ruling is entitled to the reasonable presumption that it is correct unless the party challenging the ruling has satisfied its burden demonstrating the contrary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Milner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489218\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/730/#p13\">\n    325 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489218\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/730/#p13\">\n    155 A.3d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). \"Our role is not to guess at possibilities ... but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court....
