See\n   <em>\n    Levandoski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2631130\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/267/651/#p653\">\n    267 Conn. 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 653-54,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=841%20A.2d%20208\">\n    841 A.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). The principal issue in this appeal is whether the firefighter's rule should be extended beyond the scope of premises liability so as to bar a police officer from recovering, under a theory of ordinary negligence, from a homeowner who is also an alleged active tortfeasor. The plaintiff, Robert Sepega,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a municipal police officer, appeals\n   from the judgment of the trial court in favor of the defendant, Lawrence R. DeLaura, following the granting of a motion to strike. In granting that motion, the trial court concluded that the firefighter's rule barred the plaintiff's sole claim, which sounded in ordinary negligence. We conclude that the firefighter's rule should not be extended beyond claims of premises liability and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court in favor of the defendant and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n   The following facts, as alleged by the plaintiff in his amended complaint, and procedural history are relevant to the present appeal. The plaintiff, while in the course of his employment as a municipal police officer, responded to a call at a premises owned by the defendant. The call indicated that the defendant had locked himself inside his home and was threatening to harm himself. After arriving at the premises and making numerous requests of the defendant for entry into the home, the plaintiff ultimately attempted to kick in a door and, in doing so, sustained serious injuries. The plaintiff alleged that the resulting damages were caused by the negligence and carelessness of the defendant. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had negligently \"created conditions which mandated that the plaintiff, as a police officer, forcibly enter the premises in order to prevent harm to the defendant or to others.\" In support of this claim, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant \"had violated a protective order by entering and remaining in the premises,\" was \"threatening to harm himself,\" and was \"uncooperative with police requests to come to the door and speak to them.\" We note that the complaint does not make any allegations against the defendant relating to dangerous or defective conditions on the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant filed a motion to strike the amended complaint, and the plaintiff objected. On September 15, 2015, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision denying the defendant's motion to strike. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for articulation that the court, sua sponte, recast as a motion for reargument and reconsideration. After hearing argument from the parties, the trial court vacated its original decision and issued a new memorandum of decision granting the defendant's motion to strike on October 29, 2015. The\n   defendant then filed a motion for judgment, which the trial court granted. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"We begin by setting out the well established standard of review in an appeal from the granting of a motion to strike. Because a motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court, our review of the court's ruling... is plenary.... We take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency.... Thus, [i]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied.... Moreover, we note that [w]hat is necessarily implied [in an allegation] need not be expressly alleged.... It is fundamental that in determining the sufficiency of a complaint challenged by a defendant's motion to strike,\n   all well-pleaded facts and those facts necessarily implied from the allegations are taken as admitted....

The trial court declined the defendants' request to charge the jury, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff was a licensee upon the defendant's property and that the duty which the defendants owed to the plaintiff was limited by that relationship....

We phrased the issue as whether a police officer occupies the status of an invitee or of a licensee when, in the course of performing his official duties, he is injured by a defective condition on the property of a landowner. We read\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   as [adopting] the principle expressed in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 345 (1), that the liability of a possessor of land to one who enters the land only in the exercise of a privilege, for either a public or a private purpose, and irrespective of the possessor's consent, is the same as the liability to a licensee.... We concluded that the rule applies to police officers as well as firefighters.... In doing so, we gave three reasons for extending the rule to police officers....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The first reason was cast in terms of the similarity of the roles of firefighters and police officers, and the reasonable expectations of landowners regarding those two types of public officers.... The second reason was essentially a reiteration of the doctrine of assumption of the risk.... The third reason rested upon the\n   combination of the avoidance of double taxation upon landowners and the availability of workers' compensation benefits to compensate the injured firefighter or police officer.\" (Citations omitted; footnote added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Levandoski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cone\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2631130\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/267/651/#p653\">\n    267 Conn. at 658-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=841%20A.2d%20208\">\n    841 A.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Levandoski\n   </em>\n   , this court concluded that \"[t]his background persuades us that the rule should not be extended to a nonpremises liability case, such as the present appeal.

We consider each of these policy considerations in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By focusing on a firefighter or police officer as a class from whom a premises owner needs immunity from liability, not on the reasonableness of the activity of the premises owner in the circumstances, the first policy consideration operates as a veiled form of an assumption of risk analysis. This legislature of this state, however, has abolished the assumption of risk doctrine. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (l) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   see also\n   <em>\n    Levandoski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cone\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2631130\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/267/651/#p653\">\n    267 Conn. at 662-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=841%20A.2d%20208\">\n    841 A.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, this policy consideration fails to support an extension of firefighter's rule in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant asserts that we should recognize a difference between a \"primary\" assumption of risk, which arises from the \"special relationship between the firefighter and the public,\" and a \"secondary\" assumption of risk, which arises from an individual firefighter's decision to encounter a particular risk. The defendant argues that, while Connecticut may have abolished the latter, it did not abolish the reasoning underlying the former. Thus, the defendant argues that a firefighter may assume a risk, in the broader sense, when that risk is inherent to his or her occupation. We are not persuaded. There is no indication in \u00a7 52-572h (l) that the legislature intended to differentiate between degrees of assumption of risk. The doctrine was abolished in its entirety. It would be both unfair and incongruous, therefore, for this court to rely on the assumption of risk doctrine as a basis for extending the firefighter's rule beyond premises liability claims when the clear public policy of our state is contrary to the very rationale for that doctrine. Regardless of the\n   continuing vitality of the firefighter's rule as it relates to premises liability claims, it certainly should not be extended on the basis of the common-law doctrine of assumption of risk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Furthermore, as this court explained in\n   <em>\n    Levandoski\n   </em>\n   , \"the firefighter's rule is essentially a rule of premises liability. The distinction upon which it rests, namely, whether the plaintiff is an invitee or licensee, is itself a distinction that exists in our law only with regard to claims based upon premises liability, and the differing duties of care that emanate from those distinctions are cast in terms of a landowner's duty to persons on his or her land. We have recognized that the rule is directly applicable [to] an issue of landowner liability .... We have declined to extend the rule to a case in which the plaintiff firefighters sought to recover damages from the defendant alarm company for injuries and death sustained as a result of a collision caused by the negligent maintenance and failure of brakes on their fire engine while responding to a false alarm transmitted by the defendant.... This essential link to a landowner's liability, as we [have previously] explained ... is the most compelling argument for the rule, because of the reasonable expectations of landowners, and because of the ensuing hardship that would be visited upon a landowner in the absence of the rule. Indeed, we have reiterated\n   that this is [t]he most compelling argument for the continuing validity of the rule .... This argument simply does not apply if the defendant is not a landowner. Indeed, neither the differing status of the plaintiff nor the reasonable expectations of the defendant\n   are relevant if the plaintiff is not engaged in entering the land of the defendant. It would be anomalous, therefore, to extend the rule to a case in which the most compelling argument for the rule is inapplicable.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Levandoski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cone\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2631130\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/267/651/#p653\">\n    267 Conn. at 661-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=841%20A.2d%20208\">\n    841 A.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Levandoski\n   </em>\n   , this court explained that \"to the extent that the firefighter's rule rests on the doctrine of assumption of the risk, it would be inconsistent with the policy of our general tort law to extend the rule beyond its present confines. That policy is expressed in ... \u00a7 52-572h, pursuant to which the legislature has abolished the doctrine of assumption of the risk in negligence actions. Section 52-572h (\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) provides: 'The legal doctrines of last clear chance and assumption of risk in actions to which this section is applicable are abolished.'

As the Supreme Court of Oregon explained, \"[t]he weakness in the loss-spreading rationale ... is obvious. By denying a public safety officer recovery from a negligent tortfeasor, the officer is not directed to recover his damages from the general public; rather the officer is totally precluded from recovering these damages from anyone. Contrast this with other public employees who are injured when confronting dangers on their jobs. The latter can recover workers' compensation and salary benefits from the public, but are also allowed additional tort damages from the third-party [tortfeasors].\"\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8642172\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/610/#p619\">\n    296 Or. at 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8642172\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/610/#p619\">\n    678 P.2d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For instance, either the municipal emergency medical technician, injured due to a homeowner's\n   negligence in the maintenance of his property while transporting a patient, or the municipal building inspector, injured due to homeowner's negligence while examining structures, is able to bring civil actions against defendants who may be responsible for his or her injuries. However, \"[u]nder the [firefighter's] rule the injured public safety officer must bear a loss which other public employees are not required to bear.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8642172\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/610/#p619\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Expanding such a rule would unnecessarily and improperly discriminate against public safety officers. While there is certainly danger inherent in the job of being a police officer or a firefighter, it is interesting to note that, in terms of the most dangerous public sector jobs, refuse and recyclable collectors were ranked as having the fifth most dangerous overall job in the United States in 2015, ahead of both firefighters and police officers. United States Dept. of Labor, \"National Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries in 2015\" (2016) p. 4, available at https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf (last visited September 13, 2017). Despite these statistics, we do not have a similar rule for refuse and recyclable collectors. Instead, a refuse and recyclable collector may bring a civil action against third-party tortfeasors responsible for his or her injuries if he or she is injured on\n   someone's property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   If one of the foundations underlying the firefighter's rule is that the job of police officers and firefighters are so inherently dangerous that danger and injury are part of the job, it hardly seems justified to extend the rule when statistically there are more dangerous public sector jobs in which we allow the injured worker to pursue recovery from a third-party. See S. Maloney, United States Dept. of Labor, \"Nonfatal Injuries and Illnesses Among State and Local Government Workers\" (2014) p. 8, available at https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2014/soii-gov-workers/home.htm (last visited September 13, 2017) (for state\n   and local employees, nursing and residential care workers have highest rate of nonfatal injuries).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant claims that the firefighter's rule is also justified because police officers and firefighters receive extra benefits as a result of their employment. We disagree. While there may be certain additional benefits negotiated with municipalities as the result of union collective bargaining, we cannot discern any statute in which the legislature has provided extra compensation to police officers or firefighters as a result of their employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The proponents of the firefighter's rule claim that it encourages the public to call for professional help and not to rely on self-help in emergency situations. This rationale has been criticized by one legal scholar, William L. Prosser, as \"preposterous rubbish.\" W. Prosser, Law of Torts (4th Ed. 1971) \u00a7 61, p. 397. Indeed, we conclude that, in an emergency situation, it is unlikely any person would be hesitant to call for help because they are concerned about liability for potential injuries to public safety personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We note that the concurrence disagrees with this conclusion. Although a majority of jurisdictions employ the firefighter's rule, there are many that do not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In total, eighteen states have abolished the firefighter's\n   rule, severely limited its application, or have not addressed it at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Willmore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Kan.%20103\">\n    306 Kan. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 114,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%20529\">\n    392 P.3d 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). We have not been able to find, and the concurrence does not point to, any evidence that there has been an effect on the residents in these eighteen states that deters them from calling for emergency assistance. Moreover, we cannot find, and the concurrence does not point to, any evidence of any significant detriment to society in those states that have never adopted the rule.

No jurisdiction appears to have analyzed whether the absence of the firefighter's rule actually\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   deter people from calling for emergency assistance. The concurrence also fails to rebut our approval of Prosser's statement by pointing to any evidence to demonstrate that the \"chilling\" effect on citizens has occurred anywhere else in the nation where the firefighter's rule has been abolished or limited. It is important to note that the firefighter's rule presently allows a police officer or firefighter to bring claims for negligence that do not involve premises liability. It is not a rule of absolute liability for injuries to firefighters or police officers who suffer an injury at a homeowner's residence due to the negligence of the homeowner. If an injury is suffered without negligence, the action is covered by workers' compensation. We note that even the concurrence would allow an action by a firefighter or police officer against a homeowner for negligence that occurred after the police officer or firefighter arrived. We suggest that most cases, as exhibited by the fact pattern in the present case, would fall into that category. The concurrence would also allow an action, like the present case, against a third party who was not involved in contacting the police. It is simply inconceivable to us that someone whose house is on fire will debate or hesitate in calling the fire department because he or she fears a firefighter might bring some negligence action if injury occurs. Instead, we presume that the primary concern of a person whose house is on fire would be to act to protect the health and safety of the people in the home and to salvage the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The concurrence relies on\n   <em>\n    Lodge\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arett Sales Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"245245\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/246/563/\">\n    246 Conn. 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=717%20A.2d%20215\">\n    717 A.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), to support its contention\n   that this court has previously relied on this policy rationale to support the firefighter's rule.

Specifically, this court explained as follows: \"In\n   <em>\n    Furstein\n   </em>\n   , we analyzed the firefighter rule, which gives a firefighter the status of a licensee in a personal injury action against a landowner for harm sustained during the course of duty.\n   <em>\n    Furstein\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"522478\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/218/610/\">\n    218 Conn. at 615-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20A.2d%20939\">\n    590 A.2d 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .... The firefighter rule is not directly applicable in this case because this is not an issue of landowner liability, and we decline to extend the rule to the present situation. Its rationale is, however, instructive for understanding the policy issues relevant to compensation of firefighters injured in the line of duty. We concluded that limited liability was appropriate in\n   <em>\n    Furstein\n   </em>\n   ... and\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ... because (1) the nature of a firefighter's work is inherently hazardous and the choice of that occupation is akin to assumption of the risk, and (2) firefighters are adequately compensated for the job they perform and are able to recover workers' compensation for injuries sustained in the course of their employment.... Both of these public policy considerations are equally relevant to the question of whether, as a matter of policy, the defendants should be liable for the unforeseen consequences of their negligent transmission of a false alarm.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Lodge\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arett Sales Corp.\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 580-81 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=717%20A.2d%20215\">\n    717 A.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

All or virtually all of the towns and cities in Connecticut self-administer their workers' compensation insurance plans. As a result, taxpayers' money is spent when an injured police officer undergoes medical treatment and receives indemnity benefits through workers' compensation. An injured police officer who is precluded from bringing a claim against a negligent third party would frustrate the legislative intent and public policy set forth in \u00a7 31-293 because the taxpayers, through the municipality, would be unable to recoup\n   the money they spent on the workers' compensation claim of the injured police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As this court explained in\n   <em>\n    Levandoski\n   </em>\n   , \"to the extent that the firefighter's rule rests on the avoidance of double taxation of the landowner and the presence of workers' compensation benefits for the injured firefighter or police officer, the rationale does not apply to the present case. The defendant is not a taxpayer, as is a landowner who pays taxes on his or her property. Of course, although in any given case a negligent tortfeasor who injures a firefighter or police officer may also pay taxes to the local municipality, that fact would be wholly fortuitous. The point of the rule, however, is that the landowner who owes a lesser degree of duty to the police officer who enters his or her land has that benefit because, as a landowner, he or she also indirectly pays the salary of the officer through property taxes. Furthermore, we are not persuaded that, simply because the firefighter or police officer has recourse to workers' compensation benefits, he or she should not also be able to recover from a third party based on negligence. We do not ordinarily put such an elevated burden on recovery where, for example, the third party is a product manufacturer, and we see no persuasive reason to do so in the context of the present case. In addition, as the present case indicates, permitting the plaintiff to recover for the defendant's negligence will tend to reduce workers' compensation costs by permitting the plaintiff's employer to recoup those benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Levandoski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cone\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2631130\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/267/651/#p653\">\n    267 Conn. at 663-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=841%20A.2d%20208\">\n    841 A.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Further, we recognize that most homeowners are insured against the risk of people being injured on their property due to the fault of the homeowner. The homeowner\n   is able to insure against such a risk. Therefore, it hardly constitutes double taxation when a homeowner's insurance carrier must pay money to a person injured on the homeowner's property due to the homeowner's\n   negligence.

DeLaura.

As discussed in part I A of this concurring opinion, I believe that much of\n   <em>\n    Levandoski\n   </em>\n   , echoed by the majority in the present case, constitutes legally flawed dictum that undercuts the duty analyses in\n   <em>\n    Kaminski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fairfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"520703\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/216/29/\">\n    216 Conn. 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=578%20A.2d%201048\">\n    578 A.2d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), and\n   <em>\n    Lodge\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arett Sales Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"245245\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/246/563/\">\n    246 Conn. 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=717%20A.2d%20215\">\n    717 A.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), which are based substantially on the well established public policies that support the firefighter's rule, especially that of encouraging our citizens to call for professional help in emergencies without fear of civil liability. Beyond the majority's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Levandoski\n   </em>\n   , I suggest in part I B of this concurring opinion that the breadth of the majority's opinion carries with it numerous unintended and deleterious consequences insofar as it invites first responders to bring civil actions against victims of crime and motor vehicle accidents. Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Kaminski\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lodge\n   </em>\n   , I would instead adopt a \"policy-based approach to the firefighter's rule [that] will encourage the public to ask for rescue while allowing professional rescuers to seek redress in limited but appropriate circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Baldonado\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    El Paso Nat ural Gas Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784939\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/288/#p293\">\n    143 N.M. 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784939\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/288/#p293\">\n    176 P.3d 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). To that end, as discussed in part II of this concurring opinion, I read\n   <em>\n    Levandoski\n   </em>\n   to stand only for the limited proposition that none of the public policies supporting the firefighter's rule precludes the imposition of a duty of care on suspected criminals who are fleeing or resisting a police officer. Accordingly, I concur only in reversing the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   I agree with the majority's statement of the relevant facts, procedural history, and standard of review.

Citizens should be encouraged and not in any way discouraged from relying on those public employees who have been specially trained and paid to deal with these hazards. Additionally, a citizen does not have the right to exclude public safety officers from emergency situations or to control their actions once they have been alerted to an emergency and arrive on the scene.

We are confident that most citizens, including those who are conversant with comparative negligence law,\n   believe that they now inhabit such a society.

Specifically, I believe that the majority's wholesale rejection of the firefighter's rule and its supporting public policies in nonpremises liability cases carries the consequence of inviting first responders to bring civil actions against victims of crime and motor vehicle accidents.

Indeed, I emphasize that the flexible nature of the public policy-based firefighter's rule allows us to leave the courthouse doors open to first responders injured in the line of duty under circumstances that do not implicate penalizing citizens who have called for emergency help, such as the present case. Indeed, other courts have allowed actions against independent tortfeasors who injure first responders acting in the line of duty.

The New Jersey court aptly rejected the proposition that police officers who fight crime \"must expect an occasional encounter with violence. Why then should they be permitted to sue a thief for personal injuries when they have assumed the risk that the thief might fight back? We resolve this paradox by observing that the public policy underlying the fireman's rule simply does not extend to intentional abuse directed specifically at a police officer. To permit this would be to countenance unlimited violence directed at the policeman in the course of most routine duties. Certainly the policeman and his employer should have some private recourse for injuries so blatantly and criminally inflicted.... No fundamental unfairness results from allowing an officer to sue a criminal. The crook does not summon the police for help.

The present case involves the issue of whether a property owner who allegedly acted negligently after the police arrived could be liable.

There is no empirical proof that convinces us that we should extend the rule and ignore existing precedent. In short, we conclude that\n    <em>\n     Levandoski\n    </em>\n    was not wrongfully decided.

Specifically, the concurrence quotes\n    <em>\n     Kaminski\n    </em>\n    's description of the fact that \"the defendant, an armed police officer, came to the plaintiffs' home in the course of his professional responsibilities to assist in dealing with the crisis to which the team had been alerted,\" and this court's statement that \"[f]undamental concepts of justice prohibit a police officer from complaining of negligence in the creation of the very occasion for his engagement.\"\n    <em>\n     Kaminski\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Fairfield\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"520703\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/216/29/\">\n     216 Conn. at 37-38\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=578%20A.2d%201048\">\n     578 A.2d 1048\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The concurrence reasons that, \"\n    <em>\n     Kaminski\n    </em>\n    is significant because it is our seminal recognition, as a matter of public policy, of the benefits of encouraging our state's citizens to seek assistance from our communities' first responders, rather than stoking a fear of liability that would create incentives for delayed calls, self-help, or both.\" We disagree. These statements from\n    <em>\n     Kaminski\n    </em>\n    do not support the policy argument that the concurrence claims is at issue, but instead are \"redraped [arguments] drawn from ... implied assumption of risk.\"\n    <em>\n     Christensen\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Murphy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8642172\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/610/#p619\">\n     296 Or. 610\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 619,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8642172\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/610/#p619\">\n     678 P.2d 1210\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1984). This language from\n    <em>\n     Kaminski\n    </em>\n    can be phrased another way-namely, that the plaintiff, by agreeing to be a police officer,\n    <em>\n     assumed the risk\n    </em>\n    of encountering violent people and possibly being injured. As we explain subsequently in this opinion, the assumption of risk doctrine has been abolished in Connecticut. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (l). Although we agree with the concurrence that the abolition of assumption of risk alone does not warrant the preclusion of the firefighter's rule beyond premises liability cases, the assumption of risk doctrine should not be the basis upon which we decide cases involving the firefighter's rule.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    We also agree with the concurrence that \"if an individual fails to warn of known, hidden dangers on his premises or misrepresents the nature of [a] hazard\" and \"such misconduct causes [an] injury to [a firefighter],\" there should be an exception to the firefighter's rule that allows a civil action by the firefighter.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    We take issue, however, with the assertion by the concurrence that our application of the firefighter's rule represents economic classism insofar as it gives tort immunity only to landowners. We have raised the issue of the questionable continued vitality of the rule and suggested that we are not reaching this issue only because it has not been raised by the parties. See footnote 15 of this opinion. Further, we have suggested that the classification of the type of person entering on property and the respective duty a landowner may have to that individual seems to be a concept no longer accepted by a majority of states. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Berko\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Freda\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"312921\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/93/81/#p85\">\n     93 N.J. 81\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 85,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=459%20A.2d%20663\">\n     459 A.2d 663\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1983). The concurrence seems to suggest a good reason to do away with the firefighter's rule entirely, instead of extending it in the absence of sound empirical evidence to support the extension. What the concurrence neglects to observe is that the burden of persuasion to extend this doctrine is upon the person seeking the extension, not the person relying upon existing case law. In the absence of empirical evidence that people do not call emergency personnel because they are afraid of civil liability, this extension must fail for lack of persuasive proof.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Further, the concurrence cites\n    <em>\n     Baldonado\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     El Paso Natural Gas Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784939\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/288/#p293\">\n     143 N.M. 288\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784939\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/288/#p293\">\n     176 P.3d 277\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2008), in support of a \"policy-based approach to the firefighter's rule.\" In that case, a natural gas pipeline exploded killing twelve members of an extended family who were camping at a nearby campsite.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784939\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/288/#p293\">\n     Id., at 290\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784939\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/288/#p293\">\n     176 P.3d 277\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

This opinion speaks only of the duty owed to a police officer and whether the trial court's judgment granting the motion to strike was legally correct. Consequently, many of those cases to which the concurrence refers may lack the other elements necessary to maintain a negligence action. The concurrence even admits as much, but still asserts that our opinion is improper because it will give these cases their \"ill-deserved day in court.\" We fail to see how someone exercising their right to have an issue adjudicated, unless it is a frivolous claim, should be considered an \"ill-deserved day in court.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    One possible \"ill-deserved\" case suggested by the concurrence is that an emergency medical technician could bring an action for injuries arising from a patient's negligence. The concurrence fails to realize that emergency medical technicians are not barred by the firefighter's rule in Connecticut and have brought actions for injuries caused by negligence in the past.

Professor Robert H. Heidt, whom the concurrence cites, refers to another situation where an emergency medical technician in Connecticut brought an action against a heart attack patient after the emergency medical technician slipped on the patient's staircase.

The legislature did not pass any legislation in response to this highly publicized incident, however, and emergency medical personnel are still permitted to bring an action against a negligent patient, which is in direct contrast to the concurrence's assertion. Despite this, we have not seen a significant rise in litigation regarding negligently injured emergency medical personnel, and there is no evidence to suggest that a chilling effect on citizens' request for emergency medical assistance has occurred. Other jurisdictions have also refused to extend their respective firefighter's rules to emergency medical personnel, and there has not been any apparent deterrent effect for emergency medical assistance in those jurisdictions.

Instead, a refuse and recyclable collector may bring a civil action against third-party tortfeasors responsible for his or her injuries if he or she is injured on someone's property. If one of the foundations underlying the firefighter's rule is that the job of police officers and firefighters are so inherently dangerous that danger and injury are part of the job, it hardly seems justified to extend the rule when statistically there are more dangerous public sector jobs in which we allow the injured worker to pursue recovery from a third-party.\" (Footnote omitted.) I respectfully disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    In my view, the danger of the public safety professions relative to other public sector jobs, such as refuse collection, is not the primary driving policy behind the firefighter's rule. Rather, I view the firefighter's rule as reflective of the fact that, in contrast to more predictable, yet potentially dangerous, activities such as refuse collection and roadway maintenance, many emergencies requiring the services of first responders, such as fires and motor vehicle accidents, are the product of antecedent negligent acts. Accordingly, I reject a public policy that would potentially penalize Connecticut's citizens for calling for assistance in an emergency, and otherwise dissuade them from calling for help sooner, rather than later.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Under limited circumstances; see part I B of this concurring opinion; I agree, however, with the court's rejection of the position that, \"simply because the firefighter or police officer has recourse to workers' compensation benefits, he or she should not also be able to recover from a third party based on negligence. We do not ordinarily put such an elevated burden on recovery where, for example, the third party is a product manufacturer, and we see no persuasive reason to do so in the context of the present case.

The majority posits that \"[t]his suggestion transforms the firefighter's rule into a much broader debate about common-law negligence, duty, and responsibility,\" and \"goes far beyond the facts of the present case and amounts to a general advisory opinion.\" I adamantly disagree with this assertion, and note that, on the one hand, the majority argues that the \"doctrine should be confined to the facts of the present case insofar as it involves a property owner.\" On the other hand, it repeatedly uses broad language stating that the firefighter's rule has no application beyond a certain class of cases. Part II of this concurring opinion provides a narrow, case-specific resolution to the discrete legal issue presented in this case. My use of a so-called \"parade of horribles\" in this section is merely to demonstrate the real world implications of the majority's application of the firefighter's rule. The words that we use in our opinions matter; they have real world consequences, and a broad statement with regard to the applicability of the firefighter's rule will have a direct effect on our future cases. Accordingly, I embrace the public policy-based approach to the firefighter's rule precisely because it affords us the flexibility to accommodate for the unique facts of each case.
