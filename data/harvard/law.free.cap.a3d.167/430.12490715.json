On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the court's factual findings regarding statutory theft were clearly erroneous, (2) the court's discovery rulings on October 27, 2014, December 9, 2014, and January 16, 2015, \"constitute reversible error,\" and (3) the court improperly failed to conclude that the plaintiff intentionally spoliated evidence or engaged in discovery misconduct. The plaintiff cross appeals from the judgment, claiming that the court improperly ruled in favor of the defendant on his statute of limitations special defense and barred its recovery for damages that occurred prior to October 16, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the court improperly failed to conclude that the defendant's fraudulent concealment of his misconduct tolled the applicable statute of limitations. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the defendant's appeal and the plaintiff's cross appeal. The plaintiff is a closely held stock corporation engaged in the mortgage origination business for residential properties. The defendant was a founding member, shareholder, officer and director of the plaintiff, which was incorporated on July 1, 1998. He has a bachelor's degree in business science and extensive experience in banking. Because of his financial services background, he directed, supervised, and controlled all of the financial aspects of the plaintiff from its inception until his retirement in mid to late 2010. The defendant had served as the plaintiff's vice president and treasurer, and he continued to assert his influence over financial matters until his removal from the board of directors in 2012. The plaintiff's cofounder, Laurel Caliendo, initially was the corporate secretary and subsequently became the plaintiff's president in 2000. She handled the processing, closing, funding, delivery, and servicing of the loans, as well as the selling of the loans in the secondary market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At least as early as 2004, the defendant and Caliendo withdrew moneys from the plaintiff's corporate funds. These purported advances and loans were taken without approval from the board of directors. Sometime in 2012, following the defendant's retirement and continued involvement in the plaintiff's financial matters, the plaintiff promoted Justin Girolimon to the position of chief financial officer. Girolimon had worked for the plaintiff sporadically while he was in high school and college. Beginning in 2009, until he was named the chief\n   financial officer, Girolimon had reported to the defendant in the plaintiff's accounting and financial department. Girolimon had expressed concerns in 2010 about certain journal entries that the defendant had directed him to make. Sometime in 2012, after the defendant left the company, Girolimon performed a detailed investigation of the defendant's withdrawals from corporate funds. According to the plaintiff, it first became aware of the defendant's misappropriations at the time of Girolimon's 2012 investigation. The plaintiff filed the complaint in the present action on October 16, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff's two count complaint sought injunctive relief\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and damages for conversion, statutory theft, and embezzlement. The defendant filed an answer with four special defenses and a ten count counterclaim. The gravamen of the defendant's defenses and claims was that the funds alleged to have been taken by him were funds owed to him for back pay and funds he had invested in the company. The defendant also claimed that the plaintiff's cause of action was barred by the applicable three year statute of limitations, General Statutes \u00a7 52-577.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During a twelve day trial, the court heard testimony from several witnesses and admitted 113 exhibits. The exhibits included, inter alia, a report by Richard Finkel, a forensic accountant; the plaintiff's yearly audited financial statements; copies of bank checks and withdrawal slips; and the defendant's personal financial statements. Following trial, the parties submitted extensive posttrial briefs summarizing their respective positions. On December 23, 2015, the court issued a\n   memorandum of decision in which it rendered judgment for the plaintiff on the second count of its complaint and on the defendant's ten count counterclaim. The court amended its memorandum of decision on December 31, 2015. The plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration on January 7, 2016, which it amended on January 12, 2016. On January 27, 2016, the court issued a second amended memorandum of decision, ninety-four pages in length, in which it vacated all prior memoranda of decision. The court also issued a separate memorandum of decision on January 27, 2016, addressed to the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its comprehensive memorandum of decision, the court meticulously evaluated the evidence with respect to each of the parties' claims. With respect to the issues on appeal and cross appeal, the court made the following relevant findings and conclusions: (1) the defendant owed fiduciary duties to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant \"offered virtually no resistance to the allegations\" of the plaintiff's complaint; (3) the defendant claimed that the plaintiff improperly withheld documents that would have proven the financial investments he had made in the company, but the court gave \"no credit\" to that argument;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) Caliendo testified credibly that she had\n   acknowledged her inappropriate withdrawal of corporate funds after Girolimon's investigation and that she had entered into an agreement with the board of directors for the repayment of those funds; (5) \"the defendant's credibility was impeached multiple times throughout the trial and in regard to almost every issue in this case\"; (6) \"the record is rife with examples of the defendant trying to categorize the [plaintiff's] financial records in dishonest fashion so as to mislead the directors, shareholders, or outside auditors\"; (7) the defendant had the ultimate responsibility for the characterization of transactions and accounting entries, and he was responsible for working with the auditors and reviewing the plaintiff's audited financial statements; (8) except for one deposit made in 1998, the defendant failed to prove his claimed investments in the company; (9) the plaintiff's claim that it was unaware of the defendant's misappropriations until Girolimon's investigation in 2012 was not credible; (10) Girolimon credibly explained, in his testimony and in his written investigative report, how the defendant misappropriated the plaintiff's\n   funds and the amount that he had misappropriated; (11) because the defendant lacked computer ability, the plaintiff's bookkeepers and other financial employees input the defendant's handwritten notes into the QuickBooks system, and they had actual knowledge of the defendant's inappropriate advances and withdrawals of company funds, beginning in 2004; (12) prior to 2004, when the plaintiff began to employ the QuickBooks system, the plaintiff's accounting records were handwritten; (13) the plaintiff submitted pre-2004 audited financial statements at trial that provided a baseline for its analysis, and none of those\n   statements showed any amount due from the plaintiff to the defendant; (14) Girolimon's written investigative report, which was admitted as a full exhibit, most accurately detailed the defendant's misappropriations from 2004 through 2014; (15) the defendant provided no credible evidence to contradict the conclusions in the reports submitted by Finkel and Girolimon; (16) the evidence \"incontrovertibly established\" that the defendant breached his fiduciary duty to the plaintiff \"by engaging in self-dealing by taking [the plaintiff's] funds for his own personal use at his sole discretion without any regard to [the plaintiff] or its shareholders\"; (17) the defendant did not produce any evidence that would establish fair dealing in those transactions; (18) the plaintiff sustained its burden of proving that the defendant committed conversion, statutory theft and embezzlement; (19) with respect to the defendant's special defense regarding the statute of limitations, \u00a7 52-577 was not tolled by the fraudulent concealment doctrine as claimed by the plaintiff; (20) the knowledge of the plaintiff's bookkeepers and other financial employees, with respect to the defendant's misappropriations, was imputed to the plaintiff, thereby limiting its recovery of damages to a three year period prior to the commencement of this action; (21) pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-564,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court trebled the damages that occurred subsequent to October 16, 2009; and (22) the defendant provided \"no credible evidence\" to support the allegations in his ten count counterclaim. Accordingly, the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff with respect to its claims of conversion, statutory theft and embezzlement, and against the defendant on his ten count counterclaim. The court awarded the plaintiff $2,080,185.09 in damages.\n   In the court's memorandum of decision on the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration, the court responded to the plaintiff's request to reconsider its determination that the doctrine of fraudulent concealment did not operate to toll the statute of limitations. After citing the fraudulent concealment statute; General Statutes \u00a7 52-595 ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and applicable case law, the court acknowledged that it had found numerous examples of the defendant \"trying to camouflage, conceal, and even cover up inappropriate withdrawals of company funds.\" Nevertheless, the court concluded that the doctrine of fraudulent concealment did not apply under the circumstances of this case: \"Under any burden of proof ... and even if the burden were to be shifted to the defendant to disprove fraudulent concealment\n   [as argued by the plaintiff], the court finds that the defendant openly and notoriously took company money, and therefore, could not have fraudulently concealed his wrongdoing.\" The court recounted the testimony of the plaintiff's two former bookkeepers, one employed from 2003 to 2005, and the other employed from August, 2007, through January, 2009, who testified as to the inappropriate entries made at the defendant's insistence and his request for company checks to purchase personal items. The court also noted that \"the defendant relied upon others in the plaintiff's financial department to input the defendant's handwritten ledger sheets and financial notes into the QuickBooks system,\" beginning in 2004, and continuing thereafter. Consequently, the court imputed this knowledge of the bookkeepers and other employees in the financial department to the plaintiff and limited its recovery to damages for the\n   defendant's misconduct that occurred after October 16, 2009. This appeal and cross appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   DEFENDANT'S APPEAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the court's factual findings regarding statutory theft were clearly erroneous, (2) the court's discovery rulings on October 27, 2014, December 9, 2014, and January 16, 2015, \"constitute reversible error,\" and (3) the court improperly failed to conclude that the plaintiff intentionally spoliated evidence or engaged in discovery misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Factual Findings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant's first claim is that the court's factual findings, rejecting the amount of claimed contributions made by the defendant to the company and finding that the advances and withdrawals made by him were unauthorized, were clearly erroneous. The defendant argues that these erroneous factual findings led to the court's improper conclusion that the defendant committed statutory theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In particular, the defendant argues that the court mistakenly relied on Finkel's report in concluding that the defendant misappropriated funds and in determining the amount of those funds. The defendant claims that Finkel's report was \"slanted\" and \"defective.\" He also argues that the court did not properly interpret the plaintiff's audited financial statements, failed to consider transactions dating back to the plaintiff's corporate formation, and failed to examine the plaintiff's standard practices with respect to payments of salaries and capital transactions involving corporate officers. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In a case tried before the court, the trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be afforded to specific testimony.\n   <em>\n    R.T.

Thus, while we review the court's underlying factual determinations under the clearly erroneous standard, our standard of review requires us to defer to the court's evaluation of the credibility of the parties and witnesses.

Although the defendant characterizes Finkel's report as \"slanted\" and \"defective,\" the court found Finkel's testimony at trial to be \"credible\" and that \"his calculations were scientifically based and objectively verifiable.\" Significantly, however, the court found Girolimon's report more \"accurate\" and \"reliable,\" and it relied heavily on Girolimon's report and testimony at trial in reaching its determinations as to how the defendant misappropriated the plaintiff's funds and the amount of the funds that were misappropriated. The defendant's appellate brief criticizes Finkel's report in several respects, yet he does not even mention the court's reliance on Girolimon's report. The defendant has provided no persuasive support for his argument that the court erred in its reliance on the plaintiff's financial reports and audited financial statements or that it misinterpreted those reports and statements. As stated numerous times in the court's ninety-four page memorandum of decision, the defendant presented little or no documentary evidence with respect to his claims, and the court found his testimony not credible. For all of these reasons, the defendant's first claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Discovery Rulings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendant next claims that discovery rulings made by the court on October 27, 2014, December 9, 2014, and January 16, 2015, \"constitute reversible error.\" He argues that he filed timely requests for the production of the plaintiff's handwritten records from 1998 to 2004, and copies of the general ledger account due to corporate officers, but that the plaintiff failed to produce those documents and the court failed to require compliance. The defendant maintains that the requested documents \"contain material facts that would have made a difference in the outcome of the case,\" and that they would have provided \"supporting documentation\" for his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With respect to the October 27, 2014 ruling, the defendant claims that the court,\n   <em>\n    Pickard, J.\n   </em>\n   , erroneously issued an order sustaining the plaintiff's objections to the defendant's requests for production. A review of the trial court file reveals that Judge Pickard did issue an order on October 27, 2014, which provided: \"Order: Sustained. All objections are sustained.\" There is no further explanation of the court's ruling. Further, the defendant has provided no transcript of any court proceeding that addresses the particular request for production at issue and the objections raised to that request, or an elucidation of the court's decision. This court, as a reviewing court, is left with nothing to review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"It is well settled that [t]he granting or denial of a discovery request rests in the sound discretion of the court....

The plaintiff filed a reply to the defendant's motion on December 5, 2014, in which it stated that there already had been compliance, as previously ordered by the court. Judge Moore issued the following order on December 9, 2014: \"Order: Denied. [The] plaintiff indicates that it has complied with this request.

Specifically, the defendant's discovery misconduct claim is based on his allegations that he filed discovery requests at the appropriate time, that he was diligent in pursuing those requests, that some of the documents requested do exist, and that the plaintiff intentionally destroyed some of those documents. The defendant's claim of spoliation of evidence is based on the same allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It is not necessary to set forth the legal principles governing the claims of discovery misconduct or spoliation of evidence for the reason that neither claim was raised before the trial court. Although the defendant's counsel commented \"isn't it convenient\" that certain records were not available; see footnote 3 of this opinion; there was no argument before the court that the requested documents were intentionally destroyed or that the plaintiff had engaged in discovery misconduct. The defendant's posttrial brief, which is fifty pages in length, does not allege that the plaintiff's conduct constituted discovery misconduct or that it intentionally spoliated evidence. There is no analysis whatsoever with respect to those particular issues that the defendant now raises on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \" Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part: 'The court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. The court may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court....' Indeed, 'it is the appellant's responsibility to present such a claim clearly to the trial court so that the trial court may consider it and, if it is meritorious,\n   take appropriate action. That is the basis for the requirement that ordinarily [the appellant] must raise in the trial court the issues that he intends to raise on appeal.... For us [t]o review [a] claim, which has been articulated for the first time on appeal and not before the trial court, would result in a trial by ambuscade of the trial judge.' \"\n   <em>\n    Jarvis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lieder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067340\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/117/129/#p140\">\n    117 Conn.App. 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140-41,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20A.2d%20106\">\n    978 A.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).

The plaintiff argues that the court erroneously limited its recovery to the three year period prior to the commencement of this action. In particular, the plaintiff claims that it was improper to impute the knowledge of the plaintiff's bookkeepers and other financial employees to the corporate plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"The question of whether a party's claim is barred by the statute of limitations is a question of law, which this court reviews de novo....

The plaintiff did not commence this action until October 19, 2012. Unless the three year limitation period of \u00a7 52-577 is tolled, the plaintiff would be precluded from recovering damages that accrued prior to October, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The plaintiff claims that it was unaware of the defendant's misappropriations until Girolimon conducted his investigation in 2012. Prior to 2012, the plaintiff argues that the defendant had exclusive control over the plaintiff's finances and used that control to manipulate the accounting records to conceal his activities. According to the plaintiff, the knowledge of its bookkeepers could not be imputed to the company because the board of directors was not apprised of the defendant's misconduct until 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In addressing the plaintiff's tolling claim, the court made several determinations in both memoranda of decision filed on January 27, 2016. In applying the relevant statutes and case law to the evidence presented at trial, the court made the following factual findings and legal conclusions: (1) the plaintiff's claim that it was unaware of the defendant's misappropriations until Girolimon's investigation in 2012 was not credible; (2) because the defendant lacked computer ability, the plaintiff's bookkeepers and other employees input the defendant's handwritten notes into the QuickBooks system, and they had actual knowledge of the defendant's inappropriate advances and withdrawals of company funds, beginning in 2004; (3) the knowledge of the plaintiff's bookkeepers and other financial employees, with respect to the defendant's misappropriations, could be imputed to the plaintiff, thereby limiting its recovery of damages to a three year period prior to the commencement of this action; (4) the defendant \"openly and\n   notoriously\" took company money; (5) the defendant \"transparently treated company funds as his own,\" and testified that when he \"need[ed] some of [his] moneys, [he] would withdraw\" from those funds; (6) the defendant's attitude demonstrated that he was not trying to fraudulently conceal his intentions or \"bury a secret\"; (7) two of the plaintiff's bookkeepers had knowledge of the defendant's misuse of company funds long before Girolimon's investigation; (8) Linda Kerr, a bookkeeper employed by the plaintiff from 2003 to 2005, testified that the defendant would publicly, in front of other employees, ask her to give him company checks to buy and sell coins at large coin shows; (9) the plaintiff's business did not include the purchase and sale of coins; (10) Alesia Warner, the plaintiff's bookkeeper from August, 2007, through January, 2009, took issue with certain bookkeeping entries that the defendant instructed her to make, including advances to corporate officers; (11) Warner was so concerned about those entries that she refused to sign financials for the plaintiff; (12) beginning in 2004, the defendant relied on others in the plaintiff's financial department to input his handwritten ledger sheets and financial notes into the QuickBooks system, and those entries are reflected in Girolimon's report; and (13) Girolimon's report reflects that those employees input the defendant's inappropriate withdrawals, including, inter alia, charges pertaining to personal credit cards, coin purchases, personal automobile expenses, and commissions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these reasons, the court found: \"In reviewing the nature and extent of these entries, the inescapable conclusion is that, while financial employees of the company were placing these entries onto QuickBooks, they knew that the defendant was taking unauthorized withdrawals from the company, treating, as he put it,\n   the company's funds as 'my moneys.' \" Accordingly, the court concluded: \"Under our law and the facts of the present case, the court finds that knowledge of the bookkeepers and other financial employees of the defendant's defalcations is imputed to the plaintiff corporation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The plaintiff concedes \"that it is not disputing the trial court's factual determinations that [the] plaintiff's bookkeepers were aware that [the] defendant was taking corporate funds for his own personal use. Instead, [the] plaintiff disputes that such knowledge may be imputed to the corporate plaintiff.\" The plaintiff over-looks the court's factual finding that there were other employees in the plaintiff's financial department who were inputting entries at the request of the defendant. Further, other significant findings include the facts that the employees were aware of the defendant's misappropriations since 2004, and that the defendant's activities were \"transparent\" and \"open and notorious.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Although the plaintiff emphasizes that the board of directors was not aware of the defendant's misappropriations prior to 2012, it cites no legal authority for the proposition that knowledge of a corporation can only be imputed through its board of directors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff's position is too restrictive to accommodate the facts of this case. Moreover, there is case law rejecting the claim\n   of fraudulent concealment in situations where the \"intensely public nature of [the] process\" precludes an evidentiary finding of an intent to conceal;\n   <em>\n    Bound Brook Assn.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norwalk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"558321\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/198/660/#p669\">\n    198 Conn. 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 669,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20A.2d%201047\">\n    504 A.2d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6277922,6278500,6276644,6277288,6276361,6276970,6278834,6275834,6279166,6278200,6276058,6277598\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/819/\">\n    479 U.S. 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20S.%20Ct.%2081\">\n    107 S.Ct. 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%202d%2036\">\n    93 L.Ed. 2d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986) ; and where expressed concerns would direct a plaintiff of ordinary prudence to make reasonable efforts to discover information leading to the discovery of a cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Mountaindale Condominium Assn., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zappone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1047948\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/59/311/#p322\">\n    59 Conn.App. 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322, 327,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=757%20A.2d%20608\">\n    757 A.2d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1116800,1116712,1116795\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/254/947/\">\n    254 Conn. 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=762%20A.2d%20903\">\n    762 A.2d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court properly concluded that the three year statute of limitations was not tolled by the doctrine of fraudulent concealment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The court denied the injunctive relief requested in count one of the complaint, and the plaintiff has not challenged that determination in its cross appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The plaintiff does not dispute that \u00a7 52-577 is the applicable statute of limitations.
