(Richard), born in 2004.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties separated in December 2008,\n   and after a contentious period during which plaintiff alleged acts of domestic violence (DV), and defendant successfully litigated against her claims, the marriage ended in a consent judgment of divorce (JOD) filed on September 8, 2009. The parties were unable to resolve issues of custody and parenting time prior to entry of the JOD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Earlier in 2009, plaintiff had contacted the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP or the Division) regarding Richard's inappropriate, overtly sexual behavior. The Division began to investigate whether defendant had sexually abused Richard. In April 2009, the parties entered into a consent order in the matrimonial action that restored defendant's parenting time, which had been suspended during the DV proceedings. However, a subsequent domestic violence complaint resulted in a temporary restraining order and renewed suspension of defendant's parenting time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When the court dismissed the last of plaintiff's domestic violence complaints following a multi-day trial that also ended in September 2009, plaintiff thereafter successfully sought an order to show cause temporarily suspending defendant's parenting time until the judge could review the Division's records regarding its investigation. On October 5, 2009, after completing her review, the judge dissolved any restraints and ordered resumption of defendant's parenting time in accordance with the April 2009 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 10, 2009, the Division advised defendant its \"investigation determined that abuse was substantiated for sexual molestation with regard to [Richard],\" and that \"[y]ou have been identified as a person responsible for the abuse.\" Defendant apparently sought an administrative appeal because, on February 19, 2010, the Division advised him the \"finding of abuse\" as to one incident, July 27, 2009, was overturned. However, the Division's finding of abuse as to a second incident on July 6, 2009, remained in place. Defendant filed a request for further review before the Office of Administrative Law (OAL).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Meanwhile, plaintiff sought reconsideration of the denial of her earlier request to suspend all parenting time. By July 2010, the OAL hearing still had not taken place, nor had the Division initiated a Title 9 or Title 30 action. The Family Part judge\n   overseeing the matrimonial action entered an order setting a plenary hearing for October \"on the issue ... whether it is in the best interests of ... [Richard] that parenting time with his father ... should resume.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   No hearing took place, as issues and disputes continued to arise regarding expert witnesses. In January 2011, the judge appointed Dr. Jennifer L. Perry, Psy.D., as the court's expert, and charged her with evaluating \"when and in what manner it w[ould] be in the best interest of ... [Richard] to resume parenting time with his father ....\" The parties' litigious conduct continued; it is unnecessary to detail the reasons for, or results of, various court appearances that followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In a February 2012 order, the judge provided copies of Dr. Perry's reports to counsel, and the parties again appeared before the court on April 2, 2012. Although the order entered that day indicates the judge took \"sworn testimony,\" there was no testimony. After listening to the arguments of counsel, the judge prohibited defendant \"from any and all contact with\" Richard, \"with the exception of the supervised visitation with Dr. Perry or any other visitation ordered by th[e] court.\" The judge permitted the parties to engage in discovery and set new dates for a plenary hearing in July 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In May 2012, defendant withdrew his administrative appeal of the Division's substantiated finding of abuse. No plenary hearing took place during the summer of 2012. In November, a different Family Part judge took over the litigation, and a plenary hearing began in January 2013 and continued on non-consecutive days until May. The parties thereafter submitted written proposed factual findings and legal conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 22, 2013, the judge issued an oral opinion on the record explaining the reasons supporting his order filed that day\n   (the November 2013 order). The record reflects only defense counsel was present; plaintiff's counsel had a court appearance in another county, was running late and the judge decided not to wait.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The judge found by clear and convincing evidence, that defendant had sexually abused Richard. The order granted plaintiff sole legal and physical custody of Richard and denied defendant parenting time. Section 3 of the order required that, before making any application for parenting time, defendant\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   shall comply with the requirements set forth by Dr. Jennifer Perry in her testimony, which include:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   a. Admission of wrongdoing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   b. A psycho-sexual evaluation by a professional specializing in same; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   c. Individual therapy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In Section 4, the order further provided that, \"[i]f and when the [d]efendant completes the aforementioned requirements, he may apply for consideration of parenting time through Therapeutic Management of Reunification (TMR).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In his oral opinion denying both parties' requests for counsel fees, the judge noted plaintiff's counsel's request was \"vague,\" and he did not \"know whether she's going to do something. Some post judgment motion probably ....\" The November 2013 order simply denied both parties' requests for counsel and expert fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff sought reconsideration, asking the order specifically include the judge's finding that defendant had sexually abused his son, and modifying the order to clarify\n   that her request for fees was denied without prejudice. The judge granted the motion for reconsideration and entered the January 10, 2014 order (the January 2014 order) that stated defendant \"sexually abused\" Richard, and denied plaintiff's request for fees without prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The January 2014 order reiterated the requirements of the November 2013 order imposing preconditions on defendant's future applications for parenting time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff submitted a request for fees. Defendant's opposition never asserted an inability to pay. Rather, defendant claimed plaintiff was solely responsible for the plenary hearing, because she refused to accept Dr. Perry's initial recommendation of TMR. Defendant asserted the \"proper forum for this case should have been ... a proceeding initiated by the Division.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After conducting a hearing, the judge rendered an oral opinion and memorialized it in his June 9, 2014 order (the June 2014 order), requiring defendant to pay plaintiff $60,000 in attorney fees and $2488 in costs in monthly installments of $10,000. The order further provided that \"these fees and costs shall not be dischargeable in bankruptcy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant moved for reconsideration and plaintiff cross-moved to enforce the award. In his certification, defendant, for the first time, asserted an inability to pay counsel fees awarded to plaintiff. The judge's August 29, 2014 order (the August 2014 order) granted defendant's motion in part, reducing the monthly installments to $500, but denying all other relief. The judge denied plaintiff's request for counsel fees in opposing the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff filed another motion for reconsideration, seeking an order reducing the counsel fee award to judgment, as well as an award of additional fees for making the motion. Defendant cross-moved, seeking a stay of the award and counsel fees for opposing the motion. The judge's February 4, 2015 order (the February 2015 order) denied plaintiff's motion and granted defendant's\n   motion in part, awarding him $2520 in counsel fees as an offset against the award previously made in favor of plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In A-3230-14, defendant appeals the November 2013 order that followed the hearing; the January 2014 order that granted plaintiff's motion for reconsideration and added additional terms to the original order; the June 2014 order awarding plaintiff counsel fees; and the August 2014 order largely denying his request for reconsideration of the fee award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In A-3256-14, plaintiff appeals from the August 2014 order reconsidering the fee award and the February 2015 order denying her motion for reconsideration. We calendared the cases back-to-back, and now consolidate them for purposes of issuing a single decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In A-3230-14, we reverse those provisions of the November 2013 and January 2014 orders that required defendant to \"comply with [certain] requirements\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[p]rior to\" making \"any application for parenting time\" with his son, but otherwise affirm. We affirm in A-3256-14.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    As to A-3230-14\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    [At the court's direction, Section I of its opinion, which concerns discrete issues, has been redacted from the published opinion because it does not meet the criteria set by\n    <em>\n     R.\n    </em>\n    1:36-2(d) for publication. The published parts of the opinion continue as follows.]\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In Point II, defendant argues the provisions of the November 2013 and January 2014 orders requiring his admission of \"wrongdoing\" \"[p]rior to\" making \"any application for parenting time\" violate his constitutional right against self-incrimination. As a corollary argument, defendant claims the judge erred in relying on Hoch's and Perry's opinions that his admission of wrongdoing was a necessary predicate to TMR, because they were \"net\" opinions unsupported by any indicia of scientific reliability. In response, plaintiff only contends defendant failed to raise the issue in the\n   trial court, and Richard's best interests require defendant's admission of abuse before TMR can commence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Preliminarily, defendant's claim that the opinions expressed by Hoch and Perry were net opinions lacks sufficient merit to warrant discussion.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:11-3(e)(1)(E). Defendant also suggests Perry never conditioned parenting time, or initiation of TMR, upon his admission of wrongdoing. However, in responding to a question from the judge, Perry said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   I would say that if ... Your Honor determines that sexual abuse has occurred and a perpetrator is not willing to admit to that and get the services needed in order to prevent that-or reduce the likelihood of that occurring again, ... there should be no visitation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff is correct that defendant never raised a constitutional challenge to conditioning future applications for parenting time upon an admission of wrongdoing, and we\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   adhere[ ] to th[e] long-standing principle[ ] ... 'that our appellate courts will decline to consider questions or issues not properly presented to the trial court when an opportunity for such a presentation is available unless the questions so raised on appeal go to the jurisdiction of the trial court or concern matters of great public interest.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    State v.

On the one hand, there are clearly cases of imagined or even fabricated charges against a parent, especially when raised during the pendency of divorce proceedings. For a parent to stand accused of such an offense is devastating both to that individual, and to the child's lifelong relationship with the parent. On the other hand, proof of such abuse, especially involving a very young child, is rarely clear, and the potential danger to a child from a reoccurrence, if the suspicions and accusations are well-founded, is enormous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    P.T. v.

Defendant might have properly moved for reconsideration, but his failure to do so should not bar our consideration of this significant issue. Moreover, the record is complete, because both Hoch and Perry testified at length, were subject to extensive cross-examination and defendant eschewed any opportunity to present his own expert on the subject of TMR or any necessary preconditions. Lastly, whether the provisions violate defendant's constitutional rights raises a purely legal issue, and even if the trial judge were afforded the opportunity to consider the argument, we would review his decision de novo.\n   <em>\n    Motorworld, Inc. v.

Undoubtedly, this litigation has been protracted, contentious and, on occasion, unnecessary. However, defendant has consistently denied that he abused his son, and so testified at trial. Clearly, the judge rejected this\n   testimony and found, by clear and convincing evidence, that defendant had sexually abused Richard. The judge also clearly accepted Perry's testimony that not only was defendant's admission of wrongdoing a necessary precondition to effective therapy and future parenting time, but also that defendant must undergo individual therapy and submit to a psycho-sexual evaluation before the process can begin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Putting aside preconditioning any application of defendant's admission of wrongdoing, which, as explained above, violated defendant's constitutional rights, we conclude imposition of these other preconditions violated defendant's right to invoke the equitable powers of the Family Part to modify its order denying him any parenting time. It may well be that any future application may fail, absent defendant's efforts to address the very issues Perry saw as vital to the gradual reinstitution of parenting time. However, the court should not reach that conclusion in advance of such a request. Although the judge undoubtedly made a good faith attempt to foreclose unnecessary motion practice in what had been an excessively litigated case, these provisions of the November 2013 and January 2014 orders improperly restrict defendant's right to seek further review by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We vacate Section 3 and 4 of the November 2013 order and sections 4 and 5 of the January 2014 order.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    [At the court's direction, Section III of its opinion, which concerns discrete issues, has been redacted from the published opinion, because it does not meet the criteria set by\n    <em>\n     R.\n    </em>\n    1:36-2(d) for publication.
