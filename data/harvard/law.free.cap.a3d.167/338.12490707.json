Maio, a police officer with the New Haven Police Department (department), sought such reimbursement from the defendant, the city of New Haven, after he was acquitted of charges of sexual assault in the fourth degree and unlawful restraint\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for conduct involving two young women that allegedly occurred while he was working an \"extra duty\" shift at a local nightclub. When the defendant declined to reimburse the plaintiff in accordance with \u00a7 53-39a, the plaintiff brought this action for indemnification. Following a trial, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   claiming that the trial court improperly (1) instructed the jury on the meaning of the phrase \"in the course of [the officer's] duty\" as that language is used in \u00a7 53-39a,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) precluded the defendant's use of the testimony of two key state's witnesses at the plaintiff's criminal trial, namely, A and J, the complainants and alleged victims of the plaintiff's claimed misconduct (complainants). Although we disagree with the defendant's claim of instructional impropriety, we agree that the trial court improperly prohibited the defendant from using the complainants' prior testimony and, further, that\n   evidentiary error was not harmless. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant is entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On April 18, 2008, the plaintiff was scheduled to work an \"extra duty\" shift at Bar, a nightclub located on Crown Street in New Haven. In the early hours of April 19, 2008, as patrons were leaving Bar, the complainants approached Christopher Kelly, then a lieutenant in the department, in the street outside Bar and reported that they had been sexually assaulted by the plaintiff. The plaintiff subsequently was arrested on charges of sexual assault in the fourth degree and unlawful restraint in the second degree and placed on administrative leave. He eventually was acquitted of all charges, however, and, thereafter, he commenced this indemnification action against the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 53-39a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The case proceeded to a jury trial, at which the plaintiff presented testimony from several officers for the purpose of demonstrating that he was acting \"in the course of his duty\" for purposes of \u00a7 53-39a while performing his \"extra duty\" shift at Bar. Specifically, the plaintiff sought to demonstrate that he was entitled to indemnification notwithstanding his admission that he was physically present inside Bar in violation of General Order 82-1, an order of the department that provides that an officer assigned to an extra duty shift at a bar or nightclub may not enter that establishment except in certain limited circumstances\n   not applicable to the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   These officers, as well as the plaintiff,\n   testified that the department's rules proscribing the plaintiff's conduct were routinely violated without sanction and that high-ranking department officers were aware of such violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the plaintiff testified that his interactions with the complainants on the night in question were benign and professional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   defendant countered with testimony from ranking police officers who maintained that the plaintiff's presence inside Bar violated the department's orders and was not authorized, either explicitly or implicitly, by the plaintiff's superior officers. In addition, the defendant sought to introduce into evidence, under \u00a7 8-6(1) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the criminal\n   trial testimony of the complainants concerning their encounter with the plaintiff. After finding that neither complainant was \"unavailable\" within the meaning of \u00a7 8-6, however, the trial court denied the defendant's request and barred the defendant's use of the complainants' prior testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, awarding $187,256.46 in attorney's fees, accrued compensatory time, and lost overtime. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion seeking judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a new trial. In that motion, the defendant conceded that \"[t]he phrase, 'in the course of his duty,' is construed consistent with the meaning of 'course of employment' under workers' compensation law,\" and that an employer's acquiescence in the otherwise prohibited conduct of an employee is one consideration in determining whether an officer is acting \"in the course of his duty\" under \u00a7 53-39a. Specifically, the defendant observed that, \"[a]s the [c]ourt instructed the jury,\n   General Order 82-1 was in effect at the time of this incident and constituted a binding workplace rule and regulation,\n   <em>\n    unless the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    hief of\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    p\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    olice and other ranking administration officials were aware of and tolerated a consistent pattern of violations of that order\n   </em>\n   , such that the [d]epartment acquiesced in a pattern or practice of disregard of the General Order.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, \"[a]s a part of his burden of proof in this case, [the plaintiff] was obligated to establish that violations of General Order 82-1 were ignored by, not merely lower-ranking ... officers [of the department], but by [high-ranking] officials of the [d]epartment.\" The defendant contended that the plaintiff had failed to prove that his supervising officers had acquiesced in his presence inside Bar. Finally, the defendant claimed that the court had improperly excluded the complainants' prior testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court denied the defendant's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court explained that, contrary to the defendant's claim, the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that the plaintiff remained within \"the course of his duty\" while inside Bar because the plaintiff's supervising officers were aware of, and had acquiesced in, similar violations of General Order 82-1 in the past. The court also rejected the defendant's contention that the court improperly had declined to admit the complainants' former testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the meaning of the phrase \"in the course of his duty\" in accordance with principles borrowed from workers' compensation law\n   and that the court improperly relied on such principles in rejecting the defendant's motion for postverdict relief. The defendant also contends that the trial court improperly excluded the testimony of the complainants after declining to find them \"unavailable,\" as required by \u00a7 8-6 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence for the introduction of\n   former testimony. Although we conclude that the defendant's first claim lacks merit, we agree with the defendant's claim under \u00a7 8-6, and, therefore, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case for a new trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant first contends that the trial court improperly relied on workers' compensation principles in instructing the jury on the meaning of the phrase \"in the course of his duty\" under \u00a7 53-39a and in denying the defendant's postverdict motion. The defendant objects generally to the trial court's application of workers' compensation principles to \u00a7 53-39a, and specifically to the use of the principle that an employer may \"acquiesce\" in a particular practice by an employee, thereby making it a permissible \"incident of the employment.\" As the foregoing procedural history demonstrates, however, the defendant failed to object to the use of such principles at trial, even in its motion for postverdict relief. Indeed, the record reveals that the defendant itself drew on workers' compensation principles in its request to charge and supplemental request to charge and, in fact, that it expressly requested that the court charge the jury in accordance with the principle of\n   \"employer acquiescence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore conclude that the defendant's claims\n   regarding the construction of the statutory phrase \"in the course of his duty\" were not properly preserved for appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 (this court \"shall not be bound to consider a\n   claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although we would not ordinarily address the defendant's unpreserved statutory interpretation claim, we do so here because the issue necessarily will recur on retrial. Doing so is appropriate, moreover, because the claim involves a question of law briefed by both parties, and because the defendant cannot prevail on the claim.

See General Statutes \u00a7 31-275(1).

The defendant argues that, under a strict interpretation of the statute, the plaintiff could not be physically present within Bar in violation of the department's orders while remaining \"in the course of his duty\" under \u00a7 53-39a, and, indeed, that police officers working \"extra duty\" shifts generally would not be covered by \u00a7 53-39a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In arguing that we should overrule\n   <em>\n    Link\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rawling\n   </em>\n   , however, the defendant overstates the difference between workers' compensation principles and those principles that underlie indemnity statutes like \u00a7 53-39a. Indemnification, like workers' compensation, serves the remedial purpose of making an employee whole after suffering losses closely related to his or her employment. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Norwich\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Silverberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559688\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/367/#p369\">\n    200 Conn. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369, 374,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=511%20A.2d%20336\">\n    511 A.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986) (municipal indemnification statute protecting employee from costs of action incurred \"while acting in the discharge of his duties\"; General Statutes \u00a7 7-101a [b]; was \"designed to furnish some relief for injustice that would otherwise attend our [well established] doctrine of sovereign\n   municipal immunity\"). Moreover, workers' compensation statutes, like indemnity statutes, are in derogation of the common law and governmental immunity.

During this time, the legislature has amended \u00a7 53-39a on multiple occasions without overruling this interpretive approach.

When neither of the complainants appeared to testify at trial, however, the defendant moved to have their prior testimony from the criminal trial admitted into evidence under \u00a7 8-6(1) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. At the hearing on the defendant's motion, the defendant sought to demonstrate due diligence, as required for a finding of unavailability under \u00a7 8-6, by detailing its efforts to procure the complainants' attendance at trial. Counsel for the defendant first represented to the court that he \"repeatedly\" had been in touch by telephone with A, who lived in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, and that she had agreed to testify. Counsel further explained, however, that, on the eve of the trial, A indicated that she might have other plans, and thereafter stopped responding to counsel's calls. Counsel also informed the court that he had been in contact with J, an East Haven resident, \"as recently as last week,\" and stated that she had also agreed to testify at the indemnification trial. Thereafter, counsel telephoned J \"repeatedly\" but was unable to leave a voice message. \"[I]n an abundance of caution,\" he had also sought to have her served with a subpoena when she first indicated she might not be willing to attend. A judicial marshal then testified that he had tried unsuccessfully to serve J with the subpoena, going to her house five times during the prior week and attempting to serve her at work once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Notwithstanding counsel's efforts, the trial court concluded, with respect to A, that, even though she was out of state and not amenable to subpoena in a civil action, the court could not find her \"unavailable\" in view of counsel's failure to attempt to \"preserve her testimony\" by deposition. The court made a similar finding as to J, the in-state witness, observing that counsel had sufficient time before trial to depose both complainants: \"So what I'm saying is ... that through the discovery process, you had an opportunity to notice\n   ... the depositions of both young ladies.... [Y]ou [c]ould have ... secure[d] their ... testimony by way of deposition.\" The court further explained that \"[J] is more compelling against not allowing her former testimony because she's right here in East\n   Haven. Her deposition could have been secured months ago.\" On that basis, the court excluded the former testimony of both complainants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In its motion to set aside the verdict, the defendant argued that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendant had not exercised due diligence in procuring the complainants' attendance at trial, in part due to the imposition of a deposition requirement. The court denied the defendant's motion, concluding, once again, that the defendant \"had ample opportunity to preserve the testimony of [the complainants] through deposition and did not do so.\" The court also determined that it was not permitted to rely on the representations of counsel regarding the defendant's efforts to secure the complainants' attendance and, therefore, was required to disregard the defendant's explanation of the complainants' sudden change of plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court incorrectly predicated its finding of unavailability on the defendant's attempts to procure depositions from the\n   complainants and that the court also incorrectly believed that it could not properly rely on defense counsel's representations regarding the complainants' unavailability. Because we agree with both of the defendant's claims, we conclude that the trial court improperly declined to admit the complainants' former testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, the trial court incorrectly required that the defendant attempt to depose the complainants as a precondition to the admission of their former testimony. In assessing whether a declarant is \"unavailable\" for the purpose of admitting evidence under an exception to the hearsay rule, we have stated that this court follows the definition of the term \"unavailable\" in rule 804(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

Rule 804 (a) (5) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that a declarant may be considered \"unavailable\" if he \"is absent from the trial or hearing and the statement's proponent has not been able, by process or other reasonable means, to procure: (A)\n   <em>\n    the declarant's attendance\n   </em>\n   , in the case of a hearsay exception under [r]ule 804 (b) (1) [\n   <em>\n    former testimony\n   </em>\n   ] or (6); or (B)\n   <em>\n    the declarant's attendance or testimony\n   </em>\n   , in the case of a hearsay exception under [r]ule 804 (b) (2), (3), or (4).\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, as the Judiciary Committee's notes on rule 804 explain: \"The [c]ommittee amended the [r]ule to insert after the word attendance the parenthetical expression (or, in the case of a hearsay exception under subdivision (b) (2), (3), or (4), his attendance or testimony).

As the federal rules make clear, however, the deposition requirement discussed in\n   <em>\n    Schaffer\n   </em>\n   applies only to certain exceptions to the rule against hearsay, such as statements against penal interest under rule 804(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and it does not apply to prior sworn testimony under rule 804(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, the trial court's insistence that the defendant should have attempted to depose the complainants runs counter to the clear guidance provided by the federal rules and our established reliance on their provisions for assessing unavailability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, imposing the additional\n   hurdle of a deposition makes little sense in the context of prior sworn testimony. A deposition requirement applies to statements against penal interest because those statements do not necessarily provide the same indicia of reliability as sworn testimony, which is virtually identical to in-court testimony for purposes of reliability.

Accordingly, the court was not required to disregard the defendant's representations on the issue of its diligence in procuring the complainants' attendance-the sine qua non of unavailability under our case law-even in the face of opposing counsel's objection to the use of such representations. Our conclusion in this regard is buttressed by the fact that the plaintiff's objection to defense counsel's representations was based solely on the assertion that the trial court was not permitted to rely on such representations in determining the reasonableness of counsel's efforts to secure the complainants' attendance at trial, and not on any claim that the representations were inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In light of the interrelatedness of these errors, we cannot tell whether the trial court would have reached the same conclusion had its opinion been grounded in an accurate reading of the law. Nor can we view these errors as harmless, because, as the trial court repeatedly acknowledged and the plaintiff effectively conceded at trial, the complainants' testimony was critical to the defendant's claim that the plaintiff was not\n   <em>\n    acting\n   </em>\n   in the course of his duty during the relevant time period, even assuming that his employer acquiesced in his presence inside Bar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norwalk Hospital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345364\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/241/#p254\">\n    299 Conn. 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 254-55,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20A.3d%20364\">\n    9 A.3d 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (\"[A]n evidentiary impropriety in a civil case is harmless only if we have a fair assurance that it did not affect the jury's verdict....

Indeed, both the trial court and the plaintiff acknowledged that the complainants were the only two witnesses who could contradict the plaintiff's testimony regarding the details of their interaction at Bar.

While there, he heard what sounded like a bottle breaking, and when he stepped out of the office onto the landing to investigate, he heard \"laughing and giggling\" emanating from a private staff bathroom on the second floor and noticed that the weighted \"European style\" doors had not been properly closed. Upon pushing the door open, he saw the complainants. The plaintiff told them that they were not permitted to be there, but the complainants simply dismissed him, grabbing his notepad and writing, \"Officer Maio, I [heart] you.\" One complainant tried to put her hand to his mouth.
