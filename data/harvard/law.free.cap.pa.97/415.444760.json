The defendant pleaded specially, inter alia, \u201c that by the contract of insurance entered into by plaintiff and defendant, the said plaintiff expressly promised and agreed to pay all premiums or assessments within thirty days after notice of the levy and demand for the same; that a levy and assessment had been duly and regularly levied and made, and due and legal notice thereof given to said plaintiff and demand for the amount of said levy and assessment for more than thirty days before said alleged damage or loss by fire, and the said plaintiff neglected and refused to pay the same; that it was expressly agreed that said policy should not be in force if said plaintiff neglected or refused to pay said assessments, and that said plaintiff was in default when said loss occurred,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-12\">On the trial, before Ingham, P. J., the following facts appeared : On February 10th 1870, the Lycoming County Mutual Insurance Company issued to the plaintiff a policy of fire insurance on the mutual plan, insuring a tannery and contents, situate in Nicholson township, for $1266. In consideration thereof, the plaintiff gave his premium note for $316.50, which amount he thereby promised to pay \u201c in such proportion and at such time or times as the directors of said corporation may, agreeably to their act of incorporation, require.\u201d He made a cash payment of $15.82 on the date of the note, and paid two assessments, Nos. 27 and 28, levied in September 1870, and in September 1871, respectively. The property was destroyed by fire on March 1st 1872. The company resisted payment on the ground that the plaintiff was in default, and his policy suspended, by reason of non-payment within thirty days after notice and demand of an additional assessment known as No. 29, made by the directors October 19th 1871. The plaintiff contended that this assessment was not lawfully made. The minute-book of the company showed, that at a meeting of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>directors on the 19th October 1871, the following resolution was adopted:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">\u201c Whereas, the losses by fire in Pennsylvania have been heavy within the last few months, and recently an extraordinary fire has occurred in the city of Chicago, involving a large amount of loss to the company, therefore resolved, that an assessment of twelve and a half per cent, be mad'e on all premium notes held by the company, and in force on the 10th day of October A. D. 1871.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-7\">On or about November 9th 1871, the following notice was served on the plaintiff:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-8\">\u201c$39.56.

The court decline to say to the jury that the assessment must be considered valid in law and binding upon the assured.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-6\">In the general charge, the court said, inter alia:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-7\">\u201c The defence to the plaintiff\u2019s claim is that the plaintiff neglected to pay his assessment on his premium note for more than thirty days after demand, and that the loss occurred while such assessment remained unpaid. This would be a good defence if both facts alleged were established by the evidence \u2014 the demand for the payment of an assessment and neglect to pay it, was jjroven. But the fact of the assessment is not sufficiently established. The burden is upon the company of proving the assessment; it is an official act of the officers of the company, and the proof should be olear and satisfactory. The minute-book of the company has been given in evidence, showing that on the 19th of October 1871, a resolution was passed by the board of directors, as follows: * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-8\">\u201c This is the first step in making an assessment, but the act is not complete until the officers designate the amounts to ho paid by each individual whose promissory note is held by the company. Such a statement is essential to the business of collecting; it is preliminary to the issuing of partial duplicates to the several collectors, and it is important to every stockholder in the company. [While perhaps the form of this record is immaterial, yet it cannot he an assessment if it does not set forth the name of the maker of the note and the amount assessed upon it. There is no evidence that such an assessment was made on the premium note of the plaintiff in this case, nor does the notice of an agent that such an assessment had been made supply the defect. Notice that something had been done, which had not been done, is a mere nullity.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-9\">Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for \u00a71742.

The notice to the plaintiff supplied the necessary information, and the plaintiff, by failing to pay within thirty days, or before the fire took place, had no right to recover: Hummel\u2019s Appeal, 28 P.

In other words the company cannot assess a man\u2019s premium note without saying so, any more than a county can tax an individual without assessing him by name: Catlin <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 267; Greenough <em>v. </em>Fulton Coal Co., 24 P.

No <em>recovery </em>can be had for a loss sustained during the continuance of such default: Hummel Appeal, 28 P. F. Smith 320; Columbia Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Buckley, 2 Norris 293; Washington Mutual Fire Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Rosenberger, 3 Id. 373; Crawford County Mutual Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Cochran, 7 Id. 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The main contention here is, whether the alleged assessment was actually made on the 19th of October 1871. It is known as assessment No. 29. The minute-book of the company duly proved, show's that a meeting of all the directors was held on that day, and the following preamble and resolution were adopted: \u201c Whereas the losses by fire in Pennsylvania have been very heavy within the last few months, and recently an extraordinary fire has occurred in the city of Chicago, involving a large amount of loss to the company, therefore Resolved, that an assessment of twelve and a half per cent, be made on all premium notes held by the company, and in force on the tenth day of October 1871.\u201d The secretary of the company .testified that, in pursuance of that resolution, an assessment was made on all the premium notes, as directed by the board of directors. Among the others, an assessment.was made on the premium note of the defendant in error. H. A. Smith testified that he, as agent of the company, sent a notice of this assessment, No. 29, to the defendant in error about the first of December 1871. The learned judge thought there could be no assessment that did not set forth the name of the maker of the note, and the amount assessed upon it, and therefore charged there was no evidence that such assessment was made on the premium note of the defendant in error, nor did the notice of an agent, that such an assessment had been made, supply the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">In holding that an assessment could not be valid unless the resolution levying it set forth the name of the defendant in error, and the sum assessed on his note, there was error. We believe a reference to the maker of each note by name is unusual and wholly unnecessary. The resolution covered all notes in force at the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>specified. It imposed a specific percentage on each. That is certain which may be made certain. It was very easy to ascertain the sum imposed on each note. The work was merely clerical, and could be readily performed by any person who understood the multiplication table. The precise sum he was required to pay was ascertained and stated in the notice sent to him. lie was therein required to pay the specific sum within thirty days, and also reminded of the by-law which declared the policy to be null and void unless so paid. It is true a notice of an assessment, when, in fact, none had been made, would not supply the defect. But that is not this case. The notice showed him the precise sum the percentage produced, and relieved him from making the calculation. Levying a specific percentage-on a note of a certain and fixed amount, is wholly unlike fixing a rate of taxation on land on which the valuation is not yet ascertained. Until the valuation of the land is determined, no computation can show the sum to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">There is some force in the argument of the counsel for the defendant in error, that the record does not show clearly what portion of the deposition was received in evidence. There is, however, an assignment to meet each view of the case. If the part to which we have referred was rejected, it was error. If it was admitted, then it was error to charge there was no evidence of an assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Much useless contention appears to have arisen on the trial, when the witnesses on the part of the plaintiff in error referred to the amount of the premium note. The amount of it was distinctly stated on the foot of the policy which tho defendant had already given in evidence. We think the evidence was amply sufficient to submit to the jury to find whether the assessment had been made. In so far as the objections covered by the assignments are in conflict with this opinion they are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
