He presented the certificates, together with the letters testamentary, granted to him in New Jersey, and a certificate from the surrogate that he was the duly authorized executor, whereupon the bonds with the coupons were handed over to him by the defendants, and he gave to the company the receipt endorsed on the certificates. The bonds and coupons were then taken by Rogers to New Jersey, where they were appraised and entered in the inventory of the decedent\u2019s estate, filed by Rogers in the surrogate\u2019s office in Burlington. Rogers, subsequently, in 1875, sold the bonds and misappropriated the proceeds.

Subsequently on June 23d 1880, the court entered judgment for the defendant on the point reserved. No opinion was filed.

The Act of 1705, which gave validity to foreign letters testamentary, was repealed by the Act of 1832, which prohibited foreign executors from intermeddling with assets here. Since then enabling acts have made exceptions as to certain public securities, but they do not cover United States bonds. The policy of our law is not to permit any part of decedents\u2019 estates to be removed without administration here: Alfonso\u2019s Executors\u2019 Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith 347; Moore <em>v. </em>Fields, 6 Wright 473; Sayre <em>v. </em>Helme, 11 P. F. Smith 299, 301; Reeside <em>v. </em>Reeside, 6 Phila. R. 507; Appeal of Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Co., 7 Norris 499. The position of Rogers was that of an executor <em>de son tort, </em>whose every representative ac-t in this state was void. His receipt was valueless: Roumfort <em>v. </em>McAlarney, 1 Norris 197. The uniform course of decisions since the Act of 1832,. has been that the assets here can only be distributed by our Orphans\u2019 Court, upon an account filed by an executor or administrator of the <em>situs, </em>and that all acts without a local administration are void: Dent\u2019s Appeal, 10 Hands 514; Bingham\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 345; Freeman\u2019s Appeal, 18 Id. 151; Van Dyke\u2019s Appeal, 31 Leg. Int. 69; Parker\u2019s Appeal, 11 P. F. Smith 478; Stokely\u2019s Estate, 7 Harris 476. The Act of 1832 enacts that foreign letters testamentary shall not confer <em>any </em>of the powers possessed by an executor under letters granted within this state. This negatives the right to receive a voluntary payment, as well as the right to sue: Scott on the Intestate Law 35. There is no distinction between government bonds and other evidences of property found within the state so far as administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>is concerned: Strode <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 2 P. F. Smith 181; Reading Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania, 15 Wallace 284. The will created a trust of the bonds for the widow and children^ of which the bailees were bound to take notice, and reasonable care would have required them to give notice to the widow. For their negligence in disregarding both the law and the trust in the will the defendants are liable in trover or case: Safe Deposit Co. <em>v. </em>Pollock, 4 Norris 391; Neiler <em>v. </em>Kelley, 19 P. F. Smith 405.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-6\"><em>A. Sydney Biddle </em>and <em>George W. Biddle, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ana\">By the general common law a foreign executor cannot sue for assets in another jurisdiction without taking out letters there, and giving security. But his title is recognised to receive a voluntary payment, and to give a valid acquittance therefor, provided no ancillary letters have previously been granted. The payment being voluntary, the executor has not \u201c intermedled\u201d: Wilkins <em>v. </em>Ellett, 9 Wall. 740; Wharton Conflict of Laws, 2d ed., sect. 626. The Act of 1832 repealed the Act of 1705, and restored the common law. The sole duty of an ancillary administrator is, after paying domestic creditors, to pay over the assets to the executor of' the domicile. In this case there were no domestic creditors, and the bailees did directly what would have resulted indirectly if they had paid an ancillary administrator. Mrs. Ackley\u2019s security would have been no greater, because Rogers, being domiciled here, could have obtained ancillary letters without giving security. Therefore, even if the delivery to Rogers was a technical conversion, it was <em>damnum absque </em>injuria, and the measure of damages is nominal: Hutchins <em>v. </em>State Bank, 12 Metc. 421.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-7\">But United States bonds are not assets \u201cwithin this Commonwealth they are not suable anywhere. They could not be attached here as \u201c goods, chattels and credits of the decedent within this Commonwealth.\u201d Neither could they have been collected by an anciliary administrator, <em>c. t. a., </em>as \u201csuch goods, chattels, and credits.\u201d The government was the debtor, and the <em>sit?io </em>of the debt, if anywhere, was at Washington. The <em>situs </em>of the <em>evidence </em>of the debt is nothing. The bonds may have been anywhere within the United States. State laws cannot restrict the transferability of United States securities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-8\">Apart from any question of administration, Rogers could have sued for the bonds in his own name, as the holder of the certificates of deposit, or he could have assigned the certificates to a third person who could have sued : Moore <em>v. </em>Fields, 6 Wright 467.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b177-9\">Chief Justice Sharswood</author>\n<p id=\"AsX\">delivered the opinion of the court, March 7th 1881.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">This case has been very ably and elaborately argued, and all the authorities examined and commented on. We do not, however <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>deem it necessary to discuss the several questions presented. The main contention of the plaintiff in error is grounded upon the provision of the sixth section of the Act of March 15th 1832 (Pamph. L. 136), that \u201cno letters testamentary, or of administration or otherwise, purporting to authorize any'person to intermeddle with the estate of a decedent, which may be granted out of this Commonwealth, shall confer upon such person any of the powers and authorities possessed by an executor or administrator under letters granted within this state.\u201d In speaking of this act Mr. Justice Woodward remarked in Moore <em>v. </em>Fields, 6 Wright 471: \u201c This section of the Act of 1832, suggested to the minds of the codifiers by what was said in McCullough <em>v. </em>Young, 1 Binn. 63, was merely declaratory of the common law, according to which the title of executors and administrators cannot <em>de jure </em>extend beyond the territory of the government which grants it, and the movable property therein.\u201d It has been earnestly maintained that upon the proper construction of the statute the foreign executor or administrator not only cannot sue in the courts of this state, for any of the debts or assets of the decedent, which certainly must be conceded to be settled; but that he cannot receive or give a valid acquittance upon a voluntary payment or delivery, even where it does not appear that there are any domestic claimants upon the estate. The current of authorities, where the rule of our statute is recognised as the common law, does not sustain this position : Williams <em>v. </em>Storrs, 6 Johns. Ch. 357; Parsons <em>v. </em>Lyman, 20 New York 112; Klein <em>v. </em>French, 57 Miss. 667; Wilkins <em>v. </em>Ellett, 9 Wall. 740. The point has never been decided in this state. We do not think it necessary to decide it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">. There is another point which, we think, disposes of the question upon this record. We do not consider that the United States coupon bonds which are the subjects of this controversy, were at the time of the death of the decedent, any part of his estate in this Commonwealth. The defendants were the mere depositaries of the bonds for safe-keeping. They were, therefore, in the possession of the decedent. He held the certificate of their deposit. The defendants were bound to restore the bonds at any time to the lawful holder of the certificate. It was as if the bonds had been placed in a fire-proof of the defendants, of which the decedent possessed the key. In point of fact, the certificate was in the actual possession of the widow of the decedent in New Jersey. She surrendered it as she was bound to do, to the foreign executor. She could not have withheld it. The New Jersey executor could have sued her, and compelled its delivery to him. The Pennsylvania administrator certainly could not. By the terms of the certificate it might be transferred by assignment indorsed thereon and approved by the company. The foreign executor could' haye so assigned it, and his assignee could have sued for the delivery of the bonds, in his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>name. The assignment would have been a sale of the bonds, which were payable to bearer, and passed by delivery. Whoever showed a legal title to the certificate had a right to the possession of the bonds. The case, then, is within the principle of Moore <em>v. </em>Fields, <em>supra, </em>where it was held that, whore a debt fixed by a decree or judgment of the court of another state in favor of a foreign administrator, is due by citizens of Pennsylvania to the estate of a decedent, the administrator of the foreign domicile may sue lor and recover it in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
