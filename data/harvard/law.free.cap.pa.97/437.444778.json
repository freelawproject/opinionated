On July 8th 1876, \u25a0judgment was entered against the said defendants by default for want of an affidavit of defence, and damages assessed for $439.20.

The original suit is for store goods sold to said Barbara Wadlinger, who was a married woman at the time of the purchase and delivery of the same, and at the time suit was brought and judgment rendered against her, and that deponent is not liable for the same. That the said Barbara Wadlinger is a married woman, being married to deponent and living with him as such for about twenty-one years. That said goods were purchased to retail in a dry goods and grocery store, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>and not for necessaries for herself or any of her family, nor for any other purpose which would render her liable in said action against her.

Jones </em>(with him <em>Seth W. Greer), </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au6\">The judgment against Barbara Wadlinger was absolutely void and has been stricken off the record. The judgment was opened as to John Wadlinger, and if this judgment against the bail be allowed to stand, we may have to pay the amount of our recognizance, while there is no judgment in the original case. This is a clear caso of principal and surety, and payment by the surety ought not to be enforced until the liability of the principal be determined: Patterson <em>v. </em>Swan, 9 S. &amp; R. 16; Morrison <em>v. </em>Hartman, 2 Harris 55; Corson <em>v. </em>McAfee, 8 Wright 288; 1 Tr. &amp; H. Prac., sec. 1040. The recognizance is conditioned for the payment of the \u201cjudgment debt,\u201d but there is no judgment debt due by Barbara Wadlinger, and the judgment has been opened as to John Wadlinger, and the question of its validity as to him has not yet been decided.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-9\"><em>A. W. Schalck </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2Z\">The Act of 20th March 1845, sec. 1, Purd. Dig. 635, pi. 8, directs that \u201c the bail in all cases * * * for stay of execution shall be bail absolute * * * in double the amount of the debt or damages, interest and costs recovered, conditioned for the payment thereof, in the event that the defendant fail to pay at the expiration of the stay of execution.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-10\">This clearly defines the nature of the contract, which is made by the law, and is virtually a bargain between the surety and the court; for the plaintiff below is perfectly powerless in the premises. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Jones\u2019s contract was then and there made with the court, and in consideration of the court\u2019s granting the Wadlingers a stay of execution, he (Jones) then and there (in the language of the statute), became \u201c bail absolute, to pay the debt, interest and costs if the defendants failed' to pay at the expiration of the stay of execution.\u201d The stay expired, and the defendants failed to pay as stipulated, and Stephen Jones\u2019s liability to pay the debt, interest and costs thereby matured; it became absolute, unqualified and unconditional, and justice and equity require that it should be enforced: Leonard <em>v. </em>Duffin, 9 W. N. C. 155.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b440-6\">Mr. Justice Mercur,</author>\n<p id=\"Ajab\">delivered the opinion of the court May 2d 1881.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The main question in contention here is this: When .a person has become bound by recognizance as bail for stay of execution in a judgment against a husband and his wife, and after the stay has fully expired, can he relieve himself from liability by showing the judgment was improperly taken against the wife?</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">The equitable demand of the plaintiff in the judgment is unquestioned. The defence which it is now alleged the wife might have successfully made rested on her personal privilege, which she did not interpose. She suffered judgment to be entered against herself and her husband jointly. They were satisfied to let it stand. They voluntarily gave security to obtain the benefit of a stay of execution. The bail voluntarily assumed the liability whereby he delayed the plaintiff for nine months in collecting the judgment. At the expiration of that time his liability became fixed. . The terms of his recognizance bound him to pay it. The legal requirements of the statute commanded him to pay it. It has not been reversed or vacated. The naked averment in the affidavit that the judgment is absolutely void, is the expression of an opinion which is wholly insufficient to prevent judgment being entered in this case. No fact is stated showing its invalidity as against the husband. Suppose it should be proved to be void as against the wife by reason of her personal disability, it nevertheless remains in full force against her husband: Unangst <em>v. </em>Fitler, 3 Norris 135; Hope <em>v. </em>Building Association, not yet reported; Leonard <em>v. </em>Duffin, 9 W. N. C. 155. A striking off the judgment against the wife would not impair its validity against her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The probability is the judgment would have been collected long before the nine months expired,\u2019if it had not been prevented by the intervention of the plaintiff in error. He now stands in a very unfavorable position to invoke the aid of any equitable principle to relieve him from his legal obligation: Gibbs &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Alberti, 4 Yeates 373; Armstrong\u2019s Appeal, 5 W. &amp; S. 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">The other objection that a copy of the whole record of the judgment should have been filed is without force. This action was on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the recognizance. A copy of it was filed. That is all which the law or rule of court required: Keyser et al. <em>v. </em>Dialogue, 4 W. N. C. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
