A., on August 6th 1868, agreed in writing to pay B. a sum of money in August 1870; immediately afterwards A. presented to B. an account of moneys previously advanced by him to B., or to B.\u2019s use. On February 2d 1869, A. wrote to B., in answer to a letter received from him, stating that he preferred to give no reply, and that he placed his papers in the hands of counsel; also calling B.\u2019s attention to the fact that he seemed to have forgotten that A. had paid him certain amounts. In August 1870 B.\u2019s counsel wrote to A.\u2019s counsel, demanding payment of the full sum due from A. to B. by the terms of the agreement in writing. A.'s counsel answered that A. would pay the amount, less the sums paid by A. to and for B., as appeared by the account theretofore furnished. B.\u2019s counsel replied, declining <em>the </em>offer. In an action brought on March 6th 1875, by B. against A., to recover the amount due on the instrument in writing : <em>Held, </em>that the rendering of the account by A. to B. had not prevented the Statute of Limitations from running against the same, and that therefore A. could not set up the amount due on the account as a set-off to B.\u2019s claim. <em>Held, further, </em>that there was nothing in A.\u2019s letter to B., or B.\u2019s silence after its reception, which would estop B. from setting up the bar of the Statute of Limitations to A.\u2019s claim of set off. <em>Held, further, </em>that there was nothing in the correspondence between B.\u2019s counsel <em>and </em>A.\u2019s counsel which suspended B.\u2019s right of action, or amounted to a promise by B. to pay the account, or constituted an agreement by him that it should apply as payment on the contract, so as to bar <em>the </em>running of the Statute of Limitations thereon, and enable A. to take advantage of the same as a set off.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b63-7\">January 10th 1880.</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AoP\">Before Sharswood, C.

The court, subsequently, in an opinion by Allison, P. J., entered judgment on the point reserved in favor of the plaintiff, for $6018.98. This sum was arrived at on* the following basis: The items in the account pleaded as set off were allowed, so far only as corroborated by the corresponding items in the letter of February 2d 1869, from F. J. Verrier to the plaintiff, together with interest on said items from their respective dates to August 31st 1870, when the sum agreed on in the contract became due. This sum was deducted, as a set off, from the $6000 due by the contract, and interest was allowed on the balance to the date of entering judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-9\">The plaintiff took this writ of error, assigning for error (1, 2, 3), that the court erred in entering judgment on the point reserved, when the record does not show a special verdict finding the facts, or case stated, nor w\u2019hat question of law was reserved; (4 to 7), that the court erred in deciding, that the alleged payments by decedent in his lifetime, to the plaintiff, could be set off; that plaintiff is estopped from setting up the bar of the Statute of Limitations against defendant\u2019s claim of set-off; and in entering judgment for $6013.98.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-10\"><em>J.

Nor does the record show'what the reserved question of law w\u00bbas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-11\">[Sharswood, C. J. \u2014 Was any exception taken below to such action of the court ?]</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-12\">No; but it has been repeatedly ruled by this court, that this practice presents nothing for adjudication and is erroneous. This court has reversed for this reason alone, although agreeing in opinion with the court below: Ferguson <em>v. </em>Wright, 11 P. F. Smith 258; Miller v. Bedford, 5 Norris 457; Clark <em>v. </em>Wilder, 1 Casey 314; Irwin <em>v. </em>Wickersham, Id. 316; Wilson <em>v. </em>Tuscarora, Id. 317.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-13\">The doctrine of equitable estoppel <em>in pais </em>has no application to this case. The court below held, that the plaintiff\u2019s silence after receiving the account of August 12th 1868, and the letter of February 2d 1869, estopped him from denying the payments on account of the contract sued on. That there was no positive evidence of denial by plaintiff is, because he was not a competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>witness to testify to such denial. But the letter of February 2d 1869, contains evidence in itself, that the account had been objected to by the plaintiff Florencio says, in reply to a letter from plaintiff, which evidently did not admit the set off, \u201c It would seem that you have forgotten that I paid you \u201d various sums, &amp;c. Moreover the conflicting state of the credits in the letter and in the account, make it impossible to ascertain any definite sum as the \u201c balance struck \u201d on an account stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-6\">Further, in October 1870, plaintiff\u2019s counsel demanded the full amount of the bond. The plaintiff neither said nor did anything, nor admitted anything, which induced Florencio to act on the supposition that the alleged payments were admitted as credits on the bond; and Florencio did not in any way alter his position by reason thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-7\">But even if the account or letter be treated as an account stated, it was so stated more than six years prior to the bringing of this suit. The plaintiff made no acknowledgment which would give Florencio the right to sue on an implied promise arising out of the account stated, after the expiration of six years. At the expiration of this period he is equally prevented from setting up the payments as a set-off.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-8\">The instrument sued on recites that \u201c both parties have mutually fixed the plaintiff\u2019s interest at the sum of $16,000, but inasmuch as a different amount is found in the testamentary settlement of their parents\u2019 estates, they by special agreement have fixed it at the above-named sum.\u201d This instrument was therefore in the nature of a compromise, fixing the amount due by Florencio at the date of the agreement, viz., August 6th 1868. Yet all the items of the account, claimed as set off (save one) are prior in date to this agreement, and several of them are for \u201ctestamentary expenses\u201d which, it is fair to assume, were included in the \u201ctestamentary settlement\u201d referred to in <em>the </em>agreement. They are all more than six years before this suit was brought. No claim of set-off appears to have been made when the agreement was executed and the $10,000 paid. In any aspect of the case, we contend that the Statute of Limitations is a bar to the alleged set-off, and that no silence can create an estoppel which is not strong enough to toll the bar of the statute.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-9\">(No counsel appeared and no paper-book was presented contra.)</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b67-10\">Mr. Justice Trunkey</author>\n<p id=\"A0\">delivered the opinion of the court, January 24th 1881.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">The contract is dated August 6th 1868, recites a transaction on which Edmond J. Verrier had received $10,000, leaving a balance due him of $6000, which sum is agreed to be paid by Florencio to Verrier, in August 1870.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>As appears in the bill of' exceptions, in August 1868, Florencio rendered an account to Edmond, containing a number of items amounting to $8797.67. On February 2d 1869, he wrote to Edmond, as follows : \u201c Your letter of the 28th ult. is so characteristic, that I prefer giving it no reply. I place all the papers in the hands of Mr. Guillou, who will see Mr. Biddle. It would seem that you have forgotten, that on September 9th 1867, I paid you $600, on October 28th 1867, $680, August 5th 1868, your share of testamentary expenses, as per receipt of Esunbanio Pomental, $494; and August 12th 1868 for your various bills, &amp;c., of Antonio\u2019s ($56) $521, total $2295.\u201d In the account, or letter, it is nowhere stated that the money was paid or received to apply on the contract. All the items were anterior to its date, except one, and that was six days posterior; the whole account was two years before the money became due on the contract, and the letter was written a year and a half before. There is no evidence of an agreement that the account should apply as payment. At most, it can only be inferred that the account was correct, because no objections were made within a reasonable time. An account rendered to a party indebted by his creditor, and not objected to in a reasonable time, is prima facie evidence against the party to whom it is rendered. The tone of the letter of February 2d, is not consonant with Florencio\u2019s belief that Edmond had admitted the account correct, by silence, or otherwise! But, for the purposes of this ease, let it be conceded' that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Florencio\u2019s right of action existed at and before the time he rendered the account; it accrued more than six years before he filed the plea of set-off, and more than six years before this suit was commenced. Had he' brought a suit to recover the account, more than six years after the right had accrued, the statute would have been an effectual plea in bar; it is just as effectual when replied to the claim pleaded as set off. Sending the account to Edmond, did not suspend his right to bring suit, or the running of the Statute of Limitations. Mutual demands do not extinguish each other. The letter was written over six years prior to this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Nothing in the correspondence between the counsel for the parties suspended the right of action, or amounted to a promise to pay the account, or constituted an agreement that it should apply as payment on the contract. The mere fact that Mr. Guillou mentioned that statements had been furnished to Edmond, to which Mr. Biddle made no reply, cannot prejudice the client. If it could there would be no safety in placing a claim in the hands of an attorney for collection. There is not a particle of testimony that Mr. Biddle had authority to admit the account, or that he knew anything about it; his business was to collect the money on the contract, and shortly after it became due, he demanded the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The first demand was Mr Biddle\u2019s letter of October 18th 1870. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Honce, it is a mistake to say, that when the \u201c plaintiff first made demand for the payment of the $6000, a detailed statement of the several sums claimed to be of right deducted therefrom, was promptly presented.\u201d There is no proof that the plaintiff demanded the $6000 before it became due. As already observed, the detailed statement was sent immediately after the date of the contract, and not a word therein, nor in the letter of February 2d 1869, shows that the account was claimed as a proper payment in reduction of the principal sum named in the bond. Florencio's last letter was not a request that his claim be applied on an obligation not then due; nor was it a statement that he would so apply it. lie awaited no answer, held the plaintiff at arms\u2019 length, and gave notice that he placed the papers in the hands of his attorney. How could the plaintiff\u2019s silence mislead him ? What word or act did the plaintiff utter or do, tending to induce belief that he would apply the account as payment? As we view the evidence, none whatever. We see no ground for application of the equitable principles of estoppel, so well stated in the opinion of the learned judge of the Common Pleas. We think it very clear, that he did nothing more than receive the account as sent, without returning any objection, and that only made it prima facie evidence against him. It is not pretended, that such an act by a debtor thereafter forever estops him from pleading the statute as a bar. In no sense can it operate as an estoppel. The statute runs from the date the account is rendered, if it be then due, as it would against any other simple contract debt. To avoid the statutory bar, the defendant contends, that the plaintiff\u2019s silence was an admission of the claim of payment ; but no claim of payment on this contract was made; the claim was an account of payments to and for the plaintiff\u2019 only. It is very clear that it is barred, whether the statute runs from the time he made such payments, or from the date he rendered the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In this case, there is no difficulty in entering judgment upon the verdict; for there is no evidence to warrant the jury allowing the set off against the bar of the statute. The verdict was subject to the point reserved, whether upon the evidence defendant was entitled in point of law to the set-off claimed by him. Had there been sufficient evidence for submission, this would not be a good reservation of a point: Ferguson <em>v. </em>Wright, 11 P. F. Smith 258; Wilson <em>v. </em>Steamboat Tuscarora, 1 Casey 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Judgment reversed, and judgment is now rendered on the verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $9163.92.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
