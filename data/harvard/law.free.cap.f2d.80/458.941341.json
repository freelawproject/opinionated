Grandview Bldg. Ass\u2019n,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did, that is, file an equitable action to reform the policy in the state court, after he had lost his action on it in the federal court, we are not informed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-22\">Neither findings as required under Equity Rule 70% (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nor opinion were filed. Appellee seems to think that it was upon the theory of protecting the court\u2019s jurisdiction. It argues that its bill was ancillary to the law action in which the judgment was that the plaintiff take nothing. It insists that, filed to preserve and enforce the jurisdiction of the federal court, it is not a suit to stay proceedings in the state court within the prohibition of section 265, Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 379.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-23\">We think it plain that it is Lehman v. Spurway (C.C.A.) 58 F.(2d) 227. The whole purpose, \u201cthe great object of the suit is to enjoin and stop litigation in the State courts, and to bring all the litigated questions before the Circuit Court. This is one of the things which the Federal courts are expressly prohibited from doing.\u201d Haines v. Carpenter, 91 U.S. 254, 257, 23 L.Ed. 345; Wells Fargo &amp; Co. v. Taylor, 254 U.S. 175, 41 S.Ct. 93, 65 L.Ed. 205. The decision of the question whether, as appellee contends, plaintiff has not pleaded a case for reformation, hut is merely trying to rel\u00edtigate matters already decided, is for the court of the forum he selected. Northern Assurance Co. v. Grandview Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-24\">But the invoked statute aside, the injunction should not have issued, for there was no equity in the bill. All, in effect, that it alleged was that plaintiff, having failed to obtain a judgment in the law action in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the federal court, was now .seeking to re-litigate the same matter in the state court under the pretense of an equitable action to reform. 'If this is all the plaintiff is seeking, defendant needs but to plead his federal court judgment as a bar. If plaintiff is seeking more, if his suit is really a well-founded action to reform, defendant cannot prevent his maintaining it with effect, either by enjoining its prosecution, or by pleading the former judgment in bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Appellant\u2019s suit does not, as did those cited by appellee,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> constitute or threaten any interference with the jurisdiction of the federal court properly asserted over a res. Nor is appellant\u2019s bill grounded in the equity of preventing the enforcement of a judgment obtained by fraud, as the bill was in Wells Fargo &amp; Co. v. Taylor, supra. Appellant\u2019s bill alleges no ground for the injunction, but the bringing of a suit in personam to obtain a personal judgment. ' It is fundamental that a bill for injunction merely alleging that a suit is to be or has been brought upon an invalid claim does not state a case for injunction. Cavanaugh v. Looney, 248 U.S. 453, 39 S.Ct. 142, 63 L.Ed. 354; Boise Artesian Hot &amp; Cold Water Co. v. Boise City, 213 U.S. 276, 29 S.Ct. 426, 53 L.Ed. 796; Northport Power &amp; Light Co. v. Hartley, 283 U.S. 568, 51 S.Ct. 581, 75 L.Ed. 1275. The reason for this is well stated in' the last-cited case: \u201cThe only injury alleged is the result of the suit in the State Courts. So far as appears that result will ensue only upon a decision against the appellant. It is an odd ground for an injunction against a suit that the suit may turn out against the party sued. If the action is based upon an unconstitutional law and if the trial court upholds it, still the appellant can protect its rights as fully in the State Courts as elsewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">If appellant\u2019s suit is, as he maintains, within Northern Assurance Co. v. Grandview Bldg. Ass\u2019n, supra, the state courts are competent to give him judgment, notwithstanding the adverse judgment he suffered in the law action. If it is not, the state courts are competent to say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The decree is reversed, and the cause is remanded, with directions to dismiss the bill.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-16\"> Allen v.
