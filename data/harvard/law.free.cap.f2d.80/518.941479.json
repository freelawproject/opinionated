Rohe &amp; Bro. (D.C.) 218 F. 182, and United States v. Northwestern Fisheries Co. (D.C.) 224 F. 274, and it was there held that this proviso was confined to farmers, butchers, and retail dealers, and does not apply to plants whose products were inspected and passed by the inspection officers. These cases arose in 1914 and 1915, and as the government took no steps to review them or question their rightness in other cases, we assume the government had adopted the view of these two cases and acted on it for the past twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The judge below followed such construction; consequently, he was in no error in holding, as he did, that \u201cthe affidavit of defense raising questions of law \u00bf ;msv. ined and judgment is directed to be entered for the defendant,\u201d and such judgments are now affirmed by this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
