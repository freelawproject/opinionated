By a decree entered on February 28, 1925, while appellant was a minor, in a cause to which appellant and appellee and other beneficiaries under the will were parties, the estate of the testator was ordered distributed to the parties entitled thereto, except' that a described fund was adjudged to be held by the appellee as trustee, from which fund he was ordered to discharge said legacy to appellant. Pursuant to that decree appellee paid out of that fund all legacies charged against it, except the legacy to appellant, leaving therein the sum of $5,000, which was retained by the appellee in trust for the appellant. On September 11, 1925, appellee deposited the sum of $5,000 in the Merchant\u2019s National Bank of Brownsville, Tex., taking therefor an interest-bearing certificate payable to \u201cD. Yturria, Trustee,\u201d and bearing 4 per cent, annual interest. At the time of making that deposit the Merchant\u2019s National Bank was a solvent, reputable institution, and so continued until the 24th day of March, 1932, when it was taken over by the Comptroller of the' Currency, through a named receiver, at which time the amount owing on said certificate, with accumulated interest, was the sum of $6,270.56, for which amount appellee made proof of claim to said receiver, who issued to appellee on August 22, 1932, the receiver\u2019s certificate, drawn in favor of \u201cD. Yturria, Trustee.\u201d Two receiver\u2019s dividends were paid by the receiver to appellee, one of $1,379.52 on December 27, 1932, the other on January 10, 1934, of $1,442.22, each of which amounts on the day of its receipt by appellee was deposited by him in the State National Bank of Brownsville, Tex., he taking that bank\u2019s certificate therefor, payable to \u201cD. Yturria, Trustee.\u201d Appellant reached the age of twenty-one on September' 17, 1933, without having married. On September 30, 1933, appellee tendered to appellant the above-mentioned receiver\u2019s certificate and the above-mentioned first-dated certificate of deposit issued by the State National Bank of Brownsville, Tex., in settlement of appellant\u2019s claim for said legacy, and in satisfaction of appellee\u2019s obligation as trustee under the above-mentioned decree, which offer was refused by appellant. Upon appellant reaching the age of twenty-one, she made prompt demand upon appellee for the $5,000, in response to which demand the appellee made the above-mentioned tender. Thereafter appellee kept that tender good, and, upon, appellant, on April 21, 1934, bringing this action against appellee to recover the sum of $5,000, with interest thereon from the date of the above-mentioned decree, appellee tendered to appellant and deposited in the registry of the court below said receiver\u2019s certificate, subject to the two above-mentioned credits indorsed thereon,, together with the sum of $2,840.82, that sum being the principal, with accrued interest, of the two above-mentioned certificates of deposit issued by the State National Bank of Brownsville, Tex., which certificates were surrendered to that bank and cashed by it to enable appellee to make said deposit in the registry of the court below in cash. The court ruled against the claim asserted by appellant\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">In behalf of the appellant, it was contended that appellee\u2019s deposit of the $5,-000 in the Merchant\u2019s National Bank in .the manner above stated had the effect of an appropriation of that sum to his individual use, with the result of making him liable to appellant for that sum upon the failure of the depositary bank. That contention is not sustainable. By procuring from that bank its certificate for the amount deposited, made payable to \u201cD. Yturria, Trustee,\u201d that bank was put on notice that the fund represented by that certificate was not the individual property of the depositor, but was a fund held by him in a trust relation, though the' name of the cestui que trust was not stated or disclosed; and that fund could not be applied, by the depositary bank or another, on the individual indebtedness of the depositor.

It was not claimed that appellee would have incurred the liability asserted if the certificate of deposit had been made so payable, the depositary bank being of good repute when the deposit was made. 26 R.C.L. 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">The ruling complained of was not erroneous. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
