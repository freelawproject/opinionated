In her fiduciary return of income for each of those years, petitioner reported the total amount of income received, .but treated it as having been received under five trusts, instead of one, one-fifth of the total being treated as the separate income of each trust. Taxes were paid on that basis for the year 1926, the aggregate amount thereof being less, of coitrse, than it would have been had petitioner treated the income in question as that of a single trust. For 1929 no tax was paid, one-fifth of that year\u2019s net income being within the exemption allowed by law. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held that there was but one trust. He accordingly determined tax deficiencies aggregating $8,759.97. His determination was sustained by the Board of Tax Appeals. The board\u2019s decision is before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-25\">The only question in the case is whether the instrument executed by William Mc-Ginley' on February 1, 1926, created five trusts or one. This instrument, called a \u201cdeclaration of trust,\u201d is, in fact, a trust deed. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-26\">\u201cKnow all men by, these, presents that I, William McGinley, of the Village of Wiimette,' County of Cook, State of Illinois, in consideration of the sum of One Dollar ($1.00) to me paid by Gertrude Mc-Ginley hereinafter named Trustee' herein, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>edged and in further consideration of the love and affection which I hear to my children hereinafter mentioned, and in consideration otf the trusts herein contained, hereby give, assign and transfer irrevocably unto said Gertrude McGinley in trust as hereinafter provided 12,500 shares of the capital stock of the Fulton Oil Company, and 12,500 shares of the capital stock of the Rice Oil Company, corporations duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Montana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">\u201cTo have and to hold the said shares of stock unto said Gertrude McGinley, and any other Trustee or Trustees who may at any time be appointed to carry out the trusts hereunder, all hereinafter referred to as my Trustees, in trust, to hold said shares of stock, to collect all the income and dividends thereof and after paying therefrom any taxes or other public charges and any necessary expenses of carrying out these trusts, to invest and reinvest the residue theierf as part of the original trust estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">\u201cThe said trustee shall act at all times without bond; and shall have the right to sell, trade or transfer any part or all of the trust estate herein created at any time as the same may seem expedient, and may loan or re-invest the proceeds of sale in other stock or bonds as may best serve the interest of the trust estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">\u201cMy said Trustees shall divide said trust estate hereby created into five (5) equal shares, one (1) share to be held in trust for each of my five (5) children, Thomas K. McGinley, John Jacob McGinley, Mary Emily McGinley, Richard McGinley and Jane McGinley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">\u201cWhen any one of my said children shall have arrived at the age of twenty-one (21) years my said Trustee shall pay over to said child the income on his share of said trust estate until he shall have attained the age of thirty-five (35) years whereupon my said Trustee shall pay and deliver over to said child his share of the principal of said trust estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">\u201cShould any of my said children die without leaving issue before attaining the age of thirty-five years, then the share of the child so dying shall he divided into as many parts as I have children then surviving, and one part shall be added to the share of each of the children so surviving; it being further provided that th,e living issue of any child so dying shall have the parent\u2019s share.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-11\">\u201cIn event of the death of Gertrude McGinley, Trustee herein mentioned, I, William McGinley if living shall become automatically trustee of the trust estate herein created; and if I should be not living at the time of the death of Gertrude McGinley, then my brother John L. Mc-Ginley, if living shall automatically become Trustee of the trust estate herein created; and should the said John L. Mc-Ginley be not then living, then the American Trust Company of St. Louis, Missouri, shall become automatically the trustee thereafter until the termination of the said trust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">This instrument created one trust, not five. Langford Investment Co. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.5) 77 F.(2d) 468, 470; Wynne v. Commissioner (C.C.A.5) 77 F.(2d) 473; Commissioner v. United States Trust Co. (C.C.A.2) 75 F.(2d) 973, 976; State Savings Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.7) 63 F.(2d) 482, 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">William McGinley, called as a witness for petitioner, testified \u201cthat he had two intentions in executing the trust instrument here in question; first, and most important, was to leave an estate for each one of the above children in equal amounts, so that they might have the income accruing thereto and the income be delivered to them as they became of age, twenty-one years; and the corpus of the trust, of the estate, was to be delivered to them when they were thirty-five years of age. That the second object in executing the trust was to avoid any more taxes from the earnings of that fund than was necessary, and that he attempted to split the trust into five separate parts making a separate, independent trust for each child and let each child use his or her part of the income, which was the next action which he understood was done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-14\">This testimony was apparently disregarded by the Board of Tax Appeals, and, we think, properly so. It is true that, on the question we are considering, the trustor\u2019s intention is controlling, but this intention is to be ascertained, not from his testimony, but from the instrument which he executed. See authorities cited above. His intention, as evidenced by this instrument, was to create a single trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
