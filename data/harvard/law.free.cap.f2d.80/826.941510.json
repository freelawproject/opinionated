The charge was of possession of distilled spirits in unstamped containers (section 1152a, title 26, U.S.Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1152a) ; and the evidence was that the defendant with his family occupied the first story of a building from which a stairway ran to a cellar below in which the spirits were found in unstamped cans. In the second story lived the defendant\u2019s lessor, a widow living with her daughter and son. Access to the cellar could also be had from the street by a door and from a garage in the rear, occupied by a poultry dealer. The defendant tended the furnace. The spirits, i. e., alcohol, were discovered by chance; a fire broke out in the cellar and the firemen found it when they entered. The defendant was present, and burned his hands trying to put it out. In talk with the battalion chief in command at the time, \u201cThere was something said about leaving half,\u201d to which the chief replied, \u201cWhen the cops come they take all, they won\u2019t leave half.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">It seems to us that there was not enough evidence to support a verdict. There were two other possible possessors of the alcohol besides the defendant \u2014 the poultry man and the widow\u2019s son. We cannot sec any reason \u00e1 priori to choose any one of the three as against the other two. The only conceivable makeweight is the defendant\u2019s inquiry about leaving half the alcohol; but whether this was a request or from idle curiosity does not appear. Perhaps upon a new trial more may be developed which will show that the defendant showed such concern with the preservation of the alcohol as would justify the inference that it was his; hut, when liberty is at stake, the record as it reads appears to us too insubstantial for conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">Judgment reversed; new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
