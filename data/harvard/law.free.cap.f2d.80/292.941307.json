The offenses charged constitute violations of sections 193 and 1184 (now sections 1397 (a) (1) and 1440), and section 247 (now section 1152 (a) of title 26, U.S.C. (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1152(a), 1397(a)(1), 1440).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-20\">The principal contentions are;</p>\n<p id=\"b325-21\">(1) That the search warrant under which the 37 gallons of moonshine whisky were seized was not legally issued, and that therefore the convictions under counts \u2022 5 and 7, arising out of the possession of this particular whisky, must be set aside;</p>\n<p id=\"b325-22\">(2) That there was no evidence that the appellant carried on the business of a retail liquor dealer in violation of the internal revenue laws; and</p>\n<p id=\"b325-23\">(3) That if she did she was acting under the coercion of her husband, in whose presence the sale on December 7, 1934, was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-24\"> The principal question is whether the search warrant was valid. The affidavit and search warrant describe with sufficient particularity the place to be searched and the property to be seized. However, while the convictions charged were violations of the internal revenue laws, the search warrant was not issued thereunder, but was issued under the search warrant provisions of the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, tit. 11, \u00a7 1 et seq., 40 Stat. 228 (now title 18, \u00a7 611 et seq., U.S.C., 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 611 et seq.). The internal revenue laws require that the affidavit upon which the warrant is issued shall be sworn to by an internal revenue officer, and that the warrant shall be directed to such officer. Title 26, \u00a7 1195 (now section 1502), U.S.C. (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1502). This section makes no provision for seizure, and it has been held that seizure cannot be made thereunder. Kempf v. United States, 33 F.(2d) 4 (C.C.A. 1). But see May v. United States, 199 F. 53, 62 (C.C.A. 8). Seizure is specifically provided for in the Espionage Act, and was expressly authorized in this search warrant. The affidavit was executed by one George David, who was not an internal revenue officer. The search warrant' authorized one Delmar Coyle, among others, to make the search. Coyle was a member of the United States Alcohol Tax Unit, and a civil officer of the United States. The affidavit and warrant complied with the terms of the Espionage Act as to search warrants (title 18, \u00a7 611 et seq., U.S.C., 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 611 et seq.) ; and if that act controls, the warrant, the search, and the seizure were valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-25\">We think that the search warrant was valid because the search and seizure provisions of the Espionage Act cover felonies arising under the internal revenue laws. They were assumed to be applicable for se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>curing evidence of felonies arising under statutes other than the Espionage Act in a number of federal cases, though the point was not definitely decided. Cf. Veeder v. United States, 252 F. 414 (C.C.A.7); Munch v. United States, 24 F.(2d) 518 (C.C.A.5). Moreover, the original enactment of the Espionage Act and its legislative history indicate that Congress meant the search and seizure provisions to be applied to any felony arising under statutes of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The Espionage Act contains a clause which states, among other things, that the purpose of the act is \u201cbetter to enforce the criminal laws of the United States.\u201d 40 Stat. 217. The act provides (title 11, \u00a7 2, subsec. 2, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 612(2) that a search warrant shall issue \u201cwhen the property was used as the means of committing a felony.\u201d The offenses charged in the indictment in this case are felonies (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 541). The phrase is unlimited in meaning and application. The subsection covers any felony arising under any federal statute. Moreover, in the codification of the United States Code' as enacted by Congress on June 30, 1926, title 11 of the Espionage Act (the search and seizure provision) was separated from the substantive provisions defining and creating a new and special group of offenses against the government (title 50, \u00a7 31 et seq., U.S.C. 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 31 et seq.) and was placed in title 18, U.S.C., Criminal Procedure. We think that congressional approval of the arrangement of the sections in the codification supports the view, otherwise arrived at, that it was the legislative intention to make the search warrant provisions of the Espionage Act applicable to all felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Appellant contends that if the Espionage Act is construed so as to apply here, title 11, \u00a7 23 of that act (title 18, \u00a7 633, U.S.C., 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 633) is nullified. This section provides that the enactment of the Espionage Act shall not impair nor repeal the existing provisions of law regulating the issuance of search warrants, including those of the internal revenue laws. However, the broadening of provisions for search and seizure as applied to felony cases cannot be construed as an impairment or repeal of existing search warrant provisions. They provide a cumulative remedy which in no way diminishes the force of title 26, \u00a7 1195 (now section 1502), U.S.C. (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1502).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Since search and seizure in this case were based upon a statute applicable to all felonies arising under United States statutes, the affidavit and search warrant were valid, and the conviction under counts 5 and 7 must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Upon the second question, there was substantial evidence that the appellant carried on the business of a retail liquor dealer in violation of the statute. The record shows that four men visited appellant\u2019s residence, entering at the side of the house, into the kitchen. David testified that he asked if appellant could serve them with drinks. Appellant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know you two fellows but these two gentlemen I know and I think it will be all right,\u201d and then sold them \u201cfour shots\u201d of moonshine liquor, serving them in regular one and a half ounce whisky glasses. Four bottles of beer were also served. The kitchen was fitted up with a table and benches in a so-called boctth. After the whisky and beer had been served, one of the men, Stone, purchased a pint bottle of whisky. The photographs in evidence indicated that the bottle had an obliterat\u00e9d stamp, which the record shows to have been on the bottle at the time of purchase. These surrounding circumstances,' together with the various sales made in the transaction of December 7, 1934, constituted evidence' sufficient to support the conviction on counts 1, 2 and 4. Sodini v. United States, 261 F. 913 (C.C.A.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Appellant\u2019s husband was present when the sale was made. Appellant denies that she ever saw David or knew him or his companions, and denies serving any drinks, to him or his associates in her home. However, she contends if she did make the sale, she was making it under her husband\u2019s coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The.modern statutes dealing with the status of women have modified the common-law rule that a woman violating a statute in the presence of her husband is presumed to be acting under his coercion. The independence of women in political, social, and economic matters rightly places upon them an increased responsibility. We find no reversible error in the refusal of the court to charge as requested upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">The conviction and sentence are sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
