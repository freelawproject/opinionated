In respondent\u2019s income tax returns for 1928 and 1929, the interest on these bonds was not included as taxable income. \u25a0The -Commissioner of Internal Revenue held that it should have been so included, and accordingly determined deficiencies in respondent's income taxes for those years in the aggregate amount of $4,060.28. Respondent petitioned the Board of Tax Appeals for a redetermination. The Board reversed the Commissioner and held that there was no deficiency. 30 B.T.A. 556. The Board\u2019s decision is now before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The bonds in question were acquired by respondent from R. H. Moulton &amp; Co. by bills of sale, absolute on their face, purporting to transfer and assign the bonds to respondent at prices therein specified. The bonds were paid for and delivered in accordance with the bills of sale. The Commissioner asserts that, although, in form, these transactions were purchases and sales :of bonds, they were intended to be and were, in fact, loans of money by respondent to R. H. \u2018Moulton &amp; Co., secured by pledge of the bonds in question, and that the bonds never were, in fact, the property of respondent. Respondent asserts that the transactions were, in fact, what they purported- to be, namely, purchases and sales of bonds, which thereby became and were respondent\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The issue thus presented is one of fact, which the Board of Tax Appeals has \u25a0decided in favor of respondent. The Board found that the transactions referred to were actual purchases, not loans of money secured by pledge, and that the bonds belonged to and were the property of respondent. This finding is supported by substantial evidence and is, therefore, conclusive. Burnet v. Leininger, 285 U.S. 136, 138, 52 S.Ct. 345, 76 L.Ed. 665; Phillips v.
