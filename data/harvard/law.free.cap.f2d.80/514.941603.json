Plaintiff sought to enjoin the defendant from using the words \u201cA11 White\u201d on its labels, in the sale of shoe polishes and cleaners and further from simulating the label, of the plaintiff, used on bottles and cartons containing the plaintiff\u2019s product. After a hearing, the judge below entered a decree dismissing the bid of complaint, from which action the plaintiff brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">In his oral opinion the trial judge held that the plaintiff had no right to appropriate the term \u201cAllwite\u201d as a trademark in connection with its product; that the words \u201cAll White,\u201d even though misspelled and consolidated into one word, were descriptive and not capable of an exclusive appropriation; that the word \u201cAllwite\u201d had not acquired a secondary meaning arising out of the use of the word with the plaintiff\u2019s name Griffin; and that the labels used by the defendant were in no way so similar to those used by the plaintiff as to lead any one to believe that the defendant\u2019s product was either the plaintiff\u2019s product or had anything to do with the plaintiff\u2019s product. In all these conclusions we concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">The words \u201cAll White\u201d are plainly descriptive and there can be no right to their use when they have no relation to the origin or the ownership of the goods. Standard Paint Company v. Trinidad Asphalt Manufacturing Company, 220 U.S. 446, 31 S.Ct. 456, 55 L.Ed. 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">The evidence does not show that the words had acquired any such secondary meaning as would justify their appropriation either as a trade-mark or trade-name by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">The labels used by the defendant were in no respect so similar to those of the plaintiff as to constitute unfair trade practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">Plaintiff relies upon the decision of this court in the case of W. G. Reardon Laboratories v. B. &amp; B. Exterminators, 71 F.(2d) 515, but the facts in that case are entirely different from the facts here presented and the principles there laid down are not controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">The decree of the court below is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b547-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
