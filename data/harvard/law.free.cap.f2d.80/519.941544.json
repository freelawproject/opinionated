We find no error in its conclusions, which are amply supported by the authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-22\">Although we are constrained by the statute in question to place the penalty on the taxpayer for failure to file a tax return even where the outcome shows she was not taxable for income on the item in dispute, we deem it proper to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>that any relief for her is beyond our power, and if relief is to be granted to her, it can only come through Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
