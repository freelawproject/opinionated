Whether the Kny-Scheerer Corporation was owned and controlled by the appellant at that time does not appear from the record. However, during the World War, the Alien Property Custodian, acting under the \u201cTrading with the Enemy Act\u201d of October 6, 1917 (40 Stat. 411), as amended (40 Stat. 460 and 1020, 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix), together with executive orders and proclamations, issued in pursuance thereof, seized the entire business and assets of the Kny-Scheerer Corporation, appellee\u2019s predecessor, including the \u201cAesculap\u201d trade-mark registration No. 34,826, dated June 26, 1900, together with all rights thereunder and the business connected therewith, and, thereafter, on June 21, 1919, sold and transferred the same to the Holley Securities Corporation, which assignment was duly recorded in the United States Patent Office on October 7, 1919, in Liber K-107, p. 297, of Transfers, of Patents. Thereafter, by mesne assignments from the PIolley Securities Corporation, , the Kny-Scheerer Corporation, and the Kny-Scheerer Corporation of America, which were duly recorded in the United States Patent Office, Liber K-107, p. 302, Liber W-112, p. 170, and Liber Q-147, p. 230, of Transfers of Patents, appellee became the owner of trade-mark registration No. 34,826, together with all rights thereunder and the business connected-therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>It further appears from the record that a trade-mark consisting of a \u201cStaff, Entwined Serpent and Crown,\u201d the serpent being entwined around the staff, and the latter being surmounted by a crown, has been used continuously by appellee, and its predecessors, on its goods sold in the United States, whether purchased from appellant or others, or manufactured by it. There is some confusion in the testimony relative to the use of the word \u201cAesculap\u201d by appellee. .Whether appellee or its predecessors actually used the word \u201cAesculap\u201d on its goods, either alone or in conjunction with' the \u201cStaff, Entwined Serpent and Crown,\u201d does not clearly appear. Nevertheless, it is clear from the evidence that the \u201cStaff, Entwined Serpent and Crown\u201d is recognized in the trade as symbolic of the word \u201cAesculap\u201d; that it is known in the trade as the \u201cAesculapius\u201d or \u201cAesculap\u201d trademark; and that, when used alone or in conjunction with the word \u201cAesculap,\u201d it signifies to the trade goods of high quality sold by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">On April 1, 1930, appellant registered the trade-mark \u201cAesculap,\u201d registration No. 269,353, for use on \u201csurgical, chirurgical, and medicinal instruments,\u201d and hospital furniture.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">On July 1, 1931, appellee filed a petition in the United States Patent Office for cancellation of that trade-mark registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The tribunals of the Patent Office concurred in holding that appellant was not entitled to the use of the mark at the time it was registered, and, therefore, ordered the registration canceled.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">On appeal, this court affirmed the decision of the Commissioner of Patents. Aktien-Gesellschaft F\u00fcr Feinmechanik, Vormals Jetter &amp; Scheerer v. Kny-Scheerer Corporation, 75 F.(2d) 638, 22 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">We think it is clear from the record that the goods of the respective parties are goods of the same descriptive properties. In fact, some of the articles mentioned in appellant\u2019s application are identical with those named in appellee\u2019s registration No. 289,280.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">It is earnestly argued by counsel for appellant that the record discloses that appellee has never used the word \u201cAesculap\u201d as a trade-mark on its goods, and that, therefore, it is not in position to oppose the registration by appellant of its trade-mark \u201cAesculap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">With reference to that contention, it may be said that, as hereinbefore stated, it clearly appears from the record that in the United States the \u201cStaff, Entwined Serpent and Crown\u201d is symbolic of the word \u201cAesculap,\u201d and is known as the \u201cAesculap\u201d trade-mark. This being so, the use by appellant of the word \u201cAesculap\u201d on its goods would tend to cause confusion in the trade as to the origin of the goods of the respective parties. See Nestle &amp; Anglo-Swiss C. Milk Co. v. Walter Baker &amp; Co., 37 App.D.C. 148; In re Maclin-Zimmer-McGill Tobacco Co., Inc., 49 App.D.C. 181, 262 F. 635; J. P. Heilbronn Co. v. Hammermill Paper Co., 48 F.(2d) 963, 18 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Although counsel for ' appellant have made a strong presentation of their reasons why appellant is entitled to register the mark \u201cAesculap,\u201d we are unable to hold, for the reasons herein stated, that the tribunals of the Patent Office reached the wrong conclusion. Accordingly, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
