Appellant timely and properly objected to the testimony of the officer touching the results of the search. The objection should have been sustained. The affidavit was insufficient to authorize the issuance of the warrant. An affidavit for a search warrant predicated upon information and belief only, and not stating any facts or circumstances or information upon which the belief is founded, is insufficient to support the issuance of a search warrant. Sutton v. State, 300 S. W. 639, and authorities cited; Simmons v. State, 7 S. W. (2d) 78. The statutes of this state penalize an illegal search. Article 4a C. C. P. 1925. Article 727a C. C.
