D. 1927, and anterior to this indictment, in the County and State aforesaid, Earl Smith did then and there unlawfully sell to G. H. Elliot intoxicating liquor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-18\">All law questions on this appeal are dependent upon whether or not such allegation is sufficient to charge an offense under the statute. The indictment in our opinion is sufficient for the reasons pointed out in Cause No. 11445, entitled J. C. Burgess, Appellant, v. State of Texas, Appellee, opinion this day rendered, not yet officially published. The reasons are fully given and the authorities cited in the opinion in said last mentioned cause and any further discussion by us would be repetition.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-19\">Believing the indictment sufficient to charge an offense and the evidence sufficient to support the verdict of the jury, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-20\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b518-5\">ON MOTION <em>FOR </em>REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b518-6\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AYb\">In the first count of the indictment it is charged that the appellant unlawfully sold \u201cintoxicating liquors.\u201d In the second count the possession for the purpose of sale of a potable liquor containing in excess of one per cent of alcohol by volume is charged. The second count was withdrawn from the jury in the charge of the court, and the verdict and judgment are upon the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The indictment is attacked upon the ground that it charges no offense in that the term \u201cintoxicating liquor\u201d insufficiently describes the liquor charged to have been sold. In Art. 666, P. C., 1925, the sale is denounced of \u201cspirituous, vinous or malt liquors or medicated bitters capable of producing intoxication, or any other intoxicant whatever.\u201d An analogous contention was made in Tucker\u2019s case, 94 Tex. Crim. Rep. 505, 251 S. W. Rep. 1090. In that case, the indictment charged that Tucker did unlawfully possess \u201cliquor capable of producing intoxication\u201d for the purpose of sale. The sufficiency of the indictment was discussed at some length in both the original opinion and in that on motion for rehearing, and upon the citation of authorities and analysis of the statute denouncing the offense, the complaint of the indictment was rejected as unsound. In one of the cases cited, namely, Ex parte Mitchum, 91 Tex. Crim. Rep. 63, the indictment attacked, in describing the liquor, called it \u201cintoxicating liquor.\u201d Keeping in mind the terms of the statute denouncing the \u201csale of spirituous, vinous or malt liquors or any other intoxicants whatever,\u201d we are constrained to the view that the indictment does not offend against either the statutory provisions set out in Sec. 7, Art. 396, C. C. P. 1925, declaring that the indictment shall set forth the offense in plain and intelligible words, or the declarations of the Bill of Rights, Art. 1, Sec. 10, guaranteeing to one accused of crime \u201cthe right to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and to have a copy thereof,\u201d and that in a felony case the prosecution must be upon an indictment by a grand jury. The case of Oats v. State, 250 S. W. Rep. 426, is not deemed in conflict with the conclusion stated in the present appeal. In the Oats case there was no averment that the liquor was intoxicating. Such an averment is essential in charging an offense under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Art. 666, P. C, and this demand was met in the present instance by the averment that the liquor sold was \u201cintoxicating liquor.\u201d Words &amp; Phrases, 2nd Series, Yol 2, p. 1176; James v. State, 49 Tex. Crim. Rep. 334; Ency. of Law &amp; Proc., Vol. 23, p. 56; Joyce on Intoxicating Liquor, p. 3; Black on Intoxicating Liquor, p. 2. In Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, page 1132, \u201cintoxicating\u201d is defined thus: \u201cProducing, or fitted to produce, intoxication.\u201d For an additional discussion of the questions presented reference is made to the original opinion in the case of Burgess v. State, No. 11,445.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">For the reasons stated, the motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
