The appellant was present. According to the officer, the appellant appeared surprised and said:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">\u201cWell, you have got me.

The appellant said: \u201cYou got me, but I don\u2019t know anything about this thing.\u201d Appellant testified that he did not own the still or any of the equipment and did not know it was there until he found it on the occasion mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-18\">The ruling of the court in receiving in evidence the declaration of the appellant mentioned above was challenged upon the ground that the appellant was under arrest or in custody, and that the receipt of the declaration was inhibited by the confession statute, Art. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>727, C.
