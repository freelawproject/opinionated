The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>term used is \u201cdid then and there unlawfully possess for the purpose of sale intoxicating liquor, against the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d The point has been specifically decided against the appellant in the case of Burgess v. State, No. 11,445, not yet reported, upon the citation of the following authorities: Tucker v. State, 251 S. W. Rep. 1090; Lenz v. State, 290 S. W. Rep. 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b179-9\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Avp\">Since the affirmance of the judgment the clerk has forwarded the statement of facts which should have accompanied the record heretofore. An examination of the evidence discloses that the appellant was in possession of a quantity of whisky under circumstances suggestive of an unlawful purpose. Under the statute (Art. 671, P. C., 1925) the possession of more than one quart of intoxicating liquor is prima facie evidence that the liquor is possessed for the purpose of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">There are no legal questions raised save that touching the indictment which was disposed of in the original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
