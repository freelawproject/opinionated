In arguing his case he attempted to narrate the facts. He was stopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>by </em>the court upon objection by State\u2019s counsel that he was stating facts not in evidence. In his argument, counsel for the State, criticising the effort of the appellant to relate the facts, stated to the jury that \u201cthe defendant did not have the nerve to take the oath as a witness before this jury and tell you anything.\u201d The court having sustained the objection of State\u2019s counsel, thereby prevented the appellant from relating his version of the facts and excluded from the consideration of the jury such facts as he had related. We think the argument of State\u2019s counsel containing the statement quoted is deemed a transgression of the statute' forbidding comment upon the failure of the accused to testify. See Art. 710, C. C. P., 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
