(2d) 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Bill of exception Number 2 complains of the action of the court in permitting the negro porter to testify that he told one of the officers that he could get some whiskey in appellant\u2019s room. It is stated as a ground of objection that the conversation had between the officer and the porter was out of the presence and hearing of appellant. There is nothing in the bill to verify the truth of the objection. , A mere statement of a ground of objection in a bill of exception is not a certificate of the judge that the facts which form the basis of the objection are true; it merely shows that such an objection was made.
