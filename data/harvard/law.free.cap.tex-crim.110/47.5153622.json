Three bills of exception are found in the transcript. One brings forward exception to the instructions given to the jury. In some respects the charge was amended in response to objection. Other objections turn on the evidence. Without knowing what evidence was before the court it is impossible to appraise these complaints..</p>\n<p id=\"b67-17\">Another bill complains at the argument of the District Attorney. We find nothing in the bill manifesting error. The argument in most instances could not be held objectionable. If the purpose of the bill was to complain that the argument was a reference to the failure of the defendant to testify it is incomplete in two particulars : (1) there is no recital in the bill advising us that he did not testify; (2) no facts are certified in the bill from which we could conclude that it was a necessary inference that the argument had reference to defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Boone v. State, 90 Tex. Crim. Rep. 374, 235 S. W. 580; Howard v. State, 1 S. W.

Such a bill presents no matter demanding consideration. Ivory v. State, 101 Tex. Crim. Rep. 123, 274 S. W. 565; Holt v. State, 98 Tex. Crim. Rep. 248, 265 S.
