The time for filing statement of facts and bills of exception expired on March 2nd, 1928. The statement of facts, and bills of exception were filed on March 3rd, 1928, which was 91 days from the time that notice of appeal was given. Under the provisions of Article 760 C. C.

If there should be any legal excuse for failure to file same within the time authorized, the burden was upon appellants to show it in connection with his motion for rehearing. He files an affidavit of the district clerk, but same contains nothing amounting to any such showing as could justify this court in holding the failure to file the statement of facts within time was excusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
