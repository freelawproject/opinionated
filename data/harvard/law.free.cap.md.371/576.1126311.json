Vol., 2000 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 6-801(o) of the Environment Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consistent with the conclusions reached by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and the Court of Special Appeals, <em>see Dyer, et al. v. Criegler, et al., </em>142 Md.App. 109, 788 A.2d 227 (2002), we shall hold that a leasing agent or real estate broker, who neither owns, holds or controls the rental property, is not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\u201cowner\u201d as defined in \u00a7 6 801(o).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgments of those courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Sheree Dyer, the petitioner, is the mother and next friend of her minor child Erielle<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> T. Wallace, on whose behalf this action was brought. Marilyn M. Gibson and Eva Criegler are the owners of # 3408 Springdale Avenue. Otis Warren Real Estate Co. (sometimes referred to as \u201cOtis Warren\u201d), the respondent, was the \u201cleasing agent\u201d or \u201creal estate broker\u201d for those premises, which it leased to Henry Goodall and Rosallee Goodall, Erielle Wallace\u2019s grandparents. From approximately December 1997 until December 1998, Erielle Wallace resided at # 3408 Springdale Avenue with her mother and grandparents. It is alleged that, during this time and at the leased premises, Erielle Wallace was exposed to, and injured by, lead based paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The petitioner filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Criegler, Gibson<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the respondent Otis War<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ren, alleging that Erielle Wallace suffered damages from lead paint poisoning and seeking damages for negligence and violation of the Consumer Protection Act, Maryland Code (1975, 1992 Replacement Volume, 2001 Cumulative Supplement), Title 13 of the Commercial Law Article. Otis Warren filed a motion pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-322(b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The Circuit Court granted that motion and ruled, as a matter of law, that neither the Lead Paint Act nor the Consumer Protection Act placed a duty on Otis Warren, whose sole responsibility was to provide a tenant for the landlord. It reasoned that, \u201cit would be unreasonable to incorporate brokers into that definition [of owner] when the broker\u2019s responsibility ceases at the time that he fulfills [t]he contractual obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. That court \u201cagree[d] with appellee and the circuit court that the Lead Paint Act\u2019s definition of an \u2018owner\u2019 must be read as a whole, meaning that only a leasing agent who owns, holds, or controls at least part of the property in question constitutes an \u2018owner\u2019.\u201d 142 Md.App. at 119, 788 A.2d at 233-34 (2002).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Since this case is about the meaning and, thus, the effect, of \u00a7 6-801(o), it is governed by well settled canons of statutory construction. The goal with which we approach the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>interpretation of a statute is to determine the intention of the Legislature in enacting it. The rules governing the conduct of that search are well settled and have been stated by this Court on many occasions. In <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore et al. v. Chase et al. </em>360 Md. 121, 128, 756 A.2d 987, 991 (2000) <em>(quoting Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. of Maryland v. Director of Finance for Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>343 Md. 567, 578-79, 683 A.2d 512, 517-18 (1996)), this Court said, on the subject:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-4\">\u201c[WJe begin our analysis by reviewing the pertinent rules [of statutory construction]. Of course, the cardinal rule is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995); <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448, 451 (1994); <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753, 755 (1993). To this end, we begin our inquiry with the words of the statute and, ordinarily, when the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, according to their commonly understood meaning, we end our inquiry there also. <em>Oaks, supra, </em>339 Md. at 35, 660 A.2d at 429; <em>Buckman, supra, </em>333 Md. at 523, 636 A.2d at 451; <em>Condon, supra, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 755; <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 145-46, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">\u201cWhere the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, a court may neither add nor delete language so as to \u2018reflect an intent not evidenced in that language,\u2019 <em>Condon, supra, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 755, nor may it construe the statute with \u201c \u2018forced or subtle interpretations\u2019 that limit or extend its application.\u2019 <em>Id. (quoting Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986)). Moreover, whenever possible, a statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory. <em>Buckman, supra, </em>333 Md. at 524, 636 A.2d at 452; <em>Condon, supra, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 755.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We have also recognized that a statute whose terms are unambiguous when considered by itself, may be rendered ambiguous when viewed in light of a related statute or when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>is part of a larger statutory scheme. <em>Chase, supra, </em>360 Md. at 130, 756 A.2d at 992. The application of these canons to the interpretation of the statute at issue produces a clear, logical and predictable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The definition of \u201cowner\u201d is clear and unambiguous. The statute limits the definition of \u201cowner\u201d to one that owns, holds, or controls at least part of the property. That becomes clear when all three of \u00a7 6-801 (o)\u2019s subsections are read together and it is understood how they relate to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The first subsection, \u00a7 6-801(o)(l), sets out the general definition of \u201cowner\u201d: \u201ca person, firm, corporation, guardian, conservator, receiver, trustee, executor, or legal representative who, alone or jointly or severally with others, owns, holds, or controls the whole or any part of the freehold or leasehold interest to any property, with or without actual possession.\u201d The critical aspect of the definition is that an \u201cowner\u201d must either \u201cown, hold, or control\u201d at least part of the property. Accordingly, under this definition, an individual can only be classified as an \u201cowner\u201d when that individual owns, holds or controls the property, or a part of it, at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The second subsection, \u00a7 6-801(o)(2), provides guidance as to whom the term, \u201cowner,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 6 \u2014 801(o)(l) includes. It does so by giving examples of interests in property short of legal or equitable title that, for purposes of the statute, are treated as ownership: a vendee in possession of the property and an authorized agent of the owner, \u201cincluding a property manager or leasing agent.\u201d It does not expand the definition of \u201cowner\u201d set out in subsection (o)(l), which it easily could have done by adding additional wording, such as: \u201cwhether or not the authorized agent owns, holds, or controls the whole or any part of the freehold or leasehold interest to any property, with or without actual possession\u201d to the end of \u00a7 6-801(o)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The third subsection, \u00a7 6-801(o)(3), provides: \u201c \u2018[ojwner\u2019 does not include: (i)[a] trustee or a beneficiary under a deed of trust or a mortgagee; or (ii)[t]he owner of a reversionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>interest under a ground rent lease.\u201d This Court has acknowledged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\">\u201c \u2018The terms \u2018owner\u2019 and \u2018owning\u2019 depend somewhat for their signification upon the connection in which they are used. \u2018To own\u2019 is defined, \u2018to hold as property; to have a legal or rightful title to; to have; to possess.\u2019 And an owner is \u2018one who owns; a rightful proprietor.\u2019 An owner is not necessarily one owning the fee-simple, or one having in the property the highest estate it will admit of. One having a lesser estate may be an owner, and, indeed, there may be different estates in the same property, vested in different persons, and each be an owner thereof.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\"><em>Weinberg v. Baltimore &amp; Annapolis R.R. (Co.), </em>200 Md. 160, 166, 88 A.2d 575, 577-78 (1952), <em>quoting Baltimore &amp; O.R.R. v. Walker, </em>45 Ohio St. 577, 16 N.E. 475 (1888).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Thus, we have held that \u201cat law the mortgagee is the owner of the property even if equity does for certain purposes treat him as merely having a lien on the land.\u201d <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Hagerstown v. Groh, </em>101 Md. 560, 563, 61 A. 467, 468 (1905) (condemnation). <em>See Commercial Credit Corp. v. State, </em>258 Md. 192, 198, 265 A.2d 748, 751 (1970) (same). <em>See also IA Construction Corp. v. Carney, </em>341 Md. 703, 716-17, 672 A.2d 650, 657 (1996) (\u201c \u2018[A]s a consequence of the influence of equity upon law, the mortgagor, while in possession and before default, is now at law regarded as the substantial owner of the property against everybody, except the mortgagee.\u2019 \u2018?(quoting Judge Eli Frank, in his work, <em>Title to Real and Leasehold Estates and Liens </em>(1912)); <em>Brittingham v. The Tugboat Underwriting Syndicate, </em>262 Md. 134, 142, 277 A.2d 8, 12 (1971). Similarly, in <em>Moran v. Hammersla, </em>188 Md. 378, 381-82, 52 A.2d 727, 728 (1947), this court referred to the holder of a ground rent lease as the owner of the land that leases it to the lessee for a certain period. This subsection consequently is a restriction on the definition of ownership, excluding interests in real property that, in the past and in other contexts, were classified by this Court as \u201cownership.\u201d Clearly, aware that these classes of persons have been classified as \u201cowners\u201d in the past, the Legislature did not want to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>expose them to liability even though they own, hold or control the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The petitioner has a different interpretation of \u00a7 6-801(o). It is that a \u201cleasing agent,\u201d without regard to control or actual ownership, is, by definition, pursuant to \u00a7 6-801(o)(2), an \u201cowner.\u201d She submits that, because it is undisputed that the respondent was a leasing agent and, therefore, falls within the definition of \u201cowner,\u201d the trial court \u201cadded a requirement not found in the statute that a leasing agent exercise a particular degree of control before liability may be found that the tenant\u2019s case was dismissed.\u201d (The petitioner\u2019s brief at 7).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Petitioner argues, requiring a leasing agent, or the other persons identified in \u00a7 6-801 (o) (2), to own, hold or control the property at issue renders that section superfluous or redundant. Additionally, the petitioner argues that \u00a7 6-801(o)(3)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> excludes only certain individuals and, therefore, all other groups are deliberately left covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The viability of the petitioner\u2019s interpretation depends upon reading each of \u00a7 6-801(o)\u2019s subsections separately and without reference to each other. All of her arguments essentially ignore \u00a7 6-801(o)(l). They are based on reading \u00a7 6-801(o)(2)(ii) <footnotemark>9</footnotemark>out of context, as if it were a definition of \u201cowner\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>unto itself and not just a part of one. As we have pointed out, for the petitioner\u2019s interpretation to be adopted, consistent with the requirement of the rules of construction that the statute be read in context, there would need to be additional language added to \u00a7 6-801(o)(2) indicating that any authorized agent or leasing agent is always to be considered an \u201cowner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The Legislature did not include any such language, signaling that it intended for the persons listed in subsection (o)(2)(ii) to be considered \u201cowners\u201d only when they satisfy the requirements set out in subsection (o)(l). Any other interpretation would arbitrarily hold property managers and leasing agents to a higher standard than that to which actual owners of the property are held. In fact, the interpretation advocated by the petitioner could extend to any \u201cauthorized agent of the landlord\u201d even if not associated in any way with the property. Clearly, this would lead to an illogical result.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Our interpretation is further supported by the fact that \u00a7 6-801 (o) has a third subsection that excludes certain classes of persons that otherwise would satisly the first subsection. That subsection, too, must be read in context with the other two subsections. As the respondent correctly states, and we have seen, the categories excluded in \u00a7 6-801(o)(3), mortgage holders and ground rent holders, are technically \u201cowners\u201d of an interest in the property because they hold a security interest for a loan or debt. The Legislature obviously excluded these classes of persons because even though they technically satisfy \u00a7 6-801(o)(l)\u2019s definition of \u201cowner,\u201d the Legislature did not want to expose them to liability because it does not comport with the Act\u2019s purpose \u201c... to reduce the incidence of childhood lead poisoning, while maintaining the stock of available affordable rental housing.\u201d \u00a7 6-802. The trial court did not add any requirement on its own; rather, it simply read and applied the plain wording of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Petitioner argues that when the legislative history is considered, it is apparent that \u00a7 6-801(o) applies to all leasing agents even if they do not own, hold or control the property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>This court has addressed the use of legislative history in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\">\u201c[o]ur cases indicate that even when the language of 'a statute is free from ambiguity, \u2018in the interest of completeness we may, and sometimes do, explore the legislative history of the statute under review. <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993). We do so, however, to look at the purpose of the statute and compare the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account. <em>Id. </em>In other words, the resort to legislative history is a confirmatory process; it is not undertaken to contradict the plain meaning of the statute. <em>See Coleman v. State, </em>281 Md. 538, 546, 380 A.2d 49, 54 (1977) (\u2018a court may not as a general rule surmise a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute or insert exceptions not made by the legislature.\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-5\"><em>Chase </em>at 131, 756 A.2d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The legislative history on which the petitioner relies does not support the conclusion that it is seeking.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The petitioner submits that an early draft of House Bill 760, which became Maryland\u2019s Lead Poisoning Prevention Act, included within the definition of \u201cowner\u201d \u201c... property managers, leasing agents, and maintenance personnel.\u201d <em>See </em>Draft bill, January 24, 1994. As enacted, the statute excluded maintenance personnel and retained property managers and leasing agents. Noting this fact, the petitioner argues that it demonstrates that the Legislature consciously chose to retain leasing agents within the ambit of the law. While this may be an accurate historical account, it does not affect the interpretation of \u00a7 6-801(o).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Read in its entirety, \u00a7 6-801 (o) is not a bit ambiguous as to its scope or its reach. Accordingly, giving the words of the statute their ordinary meaning, as we are required to do, <em>see Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. of Maryland v. Director of Finance for Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>343 Md. 567, 578, 683 A.2d 512, 517 (1996) (\u201cwe begin our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>inquiry with the words of the statute and, ordinarily, when the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, according to their commonly understood meaning, we end our inquiry there also\u201d), it is clear that a leasing agent or real estate broker is considered an \u201cowner\u201d only when the requirements of \u00a7 6-801(o)(l) are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Sections 6-815,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 6-820(c)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 6-823(c)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> were considered by the Court of Special Appeals in determining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>meaning of \u201cowner\u201d as defined in \u00a7 6-801(o). <em>See Dyer v. Criegler, </em>142 Md.App. at 117, 788 A.2d at 282. As to them, it opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-4\">\u201cLooking beyond the definition of \u2018owner\u2019, we find that the entire statutory scheme suggests that the Lead Paint Act applies only to those with the right to control the property. For instance, section 6-815 outlines the necessary steps an \u2018owner\u2019 must take to be in compliance with the risk reduction standards. The protective measures include a \u2018visual review of all exterior and interior painted surfaces,\u2019 removing all flaking paint, repainting, repairing all structural defects causing paint to flake, and other physical changes, all of which necessarily require an \u2018owner\u2019 to exercise control. Sections 6 \u2014 820(c) and 6-823(c) both mandate that an \u2018owner\u2019 issue required notices every two years to tenants. Because real estate agents\u2019 and brokers\u2019 relationships typically end once the lease is signed, agents and brokers, in that situation, do not have the continuous relationship contemplated by these notice provisions. In sum, the Act places duties on \u2018owners\u2019 that a person or entity without the right to control the property would be unable to comply with, thereby indicating that the Legislature did not intend real estate agents or brokers, acting only to list and promote properties, to be considered \u2018owners\u2019 for purposes of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-5\"><em>Id. </em>We agree with the Court of Special Appeals both as to the relevance of those sections to the construction of \u00a7 6 801(o) and its analysis of their effect on the definition of \u201cowner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The petitioner argues first that \u201ccontrol\u201d need not be established for the liability of a real estate broker or leasing agent to attach. If, however, \u201ccontrol\u201d is a necessary fact to be proven, she submits that the respondent exercised sufficient \u201ccontrol.\u201d She relies on the facts that (1) the leasing agent delivered possession to the tenant coupled with an agreement allowing the tenant to purchase the property; (2) the leasing agent had sufficient \u201ccontrol\u201d to comply with the Act\u2019s registration requirement;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and (3) the leasing agent delivered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>certain documents required to be given to the tenants under both State and Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Delivering possession to a tenant coupled with an agreement allowing the tenant to purchase the property does not constitute the \u201ccontrol\u201d contemplated by \u00a7 6-801(o). In <em>Brown v. Hogan, </em>138 Md. 257, 113 A. 756 (1921), the owner of a house authorized his attorney to find a purchaser for his house at a specified price. The attorney executed, on behalf of the owner, a contract of sale with a purchaser. The attorney failed to notify the owner of the contract until after the owner had executed a contract to sell the property to another purchaser. This Court held that an agent does not have implied authority to execute a contract to sell real estate which is binding on the principal. <em>See also Miller v. Mueller, </em>28 Md.App. 141, 147, 343 A.2d 922, 926 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>276 Md. 747 (1975) (\u201cThe mere retention of an agent, broker or attorney, to procure a purchaser of real estate, or to negotiate the terms of a real estate transaction, does not confer upon the agent the implied authority to make a contract of sale.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The lease in the case <em>sub judice </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">\u201cThe Owner recognizes Otis Warren Real Estate Services as the Broker negotiating this Lease and agrees to pay said Broker a brokerage fee for services rendered in the amount provided for in the listing contract in the event of the purchase of the property by the Tenant or an agent or assign of the Tenant, Owner agrees to pay a sales brokerage fee in accordance with the listing contractor or in the absence thereof a sales brokerage fee in the amount of 6% of the purchase price to the above named broker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Merely because the respondent was entitled to receive a commission in the event the tenant(s) purchased the property does not lead to the conclusion that the respondent maintained \u201ccontrol\u201d over the property. The lease simply states that the broker will receive a commission; it does not clothe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>respondent with express authority to sell the property.
