The court ordered petitioner to register as a sexually violent predator on the basis of a prior sexually based offense. We granted certiorari primarily to decide whether, based upon <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), due process requires that a jury determine the exis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>tence of the statutory factual condition precedent beyond a reasonable doubt before an offender may be required to register as a sexually violent predator pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.) Article 27, \u00a7 792.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We also granted certiorari to determine whether the trial court erred in failing to make further inquiry of a juror that was arguably equivocal in announcing her verdict<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and whether the trial court erred in refusing to pose a <em>voir dire </em>question requested by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">We shall hold that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to registration requirements under Maryland\u2019s Registration of Offenders statute. We shall hold further, based upon <em>State v. Thomas, </em>369 Md. 202, 798 A.2d 566 (2002), that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to pose petitioner\u2019s requested <em>voir dire </em>question relating to the crimes with which he was charged because such question was reasonably likely to expose potentially disqualifying juror bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">According to the testimony of the victim, Laquisha Franklin, an eleven-year-old girl, one day in the summer of 1999, her mother and a family friend, named Annie Smith, went shopping and left her home alone with petitioner, Ms. Smith\u2019s boyfriend. Petitioner and Laquisha sat on the floor playing a video game, with Laquisha sitting between petitioner\u2019s legs. Laquisha testified that petitioner commented on the size of her breasts. She testified that she \u201cscooted\u201d and petitioner \u201cscooted\u201d after her and that she felt his \u201cprivate part ... bump\u201d against her \u201cbutt\u201d on two occasions. Petitioner told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u25a0Laquisha not to tell anyone what had happened and threatened her with retaliation if she did so. Laquisha did not mention the incident to her mother until a few months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Laquisha\u2019s mother testified that, when Laquisha informed her of the incident, she notified Child Protective Services. A social worker with Child Protective Services testified that she interviewed Laquisha on September 23, 1999, and Laquisha told her about the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Two police officers testified that they arrested petitioner on September 30, 1999. They testified that petitioner acknowledged that he noticed that Laquisha\u2019s breasts were growing and that he advised her that she should be careful around boys. They testified that petitioner also acknowledged that, while he was sitting on the floor, Laquisha\u2019s buttocks came in contact with his erect penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Petitioner was convicted by a jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of second degree assault and third degree sexual offense. After the verdict was rendered, petitioner requested, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-327(e), that the jury be polled. After the jury was polled, the court excused the jurors, but asked them to assemble and wait in the lobby for a few minutes before departing. Defense counsel then approached the bench and made a motion to have the verdict stricken, proffering that one of the jurors paused and shook her head laterally while verbally responding affirmatively to her assent to the verdict. The trial court denied petitioner\u2019s motion, expressing its unwillingness to look beyond the juror\u2019s clear verbal response to evaluate her body language.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The Circuit Court sentenced petitioner to seven years incarceration on each count, to be served concurrently. The court also ordered petitioner, who had a prior conviction for a third degree sexual offense against a child, to register as a sexually violent predator pursuant to \u00a7 792, concluding that petitioner was a sexually violent predator. The trial court made no factual findings regarding whether petitioner was at risk for committing a future sexually violent offense. The judge mere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>ly stated that \u201cwith respect to the defendant in this case, Mr. Sweet, would qualify as one who has to comply with the violence [sic] sex offender registration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that <em>Apprendi </em>was not applicable, that the statute does not require a finding that the defendant is likely to re-offend, that the trial court made no error with respect to the <em>voir dire, </em>and that there was no defect in the taking of the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">II. Sexually Violent Predator Registration and Community Notification<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Section 792 defines a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d as an individual who is \u201cconvicted of a second or subsequent sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>violent offense\u201d and has \u201cbeen determined ... to be at risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense.\u201d Section 792(a)(12). Section 792(b) sets forth the procedure for determining if a person is a sexually violent predator, and provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">\u201c(b) <em>Determination; procedure. </em>\u2014 ... if an individual is convicted of a second or subsequent sexually violent offense, the State\u2019s Attorney may request the court to determine before sentencing whether the individual is a sexually violent predator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">(2) If the State\u2019s Attorney makes a request ..., the court shall determine before or at sentencing whether the individual is a sexually violent predator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">(3) In making [the] determination ..., the court shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">(i) Any evidence that the court considers appropriate to the determination of whether the individual is a sexually violent predator, including the presentencing investigation and sexually violent offender\u2019s inmate record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">(ii) Any evidence introduced by the individual convicted; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">(iii) At the request of the State\u2019s Attorney, any evidence presented by a victim of the sexually violent offense.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">\u00a7 792(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">Under the statutory framework, classification as a sexually violent predator requires the trial court to engage in a two-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>step analysis: first, the court must determine if the defendant has committed more than one \u201csexually violent offense,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 792(a)(ll); second, the court must determine whether the person is at risk for committing additional sexually violent offenses. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(a)(12); <em>Graves, </em>364 Md. at 340, 772 A.2d at 1233. The finding that a defendant qualifies as a sexually violent predator subjects him or her to the registration and notification requirements of the statute at the time of release. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(a)(7), (c). The registrant must provide the supervising authority with a signed statement that includes his or her name, address, place of employment, Social Security number, and a description and location of the qualifying criminal conduct. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(d)(1). As a sexually violent predator, petitioner was required to register every ninety days for a period of ten years. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(d)(4). Section 792 permits the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services to post on the Internet a current listing of each registrant\u2019s name, offense, and other identifying information. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(j)(6). In the time period since the case <em>sub judice </em>was argued before this Court, the Department has begun to post registry information on the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Petitioner argues that the sexual predator registration statute is a punitive statute that imposed an additional penalty upon him and that, therefore, based upon <em>Apprendi, </em>due process requires that future risk of re-offending be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioner argues that requiring registration as a sexually violent predator, pursuant to \u00a7 792, imposes an additional burden, which has the effect of increasing his sentence. He points to the legislative history of \u00a7 792, along with the burden and stigma of registration, maintaining that it demonstrates that it constitutes additional punishment. Petitioner argues, in the alternative, that even if a jury finding is not required under <em>Apprendi, </em>petitioner was entitled to have the trial court make explicit factual findings regarding the conditions precedent to registration on the record below. Petitioner concedes his current and prior convictions, but argues that the trial court made no finding regarding the risk of committing a future sexually violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>offense, as required by \u00a7 792(a)(12). Petitioner further argues that the trial court erred because the State put on no evidence regarding petitioner\u2019s potential future conduct and that evidence of petitioner\u2019s prior record, standing alone, cannot justify a finding of future risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Petitioner\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to his conviction under the sexual predator registration statute was essentially considered, albeit in a different context, and rejected by this Court in <em>Young v. State, </em>370 Md. 686, 806 A.2d 233 (2002). In that case, Young challenged the imposition of sexual offender registration as a condition of his probation, relying, like petitioner, on <em>Apprendi </em>to argue that registration was a punishment that could not be imposed absent a jury determination beyond a reasonable doubt of the predicate facts necessary for its imposition. We rejected that challenge, holding that registration under \u00a7 792 did not constitute punishment in the constitutional sense. <em>See id. </em>at 692, 806 A.2d at 236. We also held that the factual findings predicate to the imposition of registration did not expose him to a greater penalty than the prescribed statutory maximum otherwise available. <em>See id. </em>at 636, 806 A.2d at 239. The same reasoning is applicable in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Therefore, based on <em>Young, </em>in the instant case, due process did not require that a jury find the risk of committing a future sexually violent offense, as required by \u00a7 792(a)(12), beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">We conclude, however, that the trial court erred in failing to find, on the record, the factual predicate necessary for finding that petitioner was a sexually violent predator as defined by the statute. The sentencing court merely found that \u201cthe defendant in this case, Mr. Sweet, would qualify as one who has to comply with the violence [sic] sex offender registration.\u201d As we have indicated, before an offender may be required to register as a sexually violent predator, the sentencing court must make two findings: that the individual has been convicted of a second or subsequent sexually violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>offense and that the individual is <em>at risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Petitioner\u2019s interest in not being designated as a sexually violent predator is great and the State has an interest in making the determination that a convicted offender should be required to register pursuant to \u00a7 792 an accurate one in effectuating the remedial purposes of the statute. Therefore, the guarantees secured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment require that \u00a7 792 be interpreted to require that the State prove the facts predicate to sex offender registration to the sentencing judge by a preponderance of the evidence prior to imposition of registration requirements. A sentencing court, in implementing the mandate of \u00a7 792, should state, on the record, its reasons for making a determination that the offender is required to register pursuant to \u00a7 792,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> providing valuable assistance to appellate courts on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The record before us is devoid of any indication that the sentencing court had considered petitioner\u2019s future risk, as the statute required, or that the court found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that petitioner is at risk to commit a subsequent violent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">III. <em>Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">During <em>voir dire, </em>petitioner requested that the trial court ask the following question of the venire: \u201c(32) Do the charges stir up strong emotional feelings in you that would affect your ability to be fair and impartial in this case?\u201d The court declined to pose the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">The Court\u2019s decision in petitioner\u2019s case is essentially controlled by our recent decision in <em>State v. Thomas, </em>369 Md. 202, 798 A.2d 566 (2002). In that case, we held that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to refuse to ask the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>venire panel if any of them harbored \u201cstrong feelings regarding violations of the narcotics laws\u201d in a trial in which the defendant was charged with possession and distribution of a controlled dangerous substance. <em>See id. </em>at 204, 798 A.2d at 567. We reasoned that the inquiry was directed at biases, specifically those related to Thomas\u2019s alleged criminal act, that, if uncovered, would be disqualifying when they impaired the ability of the juror to be fair and impartial. <em>See id. </em>at 211, 798 A.2d at 571. The rationale of <em>Thomas </em>in this regard is fully applicable to the instant case. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to pose petitioner\u2019s requested <em>voir dire </em>question, and petitioner is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The states were required by the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071 (1994), to implement sex offender registration programs as a condition of federal law enforcement funding. <em>See </em>\u00a7 14071(g); <em>Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 336, 772 A.2d 1225, 1229-30 (2001). The Wetterling Act was developed in response to national pressure to address crimes of violence and molestation committed against children in the United States. <em>See id. </em>at 336-37 n. 8, 772 A.2d at 1230 n. 8. The Wetterling Act. established guidelines for registration and community notification for persons convicted of criminal offenses against minors or who were determined to be sexually violent predators. <em>See </em>\u00a7 14071; <em>Graves, </em>364 Md. at 336-37 n. 8, 772 A.2d at 1230 n. 8. Among other things, a state must register persons convicted of certain offenses and provide the information to the FBI and local law enforcement agencies. <em>See </em>\u00a7 14071(a). Federal law requires that registration information, at a minimum, include the offender's name, fingerprints, photo, and current address. <em>See </em>\u00a7 14071(b)(1). Federal law also requires that the information be released to the extent, necessary to protect the public from specific individuals. <em>See </em>\u00a7 14071(e)(2). Nonetheless, when Congress enacted the Wetterling Act, it afforded the states wide latitude in fashioning their sex offender registration statutes and the criteria for which an individual may be classified as a sexually violent predator, leaving to the state the questions of which offenders should be the targets of disclosure, the information gathered and the extent of disclosure, and the standards and procedures, if any, to apply to these determination. <em>See Graves, </em>364 Md. at 344, 772 A.2d at 1234; Wayne A. Logan, <em>Liberty Interests in the Preventive State: Procedural Due Process and Sex Offender Community Notification Laws, </em>89 J.Crim L. &amp; Criminology 1167, 1174 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Presently, all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government have adopted some form of sex offender registration or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>community notification programs. <em>See Graves, </em>364 Md. at 336-37 n. 8, 772 A.2d at 1230 n. 8; Logan, <em>supra, </em>at 1172.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-14\">\"At present, jurisdictions use any (or some combination) of three methods of dissemination: (1) 'public access,' which requires community members to request information from a given jurisdiction\u2019s registry ...; (2) Internet web-site access; and (3) affirmative community notification by law enforcement, which can involve the use of informational fliers and door-to-door visits by police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-15\">Logan, <em>supra, </em>at 1174 n. 35; <em>see, e.g., </em>Ala Code \u00a7 15-20-21(a)(2) (1999); \u00a7 15-20-22(a) (authorizing community notification by \"flyer,\u201d which contains, <em>inter alia, </em>offense information, a photo, and the name and home address of the registrant, and which is distributed primarily by hand, posting, local newspaper, and the Internet).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b201-10\">. Maryland Rule 4-342(1) states that a court \u201cordinarily shall state on the record its reasons for the sentence imposed.\u201d Although registration requirements may be imposed as a condition of probation, the rationale expressed in the Rule is applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b202-8\">BELL, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">I agree that the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals must be reversed and that the petitioner, Christopher Sweet, is entitled to a new trial. That is the case for the two reasons Judge Raker explains. Pursuant to <em>State v. Thomas, </em>369 Md. 202, 798 A.2d 566 (2002), the prospective jurors were required to be voir dired with respect to whether the charges against the petitioner; second degree assault and third degree sexual offense against a minor, stirred up in them strong emotional feelings that would affect their ability to be fair and impartial in the trial of the case. Moreover, the trial court never found the factual predicate underlying the factual finding that the petitioner was a sexually violent predator. Therefore, I con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>cur in the judgment. The majority also concludes, and holds, however, that should that latter finding be made, requiring registration is not punishment and, thus, is not subject to proof pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). I do not find the rationale underlying that holding to be at all persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In <em>Young v. State, </em>370 Md. 686, 806 A.2d 233 (2002), the petitioner was ordered to register as a sexual offender, <em>see </em>Md.Code art. 27, \u00a7 792(a)(6)(vii) (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1998 Supp.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to \u00a7 792(c). Although the registration requirement was pursuant to \u00a7 792, the obligation to register was made a condition of the petitioner\u2019s probation. The petitioner challenged the order to register as a sexual offender. Relying on <em>Apprendi, </em>he argued that registration was punishment and, thus, it could not be imposed without a jury determination, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the facts necessary for its imposition, in that case, because the violation that triggered \u00a7 792(a)(6)(vii)\u2019s application to the petitioner, the minority of the victim was critical, that the victim was under the age of eighteen years of age. To reach that conclusion, the petitioner applied the \u201cintent-effects\u201d analysis, a two part test, gleaned from <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 361, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 2082, 138 L.Ed.2d 501, 515 (1997) and <em>Hudson v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 99-100, 118 S.Ct. 488, 493-94, 139 L.Ed.2d 450, 459 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Also applying an \u201cintent-effects\u201d test, this one a three part one gleaned from <em>Hendricks </em>and <em>United States v. Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267, 288, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 2147, 135 L.Ed.2d 549, 568 (1996), the majority rejected Young\u2019s argument. 371 Md. at 8, 806 A.2d at 270. It held that registration under \u00a7 792 is not punishment and that, in any event, the factual findings necessary to ordering a defendant to register did not, in that case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>expose Young to greater punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 696, 806 A.2d at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Noting that the petitioner, although a violent sexual predator, rather than a sexual offender, makes a similar argument as Young made, the majority states that \u201cthe same reasoning is equally applicable in the case sub judice.\u201d 371 Md. 1, 8, 806 A.2d 265, 270 (2002). It therefore holds, \u201cbased on <em>Young, </em>in the instant case, due process did not require that a jury find a risk of committing a future sexually violent act, as required by \u00a7 792(a)(12).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Like the majority in <em>Young, </em>I did an extensive analysis of the cases and applied the factors listed in <em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963), a part of both \u201cintent-effects\u201d tests. I concluded, relying on <em>Kansas v. Myers, </em>260 Kan. 669, 923 P.2d 1024 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>521 U.S. 1118, 117 S.Ct. 2508, 138 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1997) and <em>Doe v. Otte, </em>259 F.3d 979 (9th Cir.2001), <em>cert, granted, </em>534 U.S. 1126, 122 S.Ct. 1062, 151 L.Ed.2d 966 (2002), and noting the breadth of the public disclosure of registrant information, that the Maryland sex offender registration statute is punitive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, <em>Apprendi </em>applied and, because the order was made by the court without any determination by a jury as to the predicate facts qualifying Young for sexual offender status, I dissented from both the rationale of the majority and its judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">\"The majority acknowledges that the court ordered registration as a condition of probation, but argues only that it was pursuant to \u00a7 792; it does not argue that, as the trial court apparently believed, ... that the registration was consistent with its authority to fashion conditions of probation. That is not surprising since conditions of probation are clearly punishment. See <em>Spielman v. State, </em>298 Md. 602, 610, 471 A.2d 730, 734 (1984) (\"It hardly can be contended that one who has been ordered to pay restitution, as a condition of probation, and is subject to revocation of that probation for failure to make payment, has not received punishment.\u201d). The trial court also ordered that the petitioner obtain psychological treatment.
