As a result, without objection from the parties, the trial court created a special procedure <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where, in the same criminal trial a jury would determine the guilt of appellant in respect to counts 1 thru 7, and the trial judge would determine the guilt of the appellant in respect to counts 8 and 9. Trial proceedings began later that same day. During the two-day trial the judge and the jury heard evidence on counts 1 through 7 simultaneously, with evidence of appellant\u2019s prior convictions relating to counts 8 and 9 heard only by the judge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the request of appellant, and over the objection of the State, the court deferred its verdict on counts 8 and 9 until after the jury returned its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>verdict on counts 1 through 7.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On March 21, 2001, the jury found appellant \u201cnot guilty\u201d on counts one through seven. The following day, the court returned its verdict of \u201cguilty\u201d as to counts 8 and 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">At sentencing, the court merged count 9 into count 8, and sentenced appellant to five years incarceration, of which one year was suspended and two years were converted to supervised probation. Appellant filed a motion for new trial, which was denied by the trial court in a memorandum dated July 27, 2001. Appellant then filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. This Court issued a writ of certiorari, bypassing the Court of Special Appeals, to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">\u201c1. Whether under both the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Maryland common law, the jury\u2019s acquittal barred the trial court\u2019s contrary verdict on the issue of possession.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>2. Whether the trial court erred by rendering an inconsistent verdict and improperly shifting the burden of proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The procedure utilized by the circuit court, <em>i.e., </em>the bifurcation of the decision making function between a jury and a judge in respect to different counts of a single indictment in a single trial is not expressly authorized in Maryland, or anywhere else as far as our research has revealed. In our discussion we will briefly examine the previously accepted method for severing counts of indictments into separate cases. We shall ultimately hold that in criminal cases where the circumstances and fact issues alleged are identical, a guilty verdict, or its equivalent, by the court, that is inconsistent with a jury verdict of acquittal, is, generally, impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The facts of this case are uncontroverted, the parties having agreed to proceed on the statement of facts presented in appellant\u2019s brief pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-501(g).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The facts as presented in appellant\u2019s brief are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201cIn the early morning hours of September 1, 1997, nineteen-year-old Robert Knox was shot in the foot. He claimed that he was sitting on the steps of an abandoned house with five or six friends from the neighborhood, when thirty-five year old [appellant] came out of his mother\u2019s house, several doors down, and shot him. At trial, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Knox was the only witness who identified [appellant] as the shooter. The prosecution theorized that [appellant] shot Mr. Knox in retaliation for an incident several hours earlier in which Mr. Knox \u2018borrowed\u2019 [appellant\u2019s] bicycle without asking. The defense challenged the credibility of Mr. Knox, who had a criminal record for drug distribution and theft, and emphasized the State\u2019s failure to investigate or call any of Mr. Knox\u2019s friends who were present during the bicycle incident and the shooting. The. defense argued that Mr. Knox, who was angry with [appellant] for calling the police on him, was motivated to testify falsely. The jury acquitted [appellant] of all seven counts before it, including the charge for carrying a handgun. The next day, [the trial court judge] found [appellant] guilty of the two firearm possession counts before her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u201cOfficer Aaron Robinson testified that around midnight on the day of the incident, [appellant] flagged him down, reporting that someone had borrowed his bicycle and not returned it. The two caught up with Mr. Knox and several of his friends. Officer Robinson demanded that Mr. Knox return the bike to [appellant], and threatened to lock up Mr. Knox for theft. When Mr. Knox returned the bicycle, Officer Robinson considered the incident resolved with a \u2018simple intervention\u2019 and left the scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201cMr. Knox, however, who was \u2018pretty mad\u2019 at [appellant] for calling the police, confronted [appellant] declaring: \u2018That\u2019s messed up you called the police on me.\u2019 As [appellant] started biking back towards his mother\u2019s house at 1010 North Carrie Street, Mr. Knox and his friends walked in the same direction. According to Mr. Knox, one of his friends, \u2018Monk,\u2019 said something to [appellant]. Mr. Knox and [appellant] then had \u2018little words,\u2019 and exchanged \u2018profanity toward each other.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">\u201cAn hour or two later, Mr. Knox and his friends, who had all been drinking \u2018E&amp;J\u2019 brandy, sat in front of an abandoned home at 1000 North Carrie Street, a few houses down from [appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s] house. Mr. Knox acknowledged that he lived several blocks away, and claimed he \u2018just happened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>to park\u2019 himself at that spot. According to Mr. Knox, he had been there for about twenty minutes when [appellant] came out of his mother\u2019s house. One of Mr. Knox\u2019s friends, \u2018Tay,\u2019 went over to speak with [appellant]. After [appellant] went back inside, \u2018Tay\u2019 returned to where Mr. Knox was sitting and told him \u2018everything is going to be all right.\u2019 Mr. Knox claimed that about a minute later, [appellant] came out of the house with a handgun, and shouted at him. As he tried to run away, [appellant] started shooting. Mr. Knox testified that his friends were there and \u2018they saw everything.\u2019 At the same time, he claimed that none of his friends saw who fired the gun because they \u2018had [their] backs turned when [they] heard the shots rang off and \u2018everybody ran.\u2019 He also insisted he did not know his friends\u2019 names except the nicknames of \u2018Tay\u2019 and \u2018Monk.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">\u201cAfter being shot in the foot, Mr. Knox ran seven blocks to his girlfriend\u2019s house. When the ambulance and police came, they took Mr. Knox back to North Carrie Street before taking him to the hospital, and Mr. Knox pointed to the house at 1010 North Carrie Street, indicating where the shots were fired. Detective Brenda May responded to a call about an incident four blocks over from North Carrie Street. However, when she got to the location of the reported incident, the dispatcher instructed her to report to 1010 North Carrie Street instead. Detective May investigated the area and found a 0.25 caliber casing in front of 1014 North Carrie Street in the middle of the street about a foot from the curb. She ascertained [appellant\u2019s] name as a possible suspect, obtained his photograph, and arranged a photo array. She then went to the hospital, where Mr. Knox pointed to [appellant\u2019s] photograph and identified [appellant] as the person who shot him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">\u201cDetective May, who had been a police officer for nineteen years with seven years on the violent crimes task force, did not investigate any other witnesses or possible suspects, although Mr. Knox told her he was with some friends at the time of the incident. Detective May acknowledged she did not even ask Mr. Knox for the names of his friends because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u2018from her experience a lot of people are reluctant to give up names of the people that are with them because they don\u2019t want the police harassing or bothering or going to their houses.\u2019 There was no evidence that investigators performed any tests on the casing to determine when it had been fired or how long it had been on the street, and no gun was found. Detective May obtained a warrant for [appellant\u2019s] arrest, but did not serve it because [appellant] was not at 1010 North Carrie Street when the police arrived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u201cThe jury acquitted [appellant] on counts one through seven on March 21, 2001. The following day, the Court returned a guilty verdict as to counts 8 and 9.\u201d [Some alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Appellant contends that the issues presented in this appeal arose from the \u201cunique procedural context\u201d in which appellant was tried, which consisted of a \u201cunified proceeding with a hybrid decision, part jury trial and part court trial.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Relying on principles of double jeopardy under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Maryland common law, appellant asserts that the finality of his acquittal by the jury on the charge of carrying a handgun (count 7) precluded any consideration by the trial judge of the \u201csame offense\u201d of possessing a firearm (counts 8 and 9). In the alternative, appellant, relying on <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970), argues that collateral estoppel bars the State from \u201cre-litigating a fact that previously ha[d] been resolved in [his] favor.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>contends that the trial court\u2019s verdict on counts 8 and 9 violated Maryland\u2019s common law prohibition against inconsistent court verdicts, and that the trial court violated his federal and state due process rights when it improperly shifted the burden of proof to appellant by requiring him to provide an alternative theory of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The State asserts that appellant is \u201cnot entitled to raise a double jeopardy or collateral estoppel bar\u201d when it was \u201che who requested the simultaneous court and jury trial and he who asked the court to delay its verdict until the jury had rendered [its].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, the State asserts that double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>jeopardy prohibitions, including the collateral estoppel version of double jeopardy, do not apply because the proceeding was a single trial, proffering as authority a quote from our case of <em>Farrell v. State, </em>364 Md. 499, 504, 774 A.2d 387, 390 (2001), \u201cThe double jeopardy prohibition protects a criminal defendant from successive prosecution.\u201d The State then argues in its brief in this case that \u201cHe [appellant] was not retried by either a judge or a jury at a successive trial. Rather, he was merely found guilty on two <em>different </em>counts by a judge in the <em>same </em>trial.\u201d (Emphasis in the original). It is clear, therefore, that the State considered this to be a single trial, and argues, for that specific reason, that double jeopardy principles do not apply in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">With regard to appellant\u2019s claims of trial court error, the State additionally disputes the applicability of the rules governing inconsistent verdicts in the present case, and further denies that the trial court erroneously shifted the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">General Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">\n<em>Double jeopardy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">As indicated above, it is the State\u2019s position that double jeopardy and collateral estoppel issues are not applicable because what occurred here happened in the same single case, and that the principles of double jeopardy (however manifested) apply only to matters relating to subsequent litigation. While we do not necessarily agree that double jeopardy violations can only occur in subsequent litigation, under the facts of this case we shall not directly rely on double jeopardy principles but on Maryland common law principles. We note that there are federal cases that at first glance appear to support the State\u2019s position in respect to double jeopardy. In <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 442-46, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1193-95, 25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>L.Ed.2d 469, 475-77 (1970), the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\">\u201cThe question is no longer whether collateral estoppel is a requirement of due process, but whether it is part of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against double jeopardy....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">\u201c \u2018Collateral estoppel\u2019 is an awkward phrase, but it stands for an extremely important principle in our adversary system of justice. It means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties <em>in any future lawsuit. </em>Although first developed in civil litigation, collateral estoppel has been an established rule of federal criminal law.... As a rule of federal law, therefore, \u2018it is much too late to suggest that this principle is not fully applicable to a <em>former judgment in a criminal case, </em>either because of lack of \u201cmutuality\u201d or because the judgment may reflect only a belief that the Government had not met the higher burden of proof exacted in such cases.... \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">\u201cThe ultimate question to be determined, then, in light of <em>Benton v. Maryland, supra, </em>is whether this established rule of federal law is embodied in the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy. We do not hesitate to hold that it is. For whatever else that constitutional guarantee may embrace, it surely protects a man who has been acquitted from having to \u2018run the gantlet\u2019 a second time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u201cThe question is not whether Missouri could validly charge the petitioner with six separate offenses for the robbery of the six poker players. It is not whether he could have received a total of six punishments if he had been convicted in a single trial of robbing the six victims. It is simply whether, after a jury determined by its verdict that the petitioner was not one of the robbers, the State could constitutionally hale him before a new jury <em>to litigate that issue again.\u201d </em>[Citations omitted.] [Footnote omitted.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>This Court consistent with <em>Ashe, </em>opined in <em>Butler v. State </em>385 Md. 238, 253, 643 A.2d 389, 396 (1994), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">\u201c.... (\u2018Collateral estoppel is part of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s double jeopardy guarantee...\u2019). Collateral estoppel is also an established component of Maryland\u2019s common law. <em>See Ford v. State, </em>330 Md. 682, 719, 625 A.2d 984, 1002 (1993)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">\u201c \u2018[Wjhen a[n] issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any <em>future </em>lawsuit.\u2019 \u201d [Some citations omitted.] [Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ape\">We went on to state in <em>Butler, </em>335 Md. at 253-54, 643 A.2d at 396, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">\u201cAlthough collateral estoppel is usually invoked upon a prior acquittal, the critical consideration is whether an issue of ultimate fact has been previously determined in favor of the defendant. As we stated in <em>Ford v. State, </em>collateral estoppel \u2018analysis focuses on what the fact finder did find or must have found.\u2019 (\u2018Collateral estoppel is concerned ... not with the legal consequences of a judgment but only with the <em>findings of ultimate fact, </em>when they can be discovered, that necessarily lay behind that judgment.\u2019) (\u2018Collateral estoppel ... is stubbornly fact-bound\u2019).\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">We stated in <em>Ford, supra,:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">\u201cMaryland common law also recognizes the collateral estoppel form of double jeopardy. This common law collat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>eral estoppel \u2018prevents the State from litigating a second time an issue of ultimate fact where there has already been a final determination of that issue in the accused\u2019s favor.\u2019 <em>Cousins v. State, </em>277 Md. 383, 398, 354 A.2d 825, 834, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1027, 97 S.Ct. 652, 50 L.Ed.2d 631 (1976) (citing <em>Ashe). </em>... It may apply both to subsequent trials and within the same trial. <em>Brooks v. State, </em>299 Md. 146, 155, 472 A.2d 981, 986 (1984)....\u201d <em>Ford, </em>330 Md. at 719, 625 A.2d at 1002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><em>Ford, Wright, </em>which we discuss more fully <em>infra, </em>and <em>Brooks, </em>stand for the proposition that collateral estoppel, under certain circumstances, can apply in the same case. But, the cases involved limited sets of circumstances, <em>i.e. </em>trial judges granting judgments of acquittal on some counts based upon an insufficiency of particular evidence, yet subsequently letting other counts go to the jury where they also depended upon that same particular evidence being sufficient. The procedural circumstances in <em>Ford, Wright, Brooks </em>and <em>Curtis Williams, </em>were significantly different than the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">At least in the traditional sense, the concept of double jeopardy, whether it be actual double jeopardy that precludes re-prosecution of offenses or re-litigation of issues as in collateral estoppel, usually contemplates a subsequent, or at least a different, case in which verdicts are rendered or material issues determined. It will not in this case be necessary to consider expanding the limited single case applications of collateral estoppel principles recognized in the particular circumstances of <em>Ford, Wright, Brooks, </em>and <em>Curtis Williams. </em>While it may be argued that what occurred here is some type of mutant subsequent prosecution in that the jury was excused before the verdict of the court was rendered, and, thus, the guilty verdict of the trial court violated the issue preclusion effect of collateral estoppel because it was a subsequent case, and, therefore, the court\u2019s verdict should be reversed on double jeopardy grounds, it will not be necessary in this case to either approve or disapprove of the procedure utilized below, although we shall, where necessary, discuss it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>We shall reverse for other reasons, that we shall hereafter discuss. In doing so, we will not directly reach the constitutional issue of double jeopardy or constitutional collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">First we discuss the method expressly provided for by the Maryland Rules in respect to the prejudicial effect of multiple counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\n<em>Severance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Potential prejudice is a fundamental concern underlying a court\u2019s consideration of joint or separate trials for a defendant charged with multiple criminal offenses. <em>See State v. Kramer, </em>318 Md. 576, 583, 569 A.2d 674, 677-78 (1990) (\u201cPotential prejudice is the overbearing concern of the law of this State with respect to the question of joint or separate trials of a defendant charged with criminal offenses.\u201d); <em>Frazier v. State, </em>318 Md. 597, 607, 569 A.2d 684, 689 (1990). The Maryland Rules are not silent on the matter of joinder and severance of counts in the same, or in different cases. Md. Rule 4-253(c) addresses \u201cPrejudicial joinder <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>,\u201d and specifically states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">\u201cRule 4-253. Joint or separate trials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">\u201c(b) Joint trial of offenses. If a defendant has been charged in two or more charging documents, either party may move for a joint trial of the charges....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">\u201c(c) Prejudicial joinder. If it appears that any party will be prejudiced by the joinder for trial of counts, charging documents, or defendants, the court may, on its own initiative or on motion of any party, order separate trials of counts, charging documents, or defendants, or grant any other relief as justice requires.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The rule does not further define what is meant by \u201cseparate trials.\u201d The rule does not specifically permit or prohibit the bifurcation of a single trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">It is clear that, at least where separate trials of separate counts are being considered, the decision to join or sever charges ordinarily lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See Frazier, </em>318 Md. at 607, 569 A.2d at 689; <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 705, 506 A.2d 580, 589 (1986); <em>but see McKnight v. State, </em>280 Md. 604, 612, 375 A.2d 551, 556 (1977) (mandating severance where a defendant charged with similar but unrelated offenses establishes that \u201cthe evidence as to each individual offense would not be mutually admissible at separate trials\u201d). In its consideration of joinder (and thus of severance), a trial court weighs the conflicting considerations of the public\u2019s interest in preserving judicial economy and efficiency against unduly prejudicing the defendant. <em>See Frazier, </em>318 Md. at 608, 569 A.2d at 689 (observing that \u201cthe likely prejudice caused by the joinder [of similar offenses, tried before a jury], must be balanced against the considerations of economy and efficiency in judicial administration\u201d) (citing <em>McKnight, </em>280 Md. at 609-10, 375 A.2d at 555); <em>accord Conyers v. State, </em>345 Md. 525, 548, 693 A.2d 781, 792 (1997) (noting that \u201cjoinder of offenses, traditionally, has been justified on the basis that a single trial effects an economy, by saving time and money, to the prosecution, the defendant, and the criminal justice system\u201d) (internal quotations omitted) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Ultimately, a trial judge has a duty to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial and to guard against injustice. <em>See McKnight, </em>280 Md. at 608, 375 A.2d at 554 (discussing the common law test for prejudicial joinder and explaining that, \u201cthe courts will guard against injustice and abuse whenever apparent\u201d) (internal quotations omitted) (citation omitted); <em>accord Wanzer v. State, </em>202 Md. 601, 608, 97 A.2d 914, 917 (1953) (discussing the courts\u2019 discretion in matters of trial joinder, and noting that \u201c[t]here is no rigid rule, and the only limitation is that courts will guard against injustice\u201d). Evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>dence of other crimes is inherently prejudicial because of its tendency to show that the defendant is predisposed to continue criminal behavior. Such evidence would generally be inadmissible unless circumstances of special relevance, other than proving a mere propensity to commit crime, are present. <em>See, e.g., Ross v. State, </em>276 Md. 664, 669, 350 A.2d 680, 684 (1976) (\u201cThe [Sjtate may not present evidence of other criminal acts of the accused unless the evidence is \u2018substantially relevant for some other purpose than to show a probability that he committed the crime on trial because he is a man of criminal character.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). In the present case, evidence that the appellant was a felon, although especially relevant and admissible as to counts 8 and 9, undoubtably would have been prejudicial in respect to the remaining counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">While this Court has recognized the curative effect of a properly cautioning jury instruction under circumstances similar to the case <em>sub judice,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and has recognized that trial courts can, under appropriate circumstances, avoid improper prejudice by severing counts for \u00e1 subsequent trial, we have never been presented with the type of proceeding utilized at the merits trial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">We note that the present case is an instance of a hybrid jury/bench trial on the merits. In an appropriate case<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we might necessarily be faced with an initial question of whether a trial judge has the discretion to grant the single trial procedure used in the instant case. We shall not resolve that issue in this case, as the case can be fully resolved on other important issues. Our declining to address this specific bifurcation issue, should not be construed as any approval or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>disapproval of the procedure.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">There are situations where we have disapproved of hybrid processes in the criminal courts. In respect to the exercise of the right to counsel we have, generally, disapproved hybrid representation. In <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 263, 523 A.2d 597, 598 (1987), we noted, in a Sixth Amendment context, that \u201c[t]he right of self-representation is independent of the right to assistance of counsel. The rights \u2018are mutually exclusive and the defendant cannot assert both simultaneously.\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted). We went on to say:</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\u201cThere is no right vested in a defendant who has effectively waived the assistance of counsel to have his responsibilities for the conduct of the trial shared by an attorney.... As we have noted, the right to counsel and the right to defend pro se cannot be asserted simultaneously. The two rights are disjunctive. There can be but one captain of the ship, and it is he alone who must assume responsibility for its passage, whether it safely reaches the destination charted or founders on a reef.\u201d <em>Parren, </em>309 Md. at 264, 523 A.2d at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai2\"><em>See also Leonard v. State, </em>302 Md. 111, 119, 486 A.2d 163, 166 (1985) (\u201cthe defendant cannot assert both simultaneously\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">In respect to rights of counsel issues, federal courts have also spoken to the constitutionality of hybrid representation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> They have held that a criminal defendant does not have an absolute right to both self-representation and the assistance of counsel. <em>United States v.

Bloom, </em>48 Cal.3d 1194, 1218-19, 259 Cal.Rptr. 669, 774 P.2d 698, 712 (1989); <em>People v. Doane, </em>200 Cal.App.3d 852, 863, 246 Cal. Rptr. 366, 371-72 (1988); <em>Gamble v.

Small, </em>988 S.W.2d 671, 673-74 (1999); <em>State v. Hegge, </em>53 Wash.App. 345, 349, 766 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Another situation where we have disapproved the hybridization of trial procedures (waiver of jury trial rights) is closer to the questioned procedure in the case at bar. In respect to the waiver of the right to trial by jury, Maryland Rule 4-246 contemplates that the entire trial be by jury, or by the court. Rule 4-246 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201cRule 4-246. Waiver of jury trial \u2014 Circuit court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">\u201c(a) Generally. In the circuit court a defendant having a right to trial by jury shall be tried by a jury unless the right is waived pursuant to section (b) of this Rule....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">\u201c(b) Procedure for acceptance of waiver. A defendant may waive the right to trial by jury at anytime before the commencement of trial. The court may not accept the waiver until it determines ... that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">As is readily clear, Rule 4-246 prescribes the process for waiving a jury \u201ctrial;\u201d it does not expressly permit a defendant to pick and choose a mode of proceeding in respect to particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>lar parts in a single trial on the merits, with both a jury and a court as fact-finders as to different counts of the same indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">We have generally considered the waiver of the right to be tried by a jury to be a waiver in respect to the entire merits trial, not portions of the trial. We noted in <em>Martinez v. State, </em>309 Md. 124, 131, 522 A.2d 950, 953 (1987), \u201cA defendant may waive his right to a jury trial and elect instead to be tried by the court.\u201d (citations omitted). We there addressed it as an either/or selection. In the one case having some similarity to the unusual situation of the present case, we held that it was a selection of one or the other. In <em>State v. Marsh, </em>337 Md. 528, 654 A.2d 1318 (1995), we discussed the bifurcation of merits and criminal responsibility. Marsh had waived his right to a jury trial during the merits stage of his trial, but then attempted to have the matter of criminal responsibility decided by a jury. We held that he could not. In <em>Marsh, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201cUnder this intricate scheme, when Marsh waived his right to a jury trial as to guilt or innocence, he was precluded thereby from seeking a jury determination as to criminal responsibility---- Thus under this Rule,[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] the election of a bench trial on the merits inevitably encompasses a waiver of jury rights as to criminal responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">\u201cIn this respect, the question of criminal responsibility is like every other issue to be decided in the cases. <em>See People v. Berutko, </em>71 Cal.2d 84, 453 P.2d 721, 727, 77 Cal.Rptr. 217, 223 (1969) (jury waiver goes to all of the issues to be decided in the case).\u201d <em>Marsh, </em>337 Md. at 539, 654 A.2d at 1323. [Footnote added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-9\"><em>See also People v. Russell, </em>195 Cal.App.2d 529, 532, 16 Cal. Rptr. 9, 11 (1961) (\u201cIt is settled that where a defendant waives a jury trial he is deemed to have consented to a trial of all the issues of the case before the court sitting without a jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\n<em>Consistency of the verdicts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In the ease at bar, there is no dispute that both the jury and the judge based their decisions as to appellant having the handgun, or not having it, on the same identical evidence. The evidence upon which both fact-finders relied was presented in a single evidentiary proceeding. Likewise, there is no dispute as to whether the verdicts were inconsistent. They are clearly inconsistent. At a given point in time, the jury held that appellant did not possess the handgun. The trial court necessarily held that, at the same given point in time, appellant, a felon, was in possession of the same handgun. The State argues that appellant waived his right to object to the inconsistency of the verdicts, regardless of the appropriateness of the procedure. We hold that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the inconsistent verdict of the court nullified the jury\u2019s verdict and was, thus, additionally inappropriate under Maryland common law principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">As we have said, we have found no <em>direct </em>precedent for permitting inconsistent verdicts in the criminal law of this State (or of any state or the federal courts), where a verdict of a trial judge is inconsistent with the verdict of a jury in the same case. While the procedure utilized at trial in the present case was significantly different, on at least two occasions, in <em>Wright </em>and <em>Curtis Williams, </em>discussed <em>supra </em>and <em>infra, </em>Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have disapproved inconsistent verdicts in criminal cases where the inconsistency involved court action. Additionally, our appellate courts have addressed such issues between a jury and the court in a civil context relating to consistency requirements. We see no reason why the consistency requirements in criminal cases should be less stringent than the standards we have applied in civil cases. We shall first discuss our civil precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">A reading of those prior civil cases indicates that they support the proposition that a court verdict, based upon a trial judge\u2019s different interpretation of the same facts, should not be allowed to nullify a jury\u2019s interpretation of those facts and its resulting verdict, because, the nullification of the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>verdict is the denial of a person\u2019s constitutional and common law right to be tried by a jury of his or her peers. Moreover, in that situation, where the jury and a judge render separate verdicts that are inconsistent with each other, the reasoning that supports the acceptance of inconsistent jury verdicts is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The verdict being nullified in the present case is not the judge\u2019s verdict, it is the jury\u2019s verdict, especially in respect to count 7. As to that count, appellant did not waive his right to a jury trial. Whether appellant waived a jury trial on counts 8 and 9 (the counts upon which the judge rendered a verdict) in the context of the consistency issue, is simply not relevant to the issue of whether a jury\u2019s interpretation of the facts and its not guilty verdict in a criminal case can be overturned or nullified by a judge\u2019s different interpretation of the same facts that were presented only once in a single case to both triers of fact. More important, the reasons why inconsistent jury verdicts are tolerated simply do not apply when a judge is involved in rendering one of the inconsistent verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">It makes no difference in criminal cases what the procedure is that results in the mingling of court and jury verdicts; inconsistent verdicts based on identical facts, are not permitted unless the inconsistency is solely a jury inconsistency. Additionally, when the verdicts of a court nullify a jury\u2019s verdict, a defendant\u2019s right to be tried by jury, has been improperly affected, or even nullified. At no time in the present case did appellant waive or give up his right to a jury\u2019s verdict on counts 1 through 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In <em>Edwards v. Gramling Engineering Corporation, </em>322 Md. 535, 543, 588 A.2d 793, 797 (1991), in the context of a civil case with mixed questions of law and equity,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>judge is \u2018 \u201cwithout power\u201d to reach a conclusion inconsistent with that of the jury.\u2019 <em>Gutzwiller v.

For a search for one possible view of the case which will make the jury\u2019s finding inconsistent results in collision with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019 <em>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, </em>369 U.S. 355, 364, 82 S.Ct. 780, 786, 7 L.Ed.2d 798, 807 (1962).\u201d [Some citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We went on in <em>Edwards </em>to point out that the jury\u2019s verdict could have been based on different factual circumstances than the court\u2019s <em>verdict. </em>\u201cThere are at least two possible scenarios under which a jury could find there was no conversion.... Under the second scenario, the jury\u2019s verdict for <em>Edwards </em>on conversion is consistent with the verdict for the Corporation on breach of fiduciary duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545, 588 A.2d at 798 (citations omitted). We concluded in <em>Edwards, </em>\u201cIn summary, the verdict of the jury in this case was not inconsistent with the equitable remedy fashioned by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554, 588 A.2d at 802-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">In the present case, there is only one issue, one \u201cscenario.\u201d Appellant, at the point in time at issue, was either carrying the weapon or he was not. The jury found that he was not carrying it; subsequently, based on the identical evidence presented only once in the same trial, the judge found that, at the identical point in time, he was. Unlike in <em>Edwards, </em>the judge\u2019s verdict in the case <em>sub judice </em>effectively nullifies the jury\u2019s verdict. It is, without question, inconsistent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>In <em>Higgins v. Barnes, </em>310 Md. 532, 530 A.2d 724 (1987), one of the early civil cases where issues were presented concerning the simultaneous court and jury trials of law and equitable issues, we noted the deference due to the verdicts of the jury in respect to the facts of the controversy. There, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APY\">\u201cWe hold that a trial court may not deny a defendant his right to a jury trial on the legal issues presented by his counterclaim simply because that counterclaim is raised in an equitable action. We are constitutionally required to \u2018inviolably preserve\u2019 the right of trial by jury in actions at law, and so \u2018where both legal and equitable issues are presented in a single case, \u201conly under most imperative circumstances ... can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equitable claims.\u201d \u2019 <em>Dairy Queen v. Wood, supra, </em>369 U.S. at 472-73, 82 S.Ct. at 897 (quoting <em>Beacon Theatres, supra, </em>359 U.S. at 510-11, 79 S.Ct. at 957).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 551, 530 A.2d at 733. Thus, in <em>Higgins, </em>albeit a civil case, we held that even prior court verdicts must be subordinated to subsequent jury decisions. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the contrary situation has occurred. A prior jury determination that appellant was not carrying or wearing the firearm and did not commit any of the offenses with which he was charged, is nullified, at least in substantial part, by a subsequent court decision based on the identical facts, that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>carrying the firearm. The position urged on the Court by the State does not \u201cinviolably preserve\u201d the right of criminal defendants to have the facts of their cases, and their guilt, assessed by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Once the jury determined that appellant was not wearing and carrying the handgun at the relevant point in time and found him not guilty of that charge, the trial court should have dismissed counts 8 and 9, which, under the circumstances here present, also required, in order to find appellant guilty, that appellant was in possession of the same firearms at exactly the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Our view is additionally supported by a consideration of the criminal case of <em>Hoffert v. State, </em>319 Md. 377, 572 A.2d 536 (1990). <em>Hoffert </em>involved only a jury trial where inconsistent verdicts are sometimes accepted; <em>i.e., </em>there was no bifurcation of counts between the jury and the court. Moreover, the procedural circumstances were substantially different. Nonetheless, <em>Hoffert </em>offers comments that are somewhat relevant to the present case. The verdict form in <em>Hoffert </em>contained four charges: \u201c1) Attempted murder in the first degree. 2) Attempted murder in the second degree. 3) Robbery with deadly weapon. 4) Use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379, 572 A.2d at 537. After the jury rendered not guilty verdicts on the first three counts, the trial court asked the prosecutor if he wanted the jury polled and they were polled. The trial court then proceeded to \u201chearken\u201d the verdict but had only \u201chearkened\u201d the jury\u2019s verdict on the first count when the proceedings were interrupted by a juror who reminded the trial court that it had not taken the jury\u2019s verdict on the fourth count. The trial court then took the jury\u2019s verdict on that count and it was \u201cguilty.\u201d Subsequently, the jury was re-polled on all four verdicts and they were all \u201chearkened.\u201d The argument was successfully made to the trial court that the inconsistent jury verdicts were permissible. We disagreed under the special circumstances of that case, albeit for procedural reasons, saying, in <em>Hoffert, </em>319 Md. at 384-86, 572 A.2d at 539-41:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>\u201c[W]e observed in <em>Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 53, 512 A.2d 358 (1986), \u2018commission of a felony or crime of violence is an essential ingredient of the \u00a7 36B(d) handgun offense. It is an element of the crime.\u2019 ... Thus, \u2018verdicts [of] not guilty of the crime of violence and guilty of use of a handgun in the commission of such a crime ... would be contrary to law....\u2019 Therefore, \u2018a trial court in a criminal case must, if requested by the accused, instruct a jury that an accused cannot be found guilty of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence ... if found not guilty of a crime of violence.... Nevertheless, inconsistent verdicts by a jury \u2018are normally tolerated.... \u2019 This is so because of the \u2018unique role of the jury, [and has] no impact whatsoever upon the substantive law explicated by the Court.\u2019...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201cIt follows from our decisions that the instructions given the jury were in full accord with the law, but that the jury was free to ignore them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201c... What both the judge and the prosecutor overlooked was the effect of the not guilty verdicts on the viability of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">\u201cWhen the jury was polled on the verdicts of not guilty on the first three charges, and the poll disclosed that the verdicts were unanimous, the verdicts were final. The verdicts were legally proper.... The verdicts stood complete without a verdict on the handgun charge. The guilt stage of the trial was over at that point. The jury had no further function to perform. It had exhausted its power and authority and could not be called upon to exercise additional duties in the case. In short, the case was no longer within the province of the jury.\u201d [Citations omitted.] [Alterations in original.] [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">In the case at bar, the transcript contained in the extract indicates that on March 21, 2001, the jury rendered its verdicts of not guilty on all of the jury counts, including the not guilty verdict as to count 7, and the jury was then immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>polled by the clerk who stated at the conclusion \u201cHarken to the verdict as the Court has recorded it.... \u201d The clerk continued until he had \u201charkened\u201d all of the jury\u2019s verdicts. The jury was then excused. At this point, all of its verdicts were final and were consistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">It was not until the next day, when the court reconvened, that it rendered its verdicts on counts 8 and 9. Under this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Hoffert, </em>even the jury could not have rendered those inconsistent verdicts after it was excused. The trial court\u2019s verdicts in the case at bar on counts 8 and 9 are clearly inconsistent with the jury\u2019s verdicts on the other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The rationale for accepting inconsistent jury verdicts, which we noted in <em>Hoffert, </em>and other cases as well, that \u201c[Ijnconsis-tencies may be the product of lenity, mistake, or a compromise to reach unanimity, and that continual correction of such matters would undermine the historic role of the jury as the arbiter of questions put to it\u201d does not, and cannot, logically apply in the present circumstance. <em>Hoffert, </em>319 Md. at 384-85, 572 A.2d at 540 (quoting <em>Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 54, 512 A.2d 358, 362 (1986)). As far as we know, there is no other rationale for tolerating inconsistent verdicts in criminal cases. To approve what happened below would undermine the historic role of the jury as the arbiter of questions put to it. As important, in the present case it would serve to deprive the defendant of the jury\u2019s verdict, especially as to count 7, and would retroactively deprive the defendant of his right to a jury trial by nullifying the jury\u2019s verdicts of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">We held in <em>Shell, </em>307 Md. at 52-58, 512 A.2d at 361-64 (1986), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">\u201cThe State contends that <em>Ford v. State, </em>274 Md. 546, 337 A.2d 81 (1975), and other cases, support the view that an accused may be convicted in a nonjury trial of the handgun offense under Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d), even if the judge finds that the defendant did not commit the felony or crime of violence. We disagree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u201cThe defendant in <em>Ford </em>was tried before a jury.... If the jury determines that the accused did not commit a felony or crime of violence but is guilty of use of a handgun in the commission of such felony or crime of violence, the jury has obviously rendered inconsistent verdicts. The <em>Ford </em>opinion, while recognizing that the verdicts were inconsistent, upheld the conviction because of the many cases in this Court which had \u2018repudiated the assertion that <em>jury </em>verdicts must be consistent----\u2019 <em>(Ford, supra, </em>274 Md. at 552, 337 A.2d 81, emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\u201cLater, in <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984), we reviewed the <em>Ford </em>case as follows (300 Md. at 593-594, 479 A.2d 1344):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">\u2018Thus, this Court established ... [in <em>Ford </em>] that in order to convict an accused of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence it is necessary that the trier of fact find beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed a crime of violence. In essence, this Court recognized that when an accused is charged in a multi-count indictment with the commission of a crime of violence and use of a handgun in the commission of such a crime, a verdict of guilty of the crime of violence is a prerequisite to a verdict of guilty of use of a handgun in the commission of such a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">\u2018Additionally, in <em>Ford, </em>this Court pointed out that if an accused is found guilty of both the crime of violence and use of a handgun in the commission of such a crime, the verdicts are consistent and they can both stand. If, however, there is a verdict of not guilty of the crime of violence and a verdict of guilty of use of a handgun in the commission of such a crime, the verdicts are inconsistent.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR2\">\u201cIn light of these principles, the Court in <em>Mack </em>took the position that \u2018verdicts [of] not guilty of the crime of violence and guilty of use of a handgun in the commission of such a crime ... would be contrary to law,\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 595, 479 A.2d 1344. Consequently, we held that \u2018a trial court in a criminal case must, if requested by the accused, instruct a jury that an accused cannot be found guilty of use of a handgun in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>commission of a crime of violence under ... Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d) if found not guilty of a crime of violence as defined in ... Art. 27, \u00a7 441(e).\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 587, 479 A.2d 1344. The Court pointed out that the refusal to set aside the inconsistent jury verdicts in <em>Ford </em>was \u2018premised upon the unique role of the jury, [and] had no impact whatsoever upon the substantive law explicated by the Court.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 594-595, 479 A.2d 1344.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\u201cThus, convictions based on inconsistent jury verdicts are tolerated because of the singular role of the jury in the criminal justice system.... The general view is that inconsistencies may be the product of lenity, mistake, or a compromise to reach unanimity, and that continual correction of such matters would undermine the historic role of the jury as the arbiter of questions put to it. <em>United States v.

The <em>Ford </em>holding does not justify inconsistent verdicts from the trial judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIK\">... The Court in <em>Johnson </em>then distinguished between inconsistent jury verdicts and inconsistent nonjury verdicts, and discussed with approval the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>United States v. Maybury, </em>274 F.2d 899 (2d Cir.1960). The <em>Johnson </em>Court quoted from <em>Maybury </em>as follows (238 Md. at 543, 209 A.2d 765):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201c\u2018None of these considerations [justifying inconsistent jury verdicts] is fairly applicable to the tidal of a criminal case before a judge. There is no \u2018arbitral\u2019 element in such a trial. While the historic position of the jury affords ample ground for tolerating the jury\u2019s assumption of the power to insure lenity, the judge is hardly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>\u2018voice of the country,\u2019 even when he sits in the jury\u2019s place. * * * There is no need to permit inconsistency in the disposition of various counts so that the judge may reach unanimity with himself; on the contrary, he should be forbidden this easy method for resolving doubts. * * * We do not believe we would enhance respect for law or for the courts by recognizing for a judge the same right to indulge in \u2018vagaries\u2019 in the disposition of criminal charges that, for historic reasons, has been granted the jury. 274 F.2d at 903.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">\u201cThe rule applied in the <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Maybury </em>cases, which distinguishes between inconsistent verdicts in a jury trial and such verdicts in a nonjury trial, has been adopted in other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., U.S. v.

State, supra, </em>it would be the height of appellate inconsistency for us to depart from the principles of <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Maybury </em>and hold that inconsistent verdicts in nonjury trials will generally be permitted and will be sustained in the present case. It would make utterly no sense to require a trial judge to instruct the jury \u2018that an accused cannot be found guilty of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence ... if found not guilty of a crime of violence,\u2019 <em>Mack, </em>300 Md. at 587, 596, 479 A.2d 1344, but to hold that the trial judge himself is permitted to ignore this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">\u201cThe case at bar is not one in which there is only an apparent inconsistency which in substance disappears upon review of the trial court\u2019s explanation. Unlike the situation in <em>Johnson, </em>the trial court\u2019s findings in this case are not consistent with the challenged guilty verdict. ... In light of the <em>Mack, Ford </em>and <em>Johnson </em>opinions, the defendant Shell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>conviction of the \u00a7 36B(d) handgun offense must be reversed.\u201d [Citation omitted.] [Footnotes omitted.]</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><em>Shell </em>is the leading criminal case in Maryland, and has become one of the leading cases in the country, in respect to consistent and inconsistent verdicts. We have cited its holdings on those issues in our cases of <em>Wright v. State, </em>307 Md. 552, 576, 515 A.2d 1157, 1169 (1986) and <em>State v. Anderson, </em>320 Md. 17, 29, 575 A.2d 1227, 1233.

A trial court is duty bound to apply the law in a nonarbitrary or [non-]capricious manner. A rule which would permit judgments which cannot be defended upon a logical basis would not enhance respect for the law, the courts, or the process.

In <em>Wolfe, </em>6 Va.App. at 650 n. 3, 371 S.E.2d at 319 n. 3, we noted that nothing in our opinion was \u2018intended to address inconsistent verdicts rendered by a trial judge in a single criminal trial.\u2019 Citing <em>Shell v. State, </em>we indicated our belief that \u2018the principles stated [in Wolfe] are [not] applicable to such cases. More recently, in <em>Elmore v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 424, 427, n. 1, 470 S.E.2d 588, 589 n. 1 (1996), we assumed without deciding \u2018that inconsistent verdicts in a bench trial are grounds for reversal in Virginia.\u2019 We again cited the decision of Maryland\u2019s highest court in <em>Shell </em>as representative of the decisions of other jurisdictions that \u2018the considerations that may justify inconsistent jury verdicts do not apply in a bench trial.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u2018We now expressly adopt, as applicable to elemental inconsistency in bench trial verdicts, the basic rationale applied by Maryland\u2019s highest court in <em>Shell.\u201d </em>[Some citations omitted.] [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The Virginia Court of Appeals reaffirmed its position adopting our <em>Shell </em>holding in its later case of <em>Cleveland v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 199, 562 S.E.2d 696 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">As we have indicated, we have found no cases anywhere in which a single criminal case is bifurcated in a fashion where a jury first determines whether a defendant is guilty of some of the counts, and then a judge, as a fact-finder, based upon the same evidence simultaneously presented in the same case, subsequently determines a defendant\u2019s guilt as to other counts.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> There are, however, at least two Maryland criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>cases where this Court, and the Court of Special Appeals, have addressed the effect of courts\u2019 actions in criminal cases that resulted in inconsistencies with jury verdicts. Our case of <em>Wright, supra, </em>involved the granting by a trial court of a motion for judgment of acquittal on the underlying felony and a jury\u2019s subsequent guilty verdict on the felony murder charge. In <em>Wright, </em>as is obvious, the result was an inconsistency in verdicts. In the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 case of <em>Curtis Williams, supra, </em>that court, on appeal, vacated a conviction of one offense for which a defendant had been found guilty by a jury. The result was an inconsistency of verdicts. Both <em>Wright </em>and <em>Curtis Williams, </em>involved combined decisions at different stages of a single proceeding-a jury verdict and a trial judge\u2019s granting of a motion for acquittal in <em>Wright, </em>and a jury verdict and subsequent appellate judges\u2019 decision in <em>Curtis Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We said in <em>Wright, </em>307 Md. at 576-78, 515 A.2d at 1169-70:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUL\">\u201cThe Court of Special Appeals also relied upon the rule that jury verdict consistency is \u2018not mandated by our law\u2019 and furnishes no ground for reversal. While agreeing with Wright\u2019s argument that the judgment of acquittal on the underlying attempted robbery and the conviction of felony murder \u2018were inconsistent,\u2019 the Court of Special Appeals responded that \u2018it is immaterial.\u2019 The short answer to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 reliance is that we are not in this case dealing with inconsistent action by a jury. Rather, the inconsistency was on the part of the trial court, in granting a motion for judgment of acquittal as to the underlying felony but submitting the felony murder theory to the jury. While inconsistent verdicts by a jury are normally tolerated, inconsistent verdicts by the court are not ordinarily permitted as a matter of Maryland common law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">\u201cMoreover, we recognize that, as a general principle, inconsistent verdicts on different counts at a nonjury trial are not precluded by the federal constitution, at least when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the guilty verdict \u2018is supported by sufficient evidence and is the product of a fair trial.\u2019 Notwithstanding the ordinary federal constitutional inconsistent verdict rule, we doubt that a conviction for felony murder, after an acquittal of the underlying felony on the ground that the State\u2019s proof was insufficient, and after the trial judge expressly stated that \u2018there is not' sufficient evidence to require the Defendants to put on a defense with respect to the\u2019 underlying felony, could be squared with federal double jeopardy or due process principles....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">\u201cWe conclude, therefore, that both under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and, independently, under Maryland common law double jeopardy principles, the defendant Wright\u2019s conviction for felony murder must be reversed. In addition, because his conviction for using a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence was premised upon his having committed felony murder, that conviction must also be reversed.... \u201d [Citations omitted.] [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\"><em>Wright, supra, </em>involved the prior action of a judge causing inconsistent verdicts in a jury trial. The unusual Court of Special Appeals\u2019 case of <em>Curtis Williams, supra, </em>involved subsequent actions by the Court of Special Appeals that resulted in the creation of an inconsistency in respect to a prior jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In <em>Curtis Williams, </em>the Court of Special Appeals reconsidered a prior opinion it had filed. Williams argued that the court\u2019s vacating of one count in its prior opinion, had resulted in inconsistent verdicts in his case and that the inconsistency was not the result of a jury\u2019s actions, but one created by the Court of Special Appeals. The appellant in respect to the reconsideration stated: \u201c[T]hat his conviction for using a handgun in the commission of a felony must be vacated because his conviction for the underlying felony was vacated.\u201d <em>Curtis Williams, </em>117 Md.App. at 69, 699 A.2d at 480. The Court of Special Appeals responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">\u201cWe agree. In resolving this issue, we shall address an issue we have not heretofore fully explained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u201cWe initially note that this case was tried by a jury, and the jury\u2019s verdicts were completely consistent. It convicted appellant of both the underlying felony and the handgun offense....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">\u201cHad the jury in the case at bar acquitted appellant of the underlying felony but convicted him of the handgun offense, its verdicts would have been inconsistent. We, however, would have been required to affirm the handgun conviction .... It is important to note that <em>Ford </em>involved jury verdicts. There are later cases in which courts have held that other types of inconsistent verdicts are impermissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\u201cIn <em>Garland v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 27, 28, 349 A.2d 374 (1975), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>278 Md. 212, 362 A.2d 638 (1976) ... the defendant was convicted by a jury of second degree murder and unlawful use of a handgun. We ultimately reversed the conviction for second degree murder. As to the handgun conviction, we stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\u2018It follows that with the reversal of the conviction for the underlying felony, the conviction for the handgun violation, predicated of necessity upon it, must also be reversed.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 32, 349 A.2d 374. That statement is technically correct. <em>Garland, </em>however, did not involve a jury inconsistency. It was, as is also clear in the case <em>sub judice, </em>an inconsistency created by an appellate court\u2019s vacating of the underlying felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69-70, 699 A.2d at 480-81(foot-note omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">After a discussion of this Court\u2019s <em>Shell </em>holding, the Court of Special Appeals ultimately held in <em>Curtis Williams:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">\u201cAs we view this area of the law, inconsistent verdicts from juries are tolerated because of the unique role of juries in our judicial system. Inconsistent verdicts, however, are not generally tolerated in a non-jury context.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">\u201cThe trial below resulted in jury verdicts that were completely consistent. With our action in the case <em>sub judice, </em>vacating the underlying felony, we, not the jury, have created the inconsistency. With no jury aura present, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>there is no reason for us to tolerate any inconsistency in the verdicts. Accordingly, we shall also vacate appellant\u2019s conviction on the handgun charge.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 70-71, 699 A.2d at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">As in <em>Curtis Williams, </em>the jury\u2019s verdicts in the instant case were consistent. The jury acquitted Galloway of all counts presented to it. It was only subsequently, after the jury was excused, when the trial court found him guilty of two counts in the same case, that the verdicts in the case became inconsistent. The inconsistency, therefore, was created by the trial court. This is not one of those situations where significantly different evidence is considered by the trial court and thus, the inconsistency can be explained, and the general rule might not apply. In this case both verdicts depended upon identical evidence as to the material evidentiary issue. Accordingly, the trial court created improper inconsistent verdicts and its verdicts as to counts 8 and 9 shall be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The trial court should have honored the jury\u2019s verdict and not rendered inconsistent verdicts. Upon receiving the jury\u2019s verdicts, the trial judge should have dismissed counts 8 and 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, in relevant part, explicitly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">\u201cThat in all criminal prosecutions, everyman hath a right ... to a speedy trial by an impartial jury, without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">In a criminal case a judge\u2019s role as it impacts on a jury\u2019s interpretation of the facts is normally limited to determining whether the facts support a jury\u2019s conclusions as to a conviction, not, as, what in essence occurred in the case at bar, whether the facts support a jury\u2019s conclusion as to an acquittal. If this Court were to approve the inconsistent verdicts rendered by the trial judge, it would be authorizing a practice that would permit the State to achieve a judgement of conviction that overrides a jury\u2019s finding of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Moreover to accept what occurred here would be to create different, harsher, standards in criminal cases than in civil cases. We are unwilling to afford less protection to the jury trial rights of a criminal defendant, whose very liberty, or even his or her life, is at stake, than to a civil litigant, where, generally, it is money that is at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-11\">.

Appellant moved for severance of charges in his pretrial motions pursuant to Maryland Rules 4-252 and 4-253, seeking two separate trials, one for counts 1 through 7 collectively and another for counts 8 and 9 collectively. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-252 (concerning motions in the circuit court); Md. Rule 4-253(c) (providing that \u201c[i]f it appears that any party will be prejudiced by the joinder for trial of counts, charging documents, or defendants, the court may, on its own initiative or on motion of any party, order separate trials of counts, charging documents, or defendants, or grant any other relief as justice requires\u201d). The trial court, instead of fully granting the motion to sever and scheduling a separate trial of counts 8 and 9, approved of the unusual procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">. During the jury trial, but out of the hearing of the jury, the State introduced to the court evidence of appellant\u2019s prior convictions. The predicate conviction underlying count 8 (possession of a regulated firearm after a conviction of any violation is classified as a common law offense where the person received a term of imprisonment of more than two years) stemmed from appellant's prior conviction on September 29, 1993 in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County for battery. The predicate conviction underlying count 9 (possession of a regulated firearm after a conviction of any violation classified as a misdemeanor that carries a statutory penalty of more than two years) stemmed from appellant's prior conviction on March 24, 1992 in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore City for possession of a controlled dangerous substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\">. On two separate occasions during the course of the trial, appellant asked the court to defer delivering its verdict on counts 8 and 9 until the jury returned its verdict on counts 1 though 7. The State objected on both occasions, arguing that the court's deliberation on the two counts before it had \u201cnothing to do with the jury\u2019s deliberation\u201d on counts 1 through 7, and that each trier of fact should announce its verdict at the time the verdict is reached, and not in accordance with some predetermined sequence. The court ultimately acquiesced to appellant's request. The sequence in which the verdicts were returned has little bearing on our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\">. \"[U]nder both the Fifth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] and Maryland common law, it is established that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is embodied in the double jeopardy prohibition.\u201d <em>Ferrell v. </em>State, 318 Md. 235, 241, 567 A.2d 937, 940 (1990) (alterations added). <em>See Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 445, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1195, 25 L.Ed.2d 469, 476 (1970) (holding that collateral estoppel is \"embodied in the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy\u201d).

And outside of the hearing of the jury, at the close of the State\u2019s case ... the State can admit to the [c]ourt the two true test copies of the convictions that are the subjects of those two counts.... And once the jury has made it\u2019s [sic] ... finding ... as far as the guilt or innocence on the counts submitted to it, the [c]ourt could make its\u2019 [sic] [decision], [h]aving heard all the same evidence which would be presented.... [T]he Judge just sits, and the jury has no idea obviously that it\u2019s [the simultaneous trial is] going on.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b580-9\">. <em>See supra </em>footnote 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\">. Initially, the appellant made a normal motion to sever the counts for a separate trial. The State objected, asserting that the potential prejudice could be addressed by way of instruction. After the State objected, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\"[Appellant's Counsel] ... Mr. Galloway advises he\u2019d be willing to waive his right to a jury trial on counts 8 and 9.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">At this point there is no indication that appellant\u2019s counsel is doing anything other than agreeing to waive his jury trial rights in a subsequent trial on the severed counts. At that point the State asked permission of the trial court to confer with the appellant\u2019s counsel. Alter that conference the State addressed the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\"[The State] ... if counsel and the defendant are willing to waive their right to a jury trial on the last two counts and proceed before the Court on those, the State will not object to severing those two counts from the indictment\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">At this point it is, at the least, unclear that there is to be a simultaneous single trial. The State is agreeing to sever the counts \"from the indictment\u201d. If they were actually severed, they would no longer be in this case, but would normally constitute a separate criminal case. Appellant\u2019s counsel then proceeds with a jury trial waiver inquiry of his client, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">\"[Appellant's Counsel] We are going to have a jury trial with respect to Counts 1 through 7. Counts 8 and 9, however, it\u2019s my understanding you\u2019re willing to give up your right to a jury trial and let Judge Allison decide your guilt or innocence. ... Are you willing to give up your right to a jury trial as to these last two counts?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">While the docket entries reflect that the trial court granted the motion to sever, the transcript is silent on that issue, only reflecting that the trial court accepted a waiver of jury trial rights on counts 8 and 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">The parties than proceeded on with what occurred below. Had counts 8 and 9 been properly severed, and been the focus of a separate bench trial, the same, or a very similar litany may well have been employed. From the litany alone, it is not entirely clear what was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>going on and it is certainly not' clear <em>that it was appellant who requested </em>a simultaneous jury and bench trial. In any event, given our decision, the clarity of the litany and the question of which party initiated a consideration of this procedure have little relevance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b584-10\">.

In cases where severance has properly occurred, it may be possible that a subsequent court verdict might, at first glance, appear to be inconsistent, when, in fact, it is because the court was presented with a significantly different set of facts, <em>i.e., </em>if the facts that a court is relying on during the subsequent separate trial of properly severed counts are sufficiently different than the facts presented to the jury in the prior jury trial. An example might be where a felon is accused of accosting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>person with a handgun, and, when the police are called, flees into a house. Subsequently, when, upon the arrival of the police, the felon is later arrested in the house ihe police might then discover a gun upon his person. At the jury trial the witnesses might testily that they observed no gun on his person. At the subsequent court trial the officers might testify that they recovered a gun upon his person. In that circumstance, a jury might find that at the time of the accosting on the street the felon had no handgun on his person and render a not guilty verdict in the case before it. At the court trial the judge might, lind that the felon illegally had a handgun on his person when arrested. In such circumstances it might be arguable that the verdicts are not inconsistent, but that argument, if viable, would be so because of differing factual contexts in separate cases. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the facts relied upon by the differing fact-finders were presented simultaneously and were identical, and the differing verdicts were, under those factual circumstances, inherently inconsistent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\">. <em>Curtis Williams </em>along with our case of <em>Wright </em>will be discussed at length later as we further explain our decision in respect to inconsistency of court and jury fact finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b603-11\">. <em>Gray v.

The Court is correct in holding that, on the record in this case, once the jury returned verdicts of not guilty on Counts 5, 6, and 7, it was impermissible for the judge to find appellant guilty on Counts 8 and 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">I write separately only to suggest that (1) the joinder of a criminal in possession of a firearm (CIP) charge with other charges that include, as an element, the possession of a weapon, necessarily raises the prospect of either undue prejudice to the defendant or of inconsistent verdicts, regardless of the procedure used to deal with the joinder, and (2) although the common law rule against inconsistent verdicts, except when rendered by the same jury at the same time, suffices to resolve this case, it is not the best approach. Also applicable, and, to me, preferable, is collateral estoppel \u2014 both the common law doctrine and its incorporation into the prohibition against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">It is becoming increasingly common to include a CIP count in an indictment that contains, or is to be joined with another indictment containing, other charges requiring proof of the defendant\u2019s possession of a weapon, and that presents a dilemma for both the prosecution and the defense, especially under the Maryland CIP statute. Article 27, \u00a7 445(d) makes it a felony, subject to a mandatory sentence of five years imprisonment, not subject to suspension or parole, for a person to be in possession of a regulated firearm if the person (1) has been convicted of a felony, a crime of violence, or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>misdemeanor carrying more than a two year sentence, (2) is a fugitive from justice, a habitual drunkard, or a habitual user of a controlled dangerous substance, (3) is suffering from a mental disorder and either has a history of violence or has been confined for more than 30 consecutive days in a mental institution, (4) is currently subject to a non-e* <em>parte </em>civil protection order, or (5) is less than 30 and was, in the past, adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile for committing a felony, crime of violence, or misdemeanor carrying a sentence of more than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Ordinarily, those various elements of the CIP law relating to the defendant\u2019s criminal or juvenile record, mental health status, addiction to alcohol or controlled dangerous substances, or history of violence would not be admissible with respect to any other offense, and, except in the rare circumstance, the defense would most likely not want that kind of evidence presented to the jury while it is considering the other offenses. The State, on the other hand, does not want to have to try the case twice \u2014 once to prove that the defendant committed the current offense embodying possession of a weapon and again to prove that element of the CIP offense. If the jury convicts on the other offenses embodying possession of a firearm, the only additional evidence needed to establish the CIP count is the defendant\u2019s previous record or status. If, as is most often the case, the State is relying on a previous conviction, juvenile adjudication, or existing civil protection order, in the absence of some real dispute about the matter, that fact may ordinarily be supplied either by stipulation or by certified documents. If the State is relying on the defendant\u2019s mental health status or addiction to alcohol or drugs, especially when coupled with a history of violence, that issue could well become a major one in the trial and, because of its clear potential for undue prejudice, almost require some form of separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Several different approaches have been tried in order to resolve the problem. The one least favorable to the defendant is to have the jury consider all of -the charges together, including the CIP charge, which would either allow evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the defendant\u2019s unsavory record or status to be presented, with a limiting instruction with respect to that evidence or, as is often the case, a stipulation as to the defendant\u2019s status coupled with a limiting instruction. That approach, of course, does not raise the issue presented here, because inconsistent verdicts rendered by the same jury at the same time are accepted, but, as noted, it may well be inadequate to address the problem of undue prejudice, especially if the CIP charge rests on a serious or violent prior offense or a history of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Because of the potential for prejudice, on motion or by agreement, the court may sever the CIP count for later trial, which could be before a different jury or, if the defendant waives a jury, before a judge. To avoid separate trials, which could require the empaneling of a new jury and a repetition of much of the evidence presented to the first jury, the court may take the intermediate step, as was done in <em>United States v. Joshua, </em>976 F.2d 844 (3d Cir.1992), of bifurcating the CIP charge \u2014 allowing the jury to consider only the current substantive charges first, and then, after it renders a verdict on those charges, having that same jury hear the additional evidence and then consider the CIP charge. Presumably, the bifurcated CIP charge could later be heard by the judge, provided the defendant agrees to waive his right to have the jury consider it. As the <em>Joshua, </em>court pointed out, not everyone agrees that the bifurcation approach is a good one, even where the jury ends up hearing all of the charges. The approach taken here, of essentially separate, but contemporaneous, trials \u2014 one before the jury, one before the judge-is simply another option.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The Federal courts have approved several of these approaches (although never the one used here). Some have found no error in the District Court\u2019s refusal to sever the CIP count and its allowance of either evidence of or a stipulation to the defendant\u2019s prior conviction. <em>See United States v. Bowie, </em>142 F.3d 1301 (D.C.Cir.1998) (stipulation); <em>United States v. Ward, </em>1996 WL 143470, 1996 U.S.App. LEXIS 10098 (6th Cir.1996) (unreported) (evidence presented); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number><em>Stokes, </em>211 F.3d 1039 (7th Cir.2000) (stipulation); <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>150 F.3d 851 (8th Cir.1998) (stipulation); <em>United States v. Wacker, </em>72 F.3d 1453 (10th Cir.1995) (stipulation). Others have approved of the bifurcation procedure. <em>See United States v. DeMasi, </em>40 F.3d 1306 (1st Cir.1994) (apparent bifurcation); <em>United States v. Joshua, supra, </em>976 F.2d 844 (bifurcation); <em>United States v. Yazzie, </em>1998 WL 75707, No. 97-10068, 1998 U.S.App. LEXIS 3054 (9th Cir. Feb. 23, 1998) (unreported) (bifurcation); <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>88 F.3d 812 (9th Cir.1996) (preference for bifurcation or severance); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>1995 WL 236718, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5334 (S.D.N.Y. April 24, 1995) (stipulation or bifurcation); <em>United States v. Bodie, </em>990 F.Supp. 1419 (S.D.Fla.1997) (bifurcation). At least two courts have required a severance. <em>See United States v. Singh, </em>261 F.3d 530 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Gunn, </em>968 F.Supp. 1089 (E.D.Va.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">These various approaches all have pluses and minuses from the point of view of good judicial administration. Absent some agreement that would allow the trier of fact as to the CIP count to rely on the evidence produced at the trial of the other counts, severance or bifurcation may require two, largely duplicative, trials. It also raises the prospect either of inconsistent verdicts or a collateral estoppel/double jeopardy bar. If the first jury convicts on a possession count and the second jury (or judge) acquits on the CIP count, even on uncontested evidence of the defendant\u2019s requisite status, the law would require that the inconsistent verdicts be accepted; the acquittal on the CIP count could not be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">If the jury were to acquit on the possession charge and there is no independent evidence of possession, the issue of inconsistent verdicts would probably not even arise; the question in that circumstance would be whether, on collateral estoppel/double jeopardy principles, a second trial could even take place.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The procedure used here, of a simultaneous trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>raises the same prospects, of the jury convicting and the judge acquitting or of the jury acquitting and the issue being raised of what the judge may then do. That issue, it seems to me, is better resolved by holding that, on collateral estoppel/double jeopardy principles, the judge may not proceed but must dismiss the CIP count, rather than allowing the judge to proceed with a trial, knowing that his or her only option is to acquit, regardless of how the judge actually views the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The point is that the problem we address here can arise whenever, by any procedure, the jury does not resolve the CIP charge together with and at the same time as the other possession offense, and, when that occurs and the jury acquits, the problem is really one of collateral estoppel/double jeopardy. If the issue is approached that way, the procedure used here or a bifurcated trial approach has much to commend it; it saves time and judicial resources without any prejudice to the defendant. Had the jury in this case convicted on Counts 5, 6, and 7, there would be no impediment to the judge convicting on Counts 8 and 9. If, as occurred, the jury acquitted, that would end the matter, even if there had been a severance or <em>Joshua </em>type of bifurcation.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Because I would approach the issue as one of collateral estoppel/double jeopardy, I do not agree with Judge Harrell that appellant waived his right to insist that Counts 8 and 9 be dismissed. The question is not whether the defendant waived his right to a jury trial on Counts 8 and 9; clearly, he did. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The issue is whether he waived his right against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Although collateral estoppel/double jeopardy may, in some instances, be waived, where the choice is either to allow otherwise inadmissible and prejudicial evidence to be admitted or to insist on a bifurcation, severance, or procedure such as that employed here, I do not believe that the bar of waiver is appropriate. By insisting on a procedure that would preclude the prejudicial evidence from being admitted, the defendant does not waive his/her right to a dismissal of the CIP count(s) in the event of an acquittal on a possession charge. It would be wholly impermissible to make a defendant choose between one right (to preclude the admission of unduly prejudicial evidence) and another (double jeopardy).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\">. There are circumstances in which a second trial on the CIP charge and a guilty verdict on that charge would be permissible. As here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>substantive charge may be an aggravated assault with a handgun, and the evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s commission of that crime may be in sharp dispute. There might also be evidence, however, that, in its investigation of the assault, the police searched the defendant at a later time and place and found him in possession of a gun. Acquittal on the assault charge could well be based on the jury's doubt that the defendant committed the assault and would therefore not necessarily require acquittal on the CIP charge, which could rest on the later possession. In this case, there was no such independent evidence. The only evidence connecting appellant to a regulated firearm was that pertaining to the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Dissent by</p>\n<author id=\"AAz\">HARRELL, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AN_\">joined by RAKER and BATTAGLIA, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">I am unable to accept, on the record of this case, the reasoning embodied in the Majority opinion or its result. The Majority condemns the procedure utilized in Appellant\u2019s trial, yet that procedure was put in place largely at Appellant\u2019s request and with his acquiescence. Appellant should have foreseen, in urging the trial judge to structure the trial and return of verdicts as was done, the real possibility of the disparate outcomes. Moreover, the Majority\u2019s concern for an impingement on Appellant\u2019s right to a jury trial gives little real weight to the fact that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial as to the counts for which the court convicted him. For the reasons that follow, I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The Majority rejects the proposition that the trial judge had the discretion to grant the admittedly non-traditional simultaneous-trial procedure used in the instant case. The Majority opinion severely and unduly undercuts the well-established principle that the decision to join or sever charges ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, <em>See Frazier v. State, </em>318 Md., 597, 607, 569 A.2d 684, 689 (1990); <em>Grandi-son v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 705, 506 A.2d 580, 589 (1986); <em>But see McKnight v. State, </em>280 Md. 604, 612, 375 A.2d 551, 556 (1977) (mandating severance where a defendant charged with similar but unrelated offenses establishes that \u201cthe evidence as to each individual offense would not be mutually admissible at separate trials\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In the present case, the trial judge was aware of the potential for spill-over prejudice on counts 1 through 7 from the admission of Appellant\u2019s prior criminal record on the criminal-in-possession charges (counts 8 and 9). This concern was particularly acute here due to the similar nature of the crimes charged in the indictment with the predicate prior offense underlying count 8, i.e., battery. The simultaneous-trial proceeding erected, in essence, an \u201cinformational wall\u201d between the judge and jury on the argument and prejudicial evidence presented on the criminal-in-possession charges. This procedure effectively precluded any possibility that the jury\u2019s verdict on counts 1 through 7 could be tainted by the necessary admission of Appellant\u2019s prior criminal record as to counts 8 and 9, while still allowing the State the opportunity to present its entire case without the duplicative presentation of evidence that would occur as a result of conducting consecutive trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">As acknowledged by the Majority (Maj. op. at 394-95), Maryland Rule 4-258(c) expressly vests in a trial judge the discretion to sever counts in a multi-count indictment to avoid prejudicial joinder. The trial procedure utilized here was commensurate with the court\u2019s power to sever and within its authority to \u201cgrant any other relief as justice requires.\u201d Assuming a defendant properly waives his or her right to a jury trial on the counts adjudicated by the court, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 4-246(b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would hold that implementation of the simultaneous-trial procedure, although not traditional, strikes an ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>propriate balance between the twin concerns of prejudicial joinder and judicial economy, and is within the sound discretion of the trial court to grant. In explaining my reasoning, I shall address both of Galloway\u2019s questions as raised in his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">It is well settled that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cprohibits successive prosecutions as well as cumulative punishment\u201d for the same offense. <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 166, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2226, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977). <em>See Farrell v. State, </em>364 Md. 499, 504, 774 A.2d 387, 390 (2001). This constitutional guarantee is applicable to this State through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>see Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 787, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2058, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969), and is rooted in Maryland common law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Maryland\u2019s courts often draw on the cases of the Supreme Court for guidance in developing our double jeopardy jurisprudence and, for this reason, our common law is generally harmonious with constitutional interpretations of the federal provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The double jeopardy prohibition provides a criminal defendant three basic protections. It protects against: (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal (common law plea of <em>autrefois acquit)-, </em>(2) a second prosecution for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>same offense after conviction (common law plea of <em>autrefois </em>convict); and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>See State v. Griffiths, </em>338 Md. 485, 494, 659 A.2d 876, 881 (1995) (quoting <em>Brown, </em>432 U.S. at 165, 97 S.Ct. at 2225, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (citation omitted)); <em>Huff v. State, </em>325 Md. 55, 74, 599 A.2d 428, 437 (1991) (citing <em>Gianiny v. State, </em>320 Md. 337, 347, 577 A.2d 795, 799-800 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Indispensable to a proper understanding of double jeopardy law is an appreciation of the policy considerations that mandate its enforcement. It has been stated on many occasions that the double jeopardy prohibition is premised on \u201cthe belief that \u2018the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting [a defendant] to embarrassment, expense, and ordeal and compelling him for her] to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent [a defendant] may still be found guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

Repeated prosecutorial sallies would unfairly burden the defendant and create a risk of conviction through sheer governmental perseverance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>Tibbs, </em>457 U.S. at 41-42, 102 S.Ct. at 2218, 72 L.Ed.2d 652 (internal quotations omitted) (citations omitted). <em>See Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 325, 765 A.2d 97, 124 (2001). To this end, the Double Jeopardy Clause \u201cguards against Government oppression.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 99, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2198, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wright v. State, </em>307 Md. 552, 515 A.2d 1157 (1986), Appellant\u2019s first contention is that the finality of the jury acquittal on the charge of carrying a handgun (count 7) precluded further proceedings by the trial court on the \u201csame offense\u201d of possessing a firearm (counts 8 and 9). Raising the shield of <em>autrefois acquit, </em>Appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s decision ignored the one absolute rule of double jeopardy analysis: \u201c[tjhere [are] no exception^] permitting retrial once the defendant has been acquitted, no matter how egregiously erroneous.\u201d (Quoting <em>Sanatoria v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 54, 75, 98 S.Ct. 2170, 2184, 57 L.Ed.2d 43 (1978) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The State, of course, does not take issue with the basic principles of finality discussed and applied in <em>Wright. </em>It concedes that \u201cthe status accorded to an acquittal on criminal charges is a fundamental one and quite unforgiving of mistakes, errors, or irregularities.\u201d Nevertheless, the State contends the doctrine of <em>autrefois acquit </em>does not apply here because the simultaneous court and jury trial procedure was the result of Appellant\u2019s deliberate choice. Consequently, the State argues, the policy considerations supporting a double jeopardy claim \u2014 to prevent government oppression \u2014 are not implicated here. I agree. Appellant\u2019s instrumental role in fashioning the trial process, and the absence of the type of \u201cevils\u201d the Double Jeopardy Clause is designed to prevent, removed any constitutional or common law barrier under double jeopardy principles to the trial court\u2019s decision in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The State relies on two closely analogous double jeopardy cases in support of its contention. <em>See Jeffers v. United States, </em>432 U.S. 137, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>Ohio v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 493, 104 S.Ct. 2536, 81 L.Ed.2d 425 (1984). The facts in <em>Jeffers </em>may be summarized briefly. Jeffers was charged in two separate indictments with conspiracy to distribute narcotics and conducting a continuing-criminal-enterprise to violate the drug laws. Shortly after the indictments were returned, the Government filed a motion to consolidate the charges. Jeffers successfully opposed the Government\u2019s motion, and thereafter was tried and convicted on the conspiracy charge. Jeffers then moved to dismiss the remaining charge on \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d grounds, claiming that he had already been placed in jeopardy for the \u201csame offense,\u201d in that the conspiracy charge was a lesser included offense of the continuing-criminal-enterprise charge. Jeffers\u2019s motion was denied and he was subsequently tried and convicted on the second charge as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In a plurality opinion, the <em>Jeffers </em>Court found the case to be an exception to the general rule that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a State or the federal government \u201cfrom trying a defendant for a greater offense after it has convicted him of lesser included offense,\u201d which general rule had been announced that same day in <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 169, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2227, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977). <em>Jeffers, </em>432 U.S. at 150, 97 S.Ct. at 2216, 53 L.Ed.2d 168. Finding Jeffers \u201csolely responsible\u201d for the successive prosecutions on the conspiracy charge and the continuing-criminal-enterprise charge, the Court held that his action \u201cdeprived him of any right that he might have had against consecutive trials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Similarly, in <em>Ohio v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 493, 104 S.Ct. 2536, 81 L.Ed.2d 425 (1984), the Court concluded that <em>Brown\u2019s </em>rule against successive prosecutions for greater and lesser included offenses did not apply where a defendant has entered, over the State\u2019s objection, guilty pleas to lesser included offenses while charges of greater offenses remained pending under a multi-count indictment brought in a single prosecution. Calling this an even clearer case than <em>Jeffers, </em>the Court underscored the absence of \u201cgovernmental overreaching\u201d in a single prosecution, observing that this was not a case where the State had \u201cthe opportunity to marshal its evidence and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>sources more than once or to hone its presentation of its case through a trial.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>467 U.S. at 501, 104 S.Ct. at 2542, 81 L.Ed.2d 425. The Court concluded that under the circumstances, the defendant \u201cshould not be entitled to use the Double Jeopardy Clause as a sword to prevent the State from completing its prosecution on the remaining charges.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>467 U.S. at 502, 104 S.Ct. at 2542, 81 L.Ed.2d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In the present case, Appellant was indicted on nine related charges in a single indictment stemming from the same incident. At the time Appellant filed his motion for severance of counts 8 and 9, there was nothing to prevent the State from prosecuting Appellant for multiple offenses, including lesser included offenses, in one trial proceeding. <em>See Johnson, </em>467 U.S. at 501, 104 S.Ct. at 2541-42, 81 L.Ed.2d 425; <em>Jeffers, </em>432 U.S. at 153, 97 S.Ct. at 2217-18, 53 L.Ed.2d 168; <em>Frazier, </em>318 Md. at 607, 569 A.2d at 689. Moreover, it appears that Appellant may have been entitled to a limiting jury instruction, minimizing the prejudicial effect of his prior convictions. Appellant, however, deliberately chose not to pursue this course of action, but rather opted to pursue the separate, but simultaneous, court and jury trials that ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Responding to the State\u2019s objection to severance and suggestion that Appellant instead request a limiting jury instruction, Appellant\u2019s counsel replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">[Galloway] advises he\u2019d be willing to waive his right to a jury trial on Counts 8 and 9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">In response, the State asked the court\u2019s permission to confer with Appellant\u2019s counsel, after which the State said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">Your Honor, if the \u2014 if counsel and the defendant are willing to waive their right to a jury trial on the last two counts and proceed before the [c]ourt on those, the State will not object to severing those two counts from the indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">Thereupon, Appellant\u2019s counsel qualified Appellant on his knowing partial waiver of his right to a jury trial and the manner in which the trial would proceed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>[Galloway\u2019s counsel:] Mr. Galloway, you understand that we are going to have a jury trial in the first seven counts of your case? It\u2019s going to be 12 people selected at ran-dom____Those 12 people will hear your case, and all 12 of them ... must agree that the State has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt before you can be convicted. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">[Galloway]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">[Galloway\u2019s counsel:] We are going to have a jury trial with respect to Counts 1 through 7. Counts 8 and 9, however, it\u2019s my understanding you\u2019re willing to give up your right to a jury trial and let [the trial judge] decide your guilt or innocence. Again, [the trial judge] would have to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt before you could be convicted of those two counts, <em>but it would be just her making that decision and not 12 citizens. </em>Are you willing to give up your right to a jury trial as to those last two counts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">[Galloway:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">(Emphasis added). Shortly thereafter, and before the jury was sworn, the State proffered in greater detail the manner in which it anticipated the trial would proceed, and Appellant concurred with that recitation. <em>See </em>Maj. op. at 389-90, n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">I think it clear that the principles enunciated in <em>Jeffers </em>and <em>Johnson </em>are applicable on the record before us. Appellant\u2019s deliberate and calculated election to sever counts 8 and 9 from the indictment and to engage in the simultaneous court and jury trial proceeding were clearly trial tactics. In a hearing on Appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial on 27 June 2001, Appellant\u2019s counsel discussed his motivation in making the request. Asked by the court to distinguish the case at bar from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson, </em>Appellant\u2019s counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-11\">[In <em>Johnson </em>] ... I think there was a great degree of finagling by Defense counsel to get the plea to the lesser included offense heard first in order to set the case up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>make it [a] double jeopardy standard. Now I will admit to a certain amount of finagling on my own part in this case. I did move to sever the charges. I asked the [cjourt to hear and decide the counts eight and nine, but the reason for that Your Honor, was not so that I could raise the shield of double jeopardy at a later date. The reason for that was that I did not want the jury to hear that my client had a misdemeanor conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">After further discussion, Appellant\u2019s counsel reiterated his prior remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">Now as far as Defense finagling or anything of that nature, the only purpose of that was to keep the evidence, the misdemeanor convictions away from the jury. Now Your Honor, I\u2019m well aware of the case that [the State] cites that it would not have been an abuse of this [c]ourt\u2019s discretion to require all the charges to have gone to the jury and denied the motion to sever. Frasier [sic] says it was within the [c]ourt\u2019s discretion to sever and the [c]ourt did sever so I think we\u2019re past that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Appellant engaged in similar tactics in urging the court to defer its verdict until after the jury had rendered its verdict. During Appellant\u2019s argument on his motion for a new trial, the court questioned the \u201cfortuity\u201d of the sequence in which the verdicts were rendered. Noting that it had deferred its verdict at Appellant\u2019s request,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court questioned whether the jury would have been bound by the court\u2019s factual finding had the court disregarded Appellant\u2019s request and rendered its verdict first. Avoiding a direct response, Appellant\u2019s coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>sel explained that \u201c[his] strategy in this case\u201d was that \u201cthe-[c]ourt would follow the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">While it is entirely within the Appellant\u2019s right to attempt to influence the trial process in a manner that best serves his interests, nonetheless, Appellant cannot reap the intended benefits of his efforts,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but avoid their attendant burdens and foreseeable consequences. Appellant was entitled to have all of the charges against him resolved in one proceeding. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the criminal-in-possession counts were the \u201csame offense\u201d as any of the first seven counts of the indictment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> like the defendant in <em>Jeffers, </em>it was Appellant\u2019s own action that resulted in the functional equivalent of two separate trials.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, Appellant had a complete appreci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u2022ation for the manner in which the trial was to be conducted, first by his counsel\u2019s description to him during the jury trial waiver colloquy, and later in the State\u2019s detailed explanation of the anticipated procedure. This procedure necessarily contemplated the possibility that two independent fact-finders might reach conflicting verdicts. Legal consequences flow from such tactical decisions. When a defendant voluntarily elects to proceed in a particular course of action, he or she must accept the foreseeable consequences of those elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Of equal import in my consideration of this matter is the absence of State oppression which the double jeopardy prohibition is intended to prevent. Double jeopardy principles ordinarily are implicated in a sequential setting. Here, the court and jury trials were heard simultaneously, not successively, with evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions heard by the court alone. The State did not institute an entirely new prosecution for the same offense following an acquittal or conviction of Appellant. Accordingly, none of the \u201chazards of trial, embarrassment and anxiety\u201d attendant in successive prosecutions are present. <em>Parks, </em>287 Md. at 14, 410 A.2d at 600. In this regard, this case more closely resembles the single prosecution of <em>Johnson </em>than the successive prosecutions found in <em>Jeffers. </em>This is not the example of an all-powerful State determined to convict a defendant through \u201csheer governmental perseverance.\u201d <em>See supra </em>pages 427-428. As did the Court in <em>Johnson, </em>I find \u201cthere simply has been none of the governmental overreaching that double jeopardy is supposed to prevent.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>467 U.S. at 502, 104 S.Ct. at 2542.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>The foregoing analysis is consistent also with prior decisions that have refused to apply a double jeopardy bar to a subsequent prosecution where initial jeopardy terminated for reasons other than evidentiary insufficiency. Thus, for example, retrial following a defendant\u2019s successful appeal of a conviction for trial error is not barred under double jeopardy principles. <em>See United States v. Tateo, </em>377 U.S. 463, 465, 84 S.Ct. 1587, 1589, 12 L.Ed.2d 448 (1964); <em>United States v. Ball, </em>163 U.S. 662, 672, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 1195, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896) (\u201c[A] defendant, who procures a judgment against him upon an indictment to be set aside, may be tried anew upon the same indictment, or upon another indictment, for the same offence of which he had been convicted.\u201d) (citations omitted). <em>But see Burks, </em>437 U.S. at 11, 98 S.Ct. at 2147, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (announcing the narrow exception barring retrial when a verdict is set aside for insufficiency of the evidence). While this well-established rule has been justified under various legal theories,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it most commonly is premised on the following three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>grounds: (1) a defendant\u2019s role in reversing the conviction, see <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 720-21, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2078, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969) (noting that this \u201cwell-established\u201d rule rests on the \u201cpremise that the original conviction has, at the defendant\u2019s behest, been wholly nullified and the slate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>wiped clean\u201d); <em>accord Harris v. State, </em>312 Md. 225, 240, 539 A.2d 637, 644 (1988) (applying the \u201cclean slate\u201d rationale of Pearce); <em>Parks, </em>287 Md. at 19, 410 A.2d at 602 (explaining that \u201ca defendant cannot by his own act avoid the jeopardy in which he stands and then assert it as a bar to a subsequent jeopardy.\u201d); (2) policy considerations, <em>see, e.g., Tibbs, </em>457 U.S. at 40, 102 S.Ct. at 2217, 72 L.Ed.2d 652 (explaining that \u201cretrial after reversal of a conviction is not the type of governmental oppression targeted by the Double Jeopardy Clause\u201d); <em>accord Scott, </em>437 U.S. at 91, 98 S.Ct. at 2194, 57 L.Ed.2d 65; and (3) on the basis of fairness in the administration of justice. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 344, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 1022, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975) (citing <em>Tateo, </em>377 U.S. at 465-66, 84 S.Ct. at 1589, 12 L.Ed.2d 448, for the proposition that \u201cthe practical justification ... is simply that it is fairer to both the defendant and the Government\u201d); <em>accord Parks, </em>287 Md. at 16, 410 A.2d at 601 (\u201cNot only is the right of the defendant to an error-free trial protected but the societal interest that the guilty should be punished is preserved.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">For similar reasons, a defendant\u2019s voluntary request for a mistrial ordinarily will not bar re-prosecution under double jeopardy principles. <em>See, e.g., Scott, </em>437 U.S. at 93, 98 S.Ct. at 2195, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (characterizing a defendant\u2019s voluntary request for a mistrial as a \u201cdeliberate election on [a defendant\u2019s] part to forgo his valued right to have his guilt or innocence determined before the first trier of fact\u201d); <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. at 609, 96 S.Ct. at 1080, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (\u201cThe important consideration, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed in the event of [judicial or prosecutorial] error.\u201d). <em>But see Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 679, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 2091, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982) (recognizing the narrow exception that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes retrial of a defendant whose mistrial request is granted when \u201cthe conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>mistrial\u201d). <em>See also Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 576, 587-88, 625 A.2d 932, 937 (1993) (\u201cOrdinarily, of course, when a defendant requests a mistrial, he waives his \u2018valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 837, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949)); <em>Bell v. State, </em>286 Md. 193, 202, 406 A.2d 909, 913 (1979). Likewise, re-prosecution is not barred when a defendant successfully moves for a mid-trial dismissal on grounds unrelated to guilt or innocence. <em>See, e.g., Scott, </em>437 U.S. at 99, 98 S.Ct. at 2198, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (concluding that \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause, which guards against Government oppression, does not relieve a defendant from the consequences of his voluntary choice.\u201d); <em>Lee v. United States, </em>432 U.S. 23, 31, 97 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 53 L.Ed.2d 80 (1977) (observing that the \u201cproceedings were terminated at the defendant\u2019s request and with his consent,\u201d the Court ultimately held that defendant\u2019s successful dismissal did not offend double jeopardy principles).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The preceding cases are consistent with the rationale applied in <em>Jeffers </em>and Johnson.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, the circumstances presented in the case at hand fit squarely within this line of double jeopardy jurisprudence. It is clear that Appellant (and not the State) exercised the primary advocacy in achieving severance of the inherently prejudicial charges from the first seven counts and the simultaneous court and jury trials that followed. Likewise, Appellant solicited the order in which the verdicts were rendered. <em>See supra </em>note 5. Consequently, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>interests protected by double jeopardy principles were offended here. Furthermore, this reasoning is in accord with principles of fairness and the \u201csound administration of justice\u201d embraced in <em>Tateo, </em>377 U.S. at 465-66, 84 S.Ct. at 1589, 12 L.Ed.2d 448, and by this Court in <em>Parks, </em>287 Md. at 16, 410 A.2d at 601. Just as the societal interest in punishing the guilty is preserved, so too is a defendant\u2019s right to secure a fair trial protected. Trial courts would be reluctant, at the very least, to grant a defendant\u2019s motion for severance on criminal-in-possession charges and to conduct simultaneous court and jury trials if to do so would give rise to double jeopardy implications. A decision that would allow for this possibility, in effect, would sound the death knell for a trial procedure that is manifestly in a defendant\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Accordingly, I would find the principles of finality applied in <em>Wright </em>inapplicable where a defendant freely elects to have two counts of a multi-count indictment severed and tried to the court, and elects to have the remaining counts tried to a jury in a simultaneous-trial proceeding. I conclude therefore, under the circumstances presented here, that Appellant was not deprived of the benefit of double jeopardy protections under either the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments or, independently, under Maryland common law double jeopardy principles. Moreover, for the foregoing reasons, the doctrine of collateral estoppel embodied under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and Maryland common law, does not apply in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">I turn now to Appellant\u2019s other claims of trial error. Appellant\u2019s first contention is that the trial court\u2019s guilty verdicts on counts 8 and 9 are fatally flawed because they are impermissi-bly inconsistent with the jury\u2019s verdict of not guilty on all counts. Relying on <em>Johnson v. State, </em>238 Md. 528, 209 A.2d 765 (1965), and related cases, Appellant contends that when the \u201csource of the [inconsistent verdict] is the jury, the inconsistency is tolerable; when the source of the inconsistency is the judge, it is not.\u201d It follows, Appellant argues, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\u201cbecause the court created the inconsistency, its verdict must be vacated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The State disputes the applicability of <em>Johnson </em>and related cases in the case <em>sub judice, </em>in light of the fact that \u201cthe [trial court\u2019s] two [guilty] verdicts were consistent with each other and were in no way governed by the outcome of the jury\u2019s verdicts.\u201d I agree. The general rules governing inconsistent verdicts in a criminal trial do not apply to inconsistencies between the verdicts of separate fact-finders rendered in separate, albeit simultaneous, court and jury trials <em>conducted at a defendant\u2019s request.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The rules governing inconsistent verdicts rendered by a trial judge in a non-jury trial were discussed by this Court in <em>State v. Anderson, </em>320 Md. 17, 575 A.2d 1227 (1990):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">It is ... settled in this State, as a nonconstitutional common law principle, that inconsistent verdicts of guilty and not guilty, by a trial judge at a nonjury trial, are not ordinarily permitted. The remedy is to reverse or vacate the judgment entered on the inconsistent guilty verdict. Where, however, there is apparent inconsistency in the verdicts at a nonjury trial, but where the trial judge on the record satisfactorily explains the apparent inconsistency, the guilty verdict may stand. If there is only an apparent inconsistency which in substance disappears upon review of the trial court\u2019s explanation, the guilty verdict will not be vacated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-8\"><em>Anderson, </em>320 Md. at 29-30, 575 A.2d at 1233 (footnote omitted) (internal quotations omitted) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See also Shell v.

Maybury, </em>274 F.2d 899, 905 (2nd Cir.1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">As the State correctly points out, the critical \u2014 and obvious \u2014 distinction between the cases Appellant and the Majority cite and the case now before us is the absence of an internal inconsistency in the trial court\u2019s verdict. This is not a case that demands reversal because we have no \u201cconfidence\u201d in the trial court\u2019s judgment. Indeed, the court articulated the reasons for its verdict. Finding that Appellant had been convicted previously of the predicate offenses underlying counts 8 and 9, the court explained that the remaining \u201cevi-dentiary issue is whether [Appellant] possessed a firearm on September 1, 1997.\u201d The court found the testimony of the State\u2019s chief witness, Robert Knox, to be credible. The court further noted that Mr. Knox\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Appellant\u2019s own witness, his mother, to the extent that \u201cshe heard shots that night and approximately ten to 12 seconds later she looked out her window and the [Appellant] was standing on the steps of her home.\u201d Accordingly, the court found that Appellant \u201cwas in possession of [a] gun for purposes of Article 27 Section 445D [sic],\u201d and entered a conviction on those counts. Clearly, the trial court is free to credit the testimony of the witnesses. <em>See State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323, 331 (1998) (\u201cWeighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflicts in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact finder.\u201d). <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 8-131(c) (stating that \u201c[w]hen an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court ... will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credence of the witnesses.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Appellant does not provide, nor was I able to find, authority for the proposition that the trial court in the trial of a criminal matter is bound by a jury\u2019s verdict in separate, but simulta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>neous, trial proceedings held at a defendant\u2019s request.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>supra </em>note 8. Accordingly, I view Appellant\u2019s contention in this regard as lacking merit. Moreover, for the reasons stated at <em>supra </em>pages 428-30, I find Appellant\u2019s assertion that he did not agree to the \u201cpossibility of inconsistent verdicts\u201d when he requested a bench trial on counts 8 and 9 likewise to be disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Finally, Appellant argues that the trial court improperly shifted the State\u2019s burden of proof when it credited Mr. Knox\u2019s testimony based on the absence of any \u201cevidence that the incident occurred in anyway other than that as testified to by Mr. Knox.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Appellant argues that this statement indicates the court improperly focused on the \u201cabsence of other evidence,\u201d and failed to evaluate adequately the credibility of Mr. Knox\u2019s testimony. Appellant\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The trial judge, in her instructions to the jury, explained the following concerning the State\u2019s burden of proof: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Giving appropriate deference to the trial court\u2019s decision and because an appellate court often presumes that the trial judge understands and properly applies the law, <em>see Whittlesey v. State, </em>340 Md. 30, 48, 665 A.2d 223, 232 (1995), I would conclude that the trial judge applied that same standard to her deliberations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The [Appellant] is presumed to be innocent of the charges.

In a footnote in the trial court\u2019s memorandum, dated 27 July 2001, denying Appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the trial judge explained the reason for delaying her verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">The court readily acquiesced to the defendant\u2019s request that the jury\u2019s verdict be taken before the court's to avoid any possibility that the jury would learn of, and be influenced by, the court\u2019s verdict. If defense counsel believed at the time of his request that double jeopardy or collateral estoppel precluded the second fact-[finder] to announce its decision from being inconsistent with the first fact-finder to announce its decision, he did not share that view with the court any time before the filing of the motion for a new trial.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b623-6\"><em>. </em>In his reply brief, Appellant seems to dispute the chain of events that led to the trial procedure utilized in the instant case. Arguing the State \"[r]e-work[ed] the procedural history\u201d to support its argument that Appellant was responsible for the manner in which the trial was conducted, Appellant claims that while he moved for severance of the charges, he anticipated \"completely separate judge and jury trials.\u201d Appellant contends he merely acquiesced to the prosecutor\u2019s proposal for the simultaneous court and jury trial procedure, as the prosecutor \"conditioned his consent [for severance on counts 8 and 9] on the two trials proceeding simultaneously.\u201d I believe the record supports the State's contention that Appellant prompted, and fully participated in, the decision to conduct the trial in the manner in which it was conducted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\">. Appellant contends that under this Court's analysis in <em>Frazier, </em>\"carrying a handgun [ (count 7) ] and possession of a handgun by a person with a prior conviction [ (counts 8 and 9) ] should be deemed the \u2018same offense\u2019 in accord with the \u2018same evidence' test established in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).\u201d For the reasons discussed above, I would not, and shall not, address this matter here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\">. I do not exalt form over substance in my determination that the trial procedure employed in this case involved two separate, though simultaneous, trials before two independent fact-finders. It is clear from the record that the court severed counts 8 and 9 from the single indictment. Appellant originally moved for sevetance of the charges in his pretrial motions. During the course of the motions hearing, and after conferring with Appellant's counsel, the State advised the court that it would \"not object to severing\u201d counts 8 and 9 from the indictment if the defendant was willing to waive his right to a jury trial on the same counts, which Appellant subsequently waived. <em>See supra </em>pages 428-29. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Moreover, the court noted in its 27 July 2001 memorandum that it had \"severed\u201d the two counts at defendant\u2019s request, and that the \u201ccourt and jury <em>trials </em>were heard simultaneously.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">. Appellant contends that this case can be distinguished from <em>Jeffers </em>and <em>Johnson </em>based on the fact that those cases involved prior convictions in the first prosecution, as opposed to the acquittal which occurred in the instant case. Appellant disregards, however, the extraordinary trial procedure that was employed in this case. The State did not pursue a course of seriatim prosecutions; rather it was separate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>but simultaneous, trials that simply required one verdict to be announced before the other. Indeed, Appellant directly was responsible for the order in which the verdicts were rendered. <em>See supra </em>note 5. Accordingly, the distinction Appellant urges is inapposite where, as here, the defendant is responsible for the simultaneous court and jury trials, as well as the order in which the verdicts are rendered by the independent fact-finders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b625-6\">. It has been stated on occasion that the general rule allowing retrial on a defendant's reversal of a conviction, first announced in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>163 U.S. 662, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896), is grounded on a \"waiver\u201d theory, i.e., the defendant has waived his or her double jeopardy rights by successfully appealing his or her conviction. <em>See Trono v. United States, </em>199 U.S. 521, 534, 26 S.Ct. 121, 124, 50 L.Ed. 292 (1905) (discussing ihe <em>Ball </em>doctrine, the Court explained that \"by appealing, the accused waives the right to thereafter plead once in jeopardy\u201d). The <em>Ball </em>doctrine has also been explained on the basis of a \u201ccontinuing jeopardy\u201d theory, a concept originally formulated by Justice Holmes in his dissent in <em>Kepner v. United States, </em>195 U.S. 100, 134-37, 24 S.Ct. 797, 806-07, 49 L.Ed. 114 (1904) (Holmes, J\u201e dissenting) (explaining the <em>Ball </em>principle on the basis that \"[t]he jeopardy is one continuing jeopardy from its beginning to the end of cause\u201d). <em>See Price v.

Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 609, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 1080, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976), expressly rejected the waiver analysis as applied to a defendant's successful motion for a mistrial. In this regard, the Supreme Court explained that \"traditional waiver concepts have little relevance where the defendant must determine whether or not to request or consent to a mistrial in response to judicial or prosecutorial error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a subsequent footnote, the Supreme Court further explained that the traditional standard of waiver of a constitutional right \u2014 knowing, intelligent, and voluntary \u2014 established in <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938), did not apply to the rule permitting retrials following a defendant\u2019s voluntary mistrial or a reversal of a conviction on appeal. <em>See Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. at 609 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. at 1080 n. 11, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (citing <em>Breed v.

The Court\u2019s holding in <em>Jeffers, </em>on occasion, has been characterized in dictum on the basis that Jeffers had \"waived\u201d his double jeopardy claim. <em>See Rutledge v.

Inconsistent verdicts in a jury trial, however, are tolerated. <em>See Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 54, 512 A.2d 358, 362 (1986) (\"The general view is that inconsistencies may be the product of lenity, mistake, or a compromise to reach unanimity, and that continual correction of such matters would undermine the historic role of the jury as the arbiter of questions put to it.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b632-5\">. Though not raised in Appellant\u2019s brief, Appellant\u2019s counsel seized upon a comment made in passing by a member of the Majority at oral argument concerning the authority of the trial court to render a verdict inconsistent with the jury\u2019s resolution of common factual issues. <em>See </em>Maj. op. at 400-16. In this regard, an analogy was drawn between the simultaneous court and jury trials presented in the instant case, and the circumstances presented in a civil context where, due to the presence of both equitable and legal issues, a trial is conducted both to the jury and to the court in a single proceeding. As noted earlier, this has become the Majority\u2019s raison d\u2019etat. While it is true in the latter circumstance that a judge cannot award equitable relief inconsistent with a jury's verdict, <em>see Edwards v. Gramling Eng'g Corp., </em>322 Md. 535, 543, 588 A.2d 793, 797 (1991) (citing with approval federal case law); <em>Higgins v. Barnes, </em>310 Md. 532, 541-42, 530 A.2d 724, 728 (1987), these cases, and those discussed in the Majority opinion, are not controlling in a criminal context where a defendant has waived his right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Since the 1984 merger of law and equity procedure in Maryland, parties may join legal and equitable claims in a single civil action. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-301 (abolishing the separation of law and equity, the rule provides that \"[tjhere shall be one form of action known as 'civil action.\u2019 \"). <em>See also Higgins, </em>310 Md. at 541, 530 A.2d at 728. In <em>Higgins, </em>this Court discussed the impact of the merger on a party\u2019s right to a jury trial. Recognizing an individual\u2019s historical right to a trial by jury, we noted that Article 23 of the Maryland Constitution Declaration of Rights provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">The right of trial by Jury of all issues of fact in civil proceedings in the several Courts of Law in this State, where the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of five hundred dollars, shall be inviolably preserved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-8\"><em>Higgins, </em>310 Md. at 542, 530 A.2d at 728-29. While acknowledging that this provision predated the 1984 merger, nonetheless, we determined that \"its guarantees remain as absolute under a merged system.\u201d <em>Higgins, </em>310 Md. at 542, 530 A.2d at 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">This being determined, we discussed, <em>inter alia, </em>the issue of whether a judge's inconsistent relief rendered on an equitable claim might violate an individual\u2019s jury right as to a companion legal claim. The implied concern was that the jury's factual findings on common issues could be set aside by the court, thereby circumventing an individual's constitutional right to a jury trial. To this end, we looked to analogous federal law for guidance, and quoted with approval the federal court conclusion that \"the jury determination of any issue common to both legal and equitable claims should precede court consideration of the equitable issues.\" <em>Higgins, </em>310 Md. at 542, 530 A.2d at 728 (citing <em>Ross v.
