On March 7, 1997, Mrs. Waites met with WCI\u2019s Warden, the appointing authority, and reported the offensive conversation. The Warden requested that the Internal Investigation Unit (\u201cIIU\u201d) investigate the allegations, the result of which \u2014 the investigating officer concluding that, in fact, Mr. Geiger had used the racial slur, \u201cnigger,\u201d during his conversation with Mrs. Waites, in violation of state and departmental standards<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014he received on April 11, 1997. Thereafter, on April 21, 1997, having conducted a mitigation conference with Mr. Geiger, who admitted using the racial slur,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Warden completed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>a Notice of Termination charging Mr. Geiger with violating departmental standards and Md. Regs.Code tit. 01, \u00a7 01.1995.19 (1995), which prohibits harassment and discrimination. The Notice was sent to the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (\u201cDPSCS\u201d), who, as required by \u00a7 11-104(7),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> approved the termination on May 2, 1997. Mr. Geiger received and signed the Notice on May 6,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">On August 29, 1997, William Mullen, a Correctional Officer II of the Roxbury Correctional Institution, was given a written reprimand for initiating an unsanctioned investigation of a fellow officer, Officer Brenda Shepherd, in violation of departmental standards of conduct and performance. The allegations were communicated to the Warden, the appointing authority, on March 27, 1997 and the Warden caused an investigation to be initiated. That investigation was completed on August 6, 1997 and forwarded to the Warden on August 8, 1997.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Robert Pflaumer, a Correctional Officer II at the Eastern Correctional Institution was terminated following an internal investigation into the disappearance of a set of \u201cgrand master\u201d keys, while he was the key control officer for the institution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On January 28, 1997 the Warden and appointing authority was informed that the keys charged to Mr. Pflaumer\u2019s care were missing. On January 31, 1997, the Warden instituted an investigation into the disappearance of the keys, which was concluded on February 19, 1997. Thereafter, on February 25, 1997, the Warden met with Mr. Pflaumer to discuss the incident and, on the same date, completed a Notice of Termination, which after approval of the Secretary of DPSCS on March 4, 1997, was served on Mr. Pflaumer on March 10, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In each case, the discipline imposed was overturned by administrative law judges (\u201cALJ\u201d) of the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d), each finding that the discipline was untimely under \u00a7 11-106, it having been imposed more than thirty days after the allegation of misconduct, or a situation from which misconduct could be found, had been reported to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the appointing authority. The reasoning of the ALJ in the <em>Geiger </em>case is typical. Rejecting the State\u2019s argument that the thirty day period prescribed by \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b) is flexible and runs from the completion of the investigation mandated by \u00a7 ll-106(a), it proceeded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">\u201cA reading of the statute ... reveals that the appointing authority has thirty days to conduct an investigation, meet the employees, consider any mitigating circumstances, determine the appropriate action and to give notice to the employee. Implicit in these requirements is that the appointing authority acquire knowledge of the misconduct, be it as an allegation or as a conclusion after investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"As\">Thus, in <em>Geiger, </em>the ALJ concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">\u201cI am not convinced that the narrow reading of ... \u00a7 11-106 suggested by Management is required. Instead, I find that a reading of this section of law imposes a thirty day window for Management to receive the allegations of misconduct, to investigate and to impose sanctions. As such, I conclude that the thirty day window began with the reporting of the allegation to the Warden on March 7, 1997 and that the Warden contacted the DOC/IIU who opened their investigation on March 11, 1997. The appointing authority thus had 30 days from March 7, 1997 to investigate the allegations and to then impose any disciplinary sanctions deemed to be warranted after the completion of the investigation. Because this time frame was not met in this case the Employee\u2019s argument must prevail and the Notice of Termination issued by Management on May 2,1997 must be rescinded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Similarly, in <em>Mullen, </em>the ALJ stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">\u201cThe Employee has adequately shown that the thirty day window began with the reporting of the allegation to the Warden in February, 1997 and that the Warden contacted DOC/IIU on March 27, 1997. The Appointing authority thus had 30 days from at least March 27, 1997 to investigate the allegations and to then impose any disciplinary sanctions deemed to be warranted after the completion of the invest\u00ed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>gation. Because this time frame was not met in this case, the Employee\u2019s argument must prevail and the reprimand issued by management must be rescinded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">And in <em>Pflaumer, </em>the AL J</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">\u201cConstrued the Notice to show that the appointing authority acquired knowledge of the misconduct on January 28, 1997, the day the Warden was given the Employee\u2019s January 27, 1997 report. Within the next thirty days, the investigation was completed (2/19/97), the Warden met with the Employee to discuss the matter (2/25/97), and the Warden signed the Notice of Termination (2/25/97).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai9\">\u201cThe Notice terminated the Employee on March 10, 1997.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am2\">On judicial review, the Circuit Court for Washington County and the Circuit Court for Somerset County reversed the <em>Mullen </em>and <em>Pflaumer </em>decisions respectively. Both Circuit Courts concluded that the thirty day period prescribed by \u00a7 ll-106(b) does not commence with a mere allegation of misconduct. The <em>Mullen </em>court, relying on the absence of the word \u201calleged\u201d to modify \u201cmisconduct\u201d in \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(c)(1), when its predecessor provision so provided, opined that \u201c[i]t is patently obvious that the Legislature intentionally decided to change the triggering event for the appointing authority\u2019s duty to act from a date when he learned of the <em>alleged </em>misconduct under the old law to a date when he acquired knowledge of confirmed or proven misconduct, <em>ie., </em>beyond a mere assertion of misconduct.\u201d It also rejected the argument that subsection (b) modifies subsection (a) and thus \u00a7 11\u2014 106(b) mandates that all of the requirements set forth in \u00a7 11-106(a) be accomplished within thirty days, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201c[T]he plain and unambiguous language contained in \u00a7 11-106(b) and (c) requires the appointing authority to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>disciplinary action or impose a suspension, respectively, within designated time periods after the appointing authority <em>acquires knowledge of the misconduct </em>\u2014 not after the appointing authority acquires knowledge of the <em>alleged </em>misconduct. To accept Mullen\u2019s argument would require adding the word \u2018alleged\u2019 in both subsections (b) and (c) of \u00a7 11-106. Such construction would be in contravention of the Legislature\u2019s intent since the Legislature used the word \u2018alleged\u2019 in the predecessor statute <em>and </em>employed the term \u2018alleged misconduct\u2019 in \u00a7 ll-106(a)(l). In short, it can only be presumed that the Legislature knew precisely what it was doing when it chose not to use the term <em>alleged </em>misconduct in \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b) and (c).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Noting that when he reported the keys as missing, Mr. Pflaumer did not indicate that he was responsible, the Circuit Court for Somerset County determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">\u201cOn January 28, 1997, when Warden Beshears was first informed of the missing keys, he had no reason to believe that there had been any misconduct, on the part of Pflau-mer or any other ECI employee. There was no knowledge of employee misconduct acquired by the Warden until the Warden received the results of the investigation on February 19, 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">\u201cRespondent is arguing that DPSCS must conduct an investigation and impose any discipline within thirty days of learning of any incident which may have been a result of employee misconduct. Taken to its logical end, Respondent\u2019s argument would require absurd results. For example, if an incident occurred and an investigation was immediately launched, even if the most credible evidence of misconduct was discovered on the thirty-first day of the investigation, the DPSCS could impose no discipline because of the thirty day limitations period, such an interpretation would force DPSCS, at the end of the thirty days, to either forego any discipline or \u2018rush to judgment\u2019 and take disciplinary action. Such a ludicrous result was not intended by the General Assembly, and the Court refuses to interpret the statute in that manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>A different result was reached by the Circuit Court for Allegany County. Noting that the statute is not a model of clarity on the issue of when the thirty day period prescribed by \u00a7 ll-106(b) for the imposition of discipline begins and, after reviewing the available legislative history, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">\u201cIt does not appear that the Legislature intended the 30 day period was to be triggered only after an investigation was concluded. Such a construction would render the time limitation meaningless. An investigation could consume nearly any time period as subjectively determined by a particular appointing authority. Uniformity in the application of disciplinary policies throughout the various State agencies would be sacrificed. When a particular appointing authority \u2018acquires knowledge of the misconduct\u2019 must depend on the specific facts of each case. However, it cannot be conditioned on the conclusion of an investigation by or on behalf of that authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In addition, it addressed and rejected the State\u2019s argument, premised on <em>Resetar v. State Bd. of Education, </em>284 Md. 537, 548, 399 A.2d 225, 231 (1979) and <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shrader, </em>324 Md. 454, 467, 597 A.2d 939, 946 (1991), that the administrative law judge erred in concluding that the failure of the appointing authority to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b) should result in rescission of the termination. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">\u201cThe Court believes the rule/statute considered in <em>Resetar </em>and <em>Shrader </em>[is] distinguishable from Code, \u00a7 ll-106(b). The instant statute not only sets a time limit, it specifies what may be done during the period. That is, impose disciplinary action. By implication, the statute prohibits imposition of discipline beyond that period. Otherwise, the term \u2018time limit\u2019 as used by the Legislature would be meaningless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">In unreported opinions in <em>Mullen </em>and <em>Pflaumer, </em>and a reported one in <em>Geiger, Western Correctional Institution v. Geiger, </em>130 Md.App. 562, 747 A.2d 697 (2000), the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Special Appeals affirmed the judgments of the Circuit Courts. In so doing, the intermediate appellate court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">\u201c(1) the limitation period is triggered by knowledge that is sufficient to justify the appointing authority\u2019s decision to initiate disciplinary action; (2) when the disciplined employee makes a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the appointing authority has failed to comply with the limitation period provided for by \u00a7 ll-106(b), the appointing authority must prove by a preponderance of evidence that this section was not violated; and (3) the appointing authority is prohibited from imposing disciplinary action more than 30 days after it has acquired \u2014 or, with the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have acquired \u2014 knowledge sufficient to justify taking disciplinary action against the employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\"><em>Geiger, </em>130 Md.App. at 565-66, 747 A.2d at 699.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Largely agreeing with the <em>Mullen </em>and <em>Pflaumer </em>courts on the trigger point, while expressly rejecting the circuit court\u2019s analysis in <em>Geiger, </em>the intermediate appellate court interpreted \u00a7 11\u2014 106(b) to authorize a flexible starting point, one that \u201cdoes not start until the appointing authority has \u2014 or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should reasonably have \u2014 acquired enough knowledge to justify the imposition of discipline,\u201d and to permit an employee to generate \u201cthe issue of whether the 30 day-limit had been violated,\u201d which the employer must then rebut. <em>Id. </em>at- 569, 747 A.2d at 701. It also developed a procedure for implementing this burden shifting analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aau\">\u201c[W]hen a disciplined employee contends that the time limitation of \u00a7 11-106(b) has not been complied with, the employee must overcome the presumption of correctness by making a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the appointing authority was \u2018on notice\u2019 of the alleged misconduct more than 30 days before the disciplinary action was imposed. If the employee does succeed in showing, <em>prima facie, </em>that the appointing authority was on notice of the purported misconduct on a day more than 30 days before the employee was ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>disciplined, the disciplinary action shall be rescinded unless the appointing authority proves by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the investigation required by \u00a7 11-106(a)(1) was conducted with reasonable diligence, and (2) the disciplinary action at issue was imposed no later than 30 days after the required investigation had been completed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aus\"><em>Id. </em>at 569-70, 747 A.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Applying this analysis, the Court of Special Appeals concluded in the <em>Mullen </em>and <em>Pflaumer </em>cases that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">\u201c(1) [the employee] made a prima facie showing that the disciplinary action at issue was imposed more than 30 days after the appointing authority had acquired knowledge of his misconduct; (2) [the State], however, proved that this was a ... case in which the investigation required by \u00a7 11-106(a)(1) could not reasonably have been completed until a date within 30 days of the date on which discipline was imposed <footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; and (3) the [C]ircuit [C]ourt was therefore correct in reinstating the discipline about which [the employee] complains.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In <em>Geiger, </em>on the other hand, a different conclusion was reached with respect to the State\u2019s rebuttal of the employee\u2019s prima facie case. The intermediate appellate court determined that the State \u201cutterly failed to prove that the investigation in this case could not have been completed until a date within 30 days of the date- on which the discipline was imposed.\u201d <em>Geiger, </em>130 Md.App. at 571, 747 A.2d at 702. Consequently, in <em>Geiger, </em>the intermediate appellate court was required to address an issue that it declined to consider in <em>Mullen </em>and <em>Pflaumer: </em>the proper sanction for an appointing authority\u2019s failure to impose discipline within the thirty day period prescribed by \u00a7 ll-106(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">On that issue, the Court of Special Appeals sided with the Circuit Court for Allegany County, which had concluded that the appropriate sanction for noncompliance with \u00a7 11-106 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>rescission of the disciplinary action imposed. Satisfied \u201cthat the prime reason for the addition of a limitation period in 1996, where none had existed before, was to provide protection to workers from the indefinite threat of investigation and discipline (other than suspension) for matters of misconduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 570, 747 A.2d at 702, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">\u201cThe legislative history shows that the General Assembly wished to limit the period of time in which the appointing authority could impose, for example, a reprimand or termination. The 1996 State Personnel Management System Reform Act was enacted to, <em>inter alia, </em>provide for a more consistent application of state-wide policies and procedures. That important goal is inconsistent with the proposition that a violation of \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b) can be excused whenever the appointing authority concludes that untimely disciplinary action is justified by some overriding public policy. We therefore hold that the appropriate remedy for an appointing authority\u2019s non-compliance with \u00a7 ll-106(b) is an order rescinding the discipline imposed. To hold otherwise would render illusory the protection provided to State employees by \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 570, 747 A.2d at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">We granted the Petition for Writ of Certiorari filed by Mullen and Pflaumer, and the cross petition filed by the State. <em>Pflaumer v.

Subsequently, we granted the State\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari filed in the <em>Geiger </em>case and Geiger\u2019s cross-petition. <em>WCI v.

Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 604, 573 A.2d 1346, 1349 (1990); <em>see also Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 515, 525 A.2d 628, 633 (1987). We have cautioned, however, that this inquiry is \u201cin the interest of completeness,\u201d <em>Harris v.

State, </em>281 Md. 538, 546, 380 A.2d 49, 54 (1977) (\u201ca court may not as a general rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>surmise a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute or insert exceptions not made by the legislature.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The statutory provision at the heart of these cases is \u00a7 11-106 of the State Personnel &amp; Pensions Article. Subsection (a) sets forth the duties of the appointing authority prior to imposing discipline. It provides that the appointing authority shall, before imposing any discipline for employee misconduct,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u201c(1) investigate the alleged misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u201c(2) meet with the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201c(3) consider any mitigating circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\u201c(4) determine the appropriate disciplinary action, if any, to be imposed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">\u201c(5) give the employee a written notice of the disciplinary action to be taken and the employee\u2019s appeal rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Subsection (b) addresses the restriction on the time for imposing such disciplinary action. Counting from when \u201cthe appointing authority acquires knowledge of the misconduct for which the disciplinary action is imposed\u201d and excepting suspensions without pay, pursuant to subsection (c), the appointing authority has thirty days to impose any disciplinary action. With respect to subsection (c), counting from the same knowledge base, the time limitation is five (5) days.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">The phrase in subsection (b), \u201cwhen the appointing authority acquires knowledge of the misconduct,\u201d is not defined and no guidance, beyond its context in the statutory scheme, has been provided. To be sure, when considered alone and in isolation, it is ambiguous; from the language alone, it is impossible to elucidate the quantum of knowledge sufficient to trigger the time limit. Viewed in context, however, the phrase is not ambiguous and, in fact, clearly pinpoints when the time limit for imposing disciplinary action starts. All three subsections of \u00a7 11-106 are interrelated; one can not be read and interpreted without reading and interpreting the others. Subsection (a) prescribes what must be done before imposing discipline, subsection (b) sets the general time limitation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>when the imposition of discipline must occur and subsection (c) provides a special time limit for suspensions without pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">It is significant that one of the prerequisites for the imposition of discipline is the conduct of an investigation of the alleged misconduct. To be sure, as the Court of Special Appeals observed, \u201c[t]here is an important distinction between (1) information that indicates the necessity for an investigation, and (2) the completion of an investigation required by \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(a)(1).\u201d <em>Geiger, </em>130 Md.App. at 569, 747 A.2d at 701. The intermediate appellate court, thus, drew a distinction between the quantum of knowledge the appointing authority must have at the beginning of the process and at the end, when the investigation is complete, settling on a level of knowledge sufficient to justify the imposition of discipline.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 11 \u2014 106(b) does not, by its terms, state a distinction between the amount of knowledge necessary to initiate an investigation and that required to discipline. It simply prohibits the imposition of discipline more than thirty days after knowledge of the misconduct for which the disciplinary action is imposed is acquired. Knowledge sufficient to order an investigation is knowledge of the misconduct for which discipline was imposed, if discipline ultimately is imposed for that misconduct. It is not at that stage in the process, to be sure, proof as to who is the responsible person and may not even be knowledge as to who that person is. Section 11-106, however, is not person specific; it is situation and fact based. Thus, the knowledge that triggers the running of the thirty day period need not, and may not, although it generally will, identify the employee ultimately disciplined.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We hold that, viewed in context, \u00a7 11-106 gives the appointing authority 30 days to conduct an investigation, meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>with the employee the investigation identifies as culpable, consider any mitigating circumstances, determine the appropriate action and give notice to the employee of the disciplinary action taken.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 11-106 confirms our interpretation. Determining that there was a need for \u201ca personnel management system that is more flexible, decentralizes personnel management functions, simplifies and streamlines personnel procedures and provides for the consistent application of personnel policies throughout a diverse State government,\u201d Governor Glendening, by Executive Order No. 01.01.1995.15, dated June 9, 1995, established the Governor\u2019s Task Force to Reform the State Personnel Management System. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>charged the Task Force with conducting a \u201ccomprehensive review of the Maryland State Personnel Management System contained in Division I of the State Personnel and Pensions Article to determine necessary and appropriate revisions to that law.\u201d The Task Force submitted its Final Report on January 19, 1996 and its findings and recommendations were subsequently introduced in the General Assembly as the State Personnel Management System Reform Act of 1996. One of the recommendations had the clear purpose of limiting the time in which disciplinary action could be imposed by an appointing authority. That recommendation, obviously the precursor of \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">\u201cB. Conduct \u2014 Relation Discipline \u2014 (2) After acquiring knowledge of alleged employee misconduct, an appointing authority shall have up to 30 calendar days to impose all forms of discipline detailed in Section 11 with the exception of suspension without pay. Within the 30 day time period, the appointing authority must investigate; meet with the employee; consider mitigating circumstances; and issue the discipline to be taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Task Force To Reform the State Personnel Management System; Report to the Governor, January 19, 1996, pgs. 44-45. Cross-filed as Senate Bill 466 and House Bill 774, as enacted, <em>see </em>1996 Md. Laws, ch. 347, the legislation was passed in substantially the same form as proposed by the Task Force.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Documents in the legislative file, submitted as the legislation progressed through the General Assembly, provide additional evidence that the time limit was intended to include the investigatory period. Acting Secretary of Personnel and Chair of the Task Force on Personnel Reform, Michael A. Glass, submitted written testimony commenting on the effect of proposed \u00a7 11-106:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">\u201cIn cases of conduct related discipline, the proposal establishes a uniform 30 day time period in which management may investigate, meet with the employee, and impose discipline with one exception: to impose a disciplinary suspension, the appointing authority must act within 5 days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Another written memorandum from the Department of Personnel to the House Subcommittee on Personnel is to like effect, indicating that \u00a7 11-106:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\u201c[Ijmposes the general rule that the appointing authority has 30 days after acquiring knowledge of the misconduct to impose discipline. In cases where suspension is determined to be the appropriate penalty, the appointing authority has 5 work days following the close of business after the employee\u2019s next shift after acquiring knowledge to impose the suspension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201cThis provision provides for the first time that the appointing authority has to conduct its investigation within a certain amount of time for all cases of discipline.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Finally, Mr. Glass, in a memorandum on the Task Force\u2019s recommendations to the Governor, contrasted the provisions of proposed \u00a7 11-106 and the prior legislation, Md.Code State Pers. &amp; Pens. \u00a7 9-403(a)(2) (1987, 1994 Repl.Vol.), which permitted suspension without pay \u201cwithin 2 days from the close of the employee\u2019s next shift after: (i) the alleged infraction occurred; or (ii) the appointing authority learned of the alleged infraction,\u201d pointing out that the proposed legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeO\">\u201c[i]ncreases the time allowed an appointing authority to investigate and impose disciplinary suspension from two days to five days following the close of the employee\u2019s next shift; allows the appointing authority up to thirty calendar days to impose any other form of discipline.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Having determined that the thirty day period prescribed by \u00a7 ll-106(b) is the maximum time allowed for imposing disciplinary action, we must address the issue that the State raised in its cross petition for certiorari in <em>Geiger, </em>namely, whether reversal, as a result of the rescission of the disciplinary action, is the appropriate sanction for its violation. The State relies on <em>Shrader, supra, </em>arguing that it supports the proposition that the sanction for noncompliance with a mandatory statutory provision is not necessarily dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>In <em>Shrader, </em>at issue was the interpretation of a provision of the Transportation Article, specifically Md.Code (1987, 1991 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(5)(i) of the Transportation Article, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">\u201cIf the person requests a hearing at the time of or within 10 days after the issuance of the order of suspension ... the Administration shall set a hearing for a date within 30 days of the receipt of the request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\"><em>Shrader, </em>324 Md. at 462, 597 A.2d at 942. Notwithstanding that the provision was mandatory and that timely requests for hearings were made, but hearings were not timely scheduled, within the thirty day time frame prescribed by the statute, <em>id. </em>at 462, 597 A.2d at 943, the Court held that dismissal was not the appropriate sanction, stressing the purpose of the statute (to protect the public, rather than the driver), <em>id. </em>at 464, 597 A.2d at 943, the lack of a sanction being specified in the statute, <em>id. </em>at 467-69, 597 A.2d at 945-46, and the lack of prejudice to drivers. <em>Id. </em>at 469-70, 597 A.2d at 946-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Applying that analysis to the case <em>sub judice </em>demands, the State submits, that the Court reach the same result. It reasons that the purpose of overhauling the State personnel system was to improve governmental efficiency and public service,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that \u00a7 11-106 does not specify a sanction for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>violation of its thirty day time limit, and that Geiger, in particular, was not prejudiced, in any event, by the noncompliance, as he remained fully employed and continued to receive wages and benefits. Moreover, the State stresses that overturning the termination of an employee who uses epithets, \u201cthereby demonstrating his racism and threatening institutional security and undermining morale,\u201d does not increase the efficiency of State government or improve public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The Court of Special Appeals reached the opposite result, as we have seen. Acknowledging that \u00a7 11-106 does not provide for a sanction expressly, but, relying on <em>Lussier v. Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>343 Md. 681, 686-87, 684 A.2d 804, 806-07 (1996), the intermediate appellate court noted that \u201c[wjhen a statute that imposes a duty does not prescribe the consequences for a violation of that duty, the particular sanction must be within the spirit and purpose of the applicable law\u201d and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">\u201cIn examining \u00a7 11-106 within the context of the Act\u2019s overall statutory scheme and as it relates to the agency\u2019s own implementing regulations, it appears that the prime reason for the addition of a limitation period in 1996, where none had existed before was to provide protection to workers from the indefinite threat of investigation and discipline (other than suspension) for matters of misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\"><em>Geiger, </em>130 Md.App. at 570, 747 A.2d at 702. From the legislative history, the intermediate appellate court deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>mined that the Legislature intended to limit the amount of time an appointing authority had to take disciplinary action and that one of the purposes of enacting the 1996 State Personnel Management System Reform Act was to provide a more consistent application of statewide policies and procedures.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The latter important goal, it held, was \u201cinconsistent with the proposition that a violation of \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b) can be excused whenever the appointing authority concludes that untimely disciplinary action is justified by some overriding public policy\u201d because such an interpretation would \u201crender illusory the protection provided to State employees by \u00a7 11-106(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">To be sure, \u00a7 2-301 (a) does state the purpose of restructuring the State personnel system. Subsection (b) of the section, however, addresses the \u201cduties of employees,\u201d and included within its provisions is one, the very first one, in fact, that is clearly favorable to, and intended to benefit, employees. That provision requires that \u201c[t]o maintain efficient and effective operations of State government, each State employee ... shall be treated with fairness in State employment.\u201d \u00a7 6-102(1). Moreover, that subsection also provides that each employee \u201cis entitled to the rights and protections in this title.\u201d \u00a7 6-102(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Certainly, simplifying and streamlining State personnel policies promotes efficiency and benefits the public by improving the delivery of services. Those improvements do not, however, preclude the same benefits from flowing to, and indeed being intended for, the employees, especially when another purpose of the restructuring process was \u201cthe consistent application of human resources management principles throughout the Executive Branch of State Government.\u201d Consistent application of policy, while productive of efficiency, has significant implications as to the right each employee has to be treated fairly and is, in fact, one of the protections to which each employee expressly is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>The Circuit Court for Allegany County distinguished \u00a7 11\u2014 106(b) from the rule considered in <em>Resetar </em>and the statute construed in <em>Shrader </em>on the basis that \u00a7 ll-106(b) \u201cnot only sets a time limit, it specifies what may be done during the period.\u201d Because it provides for the imposition of disciplinary action, the court reasoned, \u201c[b]y implication, the statute prohibits imposition of discipline beyond that period. Otherwise, the term \u2018time limit\u2019 as used by the Legislature would be meaningless.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">There is, moreover, more relevant Maryland case law supporting the proposition that dismissal is the appropriate sanction for non-compliance with a mandatory time requirement in a statute. <em>See In re James S., </em>286 Md. 702, 410 A.2d 586 (1980); <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 403 A.2d 356 (1979); <em>U.S. Coin and Currency v. Director of Finance, </em>279 Md. 185, 367 A.2d 1243 (1977). <em>Hicks </em>makes the point quite clearly that the sanction of dismissal is designed to ensure compliance with an unambiguously mandatory time requirement. <em>Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 316-18, 403 A.2d at 359-60. Section ll-106(b) is an unambiguously mandatory time requirement in which discipline must be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">THE JUDGMENTS IN CASE NO. 31, MULLEN AND PFLAUMER, REVERSED; JUDGMENT IN CASE NO. 41, GEIGER, AFFIRMED.

Although Mr. Geiger denied making the statements attributed to him, he admitted to having used the word \"nigger,\u201d stating, \u201cHey ...

It was completed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>August 6, 1997, when the Commanding Officer of IIU reviewed and signed it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\">. On January 27, 1997, Mr. Pflaumer reported that the keys were missing in a \u201cMatter of Record\u201d report to his supervisor. In that report, he described the incident as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">\u201cOn the above date [1-27-97] and approx, time [2:45 p.m.], I officer Pflaumer was conducting a quarterly inspection of the institutional Emergency sets, which are housed in Tower 8. Emergency keys are housed in two key boxes which are secured by padlocks. During inventory of the sets I noticed 99 set missing. I then had the Tower 8 officer double check my count. The missing set contains 20 EKGMK 1, 2, 3, 4, GGMK, PMK. These are all grand master key sets for East and West compounds. I called the former key control officer to find out if they were taken down for repair and never put back; he stated that the [keys] should be up there and did not know of their whereabouts. At approx. 3:50 Chief Irwin was advised of the missing set. All control key boxes and [the] key vault were checked twice with nothing found. All persons having access to [the] key vault were asked about the missing set. The last entry of issue was on Oct. 23 at 8:27 a.m. by this officer for a mock exercise. All keys were returned by myself at 2:35 p.m. on 23rd of Oct.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\">. The ALJ also rejected the Slate's argument that Mr. Pflaumer's \u201cMatter Report\u201d could be the triggering event for the imposition of discipline pursuant to \u00a7 11-106, pointing out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">\u201c[Counsel for the State] further argued that the Employee allegedly engaged in misconduct during the investigation, and after its conclusion. Were that so, Management could simply amend the statement of charges in the Notice to include any additional misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\">. Although the <em>Mullen </em>and <em>Pflaumer </em>opinions are unreported, their holding is the same and, indeed, identically stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\">. The Court of Special Appeals characterized the <em>Mullen </em>case as \"most unusual.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\">. This is the degree of knowledge acquired from the results of the investigation, notwithstanding the Court of Special Appeals' suggestion to the contrary and its permitting the employee to attempt to prove that the requisite knowledge was acquired earlier. The intermediate appellate court's unwillingness to adopt a \u201cconclusion of the investigation\u201d test of knowledge likely reflects its recognition that such a standard would render the time limit in \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b) superfluous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\">. The State finds persuasive that \u00a7 ll-106(a)(l) references \"alleged misconduct,\u201d in contrast to \u00a7 11-106(b) and (c), neither of which uses \"alleged\u201d to modify \"knowledge of the misconduct.\u201d It also argues that the complete phrase in subsections (b) and (c), \"knowledge of the misconduct for which the disciplinary action was imposed,\u201d connotes substantiated misconduct and, so, is inconsistent with knowledge of alleged misconduct. Finally, the State notes that the prior statute pertaining to the imposition of a suspension without pay, Md.Code \u00a7 9-403(a)(2) (1994), specified \u201calleged infraction\u201d as one of the triggering events for its imposition. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">An investigation, of necessity, is of \u201calleged misconduct.\u201d As already pointed out, knowledge sufficient to initiate an investigation is, when the investigation substantiates the misconduct and the culpable party, \u201cknowledge of the misconduct for which the disciplinary action was imposed.\u201d That there was a different trigger prior to passage of the Personnel Reform Act of 1996 also is not very persuasive when it is recalled that the Act, and for our purposes, the provision under review, was the result of a Task Force Report, whose recommendation in that regard was enacted substantially as submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The Circuit Court for Somerset County, in <em>Pflaumer, </em>interpreting \u00a7 ll-106(b) as the ALJ did, opined that to require the imposition of discipline take place within thirty days of acquiring knowledge sufficient to initiate an investigation, would lead to absurd results \u2014 \"if an incident occurred and an investigation was immediately launched, even if the most credible evidence of misconduct was discovered on the thirty-first day of the investigation, the DPSCS could impose no discipline because of the thirty day limitation period.\u201d The strength of a bright line rule is its certainty. Ensuring certainty is not an absurd result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\">. To reach this conclusion, the State relies on Md.Code \u00a7 2-301(a) and \u00a7 6-102 and the Governor\u2019s Executive Order. <em>See </em>Md. Regs.Code tit. 01, \u00a7 01.1995.15. Section 2-301(a) states the \"purpose of restructuring the State\u2019s personnel system,\u201d \"(a) in keeping with State efforts to reinvent government, restructuring of the State\u2019s personnel system should enhance the delivery of services to citizens in an effective and timely manner.\u201d Section 6-102 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">\"The basic purpose of the State Personnel Management System is to provide a system of employment for employees under the authority of the Secretary. The State Personnel Management System:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">\"(1) (i) establishes categories of service for employees based on the general nature of the employee\u2019s duties or method of appointment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">\"(ii) provides procedures for the appointment, discipline, and termination of employees in each service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-12\">\"(2) (i) groups employees into classes based on specific duties that employees perform; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-14\">\"(ii) provides a system of pay for employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\"(3) provides for a system of merit employment in the skilled service and professional service, regardless of an applicant's political or religious opinions or affiliations or of any standard other than business efficiency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">\"(4) provides a process for the:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">\"(i) promotion and training of employees; and \"(ii) prompt removal of employees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">\"(5) provides for other aspects of human resources management.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7T\">The Executive Order stated the ultimate objective of the Task Force as being \"the creation of a modern human resources management system which streamlines and simplifies the State\u2019s personnel policies and provides for the consistent application of human resources management principles throughout, the Executive Branch of State Government.\u201d COMAR 01.01.1995.15 C.(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">.
