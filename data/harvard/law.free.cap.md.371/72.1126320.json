In September, 1999, the State filed in the Circuit Court for Washington County a petition for contempt alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>that Derrick D. Long, Sr., the petitioner, was in contempt of court for failing to comply with that court\u2019s child support orders. Following a hearing in April 2000, the Circuit Court found the petitioner in constructive civil contempt and, notwithstanding its acknowledgment that he did not have the present ability to pay a purge amount, sentenced him to imprisonment for a specified period, subject to purger upon the payment of $700.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and, joined by the State, filed a joint motion to vacate the contempt order, together with a proposed consent order to facilitate the petitioner\u2019s immediate release from incarceration. As jointly requested, the intermediate appellate court vacated the petitioner\u2019s sentence; however, instead of entering the order submitted by the parties, it entered a modified order. That order remanded the case to the Circuit Court to determine conditions of release that would ensure the petitioner\u2019s appearance at further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We granted the petitioner\u2019s Petition for Certiorari, <em>Long v. State, </em>360 Md. 485, 759 A.2d 230 (2000), stayed enforcement of the Court of Special Appeal\u2019s order, and ordered the petitioner immediately released from incarceration. We shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The petitioner is the father of Kianna L. Long, born September 3, 1995. On March 14, 1997, the Circuit Court for Washington County ordered him to pay $25.00 per week for Kianna\u2019s support. The petitioner did not comply with this order, or subsequent support orders issued by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">When the petitioner, still not in compliance with the support orders, failed to appear at an enforcement hearing pertaining to one of the support orders, the State filed a petition, pursuant to Md. Rule 15-207(e),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requesting that he be held in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>contempt. At the hearing on that petition, evidence was presented that the latest support order required the petitioner to pay support and an amount toward the arrears he had amassed, but that no payments had been made. The evidence also was that, although payments had been suspended during two periods when the petitioner was incarcerated,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the current amount of arrearage was $2,975.00. Admitting that he had no physical or mental impairment that prevented his working, that in May, 1999, \u201coff and on,\u201d until his incarceration in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>September, he worked at Labor Ready, and that if he were not incarcerated he would be able to return to that employment, the petitioner offered his intermittent incarceration and his inability to find employment following his release in November as the only explanation for failing to pay child support. He testified that he had no personal assets of any kind, including a car, and that the mortgage on his home, which he had owned with his mother and sister, had been foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The court found the petitioner in contempt for his failure to pay child support from May 1999 to September 1999. Despite defense counsel\u2019s argument that imprisonment could not be the sanction for contempt, given the petitioner\u2019s inability to pay any purge amount, and specifically finding that the petitioner did not have the present ability to pay,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court nevertheless sentenced him to incarceration in the Division of Correction, subject to his paying $700 to purge the contempt. It ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">\u201cAll right, based on prior adjudications and the fact that okay, sure, he can\u2019t pay now \u2018cause he\u2019s in jail for failure to appear, which I\u2019ve dismissed since I\u2019ve found him in contempt, but there was just a blatant disregard back in May, June, July and August. I can\u2019t hide that. He\u2019s in contempt .... You seem to have a lot of problems not only not paying child support but apparently operating vehicles and everything else. If we can go out and buy a house and start paying on a house, we certainly can contribute money towards child support which apparently you didn\u2019t think you wanted to do. [It is the s]entence of this Court [that] you be committed to DOC for a period of thirteen months.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The petitioner noted an immediate appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. While that appeal was pending, the petitioner and the State filed a Joint Motion to Vacate Sentence, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>which they agreed, relying on <em>Thrower v. State ex rel. Bureau of Support Enforcement, 358 </em>Md. 146, 747 A.2d 634 (2000), that \u201cthe trial court did not find a present ability to purge, but, to the contrary, found that [the petitioner] lacked such an ability\u201d and that \u201cwhere [the petitioner] has been incarcerated [over four months] and lacks the ability to pay a purge, ... it is appropriate that he should be released immediately from incarceration.\u201d Attached to the motion was a proposed order, which, if signed, would have vacated the petitioner\u2019s sentence and ordered his immediate release, both without remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Rather than the proposed order submitted by the parties, however, the Court of Special Appeals issued its own order, in which, after acknowledging the parties\u2019 agreement that the petitioner be immediately released from incarceration, the court vacated the Circuit Court contempt judgment, remanded the case to that court \u201cfor further proceedings that conform to the requirements of Md. Rule 15-207\u201d and \u201cORDERED that [the petitioner] be taken without unnecessary delay to the Circuit Court for Washington County so a judge of that court can determine what \u2014 if any \u2014 conditions of release will reasonably assure [the petitioner\u2019s] appearance at those further proceedings required by this Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The petitioner, joined by the State, argues that, where the parties to civil contempt proceedings agree to settle the case while it is on appeal and submit their agreement to the court in the form of a proposed consent order,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>court may not enter a modified consent order that does not reflect the parties\u2019 agreement. Further, the petitioner maintains that, because the joint motion and proposed consent order filed by the parties were legally correct under <em>Thrower v. State, supra, </em>there was no basis for the Court of Special Appeals to reject any of its substantive provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Moreover, the petitioner asserts, while the court to whom a consent order is submitted, the Court of Special Appeals in this case, properly may reject the proposed order, it does not have the authority to enter its own order disposing of the appeal. The entry of a modified order that does not give effect to the parties\u2019 agreement, he concludes, deprives the parties of the benefit of their bargain and, simultaneously, of the alternative right to litigate the case through briefing and oral argument on the merits. The State agrees generally with the latter point, but believes that, in this case, where the intermediate appellate court erred was in failing to afford the parties an opportunity to be heard on why their proposed order should be altered or to address, and remedy, any perceived deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Finally, the petitioner argues that a court may not incarcerate a person pending a hearing pursuant to Md. Rule 15-207(e). He submits that, by ordering the case remanded for the trial court to \u201cdetermine what \u2014 if any \u2014 conditions of release w[ould] reasonably assure [the petitioner\u2019s] appearance at those further proceedings required by [its] Order,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals authorized the petitioner\u2019s continued incarceration for constructive civil contempt, despite the un-controverted evidence that he lacked the present ability to purge the contempt. The petitioner further challenges the broad remand ordered by the intermediate appellate court on the basis that it allows, contrary to Md. Rule 15-207 and this Court\u2019s cases, the trial court to order his continued incarcera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>tion upon a finding that that is the only way to ensure his appearance at further contempt proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">A consent judgment or consent order is an agreement of the parties with respect to the resolution of the issues in the case or in settlement of the case, that has been embodied in a court order and entered by the court, thus evidencing its acceptance by the court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Jones v. Hubbard, </em>356 Md. 513, 529, 740 A.2d 1004, 1013 (1999); <em>Chernick v. Chernick, </em>327 Md. 470, 478, 610 A.2d 770, 774 (1992) (\u201cConsent judgments or decrees are essentially agreements entered into by the parties which must be endorsed by the court.\u201d) <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 846 (7th ed.1999); <em>Montgomery County v. Revere Nat\u2019l Corp., </em>341 Md. 366, 378, 671 A.2d 1, 7 (1996). Consent judgments are hybrids, having attributes of both contracts and judicial decrees. <em>Chernick, </em>327 Md. at 478, 610 A.2d at 774. While this \u201cdual character ... has resulted in different treatment for different purposes,\u201d <em>Local Number 93, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, </em>478 U.S. 501, 519, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 3073, 92 L.Ed.2d 405, 421 (1986), consistent with other courts that have addressed the issue, <em>see Jones, </em>356 Md. at 530-32, 740 A.2d at 1013-14, this Court has repeatedly held that \u201cconsent judgments should normally be given the same force and effect as any other judgment, including judgments rendered after litigation.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>356 Md. at 532, 740 A.2d at 1014. <em>See Kirsner v. Fleischmann, </em>261 Md. 164, 170-71, 274 A.2d 339, 343 (1971). Thus, \u201c[a] consent decree no doubt embodies an agreement of the parties and thus in some respects is contractual in nature. But it is .an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be enforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>and decrees.\u201d <em>Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, </em>502 U.S. 367, 378, 112 S.Ct. 748, 757, 116 L.Ed.2d 867, 882 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">This is not to say that the contractual aspect of the consent judgment is unimportant. On the contrary, the consent judgment memorializes the agreement of the parties, pursuant to which they have relinquished the right to litigate the controversy in exchange for a certain outcome and/or, perhaps, expedience. In <em>United States v. Armour &amp; Co., </em>the United States Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201cConsent decrees are entered into by parties to a case after careful negotiation has produced agreement on their precise terms. The parties waive their right to litigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable risk of litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving of cost and elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the litigation. Thus the <em>decree </em>itself cannot be said to have a purpose; rather the <em>parties </em>have purposes, generally opposed to each other, and the resultant decree embodies as much of those opposing purposes as the respective parties have the bargaining power and skill to achieve. For these reasons, the scope of a consent decree must be discerned within its four corners, and not by reference to what might satisfy the purposes of one of the parties to it. Because the defendant has, by the decree, waived his right to litigate the issues raised, a right guaranteed to him by the Due Process Clause, the conditions upon which he has given that waiver must be respected, and the instrument must be construed as it is written, and not as it might have been written had the plaintiff established his factual claims and legal theories in litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">402 U.S. 673, 681-82, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 1757, 29 L.Ed.2d 256, 263 (1971) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">It is the parties\u2019 agreement that defines the scope of the decree. When there is an issue as to the scope of the judgment, therefore, it is to the parties\u2019 agreement that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>look and interpret. Where the agreement is embodied in the judgment, the court having approved it, without modification, construction of the judgment is construction of the agreement of the parties. Where, however, as here, the court has modified the agreement, we look to the agreement as submitted by the parties. In either case, we determine what the parties meant by what they plainly and unambiguously expressed, not what they intended the agreement to mean. <em>Roged, Inc. v. Paglee, </em>280 Md. 248, 254, 372 A.2d 1059, 1062 (1977). This is the objective test of contract interpretation, the rule in Maryland: \u201c[t]he written language embodying the terms of an agreement will govern the rights and liabilities of the parties, irrespective of the intent of the parties at the tune they entered into the contract, unless the written language is not susceptible of a clear and definite understanding, or unless there is fraud, duress or mutual mistake.\u201d <em>Slice v. Carozza Properties, Inc., </em>215 Md. 357, 368, 137 A.2d 687, 693 (1958). <em>See Langston v. Langston, </em>366 Md. 490, 506-07, 784 A.2d 1086, 1095 (2001); <em>Taylor v.

Elza, </em>286 Md. 208, 219, 406 A.2d 922, 928 (1979). In <em>Chernick v. Chernick, </em>327 Md. 470, 610 A.2d 770 (1992), we held that where parties \u201cstipulate to terms embodied in a proposed consent order, the fact that a court must approve and sign the order does not affect the parties\u2019 ability to reach a valid agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 610 A.2d at 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Treating settlement agreements in civil cases contemplating a consent judgment, including their interpretation, as any other binding contract \u201cis consistent with the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>policy dictating that courts should look with favor upon the compromise or settlement of law suits in the interest of efficiency and economical administration of justice and the lessening of friction and acrimony.\u201d <em>Elza, </em>286 Md. at 219, 406 A.2d at 928 (quoting <em>Chertkof v. Harry C. Weiskittel Co., </em>251 Md. 544, 550, 248 A.2d 373, 377 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 974, 89 S.Ct. 1467, 22 L.Ed.2d 754 (1969)); <em>see also Porter Hayden Co. v.

The public policy of encouraging settlements is so strong that settlement agreements will not be disturbed even though the parties may discover later that settlement may have been based on a mistake or if one party simply chooses to withdraw its consent to the settlement. <em>Chernick v. Chernick, </em>327 Md. 470, 481-83, 610 A.2d 770, 775-76 (1992). In <em>Fiege v. Boehm, </em>210 Md. 352, 360, 123 A.2d 316, 321 (1956), citing <em>Hartle v. Stahl, </em>27 Md. 157, 172 (1867), our predecessors noted: \u201c(1) that forbearance to assert a claim before institution of suit, if not in fact a legal claim, is not of itself sufficient consideration to support a promise; but (2) that a compromise of a doubtful claim or a relinquishment of a pending suit is good consideration for a promise; and (3) that in order to support a compromise, it is sufficient that the parties entering into it thought at the time that there was a <em>bona fide </em>question between them, although it may eventually be found that there was in fact no such question.\u201d <em>See also McClellan v.

Thus, an appeal lies when, as here, the court, rather than the consent judgment proposed, enters another, modified one. <em>Thibbitts, </em>539 N.E.2d at 1037, n. 5.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The Motion to Vacate Sentence embodied the parties\u2019 agreement in resolution of this civil contempt case. It, together with the proposed order, constituted the consent judgment which they requested the Court of Special Appeals to enter. As we have seen, the consent judgment would have vacated the petitioner\u2019s sentence and ordered his immediate release from incarceration. It did not provide for remand to the Circuit Court for further proceedings. It was for this outcome for which the petitioner bargained, giving up his right to litigate the civil contempt finding entered against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Instead of entering the consent judgment as submitted, the intermediate appellate court modified it and, as modified, entered it. While vacating the petitioner\u2019s sentence as the consent judgment requested, rather than ordering his immediate release as the consent judgment also requested, the court remanded the case for further civil contempt proceedings<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and a pretrial determination of the petitioner\u2019s eligibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>release pending those proceedings. The court apparently noticed a void in the agreement reached by the parties and, by its modified order, sought to fill it.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We agree with the petitioner and the State that the Court of Special Appeals erred when it entered the modified order rather than the proposed consent order jointly submitted by the parties. The modified order materially altered the agreement reached by the parties: by ordering a remand for further proceedings and a pretrial release determination, it is totally inconsistent with their agreement that the petitioner be released immediately from incarceration. Thus, as the parties correctly point out, by entering the modified consent order the intermediate appellate court improperly substituted its own judgment for that of the parties, and, in the process, undermined the settlement agreement at issue, and consent judgments in general, contrary to the State\u2019s longstanding policy of encouraging settlements. As to this, we are mindful of our admonition in <em>Roged, Inc. v. Paglee, </em>280 Md. 248, 372 A.2d 1059 (1977), where we held that a trial court properly declined to hear evidence regarding the construction of a consent decree because if, in fact, the decree \u201cfailed to provide for certain contingencies, this was a void to be filled by the draftsmen, not by the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254, 372 A.2d at 1062. That action also deprived both of them of the benefit of their bargain and the petitioner of the alternative right to litigate the dispute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Furthermore, because the purpose of imprisoning the contemnor is remedial, <em>Lynch v. Lynch, </em>342 Md. 509, 519, 677 A.2d 584, 589 (1996), i.e., \u201cto preserve and enforce the rights of private parties to a suit and to compel obedience to orders and decrees primarily to benefit such parties,\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>351 Md. 264, 279-80, 718 A.2d 222, 230-31 (1998), this Court consistently, and emphatically, has held that a civil contemnor may be incarcerated only when he or she has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>found to have \u201cthe present ability to purge the contempt.\u201d <em>Thrower, </em>358 Md. at 160-61, 747 A.2d at 643; <em>Jones, </em>351 Md. at 281, 718 A.2d at 231; <em>Lynch, </em>342 Md. at 520, 677 A.2d at 590; <em>Ott v. Frederick County Dept. of Social Services, </em>345 Md. 682, 688-89, 694 A.2d 101, 105 (1997); <em>Rutherford v. Rutherford, </em>296 Md. 347, 357, 464 A.2d 228, 233 (1983); <em>Elzey v. Elzey, </em>291 Md. 369, 374, 435 A.2d 445, 447 (1981); <em>State v. Roll &amp; Scholl, </em>267 Md. 714, 728, 298 A.2d 867, 876 (1973); <em>Soldano v. Soldano, </em>258 Md. 145, 146, 265 A.2d 263, 264 (1970); <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>241 Md. 416, 420, 216 A.2d 914, 917 (1966). We pointed out in <em>Thrower, </em>358 Md. at 160, 747 A.2d at 643, that incarceration for non-support \u201cobviously impinges upon the liberty interest that parents have under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, under the Maryland Constitution, and under Maryland common law, and thus must comport with both procedural due process and with the non-Constitutional procedures ordained by this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In <em>Jones, </em>we stated: \u201cBefore incarceration is imposed, the contemnor must be provided with the opportunity to show that he or she is unable, rather than unwilling, at that time, to make the court-ordered payments.\u201d 351 Md. at 281, 718 A.2d at 231. An order incarcerating a defendant without regard to his or her ability to comply with the obligation underlying it smacks of a criminal sanction, imposed without the constitutionally required protections. <em>Hicks v. Feiock, </em>485 U.S. 624, 632, 108 S.Ct. 1423, 1430, 99 L.Ed.2d 721, 732 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Having vacated the petitioner\u2019s sentence, that portion of the court order that remands the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings and requires the petitioner to be processed for pretrial release necessarily has the effect of incarcerating the petitioner without a hearing and, therefore, without an opportunity to \u201cshow that he or she is unable, rather than unwilling, at th[is] time, to make the court-ordered payments.\u201d Moreover, because the pretrial release decision is entrusted to the discretion of the court, to determine \u201cwhat\u2014 if any \u2014 conditions of release will reasonably assure the [petitioner\u2019s] appearance at those further proceedings,\u201d it is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>ceivable that the petitioner may remain incarcerated throughout the further proceedings. Neither of these situations is contemplated nor authorized by Maryland Rule 15-207(e) or our cases. Both violate due process. Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals, lacking the authority to order the petitioner\u2019s detention pending further civil contempt proceedings, erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The cases from other jurisdictions are in accord. <em>Vermont National Bank v. Taylor, </em>122 N.H. 442, 445 A.2d 1122, 1125 (N.H.1982); <em>Hipschman v. Cochran, </em>683 So.2d 209, 211 (Fla. 4th Dist.Ct.App.1996); <em>Armstrong v. Squadrito, </em>152 F.3d 564, 576 (7th Cir.1998). In <em>Hipschman, </em>explaining the invalidity of the contempt order, on the basis of which the petitioner was arrested and detained, the court pointed out: \u201cIn the area of civil contempt, due process requires that notice to the contemnor and an opportunity to be heard precede the imposition of sanctions, such as the issuance of an arrest warrant.\u201d 683 So.2d at 211. Similarly, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, in <em>Vermont National Bank, </em>observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">\u201cIf procedural due process requires notice and a prior opportunity to be heard when dealing with the attachment of property, it certainly requires those same safeguards when personal liberty is restrained, an undoubtedly more severe infringement of an individual\u2019s rights than the attachment of property.... Because the ex parte capias procedure used by the Keene District Court to initiate civil contempt proceedings against the defendants resulted in Lorraine Taylor\u2019s arrest before she had notice or any opportunity to be heard on her present ability to pay the judgment, use of the writ in this case was unconstitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"az5-dedup-0\">445 A.2d at 1125 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">To be sure, the Court of Special Appeals was concerned that the petitioner would not appear for further child support proceedings, a valid concern in light of the petitioner\u2019s repeated failure to comply with existing child support orders or to appear at previous proceedings. We share the intermediate appellate court\u2019s concern with respect to the petitioner, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>particular, as well as to countless other parents that regularly breach the duty to pay child support. As Judge Wilner explained in <em>Thrower v. State, supra, 358 </em>Md. at 160, 747 A.2d at 642:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">\u201cEnforcement of that obligation, when enforcement is required, has never been easy. It is a significant problem that has plagued the nation and this State for many years. Studies have been conducted, volumes have been written, and laws have been enacted by both Congress and the State legislatures. Efforts to induce compliance are multi-facet-ed, ranging from employment counseling and other programs designed to. assist in voluntary compliance, to a variety of intermediate coercive techniques, including wage liens, the interception of tax refunds and other governmental payments, and the suspension of various licenses and privileges, to the ultimate and most traditional device of threatening or actually imposing incarceration, either through ordinary criminal proceedings or, when the duty of support has been formalized in a court order, through criminal or civil contempt proceedings. The ultimate objective of all these efforts and techniques, including those that are truly punitive in nature, is not to punish the parent but to provide support for the children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Judge Wilner further cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">\u201c[I]t may be frustrating to judges and masters to have to deal with people who appear to be deliberately ignoring their child-support obligations, by spending available funds for other purposes, by voluntary impoverishment, by refusing to obtain steady employment, or by other techniques-people who return time and again with excuses that the judge or master finds incredible or inadequate and who thus seem to flaunt their defiance of properly entered court orders. Nonetheless, because a person\u2019s liberty is at stake and because it is a judicial proceeding, both the form and substance of due process and proper judicial procedure must be observed. Shortcuts that trample on these requi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>sites and conclusions that are based on hunch rather than on evidence are not allowed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 160-61, 747 A.2d at 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
