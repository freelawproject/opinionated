Grossman, Deputy Bar Counsel, filed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a petition for disciplinary action against Alan Edgar Harris, respondent, for multiple violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC). The petition alleged that respondent, based on his representations of Emily Lewis and Preston Lawrence Henderson, had violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.5(a), (b) and (c), 1.7(b) and (c), 1.8(a) and (j), 1.9(a) and (b), 3.2, and 8.4(a), (c) and (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>On September 27, 2001, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this Court transmitted the matter to Judge Marcella A.

On June 17, 2002, Judge Holland issued her Memorandum of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and found by clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 3.2 and 8.4(a) in the Lewis matter and MRPC 1.5, 1.7, 1.8(a) and (j), and 8.4(a) in the Henderson matter. The hearing judge further concluded that respondent did not violate MRPC 8.4(d) in the Lewis matter and did not violate MRPC 1.9 and 8.4(c) and (d) in the Henderson matter. The record was then transferred from the hearing judge to our Court for oral argument. Both petitioner and respondent, pursuant to former Maryland Rule 16-711(b)(2),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> filed with this Court exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s Memorandum of Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Respondent was admitted to the Bar of Maryland on June 10, 1960 and maintains his practice of law in his office located in Baltimore City. The Petition for Disciplinary Action filed in this case was based on two complaints, BC Docket No. 2000-120-4-2, Complaint of Emily Lewis and BC Docket No. 2000-282-4-2, Complaint of Preston Lawrence Henderson. Judge Holland\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">\u201cThe testimony offered at the hearing together with the Exhibits received established by clear and convincing evidence the following facts pertinent to the Petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">\n<em>BACKGROUND FACTS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">\u201cRespondent is an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Maryland since 1960. He is a solo practitioner with his principal office located at 110 Saint Paul Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21201. Respondent has represented between fifteen and twenty thousand clients in automobile negligence cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">\u201cRespondent was previously sanctioned for violation of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent has also previously appeared before this court on January 25, 2001, for a hearing on a Petition for Disciplinary Action filed by the Attorney Grievance Commission. As a result of that hearing, Respondent was found to have violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct: 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.4(b), 1.16(a)(2) and 3.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\u201cThis Petition raises claims of misconduct by Respondent regarding his representation of two former clients, Emily Lewis and Preston Lawrence Henderson. Respondent represented Emily Lewis in the case of <em>Lewis, et al. v. Mihialo-vici, et al; </em>filed in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City on February 7, 1992, case number 470592. Respondent represented Preston Henderson in the case of <em>State Farm Mutual v. Preston Henderson, </em>filed in the Circuit Court of Maryland for Baltimore City on November 27, 1996, case number 24-C-96-204052 and <em>Henderson v. Ashley Lane Designs, Inc., et al., </em>also filed in the Circuit Court of Maryland for Baltimore City on January 20, 1999, case number 24-C-99-000254.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-4\">\n<em>FACTS RELEVANT TO LEWIS, et al. V. MIHIALOVICI, et al.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">\u201cEmily Lewis, (hereinafter \u2018Ms. Lewis\u2019), retained the Respondent to recover damages for injuries sustained by her minor son, Michael Lewis (hereinafter, \u2018Michael\u2019), as a result of his being struck by a taxicab on or about September 12,1989. Also on this date, Ms. Lewis signed a retainer agreement provided by Respondent. The Respondent filed suit on behalf of Michael against the driver and the taxicab company on February 7, 1992, in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City, <em>Lewis, et. Al. v. Mihialovici, et at., </em>case number 470592.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">\u201cRespondent was initially unable to serve the taxicab company or the driver. The driver, John R. Mihialovici was served with process on or about March 4,1995. The taxicab company was never served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">\u201cIn a letter dated June 18, 1993, Respondent notified Ms. Lewis that the trial in this case was scheduled for September 3, 1993. Also in this letter, Respondent explained that he had not served the defendant and if he could not serve the defendant before September 3, the trial would be rescheduled. Although Ms. Lewis and Michael Lewis did appear in court on September 3, Respondent did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\u201cThe trial was rescheduled for April 20, 1995. Respondent did not appear on this day. The trial was rescheduled again for July 13, 1995. On July 13, neither the Lewis[] [family] nor Respondent appeared. As a result, the case was dismissed by Judge Gale R. Caplan. On August 4, 1995, the Respondent filed a Motion to Vacate the Order of Dismissal. On August 15, 1995, that Motion was denied by Judge Alan M. Resnick because the Respondent failed to sign the Motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">\u201cOn September 25, 1995, the Respondent filed another Motion to Vacate the Order of Dismissal and that Motion was denied by Judge Gale R. Caplan on October 6, 1995. On February 25,1997, the case against the taxicab company was dismissed pursuant to Maryland Rule 3-507 [for lack of prosecution].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201cRespondent alleged that Michael Lewis discharged him in September of 1995. He also alleged that Michael Lewis threatened to sue him. Respondent suggested that Michael hire another attorney. Respondent never withdrew his appearance nor did he communicate to the Lewis[ ] [family] that he was no longer willing to represent them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">\n<em>FACTS RELEVANT TO STATE FARM MUTUAL v. PRESTON HENDERSON &amp; HENDERSON v. ASHLEY LAYNE DESIGNS, INC. et al.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">\u201cThe Respondent represented Mr. Henderson in connection with a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in or about 1995 to 1996. Respondent has known Mr. Henderson and members of his family for thirty-five to forty years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-12\">\u201cIn or about August 1996, Mr. Henderson lived at 2240 Keyworth Avenue in Baltimore City and while he resided there, that property was subject to foreclosure. Respondent purchased the property at a foreclosure sale for $17,000.00 and told Mr. Henderson that he would allow him to remain at the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-13\">\u201cThere was no 'written agreement between Mr. Henderson and Respondent regarding Mr. Henderson\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>purchase of the property. There was also no written agreement regarding Mr. Henderson\u2019s obligations with respect to rent, taxes or other expenses related to the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\">\u201cIn 1996, Mr. Henderson was involved in an automobile accident and was sued for damages. The Respondent represented Mr. Henderson in the resulting lawsuit, i.e. <em>State Farm Mutual v. Preston Henderson. </em>A judgment in favor of State Farm Mutual for approximately $11,935.00 was entered on or about September 3, 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">\u201cOn September 4, 1997, Respondent filed suit against Mr. Henderson in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City seeking back rent. On September 11, 1997, a default judgment was entered against Mr. Henderson. Respondent was awarded a judgment in the amount of $7,200.00. On or about September 15, 1997, Respondent filed a Writ of Garnishment of Wages and Mr. Henderson\u2019s wages were later garnished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">\u201cSometime in 1997, while employed by Ashley Layne Designs, Inc. as a window treatment designer, Mr. Henderson sought Respondent\u2019s advice concerning sexual harassment at his place of employment. Mr. Henderson continued his employment with Ashley Layne Designs, Inc. until sometime in March of 1998. Mr. Henderson was discharged at that time and retained Respondent in connection with his claim for unemployment compensation. He also retained Respondent to represent him on his claims of sexual harassment and abusive discharge against his former employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">\u201cOn January 20, 1999, Respondent filed suit against Ashley Layne Designs, Inc. for sexual harassment and for abusive discharge in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, case number 24-C-99-000254. In April of 1999, after negotiation between the parties, an[ ] agreement was reached. The parties signed a confidential settlement and general release. As part of the settlement, Mr. Henderson was awarded $11,000.00. The Respondent retained the entire $11,000 as his fee for his work in the Ashley Layne Designs case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING EMILY AND MICHAEL LEWIS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\">\u201cWith respect to Respondent\u2019s representation in the case of <em>Lewis, et al. V. Mihialovici, et al., </em>Petitioner alleges that Respondent violated the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, including rules: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 3.2 and 8.4. This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent, Alan Edgar Harris, has violated the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">1. Rule 1.1 by failing to competently represent the Lewis family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">2. Rule 1.3 by failing to serve all of the defendants, failing to appear for scheduled trial dates, and failing to cure self-imposed defects in the Lewis\u2019 case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">3. Rule 1.4(a) by failing to keep the Lewis family reasonably informed of the status of their case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">4. Rule 1.4(b) by failing to explain to Emily Lewis the effect that an order of dismissal based on a failure to appear would have on her case; by failing to explain the effect that an order of dismissal pursuant to Rule 3-507 would have on her case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">5. Rule 3.2 by failing to serve all of the defendants and by failing to serve the primary defendant until March of 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">6. Rule 8.4(a) by violating Rules 1.3 and 3.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">\n<em>Violation of Rule 1.1 [Competence]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-12\"><em>\u201c... </em>Petitioner alleged that Respondent violated Rule 1.1 by failing to advise the Lewis family of trial date changes as well as failing to serve all of the defendants in <em>Lewis, et al. v. Mihialovici, et al.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-13\">\u201cIn the following paragraphs, this Court finds that Respondent violated Rule 1.3 by failing to advise the Lewis family of trial date changes. We also find that Respondent violated Rule 3.2 by failing to serve all of the defendants in <em>Lewis, et. v. Mihialovici, et al. </em>With respect to Rule 1.1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>this Court finds that Respondent\u2019s violation of Rules 1.3 and 3.2 shows a significant lack of preparation and thoroughness. Therefore, we find by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Rule 1.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\">\n<em>Violation of Rule 1.3 [Diligence]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\"><em>\u201c. .. </em>Respondent argues that he was diligent in representing the Lewis[ ] [family] because he filed their case before the statutes of limitations expired, informed them of trial dates in advance, and attempted to effect service of process on the defendants. Respondent is correct in that he did file the case of <em>Lewis, et al. v. Mihialovici, et al. </em>before the expiration of the statute of limitations. It\u2019s also true that, in a letter from Respondent to Emily Lewis dated June 18, 1993, Respondent notified Mrs. Lewis that trial was scheduled for September 3, 1993 at 1:15 p.m. Respondent also explained in that letter that he had been unable to serve the defendant and if he could not perfect service by September 3, the trial would be rescheduled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">\u201cNo trial was held on September 3, 1993. The Lewis[ ] [family] appeared but Respondent did not. The case had been postponed but Respondent failed to inform the Lewis\u2019 of that fact before September 3. The trial was rescheduled for April 20, 1995. Again, Respondent did not appear. The trial was rescheduled again for July 13, 1995. Again, Respondent did not appear. The Lewis\u2019 did not appear either and the case was dismissed for that reason. On each of these occasions, the Respondent did not appear for scheduled trial dates. Also on these three occasions, the Respondent failed to notify the Lewis\u2019 that they did (or did not) have to appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">\u201cThe Respondent filed the Lewis\u2019 case in February of 1992. Mr. Mihialovici, the driver of the cab that allegedly struck Michael Lewis was not served until March of 1995. The taxicab company, who employed the driver, was never served. At the hearing on this Disciplinary Petition, Respondent testified that he reissued service for the driver five or six times, always by private process server.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>\u201cHe </em>also testified that the taxicab company, as well as the driver, were \u2018ducking\u2019 service. From February 1992 to March 1995, a period of about three years, Respondent never attempted to serve the defendants by any other means than private process server.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">\u201cAs a result of the dismissal of the Lewis\u2019 case in July of 1995, Respondent filed a Motion to Vacate the Order of dismissal on August 4, 1995. On August 15, 1995, this Motion was denied because Respondent failed to sign the Motion. The Respondent filed another Motion to Vacate the Order of Dismissal on September 25, 1995. On October 6.1995, this Motion was also denied. On February 25,1997, the Lewis\u2019 case against the taxicab company was dismissed pursuant to Maryland Rule 3-507.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Respondent was solely responsible for the dismissal of the Lewis\u2019!] case in July 1995. The primary defendant had been served at least 3 months prior to the dismissal. The Lewis!] [family] appeared in court for the two previously scheduled trial dates, i.e. September 3, 1993 and April 20, 1995. Respondent did not appear on either of these two dates. Finally, on July 13.1995, Respondent did not appear again, nor did he notify his clients, the Lewis\u2019, that they needed to appear. The Lewis\u2019 case was dismissed. Not through any fault of their own, but because of Respondent\u2019s inability to adequately communicate with them. Therefore, this court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated Rule 1.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">\n<em>Violation of Rule 14(a) [Communication]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">\u201c... Petitioner alleges that Respondent failed to keep the Lewis! ] [family] reasonably informed of the status of their case. Respondent argues that he notified the Lewis!] [family] of scheduled trial dates. He also argues that he took all calls from Ms. Lewis or Michael Lewis regarding their case and never failed to return a call that he missed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u201cAs noted above, it is correct that Respondent sent Ms. Lewis a letter notifying her of the first scheduled trial date in the case. However, there were two other trial dates scheduled that Respondent failed to inform the Lewis[ ] [family] about. Respondent\u2019s failure to inform his clients about these other two dates resulted in the dismissal of their case. The reason for the dismissal was that the plaintiffs, i.e., the Lewis[ ] [family] and or their attorney, failed to appear. Respondent later filed two Motions to Vacate the dismissal, the first on August 4, 1995 and the second on September 9, 1995. Both motions were denied. Respondent never informed the Lewis[ ] [family] in writing that their case had been dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">\u201cAfter the second Motion to Vacate was denied, Respondent had no further correspondence with Ms. Lewis or Michael Lewis. At the hearing on this matter, Respondent testified that Michael Lewis called him sometime in September of 1995. During the conversation, Respondent testifies that Michael threatened to sue him. Respondent told Michael he could no longer represent him and he advised Michael to retain another attorney. Respondent also testified that he did not have a retainer agreement with Michael Lewis. Ms. Lews, Michael\u2019s mother, signed a retainer agreement on September 12, 1989. Respondent testified that when Michael reached eighteen years of age in September of 1994, he should have had Michael sign a retainer agreement but he never did so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">\u201cWith respect to telephone contact with Ms. Lewis, Respondent testified that he never avoided her calls and never failed to return a message. He testified that Ms. Lewis did not have an answering machine and therefore when she was not available to speak to, he could not leave a message.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">\u201cMs. Lewis acknowledged the fact that she did not have an answering machine. However, she testified that Respondent failed to return her calls on several occasions. Ms. Lewis testified that on one occasion she called Respondent at his home. Respondent\u2019s son took the call and informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Ms. Lewis that he would be handling her case, not his father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-4\">\u201cAlso at the hearing on this matter, Respondent testified that he told Michael Lewis that the case had been dismissed when Michael called him in September of 1995. It\u2019s clear from the retainer agreement, signed by Ms. Lewis in September of 1989, that she was in fact [ ] [respondent\u2019s] client. Although Michael Lewis was the actual victim, he was a minor at the time of the incident and therefore could not sign the retainer agreement. In order for Respondent to represent Michael Lewis, his mother, Ms. Lewis, had to sign the retainer agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">\u201cIn light of the facts stated above, this court finds by clear and convincing evidence, that the Petitioner violated Rule 1.4(a) by failing to keep Ms. Lewis, his client, reasonably informed of the status of her case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">\n<em>Violation of Rule l.](b) [Communication]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">\u201c... Petitioner alleges that Respondent violated Rule 1.4(b) by not explaining to Ms. Lewis what would happen to her case if he was unable to effect service of process on the defendants. Respondent counters that he did explain to Ms. Lewis what the consequences of failing to serve the defendants would be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">\u201cIn a letter from Respondent to Ms. Lewis, dated June 18, 1993, Respondent informed Ms. Lewis that a trial date had been scheduled for September 3, 1993 at 1:15 p.m. Also in this letter, Respondent explained that he would now attempt to effect service upon the defendants. Respondent concluded this letter by saying \u2018if this was accomplished in time, the trial would go on as scheduled, but if not then it would get another trial date.\u2019 [ ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">\u201cRespondent did not inform Ms. Lewis or Michael Lewis that their case was dismissed on July 13,1995. Respondent presented no evidence in support of his argument that he informed his clients that their case would be dismissed if no one appeared on their behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u201cOn August 20, 1996, the Honorable Gale R. Caplan entered an Order of Dismissal pursuant to Maryland Rule 3-507 for lack of prosecution. On February 25,1997, Judge Caplan again entered an Order of Dismissal pursuant to Maryland Rule 3 507 for lack of prosecution. Respondent filed Motions to Vacate these orders on two separate occasions, i.e. August 4, 1995 and September 25, 1995. Both motions were later denied. At the hearing, Respondent presented no evidence that he informed Ms. Lewis of the two Orders of Dismissal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\">\u201cThere was also no evidence presented by Respondent that he explained the effect of these orders on Ms. Lewis\u2019 case. This court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Respondent\u2019s failure to explain to Ms. Lewis the effects of the Orders of Dismissal on her case constituted a violation of Rule 1.4(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\n<em>Violation of Rule 3.2 [Expediting Litigation]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\"><em>\u201c... </em>Petitioner alleged that Respondent violated Rule 3.2 by failing to serve all of the defendants and by failing to serve the primary defendant, i.e. the taxi driver, until March of 1995. Respondent countered that he was unable to serve the taxicab company, and unable to serve the taxicab driver until March 1995, because they were evading service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">\u201cThe Respondent filed the Lewis\u2019 case in February of 1992. Mr. Mihialovici, the driver of the cab that allegedly struck Michael Lewis was not served until March of 1995. The taxicab company who employed the driver was never served. At the hearing on this Disciplinary Petition, Respondent testified that he reissued service for the driver five or six times, always by private process server.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">\u201cHe also testified that the taxicab company and the driver were \u2018ducking\u2019 service. From February 1992 to March 1995, a period of about three years, Respondent never attempted to serve the defendants by other means available under the Rules, such as filing a Motion for Publication. Respondent allowed a period of approximately 3 years to elapse without attempting service of process by any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>means than private process server. This court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that this constituted a violation of Rule 3.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\">\n<em>Violation of Rule 84(d) and 84(d) [Misconduct]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">\u201c... With regards to Ms. Lewis, this court finds that Respondent violated Rules 1.3,1.4 and 3.2. As a result, this court also finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Respondent violated Rule 8.4(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">\u201c... Petitioner presented no evidence at the hearing that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d) with regards to Ms. Lewis\u2019 case, and therefore this Court cannot by clear and convincing evidence find that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING PRESTON HENDERSON</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">\u201cWith respect to Respondent\u2019s representation in the cases of <em>State Farm, Mutual v. Preston Henderson </em>and <em>Henderson v. Ashley Lane Designs, Inc., et al., </em>Petitioner alleges that respondent violated the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, including Rules: 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 8.4. This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent, Alan Edgar Harris, has violated the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">1. Rule 1.5 by charging his client, Mr. Henderson, an unreasonable fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-10\">2.

Ashley Layne Designs, Inc., et al, </em>was unreasonable. Respondent countered that the attorney for Ashley Layne Designs, Inc. suggested that Respondent take the entire settlement as his fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">\u201cSometime in 1997, while employed by Ashley Layne Designs, Inc. as a window treatment designer, Mr. Henderson sought Respondent\u2019s advice concerning sexual harassment at his place of employment. Mr. Henderson continued his employment with Ashley Layne Designs, Inc. until sometime in March of 1998. Mr. Henderson was discharged at that time and retained Respondent in connection with his claim for unemployment compensation. He also retained Respondent to represent him on his claims of sexual harassment and abusive discharge against his former employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">\u201cOn January 20, 1999, Respondent filed suit against Ashley Layne Designs, Inc. for sexual harassment and for abusive discharge in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, case number 24-C-99-000254. In April of 1999, after negotiation between the parties, an agreement was reached. The parties signed a confidential settlement and general release. As part of the settlement, Mr. Henderson was awarded $11,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-10\">\u201cRespondent testified that as part of the party\u2019s negotiations, he had a 3-way conversation that included the attorney for Ashley Lane Designs (hereinafter, \u2018Mr. Eidelman\u2019), Mr. Henderson, and himself. Respondent alleged that dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>ing this conversation, Mr. Eidelman proposed the $11,000 figure as a settlement award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\">\u201cIn a later conversation between Respondent and Mr. Henderson, Respondent explained to Mr. Henderson that he would have to pay taxes on the $11,000. Mr. Henderson indicated that he did not have the money to pay taxes on the settlement award. The conversation ended at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">\u201cRespondent then testified that he had another conversation with Mr. Eidelman. This time Mr. Eidelman initiated the conversation. During this conversation, Mr. Eidelman suggested that Respondent take the entire $11,000 as his fee. He also suggested that this would allow Mr. Henderson to avoid paying taxes on the settlement award. Respondent agreed to this and the conversation ended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">\u201cRespondent later testified that when the settlement check arrived from Ashley Lane Designs, Inc. he gave Mr. Henderson $3,000 as a gift. Later that same day, respondent gave Mr. Henderson $1,200 as payment for draperies that he made for Respondent\u2019s son. Respondent testified that Mr. Henderson agreed to this arrangement and made no objections until he received a letter from Respondent\u2019s wife that he would be evicted from the property located at 2440 Keyworth Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">\u201cRespondent testified that he explained to Mr. Henderson in a letter that Ashley Lane Designs was responsible for paying his fee in this case. However, respondent did not produce this letter or any other evidence to support his testimony. Respondent also testified that he did not tell Mr. Henderson what he could expect to recover until Ashley Lane Designs made the $11,000 offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">\u201cMr. Henderson testified that Respondent told him he could expect to receive from $85,000 to $1.5 million from Ashley Lane Designs. He had no discussion about a potential settlement with Respondent prior to Respondent informing him of Ashley Lane Design\u2019s offer of $11,000. Mr. Henderson also testified that Respondent never told him that Ashley Lane Designs was responsible for his fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>\u201cMr. Henderson acknowledged that Respondent did discuss the tax consequences of the $11,000 with him but not until Respondent delivered the check to him at his home. He confirmed that he told Respondent that he could not afford to pay taxes on the $11,000. Mr. Henderson then testified that Respondent stated that he would pay the taxes on the $11,000 and put the entire $11,000 towards the repurchase of the house located at 2440 Keyworth Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\">\u201cMr. Henderson\u2019s account of how he received the $3,000 was quite different than that of the Respondent. Mr. Henderson stated that he did make draperies for Respondent\u2019s son-in-law. He told Respondent\u2019s son-in-law that the cost would be between $1,100 and $1,200. After he finished the job, Respondent provided Mr. Henderson with a ride home. During this ride, Respondent gave Mr. Henderson $3,000 cash. Mr. Henderson testified that he did not know why Respondent gave him the $3,000. He did not ask any questions even though this was more than the cost of the draperies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">\u201cLater in his testimony, Mr. Henderson acknowledged that he signed the settlement agreement and release prepared by Mr. Eidelman. He stated that he complained to the Respondent that $11,000 was much less than what Respondent told him he could expect. Mr. Henderson indicated that he signed the settlement agreement and the release despite his complaint because he trusted Respondent\u2019s judgment as a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">\u201cMr. Henderson testified that he did not discuss whether or not he had to pay taxes on the $11,000 with anyone other than Respondent. He stated that he didn\u2019t know or wasn\u2019t told that Respondent was retaining the entire $11,000 as his fee. Mr. Henderson also testified that no one else was present when Respondent told him he could expect to recover from $85,000 to $1.5 million.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">\u201cThe accounts of Respondent and Mr. Henderson differ substantially. That aside, the uncontroverted fact is that Respondent accepted the entire $11,000 settlement award as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>his fee. Rule 1.5 lists 8 factors that are to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">Factor (1): \u2018the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly.\u2019 Respondent testified that he filed the complaint in the Ashley Lane Designs case with the court. He also filed the settlement agreement, although he did not draft it himself. Mr. Eidelman drafted the settlement agreement and release. Respondent also testified that he took this case on a contingency basis. He did not keep time records of his work in this case because attorneys are not required to keep time records in contingency cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">Factor (2): \u2018the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer.\u2019 There was no testimony or evidence presented at the hearing on this matter that Respondent was precluded from taking other cases because he accepted Mr. Henderson\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">Factor (3): \u2018the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.\u2019 Respondent testified that his hourly rate in 1998 was $250 per hour. Apparently this was his general fee. Respondent did not testify specifically as to the amount of his fee in sexual harassment cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\">Factor (4): \u2018the amount involved and the results obtained.\u2019 There was conflicting testimony with respect to this factor. Mr. Henderson testified that Respondent told him he could expect to recover from $85,000 to $1.5 million from Ashley Lane Designs. Respondent testified that he did not tell Mr. Henderson this. He did not tell Mr. Henderson what he could expect to recover until Mr. Eidelman proposed the $11,000 figure. The amount of the settlement award that Mr. Henderson accepted was $11,000.00. This was also the amount that Respondent retained as his fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-9\">Factor (5): \u2018the time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances.\u2019 There was no testimony with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>to this factor. However, the docket entries from the case reflect that a complaint was filed on January 20,1999 and a Stipulation of Dismissal was filed on March 22, 1999. Factor (6): \u2018the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client.\u2019 Respondent testified that he had represented Mr. Henderson and members of his family, on various matters, for over thirty years. He also testified that he considered Mr. Henderson a friend of the family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\">Factor (7): \u2018the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services.\u2019 Respondent is an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Maryland since 1960. He has represented between fifteen and twenty thousand clients in automobile negligence cases. No testimony was presented indicating how many sexual harassment claims Respondent has handled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">Factor (8): \u2018whether the fee is fixed or contingent.\u2019 Respondent testified that he agreed to represent Mr. Henderson on his sexual harassment claim on a contingency basis. He did not negotiate his fee with Mr. Henderson and did not discuss what his fee would be until Mr. Eidelman proposed the $11,000 as a settlement of Mr. Henderson\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">\u201cRespondent drafted the complaint in this case. He negotiated with the attorney for Ashley Lane Designs, Inc. to reach a settlement of Mr. Henderson\u2019s claim. Respondent did not draft the settlement agreement and release. He did not indicate to Mr. Henderson that representing him on this matter would preclude him from representing other clients. Respondent\u2019s fee in 1998 was $250 per hour. It\u2019s unclear how much Mr. Henderson\u2019s claim was potentially worth. The settlement award he received was $11,000. Respondent retained the entire $11,000 as his fee. Respondent did not keep time records of his work in this matter but the docket entries in this case reflect a three-month span between the filing of the complaint and the filing of the Stipulation of Dismissal. Mr. Henderson was not a new client. Respondent represented Mr. Henderson and mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>bers of his family for over thirty years and considered them friends of his family. Respondent has practiced law for over forty years. The majority of those cases were taken on a contingency basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\">\u201cIn light of these facts, this court finds by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent\u2019s fee in the case of <em>Preston L. Henderson v. Ashley Lane Designs, Inc. et al </em>was unreasonable. The work Respondent performed in that matter was significantly out of proportion to the amount of his fee. If Respondent kept time records for his work in that case, perhaps an argument to the contrary could be made, but he did not. That aside, a fee that is 100 percent of the client\u2019s monetary recovery in a case, clearly crosses the line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">\n<em>Violation of Rule 1.7 [Conflicts of Interest Generally]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">\u201cPetitioner alleges that Respondent\u2019s representation of Mr. Henderson in the <em>State Farm Mutual </em>case and the <em>Ashley Lane Designs </em>case was materially limited by Respondent\u2019s interest as Mr. Henderson\u2019s landlord. Respondent countered that his representation of Mr. Henderson in these cases was not materially limited by the fact that he was also Mr. Henderson\u2019s landlord.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">\u201cIn or about August 1996, Mr. Henderson lived at 2440 Keyworth Avenue in Baltimore City and while he resided there, that property was subject to foreclosure. Respondent purchased the property at a foreclosure sale for $17,000. He told Mr. Henderson that he would allow him to continue residing in the house until he could repurchase it from the Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">\u201cThere was no written agreement between Mr. Henderson and Respondent regarding Mr. Henderson\u2019s repurchase of the property. There was also no written agreement as to Mr. Henderson\u2019s obligations with respect to rent, taxes or other expenses related to the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u201cIn 1996, Mr. Henderson was involved in an automobile accident and was sued for damages. The Respondent represented Mr. Henderson in that case, i.e. <em>State Farm Mutual v. Preston Henderson. </em>Mr. Henderson was still a tenant of Respondent living at the 2440 Keyworth Avenue property. A judgment in the approximate amount of $11,935 was entered on or about September 3, 1997 in favor of State Farm Mutual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-4\">\u201cOn September 4, 1997, Respondent filed suit against Mr. Henderson in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City seeking back rent. On September 11, 1997, a default judgment was entered against Mr. Henderson. Respondent was awarded a judgment in the amount of $7,200.00. On or about September 15, 1997, Respondent filed a Writ of Garnishment of Wages and Mr. Henderson\u2019s wages were later garnished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">\u201cMr. Henderson testified that the purpose of the suit for back rent filed by Respondent against him in the District Court was to avoid paying the State Farm Mutual Judgment. He alleged that Respondent explained to him that if he was awarded a judgment for back rent he could garnish Mr. Henderson\u2019s wages ahead of State Farm Mutual. Mr. Henderson testified that he agreed to this arrangement because he preferred that the Respondent receive the money as opposed to State Farm Mutual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s representation of Mr. Henderson in the State Farm Mutual case was materially limited by Respondent\u2019s own interest. Respondent clearly has an interest in the property located at 2440 Keyworth Avenue. He was the owner of this property after he purchased it at the foreclosure sale. Respondent testified that he was paying the mortgage, taxes, and utilities on the property because Mr. Henderson refused to pay him anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">\u201cThe Judgment in the State Farm Mutual case against Mr. Henderson was entered the day before Respondent filed suit for back rent in the District Court. There was no evidence presented at the hearing to indicate that Respondent ceased his representation of Mr. Henderson at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u201cRespondent did not believe that his representation of Mr. Henderson in the State Farm Mutual case would be adversely affected. Mr. Henderson was the uninsured defendant. There was no testimony produced to suggest that Respondent did not competently represent Mr. Henderson in that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\">\u201cRespondent also did not believe that his representation of Mr. Henderson in the Ashley Lane Designs case would be adversely affected. Mr. Henderson was awarded $11,000 by Ashley Lane Designs, Inc. as a settlement of his claim. Respondent negotiated with opposing counsel to arrive at this amount. Respondent retained the entire $11,000 as his fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201cMr. Henderson testified that Respondent did not explain to him the potential negative effect that serving as his attorney and landlord simultaneously could have. The potential for the representation to be adversely affected was greater under the circumstances because Respondent was landlord to a tenant who refused to pay rent or other expenses related to the house. Clearly, any landlord under these circumstances would want the money that was owed to them. Respondent was in a unique position in that he would have access to any settlement or award as Mr. Henderson\u2019s landlord and attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201cBecause Respondent did not explain the potential conflict of interest to Mr. Henderson, he could not obtain Mr. Henderson\u2019s consent to that conflict. Respondent testified that he advised Mr. Henderson that he could seek independent counsel, but not that he should seek independent counsel. Respondent did not put this advice in writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">\u201cThis court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Rule 1.7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">\n<em>Violation of Rule 1.8 [Conflicts of Interest-Prohibited Transactions]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">\u201cThe purchase of a house is clearly a property transaction. As noted above, Respondent purchased Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Henderson\u2019s house at a foreclosure sale. Mr. Henderson testified that the State Farm Mutual case was pending during the foreclosure sale of his house. That means that Respondent was representing Mr. Henderson in an automobile negligence case during the same time that he purchased Mr. Henderson\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\">\u201cRespondent did not purchase the house from Mr. Henderson, but at the foreclosure sale. That fact tends to indicate that subsection (1) of Rule 1.8(a) is inapplicable because Mr. Henderson was not a party to the transaction, i.e. the purchase of the house at the foreclosure sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">\u201cRespondent testified that he paid $17,000 for Mr. Henderson\u2019s house at the foreclosure sale. He later had the property assessed and indicated that it was valued at $60,000. Respondent then testified that two or three years after June of 1997, he offered to allow Mr. Henderson to repurchase the house for $80,000. There was never a written agreement with respect to rent or other expenses related to the house, but Respondent produced several letters during the hearing that requested that [] [Mr. Henderson] pay $600 per month for rent. These letters also indicated that Respondent was paying the property taxes and utility bills. These facts tend to support Respondent\u2019s claim that the transaction was fair and equitable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">\u201cRespondent was also representing Mr. Henderson in the State Farm Mutual case the day before he filed a suit for back rent against Mr. Henderson in the District Court for Baltimore City. Respondent presented no evidence at the hearing to show that he ceased his representation of Mr. Henderson in the State Farm Mutual case before filing the suit for back rent. That suit resulted in a judgment in favor of Respondent. To collect on that judgment, Respondent garnished Mr. Henderson\u2019s wages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">\u201cThe Petitioner, as well as Mr. Henderson, alleged that the District Court suit might not have been for the sole purpose of collecting back rent. Mr. Henderson testified that the purpose of the suit for back rent filed against him by Respondent in the District Court was to avoid paying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>State Farm Mutual Judgment. He alleged that Respondent explained to him that if he (Respondent) was awarded a judgment for back rent he could garnish Mr. Henderson\u2019s wages ahead of State Farm Mutual. Mr. Henderson testified that he agreed to this arrangement because he preferred that the Respondent receive the money as opposed to State Farm Mutual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-4\">\u201cWith regards to subsection (2) of Rule 1.8(a), Respondent presented no written evidence that he ever advised Mr. Henderson to seek independent counsel. Respondent testified that he advised Mr. Henderson that he could seek independent counsel, but not that he should do so. Mr. Henderson denied that Respondent ever suggested that he seek the advice of independent counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">\u201cThis court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated Rule 1.8(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">\u201c... Petitioner alleged that Respondent violated this rule [Rule 1.8(j) ] when he purchased Mr. Henderson\u2019s house at the foreclosure sale while also representing him in a bankruptcy case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">\u201cRespondent testified that the purpose of the bankruptcy action was to forestall the foreclosure of Mr. Henderson\u2019s house. That testimony, coupled with the foreclosure sale itself, indicates that Mr. Henderson\u2019s house was connected with the bankruptcy proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">\u201cThis court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated Rule 1.8(j).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">\n<em>Violation of Rules 84(a), 84(c) and 84(d) [Misconduct]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">\u201c...

As a result, this court also finds that the Respondent violated Rule 8.4(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">\u201c... Although Petitioner presented evidence that Respondent may have filed suit for back rent for the sole purpose of garnishing Mr. Henderson\u2019s wages ahead of State Farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Mutual, that allegation could not be sustained. As a result, this court finds no violation of Rule 8.4(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">\u201c... [Respondent] sent a letter requesting $600 per month in rent three months before he filed the suit. Mr. Henderson did not pay any rent to Respondent during those three months.

We shall, however, uphold petitioner\u2019s exceptions as to her conclusions. As to respondent\u2019s exceptions, the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions are supported by the facts of the case. Accordingly, we shall overrule respondent\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Respondent filed four exceptions to Judge Holland\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. Respondent\u2019s first three evidentiary exceptions relate to Judge Holland\u2019s allegedly improper findings regarding her background findings and the allegedly incomplete findings she made in respect to certain facts regarding both the Lewis and Henderson matters. In respondent\u2019s fourth exception, he excepts to Judge Holland\u2019s conclusions that he violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 3.2 and 8.4 with respect to the Lewis matter and MRPC 1.5,1.7, 1.8,1.9<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 8.4 with respect to the Henderson matter, claiming that the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions were not based on clear and convincing evidence. We find these exceptions to be without merit and overrule them. On the other hand, petitioner excepts to Judge Holland\u2019s conclusion that respondent did not violate MRPC 8.4(d) in both the Lewis and Henderson matters. We sustain petitioner\u2019s exceptions. We address the exceptions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">A. Respondent\u2019s Exceptions to Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Respondent\u2019s Exception 1</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Respondent asserts that Judge Holland erred in finding, as part of her recitation of \u201cBackground Facts,\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>respondent was sanctioned for violation of various MRPC provisions in his most recent disciplinary hearing before that court where she has presided as the hearing judge. Respondent alleges that that finding is not properly part of the hearing judge\u2019s function and may have biased her fact finding and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Respondent was not prejudiced by Judge Holland noting his disciplinary past when she considered the MRPC violations alleged in this case <em>sub judice, </em>particularly by her noting his past discipline in the beginning paragraphs of her findings and conclusions. Judge Holland issued very complete and in-depth findings and, for the most part, fully supported conclusions, which we have reiterated extensively in this opinion. For sanctioning purposes, this Court has \u201cmade clear that the attorney\u2019s prior grievance history, including whether there were prior disciplinary proceedings, the nature of the misconduct involved and the sanction imposed, as well as facts in mitigation, are to be taken into account.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Jeter, </em>365 Md. 279, 290, 778 A.2d 390, 396 (2001). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Franz, </em>355 Md. 752, 736 A.2d 339 (1999); <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 347 A.2d 556 (1975). We are not aware of, nor has respondent brought to our attention, any case law prohibiting the hearing judge from noting an attorney\u2019s past disciplinary history. It is likely that such information would be made known to the hearing judge by Bar Counsel regarding, an attorney who has been repeatedly disciplined, such as respondent here. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Respondent\u2019s Exception 2</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Respondent excepts to Judge Holland\u2019s finding that he did not \u201ccommunicate to the Lewis[ ] [family] that he was no longer willing to represent them\u201d because there was not clear and convincing evidence to support this fact. Judge Holland found that \u201c[r]espondent alleged that [during a telephone conversation where Michael Lewis told respondent he was unhappy with the way his case was being conducted] Michael Lewis discharged him in September of 1995 ... [and] that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Michael Lewis threatened to sue him.\u201d Respondent alleged that at that time he suggested that Michael hire another attorney. Nonetheless, \u201c[Respondent never withdrew his appearance nor did he <em>communicate to the Lewis </em>[ ] [family] <em>that he was no longer willing to represent them.\u201d </em>(alterations and emphasis added). Respondent notes, and the record reveals, that Ms. Lewis testified that Michael Lewis told her in 1995 that respondent had told him that he would no longer be his lawyer, arguably corroborating respondent\u2019s testimony and supporting this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Nevertheless, this evidentiary conflict insofar as the hearing stage is concerned was for Judge Holland to resolve in order for her to render findings and conclusions in the first instance. It is well settled that a hearing judge \u201c \u2018may elect to pick and choose which evidence ... to rely upon\u2019 ... assess the credibility of the witnesses ... [and that his finding in that regard are entitled to] appropriate deference.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goldsborough, </em>330 Md. 342, 356, 624 A.2d 503, 509 (1993) (citations omitted) (alteration added). While respondent claims that he did communicate to the Lewises that he was no longer willing to represent them, we hold that there was clear and convincing evidence to support Judge Holland\u2019s findings and conclusions. Regarding the Lewis matter, Judge Holland stated that \u201c[Respondent never withdrew his appearance\u201d of the Lewises and the record reveals that Ms. Lewis signed the retainer agreement, which also made Ms. Lewis his client. The hearing judge impliedly found respondent not to be credible on this matter. She found and concluded that even though respondent may have told Michael Lewis that he could no longer represent him and advised him to retain another attorney, his attempt to sever his representation of the Lewises was undermined by the fact that respondent had no retainer agreement with Michael Lewis and by his failure to withdraw or attempt to withdraw his appearance in respect to Ms. Lewis, who was a party to the retainer agreement. We note that respondent took no affirmative steps, other than this alleged phone conversation with Michael Lewis, to terminate his representation and it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>proper for Judge Holland to find that he failed to sufficiently communicate to the Lewises that he was no longer willing to represent them. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Respondent\u2019s Exception 3</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Respondent excepts generally to the findings stated by the hearing judge regarding his client, Mr. Henderson, in both the State Farm Mutual and Ashley Layne Designs, Inc. matters. Essentially, respondent submits in this exception that the hearing judge\u2019s findings are \u2018significantly incomplete because they omit findings as to matters of record herein which are necessary to fairly state the facts relevant to the activities identified in that heading [regarding Mr. Henderson].\u201d Respondent claims, as he did in his previous exception, that there was conflicting testimony before the hearing judge on the facts associated with his involvement with Mr. Henderson, which \u201crender[s] those findings unusable as clear and convincing evidence and hence as bases for disciplinary action against respondent ... [and that they] should not be accepted by this Court absent all other findings essential to their completion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">As we explained <em>supra </em>in discussing our standard of review, this Court reviews the factual findings of a hearing judge under a clearly erroneous standard. In determining whether the findings here meet that standard, we reiterate the concept that \u201cthe judge \u2018may elect to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garfield, </em>369 Md. at 99, 797 A.2d at 765 (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hines, </em>366 Md. 277, 291, 783 A.2d 656, 664 (2001)) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999)). We have reviewed the record and hold that there was clear and convincing evidence supporting her findings of fact. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Respondent\u2019s Exception 4</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">We now turn to respondent\u2019s fourth exception relating to Judge Holland\u2019s conclusions of law that he violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 3.2 and 8.4 with respect to the Lewis matter and MRPC 1.5, 1.7, 1.8 and 8.4 with respect to the Henderson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>matter. Respondent argues these findings and conclusions are not supported by clear and convincing evidence. Once more, based upon our review of the record, we hold that Judge Holland\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, as they relate to those violations, are supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">i. The Lewis Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Judge Holland\u2019s conclusions with respect to MRPC 1.1, 1.3,1.4(a) and (b), 3.2 and 8.4(a) are, as respondent notes in his exceptions, based upon the same professional misconduct on the part of respondent. We shall address respondent\u2019s exceptions to each of these rule violations and refer generally to respondent\u2019s actions which, along with evidence presented by Bar Counsel, provided clear and convincing evidence for Judge Holland to conclude as she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Rule 1.1 requires \u201cthe legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d Judge Holland concluded that respondent failed to competently represent the Lewis family. Respondent excepts to the fact that Judge Holland concluded that this rule was violated because she found that respondent also violated Rules 1.3 and 3.2, which pertain to diligence and expedition of litigation. Respondent asserts that Rule 1.1 is not a \u201ccatch-all\u201d rule and mere violations of other MRPC do not implicate a violation of Rule 1.1. We disagree. Judge Holland emphasized in her conclusions that \u201c[respondent violated Rule 1.3 by failing to advise the Lewis family of trial date changes ... [and] Rule 3.2 by failing to serve all of the defendants in the [Lewis matter] ... show[ ][ing] a significant lack of preparation and thoroughness. Therefore, we find by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Rule 1.1.\u201d There is no dispute that respondent possesses the legal knowledge and skill to provide competent representation under Rule 1.1, as evidenced by his long practice history involving thousands of cases; he, nonetheless, can still be held to violate Rule 1.1 due to, as Judge Holland emphasized, lack of thoroughness and preparation in respect to a particular case, in this instance the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Lewis matter. Clearly, other MRPC violations can evidence this failure. Competence as an attorney certainly entails competence in preparation and thoroughness of handling a client\u2019s case. Respondent claims that \u201c[t]he hearing judge attempts to treat Rule 1.1 as a \u2018catch all\u2019 rule.... Nothing in the text of Rule 1.1 or any construction or interpretation of the rule that has come to respondent\u2019s attention indicates any intention that it be used in that manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The comment of Rule 1.1 provides that \u201ccompetent handling of a particular matter ... also includes adequate preparation. The required attention and preparation are determined in part by what is at stake.\u201d In this case the record reflects that respondent not only missed scheduled trial dates, but he did not inform the Lewises when they did or did not have to appear in court and also failed to serve all the defendants whom respondent admitted were \u201cducking service.\u201d Michael Lewis\u2019 automobile negligence case was at stake and there is no question that respondent should have better informed his clients of the court appearances. Serving both the taxicab driver and cab company owners was a fundamental step to getting the proper parties involved to potentially recover damages for Michael Lewis\u2019 claim. Respondent should have made better efforts to serve them. In this case respondent did not perform competently; he was not duly prepared or thorough. Further, case law supports a Rule 1.1 violation of incompetence for general ill-preparedness and lack of thoroughness. <em>See generally Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 753 A.2d 17 (Rule 1.1 as violated where an attorney, among other things, failed to provide the client with correct information that the client did not have to appear for a scheduled trial date and failing to appear on behalf of the client); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ficker, </em>319 Md. 305, 572 A.2d 501 (1990) (finding a Rule 1.1 violation where the attorney went into to court unprepared or missed scheduled trial dates completely); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>308 Md. 219, 517 A.2d 1111(1986) (holding that seven errors, each separate and inconsequential, taken together amounted to collective incompetence). Accordingly, we also overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Rule 1.3 pertaining to diligence states that a \u201clawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d In her conclusions of law, Judge Holland notes some instances that show respondent\u2019s diligence and agrees with respondent that he acted diligently in those ways, <em>i.e., </em>respondent\u2019s notification to Ms. Lewis regarding when the trial was originally scheduled and how he once explained in a letter that the trial could potentially be rescheduled. In his exceptions, respondent supports his diligence by highlighting the type of evidence before the hearing judge indicative of diligence, <em>i.e., </em>the docket entries showing several rescheduling changes, his two motions to vacate the judgment after the case was dismissed and how the transcript reflects that the hearing judge knew he had severe familial and personal problems that may have contributed to his non-appearances in the Lewis matter. However, the issue of whether a respondent is prompt and diligent focuses more intensely on the alleged factors or instances when he or she was not prompt and diligent. Respondent seems to ignore the following paragraphs of Judge Holland\u2019s conclusions, where she went on to detail the many instances that did display respondent\u2019s lack of diligence and led to her conclusion that he violated Rule 1.3. The instances where respondent was diligent, if any, do not excuse his three non-appearances for scheduled trial dates and his failure to notify the Lewises about these dates and if they were or were not to appear in court on those dates. Even though respondent had attempted to serve the cab driver and the cab company owner who were \u201cducking service,\u201d there was an issue regarding his attempts at service of process. Respondent filed the Lewises\u2019 case in 1992 and succeeded in serving the cab driver only as of 1995. There was, therefore, a period of three years where respondent never attempted to serve the defendants by means other than by a private process server. Ultimately, the Lewises\u2019 case was dismissed directly because of respondent\u2019s lack of action, which resulted in the failure to prosecute the case. In fact, when there was a chance to cure the dismissal via a Motion to Vacate the Order of Dismissal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the Motion was denied because respondent failed to sign the Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Respondent\u2019s meager actions in the Lewis matter achieved nothing. Judge Holland\u2019s conclusion that respondent violated Rule 1.3 was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 760 A.2d 1108 (2000) (repeated failure to serve defendant demonstrated a lack of diligence); <em>Ficker, </em>319 Md. 305, 572 A.2d 501 (being altogether absent from a scheduled trial date showed a lack of diligence). We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Respondent\u2019s violations of Rule 1.4(a) and (b) which cover attorney diligence, pertain to his failure to keep Ms. Lewis reasonably informed of the status of her case, <em>ie., </em>his failure, on two occasions, to inform Ms. Lewis of a rescheduled trial date, as well as his failure to explain the matter and the effects of the orders of dismissal to the extent reasonably necessary for her to make informed decisions regarding his representation. As to Rule 1.4(a), respondent states in his exceptions that Judge Holland refers, at some length, to the factual conflicts regarding the communication that actually took place between respondent and Ms. Lewis. We accept Judge Holland\u2019s findings as to this evidence and her conclusions that there was clear and convincing evidence to find a violation of Rule 1.4(a), despite the extent to which respondent alleged he communicated with Ms. Lewis regarding her case. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that he violated Rule 1.4(b). He offers no valid support for this exception except for stating that he answered Ms. Lewis\u2019 calls and inquires and told her the case was closed. As Judge Holland noted, respondent did initially inform Ms. Lewis what the consequences would be if he could not serve the defendants, but respondent gave little more explanation regarding the case to the Lewises. The record is clear. Respondent did not inform them that their case was dismissed directly because of his lack of prosecution, nor did he tell them of the two Motions to Vacate or that they were denied, in one instance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>because he simply failed to sign the Motion. Ultimately, there was no evidence presented by respondent that he explained the effects of these orders on the Lewises\u2019 case. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Respondent excepts to Judge Holland\u2019s finding that, by virtue of violating the rules just discussed and basing her conclusion on the very same misconduct of respondent, he, by necessity, violated Rule 8.4(a). The plain language of Rule 8.4(a) provides that it is professional misconduct to violate a provision of the MRPC. Therefore, the same professional misconduct can overlap to implicate violation of various provisions of the MRPC. In fact, a cursory glance at the many attorney grievance opinions clearly shows that where an attorney has violated one rule of the MRPC, that attorney has often violated many, based on the combined whole of the attorney\u2019s misconduct. Having already sustained Judge Holland\u2019s conclusions that respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), and 3.2, we conclude that Judge Holland was presented with clear and convincing evidence from which to determine that respondent violated Rule 8.4(a). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Johnson, </em>363 Md. 598, 631, 770 A.2d 130, 150 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">ii. The Henderson Matters</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Rule 1.5, in pertinent part, states that a \u201clawyer\u2019s fee shall be reasonable\u201d and lists eight factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee. Judge Holland discussed each of the eight factors and the relevant facts and concluded that respondent violated this rule. The settlement agreement effectuated by respondent in this matter clearly states that Ashley Layne Designs, Inc. shall pay $11,000.00 to \u201cHenderson and his attorney ... as payment for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in this matter.\u201d Judge Holland ultimately concluded that despite the varying testimony regarding the fee, its amount and why and how respondent ended up with the amount he did minus any \u201cgift\u201d amount to Mr. Henderson, respondent, nevertheless, accepted the entire $11,000 settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>ment award as his \u201cattorney fee.\u201d For the same reasons listed, <em>supra, </em>after each of the eight factors to be considered regarding the reasonableness of a fee, <em>i.e., </em>the factors reflecting the nature of the fee in respect to the work done, respondent\u2019s experience, reputation, relationship with the client and the like, we affirm Judge Holland\u2019s conclusion that respondent violated this rule. An amount of $11,000 for the amount of work done by respondent in the Ashley Layne Designs\u2019 case was as the hearing judge concluded \u201csignificantly out of proportion to the amount of his fee .... a fee that is 100 percent of a client\u2019s monetary recovery in a case, clearly crosses the line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The hearing judge concluded that respondent violated Rule 1.7, pertaining to general conflicts of interest, and Rule 1.8, pertaining to conflicts of interest regarding prohibited transactions, in his representation of Mr. Henderson in his bankruptcy proceedings, the State Farm Mutual matter and the Ashley Layne Designs\u2019 matter. Judge Holland had clear and convincing evidence to find that respondent violated these two rules and we overrule respondent\u2019s exception to her conclusions. Respondent was in the unique position of being Mr. Henderson\u2019s attorney and landlord, thereby creating a' potential conflict when he represented Mr. Henderson in his sexual harassment claim. As Judge Holland inferred, any landlord, especially an attorney landlord, knowing that his tenant who had not been paying rent had just been granted a large settlement, would want from the tenant, the money due the tenant from the settlement. Respondent also represented Mr. Henderson in the State Farm Mutual claim, which put him in the unique position of knowing the potentiality for a judgment against Mr. Henderson in that case, which, in fact, occurred and benefitted respondent because he was then able to garnish Mr. Henderson\u2019s wages ahead of State Farm Mutual. Further, there is evidence to support that respondent did not tell Mr. Henderson of the potential for conflict or attempt to gain Mr. Henderson\u2019s consent to represent him in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>light of the potential for conflict.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We overrule respondent\u2019s exception to his violation of Rule 1.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Rule 1.8(a) generally states that it is prohibited for a lawyer to enter into a business, financial or property transaction with a client. Subsections one and two of Rule 1.8 are conjunctive in nature and state that a lawyer cannot enter into a prohibited transaction <em>\u201cunless: </em>(1) the transaction is fair and equitable to the client; <em>and </em>(2) the client is advised to seek the advice of independent counsel in the transaction and is given a reasonable opportunity to do so.\u201d (some emphasis added). The facts are simple, respondent was representing Mr. Henderson in the automobile negligence case against State Farm Mutual during the same time that he purchased Mr. Henderson\u2019s house. The hearing judge found that because respondent purchased the house at a foreclosure sale, subsection (1) of this rule was not violated because Mr. Henderson was not a party to that transaction. However, there was clear and convincing evidence that subsection (2) of this rule was violated. Mr. Henderson denied, at the hearing, that respondent ever suggested he seek the advice of independent counsel and the hearing judge rejected respondent\u2019s claims to the contrary. We affirm respondent\u2019s violation of Rule 1.8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">There is no merit to respondent\u2019s exception to Judge Holland\u2019s finding of a violation of Rule 1.8(j), which states that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for a client.\u201d The hearing judge concluded that respondent acquired a proprietary interest in Mr. Henderson\u2019s cause of action, <em>i.e., </em>his bankruptcy proceedings, upon his purchase of Mr. Henderson\u2019s home, even via a foreclosure sale independent of Mr. Henderson. There is a link between the 2440 Keyworth Avenue property and Mr. Henderson\u2019s claims and the subject matter, his home, that could be involved in the litigation of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Respondent, again, excepts to Judge Holland\u2019s finding that by virtue of his violations of Rules 1.5, 1.7 and 1.8 in the Henderson matters that he also by necessity violated Rule 8.4(a). We reiterate the reasoning we opined <em>supra </em>and affirm the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion regarding this rule violation. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">B. Petitioner\u2019s Exceptions to Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"APp\">Judge Holland concluded that petitioner failed to provide clear and convincing evidence to support its allegation that respondent violated MRPC 8.4(d) and that respondent did not engage in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Citing <em>Harris, Mooney </em>and <em>Attorney Grievance v. Alison, </em>349 Md. 623, 709 A.2d 1212 (1998) in its exceptions, petitioner contends that respondent\u2019s failure to appear at the scheduled court proceedings causing the Lewises\u2019 case to be dismissed because of non-appearance and respondent\u2019s seeking to \u201cline his own pockets\u201d by garnishing Mr. Henderson\u2019s wages, at the expense of Mr. Henderson, in the State Farm Mutual case serve as examples of conduct \u201cbreed[ing] disrespect for the Court and for the legal profession\u201d and were prejudicial to the administration of justice, amounting to a violation of 8.4(d) in both matters. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">An attorney\u2019s failure to adequately represent a client may violate Rule 8.4(d). <em>See Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 83, 753 A.2d at 31; <em>Brown, </em>353 Md. at 286, 725 A.2d at 1076. We held in <em>Ficker, </em>319 Md. at 313-15, 572 A.2d at 505-06, that an attorney\u2019s tardiness or absence from a scheduled proceeding may violate former Code of Professional Responsibility Disciplinary Rule (DR) 1-102(A)(5), which contained virtually the same text as current MRPC 8.4(d). <em>See also Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 83, 753 A.2d at 31; <em>Brown, </em>353 Md. at 286, 725 A.2d at 1076. We explained in <em>Ficker:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">\u201c[A]n attorney plays such an integral role in the judicial process that without his presence the wheels of justice must, necessarily, grind to a halt. The attorney\u2019s absence from the courtroom is immediately cognizable by the judge and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>intrudes upon the operation and dignity of the court.\u201d <em>Ficker, </em>319 Md. at 315, 572 A.2d at 506. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">As we discussed, <em>supra, </em>respondent acknowledges in his exceptions and in testimony before the hearing judge that he failed to appear in court in the Lewis matter and we hold that his representation of Mr. Henderson was prejudicial to the administration of justice. Therefore, the hearing judge should have concluded that he had violated MRPC 8.4(d) in the Lewis and Henderson matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The only issue that remains is the appropriate sanction to apply under the facts and circumstances of this case having now determined that respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.5, 1.7, 1.8(a) and (j)&gt; 3.2, 8.4(a) and (d).

Generally, if there are a number of mitigating factors present, or an absence of aggravating factors, we are apt to find that a less severe sanction will serve our stated purpose of protecting the public.... In cases involving the presence of highly aggravating factors, for instance where an attorney avoids, ignores, or does not cooperate with Bar Counsel or misappropriates client funds, we are more inclined to impose a more sever sanction than in those cases in which, tor example, the attorney was cooperative with Bar Counsel throughout the attorney grievance process or did not misappropriate funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104-05, 797 A.2d at 768.
