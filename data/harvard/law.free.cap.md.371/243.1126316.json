The Court of Special Appeals held that, where the order denying the contempt petition is so closely intertwined with a separate, appealable order as to be reviewable as a part of that judgment, the petitioning party does have a right to appeal. <em>Howard County v. The Pack Shack, Inc., </em>138 Md.App. 720, 725, 773 A.2d 612, 615 (2001). We shall reverse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>holding that a party that files a petition for constructive civil contempt does not have a right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of that petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Howard County adopted, as a part of its Zoning Regulations, CB 65-1997, which regulated the location in the County of adult entertainment businesses. Pack Shack, Inc., the petitioner, operates an adult book or video store, as defined in the Zoning Regulations. It filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Howard County, challenging the constitutionality, as applied to its premises, of those portions of the respondent Howard County\u2019s Zoning Regulations that restrict adult book or video stores to certain areas of the County. The court upheld those zoning regulations and issued a permanent injunction that enjoined the petitioner from using its leased premises in violation of the County\u2019s zoning regulations. The petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">While that appeal was pending in the intermediate appellate court, the respondent filed in the trial court, in the declaratory judgment action, a petition for constructive civil contempt to enforce the injunction previously entered against the petitioner. The petition was filed following an inspection conducted by the respondent of the petitioner\u2019s premises. From that inspection, the respondent concluded that the petitioner was continuing to operate its adult book or video store more than a year after the effective date of CB 65-1997 and in violation of the injunction against doing so that had been issued by the trial court less than a week before.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court found that there was insufficient evidence to hold the petitioner in contempt and, therefore, ruled that the verdict was not guilty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Dissatisfied with that decision, the respondent, as the petitioner had done a week or so before, noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In that court, it moved to consolidate its appeal with the petitioner\u2019s then still pending appeal in that court. The petitioner, for its part, moved to dismiss the respondent\u2019s appeal, arguing that it was not permitted because there was no statutory basis for it. The Court of Special Appeals ultimately denied both motions. With respect to the declaratory judgment case, it affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>The Pack Shack, Inc. v. Howard County, </em>138 Md.App. 59, 770 A.2d 1028 (2001). Although recognizing that there ordinarily is no right of appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of a petition for constructive civil contempt, the intermediate appellate court held that the respondent could appeal in the case <em>sub judice </em>\u201cbecause the contempt proceeding was in the nature of a civil execution to enforce a decree intertwined with an appealable order, i.e., the injunction.\u201d <em>Howard County v. The Pack Shack, Inc., </em>138 Md.App. 720, 725, 773 A.2d 612, 615 (2001). On the merits, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the contempt judgment, holding that the trial court applied the wrong burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 746, 773 A.2d at 627. It remanded the case for application of the appropriate standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The right to appeal in this State is wholly statutory. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., </em>358 Md. 166, 747 A.2d 647 (2000); <em>See also Gisriel v. Ocean City Elections </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>Bd., </em>345 Md. 477, 489, 693 A.2d 757, 763 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1053, 118 S.Ct. 702, 139 L.Ed.2d 645 (1998).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>recently reaffirmed this principle in <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 78, 785 A.2d 1275, 1285 (2001). Noting that \u201cexcept as may be constitutionally authorized, the right of appeal is entirely dependent upon statutes,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76, 785 A.2d at 1284, we held that the appeals statutes represent the entire subject matter of the law of appellate review and, as such, abrogate the common law on the subject. <em>Id. </em>at 77-78, 785 A.2d at 1284. In so concluding, we were persuaded by the rationale of <em>Robinson v. State, </em>353 Md. 683, 728 A.2d 698 (1999), holding that the enactment of Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27 \u00a7\u00a7 12, 12A, and 12A-1, abrogated common law assault. <em>Id. </em>at 77, 785 A.2d at 1284.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">As in <em>State v. Green, supra, </em>this case turns on the statutory construction of the relevant appeals statutes, Md.Code (1974, 1998 Replacement Volume) \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 et. seq. of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. It is appropriate, therefore, that we begin our inquiry with those appeals statutes for, if there is a right to appeal in this case, it must be grounded there.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The statutory scheme is structured to confer a broad, general right of appeal, that subsequently is limited by enumerated \u201cexceptions.\u201d <em>See State v. Green, </em>367 Md. at 78, 785 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>A.2d at 1284. The general right of appeal is contained in \u00a7 12-301. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201cExcept as provided in \u00a7 12-302 of this subtitle, a party-may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court. The right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law. In a criminal case, the defendant may appeal even though imposition or execution of sentence has been suspended. In a civil case, a plaintiff who has accepted a remittitur may cross-appeal from the final judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Section 12-302 contains the exceptions, or limitations, on that general right of appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Relevant to this case is \u00a7 12-302(b). It expressly states that \u201c[sjection 12-301 of this subtitle does not apply to appeals in contempt cases, which are governed by \u00a7\u00a7 12-304 and 12-402 of this title.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 12-304 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\u201c(a) <em>Scope of review. </em>\u2014 Any person may appeal from any order or judgment passed to preserve the power or vindicate the dignity of the court and adjudging him in contempt of court, including an interlocutory order, remedial in nature, adjudging any person in contempt, whether or not a party to the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">\u201c(b) <em>Exception. </em>\u2014 This section does not apply to an adjudication of contempt for violation of an interlocutory order for the payment of alimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The petitioner argues that the respondent had no right to appeal the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of its contempt petition. Noting that \u00a7 12-304 is the only source for the right of appeal in contempt cases, it asserts that the language of that section clearly limits the appeal right to persons adjudged in contempt. The petitioner relies on <em>Tyler v. Baltimore Co., </em>256 Md. 64, 70-72, 259 A.2d 307, 310-11 (1969), where we held that there was no right of appeal from a trial court\u2019s refusal to issue a contempt order. Discussing the predecessors of the current appeals statutes,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the <em>Tyler </em>court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">\u201cOur view is that ordinarily these two statutes offer the only right in Maryland to appellate review in cases of either civil or criminal contempt, and they offer the right only to those adjudged in contempt, not to those who unsuccessfully seek to have another held to be contemptuous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 70-71, 259 A.2d at 310. Because the respondent was not a person adjudged in contempt, the petitioner contends, the Court of Special Appeals lacked jurisdiction to entertain the respondent\u2019s appeal and, therefore, there was no right of appeal in this case. The intermediate appellate court, the petitioner submits, should have granted its motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In response, the respondent contends that \u201cby misconstruing certain appeal provisions contained in the Courts &amp; Judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>cial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Annotated Code ..., [the petitioner] seeks to strip the County, and any moving party in a civil contempt proceeding, of the right to appeal a final civil judgment of a trial court refusing to enforce a previous court order through a civil contempt order.\u201d It maintains that it has a right of appeal under \u00a7 12-301, which, by \u201cproviding that \u2018a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil ... case by a circuit court,\u2019 supplies the statutory authority....\u201d Section 12-304 does not govern its appeal, the respondent submits. In fact, the respondent asserts, \u00a7 12-304 merely supplements the general right of appeal provided in \u00a7 12-301, by expressly conferring that right in certain types of contempt cases: its main clause (\u201cAny person may appeal from any order or judgment passed to preserve the power or vindicate the dignity of the court and adjudging him in contempt of court\u201d) expressly authorizes appeals in criminal contempt cases, while it\u2019s subordinate clause (\u201cincluding an interlocutory order, remedial in nature, adjudging any person in contempt\u201d) authorizes appeals from contempt judgments relating to the enforcement of a temporary injunction or restraining order. Noting that the term \u201ccontempt\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 12-302(b) and, thus, does not differentiate between civil and criminal, but contending that, from its terms and the way it has been interpreted, \u00a7 12-304 clearly applies only to criminal contempt and orders enforcing interlocutory orders, neither of which characterizes the order in this case, the respondent concludes that its appeal is not of the type specifically referenced in \u00a7 12-304, with the result that the appeal is authorized under \u00a7 12-301\u2019s general right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The respondent further argues, advancing the rationale adopted by the Court of Special Appeals, that, even if \u00a7 12-301 did not authorize its appeal, the appeal is authorized because it is so closely intertwined with the separate permanent injunction, which the petitioner appealed. Here, the respondent relies, as did the intermediate appellate court, on language in <em>Tyler v. Baltimore Co., supra, </em>256 Md. at 71, 259 A.2d at 311, suggesting that, occasionally, someone other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the person held in contempt may appeal in contempt actions when the contempt ruling is sufficiently closely related to an order or judgment that is appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">On numerous occasions, we have stated \u201cthat the cardinal rule [of statutory construction] is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent.\u201d <em>See Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 128, 756 A.2d 987, 991 (2000); <em>See also Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995); <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448, 451, (1994); <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753, 755 (1993); <em>State of Maryland v.

State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471, 474 (1988). The primary source for determining legislative intention is the language of the statute. <em>See Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 444-45, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997). To this end, we begin our inquiry with the words of the statute and, ordinarily, when the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, according to their commonly understood meaning, and express a meaning, consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, that also is where our inquiry concludes. <em>See Oaks, supra, </em>339 Md. at 35, 660 A.2d at 429; <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Vieira, </em>340 Md. 651, 658, 667 A.2d 898, 901 (1995); <em>Tidewater/'Havre de Grace v. Mayor of Havre de Grace, </em>337 Md. 338, 344, 653 A.2d 468, 472 (1995); <em>Buckman, supra, </em>333 Md. at 523, 636 A.2d at 451-52; <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 435, 639 A.2d 675, 678 (1994); <em>Condon, supra, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 755; <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 145-46, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993); <em>State v.

State, </em>321 Md. 103, 107, 581 A.2d 426, 428 (1990), <em>appeal after remand, </em>326 Md. 423, 605 A.2d 130 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Applying these well-settled principles to the facts of this case, we agree with the petitioner that \u00a7 12-304 clearly and unambiguously limits the right to appeal in contempt cases to persons adjudged in contempt. Its plain language says as much; to be appealable, \u00a7 12-304 requires the order or judgment to be passed to preserve the power and dignity of the court and to have adjudged the person appealing in contempt of court. As we explained in <em>State v. Green, supra, </em>367 Md. at 78, 785 A.2d at 1284, the appeals statutes are structured to confer a broad, general right of appeal that is subject to enumerated limitations. Here, that structure unambiguously communicates that appeals in contempt cases fall within an enumerated exception and are not governed by the general right of appeal contained in \u00a7 12-301. As correctly noted by the petitioner, \u00a7 12-301 directs the reader to \u00a7 12-302, which appropriately is entitled \u201cExceptions\u201d and clearly states that \u00a7 12-301 \u201cdoes not apply to appeals in contempt cases.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-302(b). Section 12 \u2014 302(b), in turn, directs the reader to \u00a7 12-304. That section, entitled \u201cAppeals in contempt cases,\u201d consistent with the proposition that it provides the sole basis for appellate review in contempt cases, expressly limits appellate review in contempt cases to persons adjudged in contempt. As the respondent filed the contempt petition, it was not adjudged in contempt of court. Therefore, not being a person held in contempt, it had no right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of the contempt petition. We hold that the general right of appeal contained in \u00a7 12-301 does not extend to contempt cases and, consequently, it cannot provide the statutory basis for an appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of a petition for constructive civil contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The Court of Special Appeals thus correctly concluded that \u201cthe express language of the applicable statutes point[s] to the conclusion that there is no right of appeal by a party who unsuccessfully seeks to have another party held in contempt.\u201d <em>Howard County v. The Pack Shack, Inc., </em>138 Md.App. at 730-31, 773 A.2d at 618. \u201c[T]he strong repeated dicta in the cases, the language in current CJ \u00a7\u00a7 12-301 and 12-302, indicating that only \u00a7 12-304 is applicable to appeals in contempt cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>and the absence of a holding that the general statute does provide such a right\u201d all support such a conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 741, 773 A.2d at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">The respondent submits that \u00a7 12-304 was not intended to apply to cases like the instant one, where a moving party in a constructive civil contempt action appeals a refusal to enforce a permanent final injunction. It finds significant, in that regard, that neither \u00a7 12-302 nor \u00a7 12-304 expressly differentiates between civil and criminal contempt, referring merely to \u201ccontempt.\u201d Despite not defining \u201ccontempt\u201d as referring to civil or criminal contempt, the respondent contends, nevertheless, that, by describing the kinds of cases in which it applies, \u00a7 12-304 was intended by the Legislature \u201cto provide express and supplementary authority in certain types of contempt cases in addition to the general authority for appeals provided in CJ Section 12-301.\u201d Those types of contempt cases, the respondent concludes, are criminal contempt cases and contempt orders or judgments relating to the enforcement of a temporary injunction or restraining order. And, because neither is involved in the case sub judice, it asserts, the general authority for appeals prescribed in \u00a7 12-301 controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">That neither \u00a7 12-302(b) nor \u00a7 12-304 differentiates between civil and criminal contempt cases does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that the generic reference to \u201ccontempt cases\u201d in those provisions means that \u00a7 12-301 applies to any contempt cases to which \u00a7 12-304 does not apply. Nor is there significance in the fact that the Maryland Rules did not differentiate between criminal and civil contempt until this Court\u2019s Order of June 7, 1996, effective January 1, 1997, adopting new contempt rules, Maryland Rules 15-201 to 15-208. Our cases have long recognized and discussed the distinction between civil and criminal contempt. <em>Kelly v. Monte-bello Park Co., </em>141 Md. 194, 197-98, 118 A. 600, 601 (1922); <em>Ex Parte Sturm, </em>152 Md. 114, 124-25, 136 A. 312, 316 (1927); <em>Donner v. Calvert Distillers Corp., </em>196 Md. 475, 483, 77 A.2d 305, 307-8 (1950); <em>Sheets v. City of Hagerstown, </em>204 Md. 113, 120, 102 A.2d 734, 736 (1954), <em>Winter v. Crowley, 245 </em>Md. 313, 226 A.2d 304, 306-07 (1967); <em>Tyler v. Baltimore County, </em>256 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Md. 64, 71, 259 A.2d 307, 310-11 (1969); <em>State v. Roll et al, </em>267 Md. 714, 728, 298 A.2d 867, 876 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Important to the resolution of this case is this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Tyler v. Baltimore Co., supra. </em>There, the issue was whether an order by the Circuit Court of Baltimore, granting summary judgment in favor of defendants that the plaintiff sought to have held in contempt of court for failing to issue a permit that the court had ordered issued, thus refusing to hold them in contempt, was appealable. Preliminarily, we explained that the predecessors to the current appeals statutes were enacted by the Legislature in response to <em>Ex Parte Sturm, supra, </em>in which this Court held that a judgment imposing a fine for criminal contempt was not appealable because there was no statute that specially authorized appeal, that abrogated the rule that there was no right of appellate review in contempt cases, and <em>Kelly v. Montebello Park Co., supra, </em>holding, for the same reason, that a party adjudged in constructive criminal contempt for violating a temporary injunction had no right to appeal. 256 Md. at 69-70, 259 A.2d at 310. As we have seen, aware of the difference between the types of contempt, we held that the two statutes providing for appeals in contempt. cases \u201coffer[ed] the only right in Maryland to appellate review in cases of either civil or criminal contempt,\u201d and then only to the contemnor, rather than the initiator of the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 70-71, 259 A.2d at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">It is quite interesting that, in reaching that holding, the Court discussed <em>Chambers v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 642, 643, 240 A.2d 644 (1968). Commenting on its holding that there is no right of appellate review in contempt cases, civil or criminal, for which it relied on <em>Kelly v. Montebello Park Co., supra, </em>we pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">\u201cThe actual holding in <em>Kelly </em>was not this broad. It held that the contempt there involved was criminal and that there had been no relaxation in Maryland of the rule that no appellate review was available in cases of criminal contempt. <em>Kelly </em>can be read to say that the common law rule is the Maryland rule and as engaging in a somewhat vague and rambling discussion not necessary to the holdings made that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>generally there is more relaxation of the rule in cases of civil contempt than in criminal and that perhaps some cases of civil contempt might be reviewable in Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><em>Tyler v. Baltimore County, </em>256 Md. at 70, 259 A.2d at 310. Thus, the breadth of the Court\u2019s holding with respect to the appealability of any contempt order was not inadvertent; it was quite deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Two principles, recently recalled and reiterated in <em>Blevins v. Baltimore County, </em>352 Md. 620, 642, 724 A.2d 22, 33 (1999), are applicable to the resolution of this case. The first is that \u201cthe Legislature is presumed to be aware of the interpretation that this Court has placed upon its enactments.\u201d <em>Waddell v. Kirkpatrick, </em>331 Md. 52, 60, 626 A.2d 353, 357 (1993). This Court, in <em>Tyler v. Baltimore County, </em>as indicated, interpreted the predecessors of \u00a7 12-304 as the sole source of the right to appeal in contempt cases, civil or criminal, just four years before the statutes were recodified. Moreover, as also indicated, the cases of this Court have differentiated between the types of contempt, the most recent before recodification being <em>State v. Roll et al., supra, </em>decided January 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The second principle is that \u201ca change in a statute as part of a general recodification will ordinarily not be deemed to modify the law unless the change is such that the intention of the Legislature to modify the law is unmistakable.\u201d <em>Duffy v. Conaway, </em>295 Md. 242, 257, 455 A.2d 955 (1983); <em>In re Special Investigation No. 236, </em>295 Md. 573, 458 A.2d 75 (1983). As we have seen, despite the interpretation given \u00a7 12-304\u2019s predecessors and the many cases in which this Court has discussed the difference between civil and criminal contempt, the law pertaining to the appeal of contempt cases was unchanged by Code Revision. <em>See </em>Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 12-304, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">\u201cIn view of the broad language of \u00a7 12-301, the need for a special contempt appeal provision may be questioned. However, there is an unusual history with respect to appeals in contempt cases. At common law, the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the trial court in a contempt case was conclusive and not reviewable by any other tribunal in the absence of express statutory authority; <em>Kelly v. Montebello Park Co., </em>141 Md. 194, 118 A. 600 (1922). It was not until after <em>Kelly </em>had been reaffirmed in <em>Ex Parte Sturm, </em>152 Md. 114, 136 A. 312 (1927) that Maryland adopted the predecessor of Art. 5, \u00a7 18; see Ch. 357, Laws of 1927. In view of this historical situation, it is thought wise to retain an express authority for appeals in contempt cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Two decisions of the Court of Special Appeals, subsequent to recodification, support this proposition. <em>See Becker v. Becker, </em>29 Md.App. 339, 345, 347 A.2d 911, 915 (1975); <em>(\u201cTyler </em>makes it vividly clear that in this State only those adjudged in contempt have the right to appellate review. The right of appeal in contempt cases is not available to the party who unsuccessfully sought to have another\u2019s conduct adjudged to be contemptuous.\u201d) <em>Kemp v. Kemp, </em>42 Md.App. 90, 101, 399 A.2d 923, 930 (1979) (\u201cIt is clear that under Courts Art. \u00a7 12-304(a), the right of appeal in contempt cases is not available to the party who unsuccessfully sought to have the other adjudged in contempt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">We also reject the respondent\u2019s alternate argument, grounded in the rationale ultimately adopted by the Court of Special Appeals, that the appeal was authorized because it was closely intertwined with the declaratory judgment and permanent injunction, which the petitioner appealed. That rationale is based on dicta in <em>Tyler v. Baltimore County, supra. </em>Having concluded that the respondent in that case had no right of appeal, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">\u201cThere may be occasional instances in which the order imposing the punishment for civil contempt or refusing to impose the order for civil contempt is so much a part of or so closely intertwined with a judgment or decree which is appealable as to be reviewable on appeal as part of or in connection with the main judgment, as in <em>Williamson v. Carnan, </em>1 G. &amp; J. 184, and <em>Longley v. McGeoch, </em>115 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>182, 80 A. 843 (in which no point was made as to the right to appeal; <em>cfi Emergency Hospital v. Stevens, </em>146 Md. 159, 164-165, 126 A. 101).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><em>Tyler v. Baltimore County, </em>256 Md. at 71, 259 A.2d at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">To say that two orders or judgments are closely intertwined does not make it so. In the case sub judice, such a statement is, in fact, belied by the actions of the Court of Special Appeals in ruling on the respondent\u2019s motion to consolidate the petitioner\u2019s appeal of the declaratory judgment and injunction with its appeal of the dismissal of its contempt petition. To put it quite plainly, we are hard pressed to understand, in light of its denial of the respondent\u2019s motion to consolidate the appeals, how the intermediate appellate court could have reached such a conclusion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, the intermediate appellate court all but conceded that the cases were not connected, stating, \u201c[W]e denied that motion [the respondent\u2019s motion to consolidate the appeals] but, had it been granted, the contempt proceeding <em>would have been </em>\u201cintertwined\u201d with the injunction case then pending in this Court.\u201d <em>Howard County v. The Pack Shack, </em>138 Md.App. at 742, 773 A.2d at 625 (internal citations omitted, emphasis added). Thus, we do not agree with the respondent\u2019s assertion, and the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion, that the ruling in the contempt pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ceeding and the judgment in the declaratory judgment action were closely intertwined at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">None of the cases on which the <em>Tyler </em>Court relied is applicable to the situation <em>sub judice. </em>In each, the appealing party was the person that had been adjudged in contempt and, in each, there was a separate final judgment as to which there was no dispute the contempt finding was closely related and intertwined. In <em>Williamson v. Carnan, </em>it was the defendant who sought to appeal a contempt order entered against him and the appeal was allowed because the result of a separate appeal of the injunction out of which the contempt order arose, would determine whether the defendant should have been held in contempt in the first instance. 1 G. &amp; J. 184 (1829). <em>Longley v. McGeoch, </em>115 Md. 182, 80 A. 843 (1911) and <em>Emergency Hospital v. Stevens, </em>146 Md. 159, 126 A. 101 (1924), are to similar effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In any event, the continued vitality of this exception, which was a very narrow one to begin with, is highly doubtful. Although we need not reach that issue here, because we have concluded that the contempt ruling and the declaratory judgment are not closely intertwined, that exception very likely would not apply when the appeal is filed by a person who was not held in contempt, however closely related and intertwined it is with other orders or judgments also pending appeal. <em>Tyler </em>simply does not support affording the losing party to a contempt action the right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The right to appeal in contempt cases, codified in \u00a7 12-304(a), formerly was addressed in two separate statutes. Maryland Code (1957, 1968 Repl.Vol.), Art. 5, \u00a7 18, entitled \"Appeals in Contempt Cases,\u201d provided that \"[a]ny person may appeal to the Court of Appeals from any order or judgment passed to preserve the power or to vindicate the dignity of the court and adjudging him in contempt of court.\u201d Maryland Code (1957, 1968 Repl.Vol.), Art. 5, \u00a7 7(e), entitled \"Appeals from Certain Interlocutory Orders,\u201d authorized appeal from \"[a]n order, remedial in its nature, adjudging in contempt of court any party to a cause or any person not a party thereto, except orders entered requiring the payment of alimony.\u201d These sections were combined when the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article was adopted as part of Code Revision in 1973. <em>See </em>1973 Md. Laws Special Session ch. 2, Section 1. The Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 12-301 states that the recodification was not intended to change the general rules as to appealability, with one exception not relevant to the right of appeal in contempt cases, and directs readers to \u00a7 12-304 with respect to appeals in contempt cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\">. Maryland Rule 2-503, although applicable to trial consolidations, provides a valid analogy. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">\"(1) When permitted. \u2014 When actions involve a common question of law or fact or a common subject matter, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, may order a joint hearing or trial or consolidation of any or all of the claims, issues, or actions. An action instituted in the District Court may be consolidated with an action pending in a circuit court under the circumstances described in Code, Courts Article, \u00a7 6-104(b). The court may enter any order regulating the proceeding, including the filing and serving of papers, that will tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">At the very least, to be intertwined, not to mention closely so, the matters must qualify for consolidation. Here, the contempt action and the declaratory judgment share subject matter, the zoning regulations being at the center of each. The issues \u2014 the questions of law and fact\u2014 in the two cases, however, are decidedly different.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
