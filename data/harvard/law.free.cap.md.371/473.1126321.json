Thompson also alleges that the trial judge erred by adding inappropriate language in the jury instruction regarding the \u201cduty to deliberate.\u201d We conclude that, because the amendment to the indictment was not a \u201cchange in the character of the offense charged,\u201d no prejudice befell Thompson. We also find that the language used by the trial judge, instead of the \u201cduty to deliberate\u201d instruction, was erroneous and prejudicial to Thompson; therefore, we reverse the Court of Special Appeals and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">On April 27, 2000, Detective Joseph New and other officers of the Montgomery County Police Department executed a search warrant for 2101 Forest Glen Road, Silver Spring, Maryland. During the search, the officers recovered a black bag containing numerous glassine baggies and a digital scale on the night stand of Thompson\u2019s bedroom. In addition, three bags of marijuana,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cash totaling $190.00, a pack of rolling papers, a box of Philly Blunt cigars, sandwich bags, and a pipe<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were also recovered in the same room.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Thompson was arrested and interviewed after receiving his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. During that interview, Thompson admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ted that the marijuana belonged to him for his own personal use, although he sometimes sold some to his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Thompson was indicted on charges of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance in violation of Maryland Code Art. 27, Section 286(a)(1) (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.), possession of controlled paraphernalia in violation of Maryland Code Art. 27, Section 287A (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), and possession of a controlled dangerous substance in violation of Maryland Code Art. 27, Section 287(a) (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The Second Count, possession of controlled paraphernalia, contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">The Grand Jurors of the State of Maryland, for the body of Montgomery County, upon their oaths and affirmations, present that TERRY HUGH THOMPSON, on or about April 27, 2000, in Montgomery County, Maryland unlawfully did possess controlled paraphernalia in sufficient quantity to and under circumstances which reasonably indicate an intention to use such items for the illegal distribution and dispensing of a controlled dangerous substance, to wit: a digital scale, glassine baggies, Philly blunt cigars, rolling papers, and a wooden pipe, in violation of Article 27, Section 287A of the Annotated Code of Maryland, contrary to the form of the Act of Assembly in such case made and provided, and against the peace, government and dignity of the State. (Possession of Controlled Paraphernalia, Article 27, Section 287A)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Thompson\u2019s trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County began on December 5, 2000. On the final day of trial, the State moved to amend the Second Count by striking the statutory references to Maryland Code, Art. 27, Section 287A and adding, in their stead, references to Article 27, Section 287(d)(2). In unsuccessfully objecting to this amendment, Thompson iterated that it would alter the punishment he could face from a f\u00edne to a potential of a one-year incarceration for this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>At the close of arguments, the trial judge indicated he was going to instruct the jury with what he called the \u201cattitude of jurors\u201d instruction. Thompson objected to the court\u2019s proposed instruction and indicated his preference for the \u201cduty to deliberate\u201d Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction, (MPJI-Cr) 2:01.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Thompson\u2019s attorney excepted to the instruction, and Thompson was convicted on all three counts. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported- opinion, affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision regarding both issues. The court held that the amendment of the statutory reference to the indictment was only a change of form, not substance, and that the jury instruction given, as a whole, was not coercive and did not encourage any jurors to relinquish their beliefs solely to reach a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Thompson filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we granted, <em>Thompson v. State, </em>368 Md. 526, 796 A.2d 695 (2002), to address two separate issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">A. Did the trial court err in failing to give the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction regarding the jury\u2019s duty to deliberate, and giving its own modified version of the instruction instead?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-8\">B. Does an amendment to a charging document, which changes the statute under which a defendant has been charged from Article 27, Section 287A to Article 27, Section 287(d)(2), thereby increasing the maximum penalty the defendant may face, constitute a \u201cchange in the character of the offense charged\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">A. Jury Instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">The first issue posed by our grant of certiorari is whether the trial judge erred in instructing the jury with what he called the \u201cattitude of jurors\u201d instruction rather than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u201cduty to deliberate\u201d Maryland Pattern Jury Instruction 2:01. We answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Rule 4-325 of the Maryland Rules defines the timing of jury instructions and the content of those instructions. The Rule states that, \u201c[t]he court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-825(c) (2000). As we have often stated, the purpose of instructing a jury is \u201cto aid the jury in clearly understanding the case, to provide guidance for the jury\u2019s deliberations, and to help the jury arrive at a correct verdict.\u201d <em>Chambers v. State, </em>337 Md. 44, 48, 650 A.2d 727, 729 (1994); <em>General v. State, </em>367 Md. 475, 485, 789 A.2d 102, 108 (2002). An important aspect of this guidance is providing a description of the process by which the jury is supposed to deliberate. <em>See, Kelly v. State, </em>270 Md. 139, 142, 310 A.2d 538, 540-41 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">In the present case, the trial judge instructed the jury on the process of deliberation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">The attitude and conduct of jurors at the outset of their deliberations are matters of considerable importance. It is rarely productive or good for a juror upon entering the jury room to make an emphatic expression of his or her opinion on the case or to announce a determination to stand for a certain verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">Your verdict should only be arrived at after careful and thoughtful deliberation. And it may be helpful to listen to consult with each other and to discuss the evidence and the deductions to be drawn therefrom freely and fairly in a sincere effort to arrive at a just verdict. This, however, does not mean that any juror is required to yield an honest conviction after such consultation or deliberation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">Remember that you are not partisans or advocates but rather jurors. The final test of the quality of your service will lie in the verdict which you return to the Court, not in the opinions any of you may hold as you retire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-10\">Have in mind that you will make a definite contribution to efficient judicial administration if you arrive at a just and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>proper verdict in this case. To this end, the Court reminds you that in your deliberations in the jury room there can be no triumph except in the ascertainment and declaration of the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">Your verdict must represent the considered judgment of each juror and must be unanimous. In other words, all 12 of you must agree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Thompson asserts that the process of deliberation should have been described as that given in the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction (MPJI-Cr) 2:01 as he requested during trial. MPJI-Cr 2:01, entitled \u201cJury\u2019s Duty to Deliberate,\u201d is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">The verdict must be the considered judgment of each of you. In order to reach a verdict, all of you must agree. Your verdict must be unanimous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">You must consult with one another and deliberate with a view to reaching an agreement, if you can do so without violence to your individual judgment. Each of you must decide the case for yourself, but do so only after an impartial consideration of the evidence with your fellow jurors. During deliberations, do not hesitate to reexamine your own views. You should change your opinion if convinced you are wrong, but do not surrender your honest belief as to the weight or effect of the evidence only because of the opinions of your fellow jurors for the mere purpose of reaching a verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction (MPJI-Cr) 2:01.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">We first addressed the appropriate language to be used in a criminal case to instruct a jury on its duty to deliberate prior to its adjournment to consider the fate of a defendant in <em>Kelly, </em>270 Md. at 140, 310 A.2d at 539-40. In that case, we were asked to reverse a conviction for manslaughter and remand for a new trial because the following language was used by the trial court in the instruction given to the jury before it retired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqC7\">May I say to you when you retire to consider this case it may well be that there will be a difference of opinion between you. If that is so, that is not something to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>concerned about because obviously when there are three days of testimony it\u2019s not unlikely that there may be some difference. What I ask you to do is for each of you to consult with each other, to consider the testimony as it has been given. In those instances where you cannot conscientiously agree with the majority, then you should maintain your own position. On the other hand you should not out of stubbornness refuse to alter your position, whether it is for innocence or guilt merely because you are not willing to listen to the arguments of the other jurors. There must be some give and take between you. There must be some understanding between you and it is up to you to determine for yourselves whether or not you can conscientiously agree as to what the verdict should be in this case. It makes no difference whether you originally start out in the minority or majority. In every case you are the final arbiters of your own conscience and you must decide whether or not you can agree to reach a verdict in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 144-45, 310 A.2d at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In affirming the conviction, we announced our adoption of the American Bar Association Criminal Justice Standards, Standard 5.4, <em>Standards Relating to Trial by Jury, </em>Approved Draft, 1968, American Bar Association, 1968 (\u201cABA <em>Standards </em>\u201d) as the criteria to be used in measuring the appropriateness of \u201cduty to deliberate\u201d jury instructions. The text of the ABA <em>Standards </em>was:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">Length of deliberations; deadlocked jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">(a) Before the jury retires for deliberation, the court may give an instruction which informs the jury: (i) that in order to return a verdict, each juror must agree thereto; (ii) that jurors have a duty to consult with one another and to deliberate with a view to reaching an agreement, if it can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>done without violence to individual judgment; (iii) that each juror must decide the case for himself, but only after an impartial consideration of the evidence with his fellow jurors; (iv) that in the course of deliberations, a juror should not hesitate to reexamine his own views and change his opinion if convinced it is erroneous; and (v) that no juror should surrender his honest conviction as to the weight or effect of the evidence solely because of the opinion of his fellow jurors, or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">(b) If it appears to the court that the jury has been unable to agree, the court may require the jury to continue their deliberations and may give or repeat an instruction as provided in subsection (a). The court shall not require or threaten to require the jury to deliberate for ah unreasonable length of time or for unreasonable intervals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">(c) The jury may be discharged without having agreed upon a verdict if it appears that there is no reasonable probability of agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Standard 5.4, <em>Standards Relating to Trial by Jury, </em>Approved Draft, 1968, American Bar Association, 1968. In <em>Kelly, </em>we determined that the jury instructions given by the trial court comported with these ABA <em>Standards </em>and held, therefore, that a reversal of the underlying conviction was not warranted. <em>Kelly, </em>270 Md. at 140-45, 310 A.2d at 540-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The guidance we provided in <em>Kelly, </em>however, went beyond our examination of the specific jury instructions utilized in the underlying case. In addition to adopting the ABA <em>Standards, </em>we also gave approval to a specific instruction that, we held, was always proper to use before a jury begins to deliberate. That instruction states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">The verdict must represent the considered judgment of each juror. In order to return a verdict, it is necessary that each juror agree thereto. Your verdict must be unanimous. It is your duty, as jurors, to consult with one another and to deliberate with a view to reaching an agreement, if you can do so without violence to individual judgment. Each of you must decide the case for yourself, but do so only after an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>impartial consideration of the evidence with your fellow jurors. In the course of your deliberations, do not hesitate to reexamine your own views and change your opinion if convinced it is erroneous. But do not surrender your honest conviction as to the weight or effect of evidence solely because of the opinion of your fellow jurors, or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">You are not partisans. You are judges \u2014 judges of the facts, fin criminal cases substitute the following: Since this is a criminal case, you are judges \u2014 judges of both the law and the facts.] Your sole interest is to ascertain the truth from the evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 143-44, 310 A.2d at 541 (quoting Instruction 8.11 of <em>Jury Instructions and Forms for Federal Criminal Cases, </em>27 F.R.D. 39, 97-98 (D.C.1961)). We referred to this instruction as an \u201cAllen-type\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> instruction because of its modified language and recognized that judges may \u201cpersonalize\u201d jury instructions, especially prior to the beginning of deliberations as long as they \u201creasonably adheref] to the [ABA] Standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 310 A.2d at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In <em>Burnette v. State, </em>280 Md. 88, 371 A.2d 663 (1977), we were asked to consider whether an <em>Allen </em>charge should be given when the jury is deadlocked. In response, we disavowed its use because we determined that the language was coercive and, as such, an impermissible interference with the province of the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 100, 371 A.2d. at 669. Subsequently, in <em>Goodmuth v. State, </em>302 Md. 613, 490 A.2d 682 (1985), we noted that the guidance given in <em>Burnette </em>was applicable to pre-deliberation instructions as well as to those given to deadlocked juries. <em>Id. </em>at 622, 490 A.2d at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>In <em>Burnette </em>we objected to language suggesting that the minority members of a jury should be deferential to the views of the majority. <em>Burnette, </em>280 Md. at 100, 371 A.2d at 669. Specifically, we considered whether the following language offended the ABA <em>Standards: </em>\u201c[i]f your views are contrary to those of the vast majority you should consider whether your views, which make no impression on the minds of so many equally intelligent jurors, are correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also voiced concern over language used in <em>Burnette </em>in which one part of a sentence instructed jurors to reach a verdict based on their own convictions, while the next part of the same sentence told jurors to give \u201cproper regard and deference to the opinions of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 371 A.2d. at 669. The instruction, according to our analysis, gave only \u201cpassing attention to the important principle that honest judgment, and not mere acquiescence, should be at [the] basis of a juror\u2019s decision\u201d. <em>Id. </em>We stated also that \u201cthe instruction might tend to unduly strengthen the majority\u2019s convictions, perhaps making the majority less willing to seriously engage in further deliberations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, we found that the instruction in <em>Burnette </em>was essentially a traditional <em>Allen </em>charge; it was not a personalized version of our recommended instruction nor did it \u201cclosely adhere\u201d to the ABA <em>Standards. Id. </em>at 99-100, 371 A.2d at 668. We emphasized that, \u201cdeviations in substance will not meet with our approval.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 371 A.2d at 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In <em>Goodmuth, </em>we explored whether traditional <em>Allen </em>language could be appropriately used to instruct a jury prior to deliberation. 302 Md. at 614, 490 A.2d. at 682. We emphasized that the analysis in <em>Burnette </em>was not limited to instructions given to deadlocked juries but also to jurors prior to the beginning of deliberations. <em>Id. </em>at 622, 490 A.2d at 686. We found that <em>Allen </em>instructions given before deliberations are just as coercive and \u201cmay well impact upon the minority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622-23, 490 A.2d at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The ABA <em>Standards </em>for \u201cduty to deliberate\u201d jury instructions approved in <em>Kelly, </em>and affirmed in <em>Burnette </em>and <em>Good-muth, </em>have been incorporated into the \u201cDuty to Deliberate\u201d Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 2:01 as we noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>in <em>Graham v. State, </em>325 Md. 398, 409 n. 4, 601 A.2d 131, 136 n. 4 (1992).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We explicitly expressed approval of MPJI-Cr-2:01, which we noted \u201cclosely follows the language of Standard 15-4.4 (formerly Standard 5.4) of the Standards for Criminal Justice (1978,1986 Supp.).\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Although some portions of the jury instruction given by the trial judge in the present case in what he called the \u201cattitude of the jurors\u201d instruction give some deference to the ABA <em>Standards </em>and reflect some of the nuances of the Maryland Pattern Jury Instruction 2:01, there are substantial deviations between the instruction given in this case and the ABA <em>Standards, </em>as well as MPJI-CR 2:01. Specifically, the following portions of the instruction given by the trial court do not meet the criteria of the ABA <em>Standards:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">The attitude and conduct of jurors at the outset of their deliberations are matters of considerable importance. It is rarely productive or good for a juror upon entering the jury room to make an emphatic expression of his or her opinion on the case or to announce a determination to stand for a certain verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">Remember that you are not partisans or advocates but rather jurors. The final test of the quality of your service will lie in the verdict which you return to the Court, not in the opinions any of you may hold as you retire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">Have in mind that you will make a definite contribution to efficient judicial administration if you arrive at a just and proper verdict in this case. To this end, the Court reminds you that in your deliberations in the jury room there can be no triumph except in the ascertainment and declaration of the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The language of this instruction does not \u201creasonably adhere to\u201d the ABA <em>Standards. </em>This is especially true of the language that suggests \u201cthe final test of the quality of your service will lie in the verdict which you return to the Court, not in the opinions any of you may hold as you retire.\u201d This concept of a \u201cfinal test\u201d implies that there is a standard of service to which a juror should aspire, one that requires a verdict to be reached rather than one that requires consideration of individual conviction and whether individual conviction thoughtfully can be reconciled with collective judgment. Because a verdict cannot be reached without unanimity, the \u201cfinal test\u201d language logically implies that a \u201cgood\u201d juror acquiesces in a verdict rather than adheres to his or her own judgment. Such language is a deviation in substance from MPJI-Cr 2:01 and the ABA <em>Standards, </em>which recognize that jurors should not surrender honest convictions in order to return a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The State points to other jurisdictions such as North Carolina, Idaho, and California that have made use of the language of a \u201cfinal test\u201d in which the \u201cquality of service will he in the verdict you return.\u201d <em>State v. Bryant, </em>282 N.C. 92, 99-100, 191 S.E.2d 745, 750-51 (1972) cert. denied, 410 U.S. 958, 93 S.Ct. 1432, 35 L.Ed.2d 691 (1973); <em>State v. Tope, </em>86 Idaho 462, 468, 387 P.2d 888, 892 (1963); <em>People v. Moraga, </em>244 Cal.App.2d 565, 53 Cal.Rptr. 563 (1966). At the time of those decisions, however, these jurisdictions had not adopted the ABA <em>Standards </em>as we have done to provide guidance concerning appropriate language for \u201cduty to deliberate\u201d jury instructions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As such, those cases are inapposite to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals found that the instruction given by the trial judge comported with MPJI-Cr 2:01. We differ from that court because we find the \u201cfinal test\u201d language used in the duty to deliberate instruction to be a deviation in substance from the pattern jury instruction and the ABA <em>Standards. </em>Such language is suggestive of the primacy of collective judgment over individual principle and honest conviction. We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals with instructions to reverse the judgment of conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">B. Amendment to the Indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Although this case will be remanded for a new trial, the issue of the amendment to the Indictment must be addressed because of its potential double jeopardy implication regarding the affected count were we to find petitioner\u2019s argument had merit. We, therefore, shall address the second issue raised, that of whether a mid-trial amendment to the Indictment changing the statutory reference was properly received.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Maryland Rule 4-204 permits an amendment to a charging document under certain circumstances. Rule 4-204 provides that: \u201cfo]n motion of a party or on its own initiative, the court at any time before verdict may permit a charging document to be amended except that if the amendment changes the character of the offense charged, the consent of the parties is required.\u201d Md. Rule 4-204 (2000).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thompson did not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>sent to the amendment. Rather, he objected based on his assertion that the amendment specifically changed the penalty from a flat f\u00edne to one with a possibility of one-year incarceration. We, therefore, must determine whether the amendment of the Second Count during trial \u201cchanged the character of that offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Initially, the Second Count of the Indictment stated, in pertinent part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">COUNT TWO: <em>Possession of Controlled Paraphernalia </em>... that TERRY HUGH THOMPSON, on or about April 27, 2000, in Montgomery County, Maryland unlawfully did possess controlled paraphernalia in sufficient quantity to and under circumstances which reasonably indicate an intention to use such items for the illegal distribution and dispensing of a controlled dangerous substance, to wit: a digital scale, glassine baggies, Philly blunt cigars, rolling papers, and a wooden pipe, in violation of Article 27, Section 287A of the Annotated Code of Maryland----(Possession of Controlled Paraphernalia, Article 27, Section 287A)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">On the final day of trial, the State moved to amend this count by substituting the statutory citations. The State sought to change the citation from Article 27, Section 287A to Article 27, Section 287(d)(2). Section 287A bears a possible maximum fine of $500.00 while the possible penalty for a violation of Section 287(d)(2) is a one-year prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">As we have stated, the purpose of an indictment is to provide notice to the accused of the charge against him and to guard against the possibility of unfair surprise during trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>358 Md. at 392, 749 A.2d at 773.

Below is the language of these three texts at issue-the initial Indictment, Article 27, Section 287A and Article 27, Section 287:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASW\"><em>Initial </em>Indictment\u2014 Count 2</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">\n<em>Language of Article 27, \u00a7 287A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">\n<em>Language of Article 27, \u00a7 287(d)(2)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\n<em>Possession of Controlled Paraphernalia</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">287A Drug Paraphernalia</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">Unlawful possession or distribution of controlled paraphernalia</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">... TERRY HUGH THOMPSON, on or about April 27, 2000, in Montgomery County, Maryland, unlawfully did possess controlled paraphernalia in sufficient quantity to and under circumstances which reasonably indicate an intention to use such items for the illegal distribution and dispensing of a controlled dangerous substance, to wit: a digital scale, glassine baggies, Philly blunt cigars, rolling papers, and a wooden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>pipe, in violation of Article 27, Section 287A of the Annotated Code of Maryland, contrary to the form of the Act of Assembly in such case made and provided, and against the peace, government and dignity of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>(a) Definition \u2014 As used in this section, the term \u201cdrugpara-phernalia\u201d means all equipment, products, and materials of any kind which are used, intended for use, ... in ... introducing into the human body a controlled dangerous substance____It includes but is not limited to: (5) scales ...

Evidence of such circumstances shall include but not be limited to close proximity to any such controlled paraphernalia to any adulterants or equipment commonly used in the illegal manufacture and distribution of controlled dangerous substances, such as but not limited to any of the following: scales, sieves, strainers, measuring spoons, staples and staplers, or procaine hydrochloride, manni-tol, lactose, quinine, or any controlled dangerous substance....</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">The language of the Indictment reflects the language of Section 287(d)(2) at first glance. A more studied exploration supports this conclusion. The Second Count utilizes exact phrases from Section 287(d)(2) to indicate a charge against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Thompson for possession of paraphernalia with the intent to distribute marijuana. The term \u201ccontrolled paraphernalia\u201d is used throughout the charging document. This terminology is included and defined exclusively in Section 287(d)(2) above. The following boldfaced language within the unamended Indictment indicates phraseology that is taken directly from the text of Section 287(d)(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\n<em>Possession of Controlled Paraphernalia</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">... TERRY HUGH THOMPSON, on or about April 27, 2000, in Montgomery County, Maryland, unlawfully did possess controlled paraphernalia in sufficient quantity to and under circumstances which reasonably indicate an intention to use such items for the illegal distribution and dispensing of a controlled dangerous substance, to wit: a digital scale, glassine baggies, Philly blunt cigars, rolling papers, and a wooden pipe, in violation of Article 27, Section 287A of the Annotated Code of Maryland, contrary to the form of the Act of Assembly in such case made and provided, and against the peace, government and dignity of the State. (Possession of Controlled Paraphernalia, Article 27, Section 287A)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In addition, Section 287(d) (2)\u2019s category of \u201cglassine envelopes or any other container suitable for the packaging of individual quantities of controlled dangerous substances for the illegal ... distribution\u201d could include items listed on the Indictment \u2014 Philly Blunt cigars, rolling papers, and glassine baggies.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The next focus of our analysis must be whether the body of the Second Count was sufficient to charge any crime, because in <em>Gray v. State, </em>216 Md. 410, 416, 140 A.2d 643, 646 (1958), we found that an insufficiency in the language of a charge could give rise to a circumstance in which a statutory reference supplied a necessary element of the characterization of an offense charged. There, we found that a caption, ordinarily amendable without altering the character of an offense, became a necessary part of the charging document because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>served to clarify an otherwise insufficiently described charge.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In the present case, however, we find that the Indictment is sufficient without the statutory citation in that it provides notice to Thompson that he is being charged with possession of controlled paraphernalia with intent to distribute in violation of Section 287(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Thompson also argues that the language of the Indictment is a combination of the wording of both Section 287A and Section 287(d)(2), and, thus, the statutory reference is a necessary indicator of which section is charged. An examination of both Sections 287A and 287(d)(2) shows that possession of the paraphernalia listed in the Second Count, specifically the scale, glassine baggies, Philly Blunt cigars, and rolling papers, conceivably could fit either section.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This commonality, however, does not create any ambiguity regarding which statute had been charged.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Tt is the intent with which one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>possesses such paraphernalia that determines which section is charged. The gravamen of Section 287(d)(2) is possession of controlled paraphernalia with the intention of distributing or dispensing. Code, Art. 27, Section 287(d)(2). The caption used for Section 287(d), <em>distribution of controlled paraphernalia, </em>reinforces this statute\u2019s clear purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In contrast, the gravamen of Section 287A is specifically that of possessing a drug paraphernalia with the intention to use it in ingesting, inhaling or otherwise introducing a controlled dangerous substance into the human body. Code, Art. 27, Section 287A. The possession <em>for personal use </em>is clearly indicated by the statute\u2019s language.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In the Second Count of the Indictment, the language of the alleged act and character of the charge is extrapolated directly from Section 287(d)(2) \u2014 \u201cpossess controlled paraphernalia in sufficient quantity to and under circumstances which reasonably indicate an intention to use such items for the illegal distribution and dispensing of a controlled dangerous substance.\u201d Therefore, the \u201ccharacter of the offense charged\u201d was clearly that of Section 287(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">This situation differs from that in <em>Johnson, </em>in which the State sought to substitute the word \u201ccocaine\u201d for the word \u201cmarijuana\u201d in a charging document. <em>Johnson, </em>358 Md. at 387, 749 A.2d at 770. Such an amendment would have altered what the basic offense was and triggered a more severe penalty for a charge involving cocaine rather than marijuana.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 891, 749 A.2d. at 772-73. In this case, the amendment of the statutory citation does not alter the character of the offense; the Indictment sufficiently charges a violation of Section 287(d)(2). It is not the statutory reference that triggers the possible penalty but, rather, the character of the offense alleged. Therefore, no prejudicial error occurred in the trial court\u2019s allowance of the amendment at the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY MONTGOMERY COUNTY.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge CATHELL concur in the result and in Part II.A of the opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-10\">.
