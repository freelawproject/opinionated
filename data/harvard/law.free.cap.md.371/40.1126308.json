The Final Order adopted the recommended decision of the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) of the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d) dismissing Petitioner\u2019s complaint on the ground that Mehrling had been divested of individual standing to pursue the claim due to her pending bankruptcy case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After receipt of the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision, Petitioner filed exceptions with the MIA which included evidence that her bankruptcy case had been dismissed five days before the ALJ issued his proposed decision, a fact not made known to the ALJ. The Associate Deputy Commissioner, <em>see supra </em>note 1, nonetheless adopted the ALJ\u2019s recommended decision to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s complaint for lack of standing. Petitioner\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration, treated by the Associate Deputy Commissioner as a Motion for Rehearing, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Petitioner sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Carroll County. The Circuit Court affirmed the MIA\u2019s final decision, ruling essentially that Petitioner\u2019s failure to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>evidence of her bankruptcy dismissal to the ALJ precluded her from later presenting it to the MIA in her exceptions. Petitioner timely filed an appeal with the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. Petitioner filed with this Court a petition for writ of certiorari, which was granted, <em>Mehrling v. Nationwide, </em>368 Md. 239, 792 A.2d 1177 (2002), so that we might consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">1. Did the court and administrative bodies below err in affirming the decision to grant [Respondent\u2019s] motion to dismiss on the ground that Petitioner lacked standing to bring her claim?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The instant case is governed by the contested case provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), Maryland Code (1995 Repl.Vol., 1998 Supp.), State Government Article, \u00a7\u00a7 10-201-10-227 (\u201cAPA \u00a7\u00a7 10-201-10-227\u201d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as supplemented by the Rules of Procedure of the OAH codified in the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 28.02.01 and regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>promulgated by the MIA in COMAR 31.02.02.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An overview of the relevant statutes and regulations is provided in Part II of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AyM\">\n<em>A. Petitioner\u2019s underlying claim against Respondent.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">On 2 September 1997, Petitioner filed a complaint with the MIA<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> alleging that Respondent wrongfully terminated her contract as a Nationwide agent in violation of Insurance Art., \u00a7 27-503(d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After an investigation, the MIA found no violation of Maryland insurance laws, and so notified Petitioner by letter dated 8 June 1998. On 6 July 1998, Petitioner requested a hearing regarding the MIA\u2019s decision. The MIA delegat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ed its authority to conduct the hearing and to issue a proposed decision to the OAH, and the matter was assigned to an ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In accordance with the schedule issued by the ALJ, discovery was to be completed by 6 November 1998. On 19 October 1998, Respondent submitted its first request for production of documents to Petitioner. Petitioner\u2019s counsel requested, and received, extensions of the discovery deadline until the end of November. Ultimately he failed to respond. On 12 February 1999, Respondent filed a Motion to Compel Petitioner to produce certain documents. The ALJ granted Respondent\u2019s motion on 23 February 1999, ordering Petitioner to produce a written response within ten days from entry of the Order. Petitioner had not complied with that Order as of 26 April 1999, the date the ALJ filed his recommended decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\n<em>B. Petitioner\u2019s bankruptcy and Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss for lack of standing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">On 11 December 1997, several months after Petitioner filed her complaint with the MIA, Petitioner and her husband filed for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the United States Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland. On 19 August 1998, Petitioner\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was dismissed subject to Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(g), which restrained Petitioner from filing any further petitions in bankruptcy for 180 days from the date of dismissal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">On 10 November 1998, Petitioner and her husband filed for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>United States Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland. Petitioner failed to disclose in her bankruptcy filings and schedules her pending administrative action against Respondent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">On 1 February 1999, Respondent filed in the MIA administrative proceeding a motion to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s complaint, arguing that by virtue of her Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing her alleged claim against Respondent properly belonged to the bankruptcy estate, and therefore a bankruptcy trustee alone had standing to pursue the claim against Nationwide on behalf of the bankrupt estate. Petitioner requested an extension, until 15 March 1999, to respond to Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss. On 25 March 1999, after Petitioner failed to respond within the requested deadline, Respondent renewed its motion to dismiss for lack of standing, and also requested that the case be dismissed due to Petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with the ALJ\u2019s discovery Order discussed <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">On 21 April 1999, the Bankruptcy Judge issued an Order Dismissing Case of Ineligible Debtors (\u201cOrder\u201d) that dismissed Petitioner\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, effective as of the date the petition was filed (10 November 1998). The Order indicated that Petitioner was ineligible for relief under her Chapter 7 filing because it had been filed erroneously within 180 days of the date (19 August 1998) her Chapter 13 bankruptcy case had been dismissed. <em>See </em>Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(g), <em>supra </em>note 8. As noted <em>supra, </em>Petitioner failed to inform the ALJ of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">On 26 April 1999, the ALJ issued a Recommended Decision on Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss. That decision, together with the record compiled before the OAH, was submitted to the MIA. Relying on <em>Pacific Mortgage and Investment Group, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>Ltd. v. Horn, </em>100 Md.App. 311, 319, 641 A.2d 913, 917 (1994) (citations omitted), the ALJ first determined that the \u201cbankruptcy trustee is the proper party to bring an action for injury to a person\u2019s property while a bankruptcy case is open.\u201d Finding that Petitioner\u2019s \u201cclaim against [Respondent] was in existence at the time she petitioned for bankruptcy,\u201d the ALJ determined that the claim was a part of Petitioner\u2019s bankruptcy estate and thus the \u201cbankruptcy trustee [was] the only person with standing to pursue this claim.\u201d Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Petitioner \u201clacked standing to pursue her complaint,\u201d and therefore had \u201cfailed to state a claim for which agency relief may be granted.\u201d The ALJ recommended that Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s complaint for lack of standing be granted. Because Petitioner had not advised the ALJ of the dismissal of the bankruptcy case, that fact was not considered by the ALJ at the time he issued his proposed decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">On 14 May 1999, Petitioner timely filed with the MIA written exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s recommended decision, attaching to the exceptions a copy of the Order dismissing her Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Arguing that the bankruptcy case was dismissed, effective as of the date it was filed, and therefore she had standing to maintain her claim against Nationwide, Petitioner asked that her complaint be \u201creinstated for a hearing on the merits before the OAH.\u201d On 28 May 1999, Respondent moved to strike Petitioner\u2019s exceptions, arguing, in essence, that the Associate Deputy Commissioner was confined to considering solely the evidentiary record made before the ALJ and that Petitioner failed to act with diligence throughout the administrative proceeding, including not informing the ALJ of the dismissal of the bankruptcy matter. No apparent action was taken by the MIA on the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">On 19 July 1999, the Associate Deputy Commissioner issued a Final Order in the matter, which reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ai-dedup-0\">I have carefully evaluated the documentary record in this case, the Exceptions filed by the [Petitioner] and the [Respondent], and the Recommended Decision of [the ALJ]. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Based thereupon, I am persuaded that the ALJ\u2019s Conclusions of Law, based upon his detailed Findings of Fact pursuant to COMAR 31.02.02.12B and well thought out Discussion are correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">THEREFORE, it is hereby</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">ORDERED, that the Recommended Decision of [the ALJ] to dismiss [Petitioner\u2019s] appeal, be adopted as the Commissioner\u2019s Final Order....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Petitioner promptly moved for reconsideration of the Final Order, and Respondent replied to it. In his Order dated 11 August 1999, the Associate Deputy Commissioner denied Petitioner\u2019s motion, stating \u201cI have considered the Motion for Reconsideration, which I am treating as a Motion for Rehearing, and I have also considered the Response of Nationwide. I find there is no valid reason to grant a rehearing in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\n<em>C. Judicial review of the Final Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Petitioner sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Carroll County of the MIA\u2019s Final Order. Petitioner<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> argued that the Associate Deputy Commissioner, having \u201cexercised his discretion\u201d to consider evidence of Petitioner\u2019s bankruptcy dismissal, nonetheless failed to \u201crecognize the import\u201d of this evidence, and therefore his final order dismissing Petitioner\u2019s complaint for lack of standing was erroneous, not supported by substantial evidence, and arbitrary or capricious. Respondent, on the other hand, claimed that Petitioner was not allowed to introduce new evidence of her bankruptcy dismissal through the vehicle of her exceptions. It asserted that exceptions are \u201climited to ... simply a review of the evidence\u201d compiled before the ALJ. Observing that the administrative record before the ALJ was silent as to Petitioner\u2019s bankruptcy dismissal, Respondent contended that the Associate Deputy Commissioner\u2019s Final Order was \u201csupported by substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>evidence in the administrative record.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In rebuttal, Petitioner denied Respondent\u2019s contention that the administrative record closed with the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision, remarking that \u201ceven if the [c]ourt were to somehow accept Respondent\u2019s argument, their case still fails, because the [Associate Deputy] Commissioner properly exercised his discretion to accept this evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">On 6 December 2000, the Circuit Court affirmed the MIA\u2019s Final Order, opining that \u201c[Petitioner cannot present evidence contesting [Respondent\u2019s] Motion to Dismiss when she failed to provide [the ALJ] with any [such] evidence,\u201d in spite of \u201cample opportunity\u201d to do so. (Citing <em>Osztreicher v. Juanteguy, </em>338 Md. 528, 535, 659 A.2d 1278, 1281-82 (1995) (\u201cA party who does not offer evidence on an issue as to which that party has the burden of proof acquiesces in the adverse judgment entered on that issue.\u201d) (citation omitted)). Moreover, while the court recognized the broad \u201cdiscretion of an administrative agency to admit evidence after a hearing,\u201d <em>see Md. State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 557, 625 A.2d 914, 922 (1993), it refused to \u201cassign it more weight than what it was afforded by the [Associate Deputy] Commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Petitioner timely filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals which, in an unreported decision, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court affirming the Final Order. Citing <em>Pacific Mortgage, </em>100 Md.App. at 319, 641 A.2d at 917, the intermediate appellate court first determined that a bankruptcy trustee alone has standing to pursue a claim on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. As did the Circuit Court, the Court of Special Appeals found that Petitioner \u201chad the opportunity to present evidence to the ALJ from which a factual finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>her bankruptcy petition had been dismissed could be made,\u201d but made \u201cno attempt\u201d to do so. While noting that Petitioner eventually submitted evidence of her bankruptcy dismissal to the MIA, the intermediate appellate court explained that \u201c[t]he circuit court, sitting as an appellate court, ... cannot go outside the record compiled by the ALJ and, based on some supplemental facts, reach a different ruling.\u201d (Citing <em>Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Karwacki, </em>340 Md. 271, 280, 666 A.2d 511, 515 (1995) (stating that a reviewing court must defer to an agency\u2019s factual findings and must not make an independent assessment of the evidence); COMAR 31.02.02.12, <em>see infra </em>page 16). The court further explained that while the Associate Deputy Director had the discretion to consider the supplemental evidence, he was not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We shall supply additional facts <em>infra </em>as necessary to our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">We believe it instructive to our analysis to provide an overview of the relevant statutes and regulations that govern the administrative process in the instant case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under Insurance Art., \u00a7 2-210(a)(2),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> any person claiming to be aggrieved by a decision of the Commissioner is entitled to a hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the matter.

Accordingly, we shall accept, without critical comment, the holding in that case for purposes of our analysis here. The parties\u2019 dispute in the present case begins with their respective assertions as to what constitutes the administrative record before the MIA when the Final Order was issued. Petitioner contends the supplemental evidence of Petitioner\u2019s bankruptcy dismissal was properly before, and considered by, the Associate Deputy Commissioner. Citing COMAR 31.02.02.10E,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Petitioner asserts that the administrative record before the MIA included her written exceptions and attachments. Petitioner argues that there is nothing in the APA or corresponding regulations that prohibit Petitioner from submitting new evidence in support of her exceptions. Even were there some regulatory limitation in that regard, Petitioner claims that the Associate Deputy Commissioner in fact exercised his discretion to consider this evidence, made apparent by his statement in the Final Order that he \u201ccarefully evaluated the documentary record in this case, [and] the Exceptions filed by [Petitioner].\u201d <em>See supra </em>pages 7-8. Accordingly, Petitioner asserts that the Associate Deputy Commissioner\u2019s Final Order is erroneous, unsupported by substantial evidence in the record, and arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Respondent disputes Petitioner\u2019s contention that new evidence introduced by way of her exceptions was a part of the administrative record before the MIA, arguing that exceptions are confined to a <em>review </em>of the record that was compiled by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>the ALJ. (Emphasis added). Citing COMAR 31.02.02.12(B), <em>see supra </em>pages 15-16, Respondent observes that \u201c[i]n reviewing the administrative law judge\u2019s proposed decision, the Commissioner is <em>bound </em>by the findings of fact that are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added by Respondent). Respondent extrapolates from this regulation the notion that \u201cthe Commissioner is confined to the factual record that was before the administrative law judge.\u201d Noting that the administrative record was \u201cvoid\u201d of any evidence from which a factual conclusion could be reached that Petitioner had administrative standing, Respondent contends the MIA\u2019s final decision should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">We commented earlier, to some extent, on judicial review of a final decision or order of an administrative agency. <em>See supra </em>pages 16-18. We summarize the relevant principles here as they undergird our analysis in this matter. Aggrieved by the final decision of the MIA, Petitioner was entitled to seek judicial review of the decision as provided in APA \u00a7 10-222(a)(1). As often stated, in reviewing an agency\u2019s decision under the APA, a court ordinarily is \u201cconfined to the record\u201d made before the administrative agency. APA \u00a7 10 \u2014 222(f)(1). <em>See Coleman v. Anne Arundel County Police Dep\u2019t, </em>369 Md. 108, 121, 797 A.2d 770, 778 (2002) (explaining that judicial review is \u201c \u2018limited to determining if there is substantial evidence\u2019 in the administrative record as a whole \u2018to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Dep\u2019t of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Campbell, </em>364 Md. 108, 123, 771 A.2d 1051, 1060 (2001) (noting that a reviewing court is restricted to the record made before the administrative agency). <em>See also supra </em>page 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">A reviewing court may remand the case for further proceedings, affirm the final decision, or reverse or modify an administrative agency\u2019s decision if \u201cany substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision\u201d is, <em>inter alia, </em>erroneous, \u201cunsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence <em>in light of the entire record </em>as submitted,\u201d or \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d APA \u00a7 10-222(h). (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>The initial question we confront is when does the administrative record close for the receipt of evidence in a contested case under the APA where the administrative agency reserves final decision-making authority? We hold that, for purposes of judicial review of an agency\u2019s final decision, the entire administrative record consists of all transcripts, documents, information, and materials<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> that were before the final decision maker at the time of his or her decision. We base our conclusion on the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">First, it is the function of the court on judicial review of an agency\u2019s action to review the \u201cfinal decision\u201d in a contested case. APA \u00a7 10-222(a)(l). Where, as here, the administrative agency retained the authority to make the final decision, we review the final decision of the agency, and not the ALJ\u2019s recommended decision. It follows, then, that the \u201centire\u201d administrative record consists of all materials and information the agency had before it at the time it reached its final decision. This notion is consistent with the principle that an \u201cadministrative agency has broad discretion to consider evidence submitted after the close of an evidentiary hearing as long as there is compliance with procedural due process.\u201d <em>Zeigler, </em>330 Md. at 557, 625 A.2d at 922 (citing <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 7-10, 432 A.2d 1319, 1323-24 (1981) (documentary evidence submitted to the agency several days after the hearing but before the agency\u2019s decision); <em>Montgomery County v. Nat\u2019l Capital Realty, </em>267 Md. 364, 375-76, 297 A.2d 675, 681-82 (1972) (documentary evidence submitted to and considered by the zoning body after the hearing); and other cases cited therein). An agency\u2019s ability to consider post-hearing evidence necessarily contemplates that such evidence becomes a part of the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Second, as part of the administrative process the APA (and complementary regulations) provide a party with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u201clast chance\u201d opportunity to persuade the agency that an ALJ\u2019s proposed decision should be \u201caffirmed, reversed, or remanded.\u201d APA \u00a7 10 \u2014 216(a)(1). In this regard, a party aggrieved by the ALJ\u2019s recommended decision may file exceptions. <em>See </em>APA \u00a7 10-216, <em>see supra </em>pages 14-15; COMAR 31.02.02.10A, <em>see supra </em>note 21. <em>See also </em>COMAR 28.02.01.22B(2).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, under APA \u00a7 10-218(9), exceptions are deemed a part of the record that is before the agency in making its final determination. As Petitioner correctly points out, there is nothing in the statute<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> or corresponding regulations that would preclude a party from offering new evidence in support of the party\u2019s exceptions, subject to satisfaction of due process consideration before such evidence may be admitted. Respondent offers no cases, and we are aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>of none that have construed so narrowly these provisions. Indeed, it would appear that filing exceptions is the only appropriate method for a party to present post-hearing evidence for an agency\u2019s possible consideration. <em>Zeigler, </em>330 Md. at 557, 625 A.2d at 922, and cases cited therein. We merely recognize that written exceptions are a part of the administrative process, and therefore, evidence offered in exceptions may become, unless properly rejected by the agency, a part of the administrative record, subject to the final administrative decision maker\u2019s ruling on whether to admit and consider such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the Court of Special Appeals erroneously concluded that a reviewing court \u201ccannot go outside the record <em>compiled by the ALJ.\u201d </em>For similar reasons, we hold that the Circuit Court likewise erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">We turn now to Petitioner\u2019s assertion that the final agency decision is erroneous, not supported by substantial evidence, and arbitrary or capricious because the Associate Deputy Commissioner, having exercised his discretion to consider the evidence of Petitioner\u2019s bankruptcy dismissal, nonetheless adopted the ALJ\u2019s Recommended Decision to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s complaint for lack of standing. We are unable at this time to resolve this question. The difficulty which forestalls our resolution is that the Associate Deputy Commissioner failed to address with sufficient clarity whether he considered the new evidence presented in Petitioner\u2019s exceptions, and, if he did consider it, failed to provide a rationale for his findings and conclusions, consistent with that evidence, upon which we may conduct meaningful judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">It is well established by this Court that administrative agencies must comport with the applicable statutory requirement to make meaningful findings of fact and conclusions of law when rendering final decisions. <em>See Forman v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>332 Md. 201, 220, 630 A.2d 753, 763 (1993) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>(concluding the findings requirement<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> of the Transportation Article and the APA were not satisfied); <em>Harford County v. Earl E. Preston, Jr., Inc., </em>322 Md. 493, 505, 588 A.2d 772, 778 (1991) (concluding the agency violated the findings requirement of the Harford County Zoning Code); <em>United Steelworkers v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>298 Md. 665, 678-79, 472 A.2d 62, 69 (1984) (concluding the findings requirement of the Maryland Occupational Safety &amp; Health Act (MOSHA) was not satisfied). Even in the absence of statutory authority, meaningful findings are required to facilitate judicial review. <em>See Blackburn v. Bd. of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs, </em>130 Md.App. 614, 624, 747 A.2d 725, 730 (2000) (requiring the Board of Liquor License Commissioners to set forth specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, even in the absence of an express requirement to do so). <em>See also Baker v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>269 Md. 740, 747, 309 A.2d 768, 772 (1973) (stating in dictum that \u201ceven in the absence of a statutory provision,\u201d the right of a party to be apprised of the facts relied upon by an agency in making its decision \u201cis frequently required by a court as an aid to judicial review\u201d) (citing 2 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 16.05 444-49 (1958)). For those agencies subject to the APA, as is the MIA in the instant case, that requirement is embodied in APA \u00a7 10-221(b) (requiring a final decision or order in a contested case to \u201ccontain separate statements of: (i) the findings of fact; (ii) the conclusions of law; and (iii) the order.\u201d). <em>See supra </em>page 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">The objective of these statutory requirements is two-fold in that it seeks to apprise the parties of the basis for the agency\u2019s decision and to facilitate judicial review. <em>See For-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>man, </em>332 Md. at 220, 630 A.2d at 763 (\u201cThe purpose and effect of these [statutory] sections is to provide the parties and, ultimately, a reviewing court, with the ability to understand the basis for the [final decision maker\u2019s] decision.\u201d); <em>Preston, </em>322 Md. at 505, 588 A.2d at 778 (\u201cThis [statutory] requirement is in recognition of fundamental right of a party to a proceeding before an administrative agency to be apprised of the facts relied upon by the agency in reaching its decision and to permit meaningful judicial review of those findings.\u201d); <em>United Steelworkers, </em>298 Md. at 679, 472 A.2d at 69 (\u201cWe must know what a decision means before the duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or wrong.\u201d) (citation omitted) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Blue Bird Cab Co. v.

Malakoff, </em>273 Md. 214, 229, 329 A.2d 8, 17 (1974)). We recently explained that \u201c[fjindings of fact must be meaningful and cannot simply repeat statutory criteria, broad conclusory statements, or boilerplate resolutions.\u201d <em>Bucktail v. Talbot County, </em>352 Md. 530, 553, 723 A.2d 440, 451 (1999). <em>See also Turner v. Hammond, </em>270 Md. 41, 55-56, 310 A.2d 543, 551 (1973) (referencing a preprinted form filled out by the local board of zoning appeals to deny an application for a special use exception, we noted that there were \u201cno findings of fact worthy of the name and we think citizens are entitled to something more than a boiler-plate resolution\u201d). This is compelled by the nature of judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s final decision. In <em>United Steelworkers, </em>298 Md. at 679, 472 A.2d at 69, this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Judicial review of administrative action differs from appellate review of a trial court judgment. In the latter context the appellate court will search the record for evidence to support the judgment and will sustain the judgment for a reason plainly appearing on the record whether or not the reason was expressly relied upon by the trial court. However, in judicial review of an agency action the court may not uphold the agency order unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">More recently, we explained in <em>Forman, </em>832 Md. at 220-21, 630 A.2d at 763-64:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">In order to apply the appropriate standard of review ... the reviewing court first must know how and why the agency reached its decision. It must know what it is reviewing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">Without findings of fact on all material issues, and without a clear statement of the rationale behind the [final decision maker\u2019s] action, a reviewing court cannot properly perform its function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">At a minimum, one must be able to discern from the record the facts found, the law applied, and the relationship between the two.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">As a threshold matter in the present case, it is unclear whether the Associate Deputy Commissioner indeed considered the new evidence in Petitioner\u2019s exceptions. The exceptions were the subject of a motion to strike, based in part on the alleged lack of diligence on Petitioner\u2019s part generally and as to the production of the new evidence particularly. No ruling on the motion to strike was made. Although language in the Final Order recites that the exceptions were \u201ccarefully considered,\u201d an inference that the new evidence contained there was admitted and considered is beggared by the resultant dismissal grounded on the premise that the pendency of the bankruptcy petition on 26 April 1999, the date the ALJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>decision was filed, deprived Petitioner of standing to maintain the administrative complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>th\u00e9 correctness of the legal conclusion that a bankruptcy trustee alone has standing to pursue a claim on behalf of a bankrupt estate, Petitioner\u2019s argument and evidence in her exceptions that the ALJ\u2019s finding \u201cwas no longer applicable,\u201d if the new evidence was admitted and considered, would have created a material dispute that merited a clearer resolution by the Associate Deputy Commissioner. As previously explained, the ALJ was not informed that Petitioner\u2019s bankruptcy case had been dismissed prior to issuance of his proposed decision. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s \u201cdetailed\u201d findings of fact and \u201cwell-thought out\u201d discussion concerning the rationale for his proposed decision arguably was contrary to evidence that was subsequently provided to the Associate Deputy Commissioner in Petitioner\u2019s Exceptions.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>pages 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Clearly, the Final Order falls far short of comporting with the statutory requirements of the APA, <em>see supra </em>page 16, and of providing adequate factual findings and a clear statement of the rationale for the agency\u2019s conclusions so as to permit \u201cmeaningful\u201d judicial review. Instead, we are left to speculate or guess at a basis for the Associate Deputy Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The Associate Deputy Commissioner failed to \u201cresolve all significant conflicts\u201d or make \u201cfull, complete and detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law\u201d from which we may perform properly our function. <em>Forman, </em>332 Md. at 221, 630 A.2d at 764. Petitioner presented the MIA with a second opportunity to elaborate on the basis for its decision in her Motion for Reconsideration. Unfortunately, the Associate Deputy Commissioner was not up to the task in his response. Accordingly, the appropriate disposition of this case is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>remand to the MIA to prepare legally adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law based on the administrative record as a whole, with a cautioning note that if evidence of the termination of Petitioner\u2019s bankruptcy is admitted into evidence, it may be appropriate for the MIA to remand this matter to the ALJ for his consideration.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE MARYLAND INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

Petitioner\u2019s wrongful termination complaint against Respondent brought her claim within the purview of the MIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b237-11\">. Specifically, Petitioner alleged that Respondent discriminated against her in terminating her contract as a Nationwide agent. Insurance Art., \u00a7 27-503(d), provides that \"an insurer may not cancel or amend a written agreement with an agent or broker or refuse to accept business from the agent or broker if the cancellation, amendment, or refusal is arbitrary, capricious, unfair, or discriminatory.\u201d As relief, Petitioner sought, <em>inter alia, </em>reinstatement of her agency contract and restitution including lost commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">An \"agent\u201d is defined as \"a person that, for compensation, solicits, procures, negotiates, or makes insurance contracts ... or the renewal or continuance of these insurance contracts for persons issuing the insurance contracts.\u201d Insurance Art., \u00a7 1 \u2014 101(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b238-10\">.

The MIA, in the Circuit Court, adopted the position of Respondent, adding further that the \"purpose and goal of exceptions is to review the Administrative Law Judge's proposed decision.... It is not a de novo hearing where a litigant, who fails to provide evidence before the Administrative Law Judge, can simply submit it anew.\u201d The MIA, however, has not offered overt support of Respondent in the proceeding before this Court, so we do not respond here to the MIA\u2019s argument below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\">.
