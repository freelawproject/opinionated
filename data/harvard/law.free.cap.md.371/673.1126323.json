Rule 16-709.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petition, which is based on the complaint of Mr. Phillip A. Lobo, alleges that respondent violated several Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> two provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and several sections of Title 16 of the Maryland Rules.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>On November 5, 2001, pursuant to Md. Rules 16-709(b) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>16-711(a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this Court assigned the matter to a judge in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. On January 16, 2002, this Court granted respondent\u2019s motion to transfer the case to the Circuit Court for Frederick County and assigned Judge Julie R. Stevenson to conduct an evidentiary hearing and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to respondent\u2019s case. Respondent was duly served and he filed a timely answer to the petition. The evidentiary hearing took place on March 26 and 27, 2002. Judge Stevenson heard testimony from three witnesses of the petitioner, including: Sterling Fletcher, petitioner\u2019s investigator, Laurence Johnson, an expert in the area of immigration law and a member of the Maryland Bar and John DeBone, petitioner\u2019s paralegal. In addition to this testimony, petitioner read portions of the following into the record: respondent\u2019s testimony at the Inquiry Panel hearing held in this matter on February 28, 2001, respondent\u2019s testimony from petitioner\u2019s March 5, 2002 deposition of respondent and respondent\u2019s answers to petitioner\u2019s discovery requests. Petitioner\u2019s evidence also included a videotape of the deposition of the complainant, Phillip A. Lobo, which was admitted by the court, over respondent\u2019s objection, pursuant to Md. Rule 2-419(a)(3)(D).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After his motions for dismissal and a continuance were denied, respondent offered no witnesses or additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>After the hearing, Judge Stevenson found, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent willfully misappropriated funds and was in violation of Md. Rules 16-603, 16-604, 16-606, 16-607 and 16-609, Md.Code (1989, 2000 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 10-302, 306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, as well as MRPC 1.15(a) and (b), 1.4(a) and 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d). Respondent filed in this Court several exceptions to Judge Stevenson\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. We overrule these exceptions and accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Considering respondent\u2019s egregious conduct, the appropriate sanction is disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">We adopt the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact, but reorganize those facts to better suit the needs of this opinion. The facts are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">A. The Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">This disciplinary hearing was initiated by a complaint made by Phillip A. Lobo (hereinafter, \u201cMr.Lobo\u201d) arising out of respondent\u2019s handling of Mr. Lobo\u2019s $30,000, which was to be deposited into an escrow account in the course of the representation of Mr. Lobo in obtaining a visa to enter the United States from India. Mr. Lobo, a citizen of India, currently resides in Australia. In 1998, petitioner received a letter from Mr. Lobo\u2019s Australian counsel stating Mr. Lobo\u2019s claim that respondent failed to return his $30,000 that was to be deposited in an escrow account in March of 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">B. The Agreement/Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">In 1996, in addition to practicing law out of his Bethesda, Maryland office, respondent alleged that he also offered clients financial and investment advice. At that time, respondent had been taking referrals from a former client, Harbhag-wan S. Suri (hereinafter, \u201cMr.Suri\u201d), since 1995. Respondent represented Mr. Suri in Mr. Suri\u2019s effort to obtain a L-l Visa to enter the United States from India. Mr. Suri obtained this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>visa, but had returned to India by 1995. Mr. Suri placed ads in a Bombay, India newspaper soliciting businessmen interested in obtaining visas to enter the United States. In February of 1996, Mr. Lobo read such an ad and contacted Mr. Suri, who he did not know prior to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Mr. Lobo met with Mr. Suri and was told that Mr. Suri had a partner in the United States who could assist Mr. Lobo in obtaining a L-l Visa to enter the United States. He told Mr. Lobo that respondent was his partner and showed Mr. Lobo documents that corroborated his partnership with respondent. Mr. Suri then explained the visa process and its expenses to Mr. Lobo. Mr. Lobo understood that Mr. Suri would prepare and complete the necessary documents in India and then forward them to respondent so that respondent could file them with the appropriate agency. Mr. Lobo was told that the process would cost the equivalent of between $7,000 and $7,500. Mr. Lobo agreed to engage their services by initially paying Mr. Suri the equivalent of $8,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">During the preparation of the paperwork in India, Mr. Suri informed Mr. Lobo that Mr. Lobo\u2019s visa application could be expedited by placing $50,000 into an escrow account in the United States. He explained that this was necessary in order to convey Mr. Lobo\u2019s sincerity in regard to immigrating to the United States and would assist Mr. Lobo to commence operations for a United States subsidiary to his Indian company, Lobo Development. Although Mr. Lobo was initially disinclined to deposit this money, he eventually agreed to wire $30,000 to respondent with the understanding that it wouid be deposited into an escrow account. In late February of 1996, Mr. Lobo flew to Hong Kong and later wired $30,000 to respondent\u2019s personal bank account at Riggs National Bank on March 1, 1996. Mr. Suri gave respondent\u2019s account information to Mr. Lobo. Along with the money, Mr. Lobo sent respondent a letter and a photocopy of the transfer details via facsimile. This was the first direct communication between Mr. Lobo and respondent and it included, in addition to a request for written conformation and a copy of the escrow agreement from respondent, the language, \u201cIN CASE OF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>NON-PERFORMANCE ON PROJECT FUNDING AND OR INABILITY TO OBTAIN L-l VISA APPROVAL FOR ME, THIS DEPOSIT MAY BE CREDITED TO MY ACCOUNT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">On the same day, respondent sent a facsimile to Mr. Lobo in order to confirm respondent\u2019s receipt of Mr. Lobo\u2019s $30,000. The facsimile also included the escrow agreement, which was signed by both respondent and Mr. Suri. The letter was printed on respondent\u2019s letterhead. The escrow agreement states:</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">\n<em>\u201cESCROW AGREEMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">I, Edward Patrick Gallagher, Attorney-at-Law, do hereby agree to deposit and place in my legal escrow account at Riggs National Bank here in the Untied States the sum of US$30,000.00 (Thirty Thousand U.S. Dollars) as deposited by Mr. Phillip A. Lobo.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">This amount shall remain in my legal escrow account for the purpose for which it is deposited, namely as a good faith deposit for Master Host Inn and Howard Johnson-Richmond. In case of non-performance on project funding and or inability to obtain L-l Visa approval for Mr. Phillip A. Lobo, this deposit will be refunded to the depositor promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">This Escrow Agreement is jointly endorsed by Mr. Harbhagwan S. Suri, President, Intercontinental Business Services (USA), Inc. as well and the same guarantee of deposit refund will apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Edward Patrick Gallagher, Esquire Attorney-at-Law</p>\n<p id=\"AX0\">Harbhagwan S. Suri, President Intercontinental Business Services (USA). Maryland, USA</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">Escrow Account:</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">RIGGS NATIONAL BANK Account No. 08-624-773 (ABA # 064000030) P.O. Box 1525 Washington, D.C. 20075 (USA) Telex: 197739 RIGGS UT</p>\n<p id=\"b875-17\"><em>Name of Depositor: </em>Mr. Phillip A. Lobo</p>\n<p id=\"b875-19\">Phillip A.

The stamp impression of the Intercontinental Business Services (USA), Inc. seal is under Mr. Suri\u2019s signature. The other lines were left blank for Mr. Lobo to sign and date. Respondent admits to preparing and signing this escrow agreement and the attached letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Mr. Lobo testified that he then returned to India from Hong Kong on March 9,1996 and met with Mr. Suri, who then assisted Mr. Lobo in gathering information pertaining to Mr. Lobo\u2019s application for a L-l Visa. When Mr. Lobo\u2019s L-l Visa petition was completed, respondent sent it to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) on April 11, 1996. The petition was approved by the INS subject to the United States Consulate\u2019s approval of Mr. Lobo\u2019s petition. The INS instructed Mr. Lobo to complete an interview at the United States Consulate in Bombay, India. The United States Consulate in Bombay denied Mr. Lobo\u2019s petition, stating that it needed \u201cadministrative processing.\u201d At respondent\u2019s hearing, testimony by petitioner\u2019s expert explained that this likely meant that Mr. Lobo\u2019s petition did not comply with the provision of the law or regulations, although submission of further documents would warrant further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">In August of 1996, five months after he began the process, Mr. Lobo had yet to receive the L-l Visa. He subsequently abandoned the matter and immigrated to Australia without the assistance of respondent. Mr. Lobo testified that he then requested the return of his $30,000 from respondent via Mr. Suri. After not receiving the money, Mr. Lobo directly contacted respondent by sending him a letter via facsimile on January 23, 1997 requesting the return of his $30,000. Mr. Lobo received no response. On July 22,1997, Mr. Lobo faxed another letter to respondent, again requesting the refund of his $30,000. Respondent responded in a facsimile dated July 25, 1997. Respondent\u2019s reply to Mr. Lobo\u2019s July 22 nd letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-5\">\u201cReference your fax, please note that your checking account here in the United States was closed as per instructions of your agent and partner, Mr. H. Suri, on July 11, 1997 and distributed to him. He has in his possession \u2018all\u2019 records of this account and you can obtain them through him at his office in Bombay. For your information, he has departed this date from the United States and should be in Bombay sometime next week.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Mr. Lobo testified that he has not received any part of the $30,000 wired to respondent from either respondent or Mr. Suri.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">At the Inquiry Panel in this matter, respondent produced a document, dated February 28, 1997, purporting to be a copy of a letter from him to Mr. Lobo in response to Mr. Lobo\u2019s January 23, 1996 letter. However, Mr. Sterling Fletcher, the petitioner\u2019s investigator, doubted the authenticity of the letter. Mr. Fletcher\u2019s doubt stemmed from the address on respondent\u2019s letterhead; it was stated as 111 North Berwick, Williamsburg, Virginia 23188, although respondent did not move to that address until March of 1998. In addition, there was no mention of this February letter in respondent\u2019s July 25, 1996 letter to Mr. Lobo.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">C. The Money</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Petitioner, through the work of its employee, John DeBone, conducted an investigation of respondent\u2019s bank accounts at Riggs National Bank. The account into which Mr. Lobo wired $30,000 on March 1, 1996 was not an escrow account, but a personal account entitled \u201cEdward Patrick Gallagher, Attorney-At-Law\u201d (hereinafter, \u201cAttorney Account\u201d). Mr. De-Bone\u2019s review of this Attorney Account\u2019s transactions showed that the account was primarily used by respondent for business and personal expenses, and thus was not an escrow account, and that its balance before Mr. Lobo\u2019s March 1, 1996 wire of $30,000 was approximately $1,200. On March 4, 1996, prior to the opening of an escrow account, two disbursements of $3,180 were made from the Attorney Account and wired to an account in England.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">An escrow account for Mr. Lobo was created on March 4, 1996 and was entitled, \u201cEdward Patrick Gallagher, Esquire, Escrow for Phillip Lobo\u201d (hereinafter, \u201cEscrow Account\u201d). However, the account was not opened with the entire $30,000 that Mr. Lobo had agreed to when he wired it to respondent. Mr. DeBone testified, and respondent\u2019s bank records indicate, that the account was opened with only $23,570. Respondent and his wife, Joann N. Gallagher, were signers on this account, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>which was an interest bearing money market checking account. A wire transfer of $549.75 was made from the Escrow Account to a bank in England on March 12, 1996. Over the next six months, five checks cleared from the account, which brought the Escrow Account\u2019s balance to less than $600. All five checks were made payable to respondent, with the first check being signed by Mrs. Gallagher. The four other checks were signed by respondent. On February 18, 1997, check number 109, for $505, had drained the account to approximately $50. By July 11,1997, when respondent closed the account, the Escrow Account had a balance of $22.37, which included seven service charge deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The hearing court found that there was no credible explanation for the disbursement of the $30,000 that Mr. Lobo wired to respondent on March 1, 1996 and that these disbursements were \u201cclearly inconsistent\u201d with the Escrow Agreement, which respondent had signed. The hearing court highlighted the fact that respondent claimed, that between March 1st and 3rd of 1996, he received one or more calls from Mr. Suri and that Mr. Suri indicated that Mr. Lobo was present and wished to disburse funds from the Escrow Account. Although respondent claims that a voice in the background of Mr. Suri\u2019s office was Mr. Lobo, respondent could not have known Mr. Lobo\u2019s voice because they had never met. In addition, Mr. Lobo testified that he did not return to Bombay until March 9, 1996 and respondent knew that Mr. Lobo was in Hong Kong at that time because that is the location from which Mr. Lobo wired the $30,000 to respondent. Furthermore, Judge Stevenson found that respondent\u2019s testimony concerning these calls was not consistent with his prior representations. During petitioner\u2019s investigation in May 1999, respondent told Mr. Fletcher the following: that respondent had lost all of his documentation in Mr. Lobo\u2019s file due to a recent move and that respondent had communicated with Mr. Lobo only once at the beginning of his representation of Mr. Lobo. Respondent\u2019s answer to petitioner\u2019s interrogatories similarly stated that he only spoke to Mr. Lobo once via telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Respondent admitted to his representation of Mr. Lobo and to the receipt of the $30,000 in question, yet he denied that the money was to be held in an escrow account. He explained that his departure from the terms of the escrow agreement was due to telephone conversations between respondent and Mr. Suri. Respondent claims that Mr. Suri and Mr. Lobo were partners and business associates and that Mr. Suri was authorized to speak for Mr. Lobo. Respondent claims that he disbursed the funds in the Escrow Account according to Mr. Surfs instructions. Respondent admitted that he was never shown any writing that imposed an agency relationship between Mr. Suri and Mr. Lobo and respondent did not produce any evidence to corroborate these claims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">The hearing court specifically found that respondent\u2019s explanation of why he dishonored the escrow agreement between himself and Mr. Lobo was not supported by the facts. After citing to the fact that respondent could not corroborate his claims of a prior business relationship between Mr. Suri and Mr. Lobo, the hearing court found there to be sufficient evidence to illustrate that Mr. Suri and respondent were, in fact, business associates. First, Mr. Lobo testified to the Suri-respondent relationship. Although respondent denied any relationship with Mr. Suri, the State of Maryland Personal Property Tax Return for International Business Services (USA), Inc. (hereinafter \u201cIBS\u201d), which was prepared by respondent and his wife, indicated that respondent, his wife, and Mr. Suri were the officers of IBS. Respondent also had signature authority for an IBS bank account, his 1996 office address was the same address as IBS\u2019s letterhead, he received money from IBS and he paid the rent for IBS from his own personal account. In addition, a business letter from respondent\u2019s wife to Mr. Lobo identified Mr. Suri as her agent in Bombay.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The court found respondent\u2019s actions to be contrary to \u201can honest belief that Lobo knew about or had authorized the disbursements from the account, facts which Lobo denied.\u201d After Mr. Lobo formally requested a refund of the entire $30,000, respondent made yet another withdrawal of $505 to himself without questioning or attempting to verify his understanding that Mr. Suri had the authority to disburse the funds. Respondent never questioned why Mr. Lobo was demanding a refund for the entire amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Additionally, the hearing court found, contrary to respondent\u2019s assertion, that Mr. Suri\u2019s accounting of the money does not corroborate respondent\u2019s version of the disbursements. In letters purportedly written by Mr. Suri, Mr. Suri believed that the entire balance of $30,000 was intact as of May 26, 1996. However, by that time, respondent had disbursed approximately $26,000 of those funds. In addition, Mr. Suri\u2019s accounting does not mention a $10,000 check written to respondent in May of 1996. Respondent claims that Mr. Suri told respondent to give the disbursement to a Mr. Bagar\u00eda, a Bombay businessman in the United States, as authorized by Mr. Lobo. However, Mr. Suri\u2019s accounting has no record of the disbursement and Mr. Lobo denies knowing Mr. Bagar\u00eda. No evidence showed any relation between Mr. Lobo and Mr. Bagar\u00eda, but it did reveal that respondent and Mr. Bagar\u00eda had a prior business relationship, as respondent had set up a corporation for Mr. Bagar\u00eda on November 9, 1995. Finally, Mr. Suri\u2019s accounting of the Escrow Account identifies that approximately $6,250 was returned to Mr. Lobo, while respondent\u2019s accounting indicates that only $22.37 was returned. Mr. Lobo denies receiving any money and the bank records show no transfers from the Escrow Account to Mr. Suri or Mr. Lobo.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">While Mr. Lobo testified that his original payment to Mr. Suri was to cover all fees for the visa process, respondent stated that he took money from the account for fees relating to his representation of Mr. Lobo. The court found that even if respondent was entitled to any fee, then the approximate $6,300 in legal fees still does not account for the absence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>remaining money, totaling approximately $23,700, still owed to Mr. Lobo.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">The hearing court found that the initial wire transfers of money to England, taken from Mr. Lobo\u2019s original $30,000 wire transfer, were not made to further Mr. Lobo\u2019s business interests, but rather to further the interests of respondent and IBS.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At his deposition, respondent indicated that these wire transfers were used to pay \u201ccommitment/application fees to Anglo American Ventures, Ltd.,\u201d in an effort to obtain large scale financing from that overseas institution. Mr. Lobo denies any dealings with Anglo American at this time. In fact, the evidence reveals that IBS had actually been attempting to procure financing for the purchase of Master Host Inn and Howard Johnson-Richmond prior to respondent\u2019s contact with Mr. Lobo. Respondent admits that he and his wife were attempting to obtain this financing in 1995 and 1996. In August of 1996, after Mr Lobo had moved to Australia and abandoned his attempt to obtain a L-l Visa to come to the United States, IBS and Mr. Suri were still attempting to buy and renovate the Master Host Inn.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">D. The Visa Process</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The hearing court qualified petitioner\u2019s witness, Laurence Johnson, as an expert on immigration matters. Mr. Johnson testified that obtaining a L-l Visa requires <em>both </em>the approval of the petition by the INS <em>and </em>the approval of the United States Consulate in the foreign country. Thus, the hearing court found that respondent had not procured a L-l Visa for Mr. Lobo and respondent\u2019s repeated statements to the effect that he had obtained approval of the L-l Visa for Lobo misstated the facts and the law. In fact, Mr. Johnson specifically refuted respondent\u2019s assertion made in a letter to Mr. Lobo, that the United States Consulate\u2019s role in the visa process was merely a rubber stamp.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Respondent\u2019s testimony that Mr. Lobo\u2019s testimony is not credible because he was denied entry into the United States through a L-l Visa was also refuted by Mr. Johnson\u2019s testimony. Mr. Johnson testified that one cannot make a negative inference concerning Mr. Lobo\u2019s character merely from the fact that the United States Consulate denied Mr. Lobo\u2019s L-l Visa petition. Specifically, Mr. Johnson testified that Mr. Lobo\u2019s L-l Visa petition, that had been denied by the United States Consulate in Bombay, India, had no notation referring to fraud, as is the usual practice when a petition is denied because of applicant fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">E. Additional Misappropriation</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Petitioner offered evidence, and the hearing court found, that respondent had misappropriated funds of another trust account and that the funds in question within the Escrow Account for Mr. Lobo were not the only funds that respondent used for an unauthorized purpose. On February 26, 1997, respondent received a check from Jatin Damani for $26,000. Respondent testified that these funds were to be held in trust for the client until they were returned on August 7,1997. The bank records indicate that these funds were not held in trust after the funds were deposited on April 3, 1997. On July 18, 1997, the balance of the trust account was under $5,000. Although respondent did refund the $26,000, he was only able to do so because $25,000 was deposited to the account in late July of 1997. Those funds came from respondent\u2019s and his wife\u2019s other accounts, including \u201ctwo checks totaling $10,000 which bear a signature appearing to be the same as the signature on the Escrow Agreement and letters purporting to be from Suri.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">We hold that there was clear and convincing evidence in the record to support the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact and that those findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">F. The Hearing Judge\u2019s Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">The hearing judge subsequently concluded, based on the findings of fact proven by clear and convincing evidence, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>respondent violated several Maryland Rules. The court concluded the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-4\">\u201cThat on March 1, 1996, the Respondent falsely represented to Lobo that he would hold Lobo\u2019s $30,000 in a legal escrow account subject to his being able to obtain an L-l Visa for Lobo and/or project funding for Master Host Inn and Howard Johnson-Richmond, that Lobo, in reliance on the Respondent\u2019s representation, transferred $30,000 to the Respondent\u2019s bank account, that Lobo did not receive an L-1 Visa, that the funding for the purchase of the hotels was never obtained and, in fact, Respondent made a claim for the return of the fees paid to Anglo American;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-5\">\u201cThat, contrary to the written agreement, Respondent disbursed the funds to Anglo American and himself in breach of his fiduciary duty to Lobo. Respondent\u2019s representations to Petitioner during the investigation of Lobo\u2019s complaint that he was authorized to disburse these funds in a manner inconsistent with the written agreement is not credible in light of the facts that he, his wife and Suri through IBS were attempting to obtain funding to purchase the two properties in question, that the funding was never received, and that Suri\u2019s letters to the Petitioner demonstrate that he was not aware of the manner in which the funds were disbursed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-6\">\u201cThat the Respondent disbursed all funds from the account, except the funds sent to Anglo American, to himself, and used the funds in a manner inconsistent with the escrow agreement and for purposes other than the purpose for which the funds were entrusted thereby misappropriating the funds in violation of Maryland Rule 16-609; that this conduct was willful and not the result of mistake or negligence and the Respondent knew that he was using the funds in a manner inconsistent with the Escrow Agreement in violation of Maryland Code Annotated Business Occupations and Professions Article \u00a7 10-306. <em>See, Attorney Grievance Commission v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 671 A.2d 463 (1996) and 10-606;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>\u201cThat the Respondent also misappropriated funds he obtained from a client identified as Jatin Damani/Pratik Investments on February 26, 1997 and, on or about August 7, 1997, repaid that client from funds received from other sources. These funds were also deposited to the attorney-at-law account and not to a properly designated trust account and commingled with personal funds of the Respondent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-4\">\u201cThat the Respondent did not maintain a properly designated account in compliance with Rule of Professional Conduct (MRPC) 1.15, Title 16 Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules and Maryland Code Annotated Business Occupations and Professions Art. \u00a7 10-302 since the account into which the Lobo funds were deposited was titled Edward Patrick Gallagher, Attorney-at-Law and was not in compliance with Rule 16-606 in that the checks and deposit tickets for the account did not bear the appropriate designation: \u2018Attorney Trust Account\u2019, \u2018Attorney Escrow Account\u2019, or \u2018Clients\u2019 Funds Account:[,]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-5\">\u201cThat the Respondent commingled client funds with his personal funds in the attorney-at-law account on at least two occasions in 1996 and 1997 in violation of MRPC 1.15(a) and Maryland Rule 16-607;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-6\">\u201cThat the Respondent did not maintain records for the Lobo funds and failed to provide Lobo with an accounting for these funds upon request in violation of MRPC 1.15(b);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-7\">\u201cThat the Respondent received and accepted funds as an attorney intended in whole or in part to benefit a client or third person in which he did not maintain a properly designated attorney trust account in compliance with Maryland Rule 16-603;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-8\">\u201cThat the Respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-604 which provides that all funds received and accepted by an attorney in this state from a client or third person to be delivered in whole or part to a client or third person, unless received as payment of fees owed to the attorney by the client or in reimbursement for expenses ... shall be deposited to an attorney trust account, since the $30,000 received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>on March 1, 1996 by the Respondent and the $26,000 received by the Respondent on February 26, 1997 were not received as payment of fees or expenses owed to the Respondent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-4\">\u201cThat the Respondent failed to keep Lobo reasonably informed about the status of the representation and the handling of the $30,000 in violation of MRPC 1.4(a);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-5\">\u201cThat the Respondent also violated MRPC 8.4(a) by violating the Rules of Professional Conduct:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-6\">\u201cThat the Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(b) in that the misappropriation of clients\u2019 funds constitutes criminal conduct which adversely reflects on his fitness to practice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-7\">\u201cThat the Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(c) in that his misappropriation of client funds and misrepresentations to Lobo that the funds would be held in a legal escrow account and returned pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and misrepresentations to Lobo and Petitioner that he had been successful in obtaining an L-l Visa for Lobo and authorized to disburse Lobo\u2019s funds constitutes conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-8\">\u201cThat the Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(d) by engaging in the conduct described above which constitutes conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d [Footnotes omitted.] [Alteration added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">On August 2, 2002, respondent filed in this Court several exceptions to Judge Stevenson\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.

In these proceedings, respondent represented himself <em>pro se. </em>When enumerating his exceptions, respondent did not clearly express whether he was excepting to Judge Stevenson\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. He also repeated many of his exceptions in each section of his written submission to this Court. As such, this Court gives its own labels to respondent\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">B. Respondent\u2019s Factual Exceptions:</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">In discussing respondent\u2019s factual exceptions, this Court has combined several of respondent\u2019s points in the interest of judicial economy and because many of respondent\u2019s exceptions are muddled, thus some can better be incorporated into other exceptions. Respondent makes three discernable exceptions in regard to the hearing court\u2019s assessment of the facts. First, respondent excepts to petitioner\u2019s investigatory methods, as he claims that they failed to properly investigate Mr. Lobo. Next, respondent\u2019s main factual exception pertains to the hearing court\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the complainant, Mr. Lobo. Respondent claims that several factors supposedly affect Mr. Lobo\u2019s credibility and that the hearing court did not properly evaluate any of these factors. Finally, respondent excepts to the hearing court\u2019s finding that an escrow agreement between respondent and Mr. Lobo existed. Each of respondent\u2019s factual exceptions are refuted by sufficient factual bases and strong evidentiary support, as found by the hearing judge. Thus, these exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Respondent\u2019s claims that Mr. Lobo\u2019s credibility was not investigated by petitioner and assessed properly by the hearing judge find no support in the record. Petitioner undertook an exhaustive, four-year investigation that included depositions, interrogatories, requests for admissions, an extensive financial investigation, which subsequently unveiled a violation unrelated to Mr. Lobo\u2019s complaint, and culminated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>presentation of sufficient evidence of respondent\u2019s multiple violations of the Maryland Rules. Respondent\u2019s main contention with petitioner\u2019s investigation was that petitioner did not \u201cconduct an investigation of Mr. Phillip A. Lobo, the Complainant, and his credibility.\u201d Respondent requested that petitioner provide financial documents, and the like, so that respondent could impeach the answers Mr. Lobo provided to respondent\u2019s questions during Mr. Lobo\u2019s deposition. In other words, respondent requested that petitioner, after it satisfied its own burden of proof, should have additionally explored every lead that could possibly assist respondent\u2019s defense. That is the purpose of defense counsel. Petitioner is not responsible for respondent\u2019s inability to investigate possible defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Despite respondent\u2019s exception and the fact that respondent\u2019s conduct, not Mr. Lobo\u2019s, is the focus of this disciplinary proceeding, the record shows that Judge Stevenson did take Mr. Lobo\u2019s credibility into account when making her assessment of the evidence before her. In a preliminary motion heard directly prior to the start of the March 26, 2002 hearing, Judge Stevenson heard arguments on respondent\u2019s request for petitioner to produce documents of a non-party witness, namely Mr. Lobo\u2019s financial records and other documents purported to be relevant to Mr. Lobo\u2019s credibility and the possible commission of fraud in India. In ruling on respondent\u2019s motion, Judge Stevenson said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXx\">\u201cI\u2019m going to deny the request for production of documents. I do note, however, the deposition has already been taken. I\u2019m accepting the representation that these issues regarding this documentation and the status were raised and certainly do raise credibility issues for the Court to assess in determining the truthfulness of the testimony that is being presented before this Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">During the hearing, petitioner presented expert testimony refuting respondent\u2019s contention that the United States Consulate\u2019s denial of Mr. Lobo\u2019s L-l Visa petition was due to credibility issues. In fact, Mr. Johnson stated that the Consulate denied the petition due to \u201cadministrative processing\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>did not note any fraud, as is the usual practice. The hearing judge also viewed the videotaped deposition of Mr. Lobo and was able to assess his answers, demeanor and credibility in answering both the petitioner\u2019s and respondent\u2019s questions. It is apparent that the hearing court had before it sufficient facts, including respondent\u2019s claims of fraud and denial of the visa, to assess Mr. Lobo\u2019s credibility. We have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiY\">\u201cThe hearing judge is in the best position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and to decide which one to believe and, as we have said, to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon. The judge was free to disregard the testimony of respondent if the judge believed the evidence was not credible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><em>Monfried, </em>368 Md. at 390, 794 A.2d at 101. Given this settled law and absent clear error, we see no reason to disturb the hearing judge\u2019s finding in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Lastly, respondent\u2019s exception to the hearing court\u2019s finding that there was an agreement between respondent and Mr. Lobo to secure Mr. Lobo\u2019s $30,000 in an attorney escrow account, is contrary to all the evidence except respondent\u2019s own, uncorroborated, testimony. Petitioner presented an escrow agreement between respondent, Mr. Suri and Mr. Lobo, which was signed and dated by respondent and Mr. Suri.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is of little consequence that the document was unsigned by Mr. Lobo. It was a document prepared by respondent to memorialize the agreement between the parties as to the escrow status of the $30,000 wired to respondent by Mr. Lobo. It was transmitted to Mr. Lobo after Lobo\u2019s money had been received by respondent. Petitioner sought to utilize the document as evidence against respondent, not against Mr. Lobo. In addition, as we have indicated, Mr. Lobo had already forwarded the $30,000 to respondent with a request to put the money into such an escrow account, thus respondent\u2019s reply to Mr. Lobo, including the escrow agreement signed by respondent and Mr. Suri, established the mutuality of intent for respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>dent to create an escrow account by respondent on behalf of Mr. Lobo. Respondent\u2019s subsequent creation of the account, named \u201cEdward Patrick Gallagher, Esquire, Escrow for Phillip Lobo,\u201d is additional evidence that an escrow agreement existed. <em>See Porter v. General Boiler Casing Co., Inc., </em>284 Md. 402, 396 A.2d 1090 (1979) (holding that a signature is not required in order to bring a contract into existence).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Respondent did not produce any evidence to corroborate his contention that Mr. Lobo orally altered the escrow agreement after the money was wired to respondent. In fact, as previously mentioned, petitioner produced several pieces of evidence to the contrary. There were no writings supporting this alleged alteration, Mr. Lobo denied such an oral alteration and respondent continued to drain Mr. Lobo\u2019s account even after Mr. Lobo formally requested the return of the entire $30,000. Additionally, Mr. Suri\u2019s accounting does riot correspond to that of respondent\u2019s, and a letter written by Mr. Suri shows that he did not know the method of dispersal of the funds, which specifically refutes respondent\u2019s claim that Mr. Suri was directing respondent on how to disburse the funds. With this evidence before it, the hearing court\u2019s finding of the existence of an escrow agreement was supported by sufficient evidence and was not clearly erroneous. This Court overrules this exception and accepts the hearing court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">C. Respondent\u2019s Legal Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"A2o\">1. Procedural Error</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Respondent excepts to the petitioner\u2019s Petition for Disciplinary Action and this Court\u2019s subsequent order, both of which were filed pursuant to Md. Rule 16-709. Respondent contends that the use of the \u201cnew Rules under Chapter 700 becoming effective on July 1, 2001 and replacing the Rules previously existing,\u201d was required. Respondent points to the fact that petitioner\u2019s petition was filed on November 1, 2001, after the July 1, 2001 effective date. Thus he claims that the petition, and any subsequent order by this Court, had no power because the rules used were no longer applicable. This contention has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>This disciplinary proceeding was initiated well before the newer rules became effective on July 1, 2001; respondent overlooks this fact.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Mr. Lobo\u2019s complaint was docketed after receipt of his letter by Bar Counsel during March of 1998. After a thorough investigation, the matter was forwarded to an Inquiry Panel. A hearing took place on July 25, 2000, at which respondent did not appear. Regardless of the fact that it found that respondent had adequate notice of that Inquiry Panel hearing, the Review Board, on December 13, 2000, remanded the matter to the Inquiry Panel for a new hearing on the merits in order to safeguard against any argument that respondent\u2019s due process rights were adversely affected. That hearing occurred on February 28, 2001 and the matter was subsequently forwarded to the Review Board to file charges. The fact that these procedures all occurred before July 1, 2001 illustrates that respondent\u2019s disciplinary proceeding had been docketed, investigated, submitted to the Inquiry Panel and forwarded to the Review Board well before the rules changing this procedure went into effect. This disciplinary proceeding was correctly in the system pursuant to the rules in place at that time. As a result, all orders, filings, hearings and decisions made after July 1, 2001, including the Review Board\u2019s July 11, 2001 direction for Bar Counsel to file charges, petitioner\u2019s November 1, 2001 Petition for Disciplinary Action, the March 2002 hearing before Judge Stevenson, Judge Stevenson\u2019s July 22, 2002 findings and this Court\u2019s orders and this decision, were all correctly submitted and processed, as required, under the Maryland Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">2. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Respondent argues that his due process rights were violated by not being able to cross-examine the complainant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Mr. Lobo, in a courtroom within the jurisdiction of Maryland: This exception has no merit. We hold that respondent received adequate notice for all hearings and proceedings associated with this matter. On March 6, 2002, respondent also participated in the video-conference and taping of Mr. Lobo\u2019s deposition. Respondent and petitioner were located in Maryland, while Mr. Lobo was located in Australia. In fact, respondent was able to conduct a broad cross examination of the witness at that time. The fact that Mr. Lobo, and other witnesses subpoenaed by respondent, were beyond the subpoena power of this State does not violate respondent\u2019s due process rights. Again, after a thorough review of the record, we hold that respondent received sufficient notice throughout this disciplinary proceeding, all decisions were proved by clear and convincing evidence<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the proceeding was fair and consistent with all of respondent\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">3. Admissibility of Deposition Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Respondent excepts to the hearing court\u2019s admission of Mr. Lobo\u2019s deposition testimony pursuant to Md. Rule 2-419(a)(3)(D).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We overrule this exception, as the deposition was properly admitted under Rule 2-419(a)(3)(D). That rule states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-6\">\u201cRule 2-419. Deposition \u2014 Use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-7\">(a) When may be used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-8\">(3) Witness not available or exceptional circumstances. The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose against any other party who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due notice thereof, if the court finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-4\">(D) that the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXC\">Respondent argues that the hearing court\u2019s admission of Mr. Lobo\u2019s videotaped deposition under Rule 2-419(a)(3)(D) was improper because \u201cMr. Lobo was available to come to the hearing but arbitrarily refused to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">In a very recent case, <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Snyder, </em>368 Md. 242, 793 A.2d 515 (2002), which concerned a different rule, Md. Rule 5-804(a), we addressed the unavailability of witnesses in the context of testimony taken at the inquiry panel stage. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-6\">\u201cAt the time of the hearing in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Royer no longer lived in Maryland and was not subject to subpoena. Furthermore, efforts by Bar Counsel to contact Royer by telephone and mail to procure his appearance at the hearing before Judge Woodward proved unsuccessful. Royer was absent at the hearing in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and his presence could not be procured by process. Thus, respondent\u2019s exception to the admission in evidence of Royer\u2019s inquiry panel testimony is overruled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265, 793 A.2d at 528. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">In overruling this exception in <em>Snyder, </em>we relied, in part, on our decision in <em>Bartell v. Bartell, </em>278 Md. 12, 357 A.2d 343 (1976), where we upheld a trial court\u2019s exclusion of a party\u2019s attempt to admit his own deposition testimony in a divorce/custody action. In that case, Mrs. Bartell filed a complaint against her husband, Dr. Bartell, who voluntarily left Maryland and took up residence in Alberta, Canada. Mrs. Bartell charged her husband with adultery and desertion and sought permanent alimony, alimony <em>pendente lite, </em>custody of their children, child support and attorney\u2019s fees. Dr. Bartell sought to admit his own deposition, taken in Canada, at trial. This Court upheld the deposition\u2019s exclusion saying that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\u201c[Dr. Bartell] and he alone who was responsible for his absence from the State and from the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24, 357 A.2d at 349. We also noted that Mrs. Bartell was powerless to compel her husband to testify at trial because \u201cthe subpoena powers of the State of Maryland stop at the state line.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 357 A.2d at 347. In this case, petitioner had no bearing on Mr. Lobo\u2019s absence from respondent\u2019s March 2002 hearing. Unlike Dr. Bartell, Mr. Lobo was never within the jurisdiction of this State and petitioner, the party seeking to admit Mr. Lobo\u2019s deposition, had no role in keeping Mr. Lobo beyond the reach of Maryland\u2019s subpoena power. Petitioner was \u201cunable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">In a case involving a predecessor to the rule at issue in the case <em>sub judice, Perlin Packing Co. v. Price, </em>247 Md. 475, 490, 231 A.2d 702, 711 (1967), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-5\">\u201cThere was no evidence that the absence from the state of the witness Jerry Price was procured by any connivance on the plaintiffs\u2019 part and we think the trial judge properly allowed its [a deposition] admission into evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">In the older case, <em>Wilmer v. Placide, </em>137 Md. 107, 109, 111 A. 822, 823 (1920), where we upheld the denial of admission of a deposition because evidence supporting its admissibility was lacking, we nonetheless said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-7\">\u201cWe do not find in the record any statement that the witness was dead, or proof of his inability to attend. In <em>Baltimore Consolidated Ry. Co. v. O\u2019Dea, </em>91 Md. 506, 46 A. 1000, this section (which was \u00a7 19 of the Code of 1888) was before the Court. Chief Judge McSherry on pages 512-513 said of it: \u2018Primarily the statute contemplates that the resident witness shall appear in person, but as contingencies might occur where this would not be possible, the Legislature provide by \u00a7 19 for the production of his testimony by deposition if the personal attendance of the witness could not be procured in a reasonable time. The deposition thus taken can only be used should the witness continue unable to be present.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>In <em>Kishter v. Seven Courts Community Association, Inc., </em>96 Md.App. 636, 626 A.2d 993 (1993), the Court of Special Appeals reversed a trial court\u2019s decision excluding deposition testimony where the witness was out-of-state pursuant to Md. Rule 2-419. In that case, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-4\">\u201cIn considering the draftsman\u2019s role, the trial court can and should consider the deposition testimony of the draftsman, if offered by appellants and if the draftsman is still located out-of-state. We note that at the initial trial appellants offered as an exhibit the transcript of a deposition of the draftsman, Richard Sokolov ... pursuant to Md. Rule 2-419. The deposition was taken in Ohio, where Sokolov lived and practiced. Counsel for the Association attended the deposition and cross-examined Sokolov. At the time of trial Sokolov was unavailable to appear as a witness. The trial court, however, refused to admit the Sokolov deposition. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-5\">\u201cUnder Md. Rule 2-419(a)(3), a deposition in lieu of live testimony is admissible when the deponent/witness is unavailable to testify at trial and the party against whom the deposition is being used was present at the deposition or at least had notice of it. <em>Skives v. Furst, 70 </em>Md.App. 328, 521 A.2d 332 (1987). In the present case the deponent/witness was outside of the State and therefore unavailable as a witness. The Association was present at the deposition and, in fact, availed itself of the opportunity to cross examine the deponent. Accordingly, the deposition should have been admitted into evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 643-44, 626 A.2d at 997. In an earlier case analyzing a predecessor rule to Md. Rule 2-419, which contained nearly identical language, the Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cLw]ithin the clear contemplation of the rule is the fairly routine situation wherein a witness has been deposed and is then, for some reason, unable to attend the trial.\u201d <em>Quecedo v. DeVries, </em>22 Md.App. 58, 62, 321 A.2d 785, 787, <em>cert. denied, </em>272 Md. 747 (1974). The facts in the case <em>sub judice </em>are essentially the same. Not only was Mr. Lobo out of the State of Maryland, he, as far as this Court can ascertain, was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>inside the United States and could not legally have been in the country during respondent\u2019s entire disciplinary proceeding because respondent had failed to procure a visa for him. Mr. Lobo failed to answer the respondent\u2019s subpoena to attend his March 26-27, 2002 hearing. Mr. Lobo has not been able to obtain a visa to enter the United States since 1996. Mr. Lobo was unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Similar to the Seven Courts Community Association in <em>Kishter, </em>respondent was present and able to cross examine the witness at the deposition.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, the hearing court was able to assess Mr. Lobo\u2019s physical demeanor and many other aspects of live testimony due to the fact that his deposition was videotaped. Respondent was able to cross examine Mr. Lobo and the hearing court was able to see Mr. Lobo\u2019s facial expressions, mannerisms and testimony via the videotaped deposition, and thus was able to assess Mr. Lobo\u2019s credibility. The videotaped deposition was correctly admitted into evidence pursuant to Md. Rule 2-419(a)(3)(D).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>4. Clear and Convincing Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">Respondent generally excepts to the hearing court\u2019s conclusions that petitioner presented evidence sufficient, by a clear and convincing evidence standard, to find respondent\u2019s conduct in violation of the charges set out in petitioner\u2019s petition. We recently reiterated the definition of clear and convincing evidence in <em>Harris, </em>366 Md. at 389, 784 A.2d at 523-24 (quoting <em>Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 79, 753 A.2d at 29), when we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-5\">\u201c \u2018The requirement of \u201cclear and convincing\u201d or \u201csatisfactory\u201d evidence does not call for \u201cunanswerable\u201d or \u201cconclusive\u201d evidence. The quality of proof, to be clear and convincing, has also been said to be somewhere between the rule in ordinary civil cases and the requirement of criminal procedure \u2014 that is, it must be more than a mere preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt. It has also been said that the term \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence means that the witnesses to a fact must be found to be credible, and that the facts to which they have testified are distinctly remembered and the details thereof narrated exactly and in due order, so as to enable the trier of the facts to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue. Whether evidence is clear and convincing requires weighing, comparing, testing, and judging its worth when considered in connection with all the facts and circumstances in evidence.\u2019 \u201d [Some citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAD\">We hold that Judge Stevenson\u2019s conclusions of law meet this burden. After an extensive review of the record in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we overrule respondent\u2019s exception and hold that the hearing court\u2019s conclusions of law are supported by sufficient facts, which meet the clear and convincing standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">a. Misappropriation of Client Funds</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The hearing court specifically found that respondent misappropriated the funds of his clients, Mr. Damani and Mr. Lobo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>As such, the court concluded that respondent\u2019s misappropriations, comprehensively set out by the hearing court, constituted violations of Md. Rule 16-609 and section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code. As earlier indicated, Rule 16-609 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-4\">\u201cProhibited transactions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">An attorney or law firm may not borrow or pledge any funds required by these Rules to be deposited in an attorney trust account, obtain any remuneration from the financial institution for depositing any funds in the account, or use any funds for any unauthorized purpose. An instrument drawn on an attorney trust account may not be drawn payable to cash or to bearer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Section 10-306 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-7\">\u201cMisuse of trust money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-8\">A lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">After March 4, 1996, when respondent established the Escrow Account for Mr. Lobo, he intentionally and consistently depleted the funds of said account without the permission of Mr. Lobo. Nearly every disbursal was directly to respondent himself, with the exception of the funds wired to Anglo American in England.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Even after Mr. Lobo demanded the return of the $30,000, evidencing his lack of knowledge of respondent\u2019s account activity, respondent continued to disburse funds to himself. Regardless of whether Mr. Lobo owed respondent a fee, he still misappropriated thousands of Mr. Lobo\u2019s dollars. His use of Mr. Lobo\u2019s money was inconsistent with their escrow agreement and occurred without Mr. Lobo\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">In addition, respondent received $26,000 from a Mr. Damani in 1997. Again, the money was received into respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Attorney Account and was to be held in trust by respondent. Although respondent did return the entire amount to Mr. Damani, he failed to maintain the funds in trust. Respondent\u2019s bank records clearly show that respondent\u2019s account balance fell below $26,000 several times during the time in which those funds were to be held in trust. In fact, respondent was only able to repay the funds after transferring over $25,000 from his various other accounts. Respondent\u2019s handling of Mr. Lobo\u2019s and Mr. Damani\u2019s accounts is conduct that clearly illustrates a misappropriation in that respondent was using his clients\u2019 money for his own personal needs. This was inconsistent with their wishes, constituting an improper purpose in violation of Md. Rule 16-609 and section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code. We thus overrule respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">b. Commingling of Funds and Maintenance of Accounts</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">In her conclusions of law, Judge Stevenson found that respondent did not maintain his client trust accounts properly and additionally commingled Mr. Lobo\u2019s $30,000 and Mr. Damani\u2019s $26,000, with respondent\u2019s own funds in violation of MRPC 1.15(a), Title 16 Section 600 of the Maryland Rules and section 10-302 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code. The relevant portions of MRPC 1.15 state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-6\">\u201c(a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients ... that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account maintained pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules.... Complete records of such account funds ... shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of five years after termination of the representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-7\">(b) Upon receiving funds ... in which a client ... has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client.... [A] lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client ... any funds ... that the client ... is entitled to receive and, upon request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>by the client ... shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">On March 1, 1996, Mr. Lobo sent $30,000 to respondent\u2019s Attorney Account. While respondent claims that he did not immediately transfer this money to an escrow account because it was received late in the day on Friday, March 1, 1996, it is clear that he was able to disburse some of those funds prior to establishing the Escrow Account. These disbursements were not attorney\u2019s fees but were found to have been for the purpose of obtaining financing for respondent\u2019s personal interests. In the representation of another client, respondent received $26,000 from a Mr. Damani in 1997. That money was not a payment of fees; it was money to be held in trust by respondent. However, instead of depositing those funds into a trust or escrow account, respondent deposited them into his Attorney Account. As previously mentioned, he allowed the balance to drop below the trusted amount several times. Under MRPC 1.15(a) and Md. Rule 16-607, this type of commingling of client and lawyer funds is clearly prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">This conduct is also violative, as the hearing court found, of section 10-302 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code. That statute denies a lawyer the right to accept trust money unless that lawyer properly maintains an attorney trust account complying with the Maryland Rules, specifically, for the purposes of this case, sections 603, 604 and 607 of Title 16. As earlier noted, the relevant portions of these sections of Title 16 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-6\">\u201cRule 16-603. Duty to maintain account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-7\">An attorney ... shall maintain one or more attorney trust accounts for the deposit of funds received from any source for intended benefit of clients or third persons. The account or accounts shall be maintained in this State, in the District of Columbia, or in a state contiguous to this State, and shall be with an approved financial institution. Unless an attorney maintains such an account ... an attorney may not receive and accept funds as an attorney from any source intended in whole or in part for the benefit of a client....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>\u201cRule 16-604. Trust account \u2014 Required deposits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-4\">Except as otherwise permitted by rule or other law, all funds ... received and accepted by an attorney ... in this State from a client ... to be delivered in whole or in part to a client ... unless received as payment of fees owed the attorney by the client or in reimbursement for expenses properly advanced on behalf of the client, shall be deposited in an attorney trust account in an approved financial institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-5\">\u201cRule 16-607. Commingling of funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-6\">a. General prohibition. An attorney ... may deposit in an attorney trust account only those funds required to be deposited in that account by Rule 16-604 or permitted to be so deposited by section b. of this Rule.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARS\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>respondent accepted Mr. Lobo\u2019s trust money, which was intended to benefit Mr. Lobo, not respondent, by wire into his Attorney Account on March 1, 1996. Only later, on March 4, 1996, did he open the Escrow Account for Mr. Lobo. Prior to even opening the Escrow Account, respondent wired two money transfers to England, which totaled $6,360 of Mr. Lobo\u2019s $30,000 and was wired from respondent\u2019s Attorney Account. By depositing trust funds into his Attorney Account, respondent violated Md. Rule 16-606, which requires the title of a trust fund account to include the words, \u201cAttorney Trust Account,\u201d \u201cAttorney Escrow Account\u201d or \u201cClients\u2019 Funds Account,\u201d which shall be on all checks and deposit slips. Because respondent commingled his own funds with that of trust funds in his personal Attorney Account, he failed to maintain an account in accordance with Md. Rule 16-607. As a result of this conduct, which was in total disregard for Title 16 Section 600 of the Maryland Rules, respondent violated section 10-302 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Respondent subsequently failed to maintain and provide Mr. Lobo with adequate records of his accounting of the disbursements of the $30,000 and additionally failed, under MRPC 1.4(a), to keep Mr. Lobo aware of the disbursements at all. Rule 1.4 states, in relevant part: \u201c(a) A lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">This case is replete with facts showing that respondent not only mishandled Mr. Lobo\u2019s Escrow Account, but failed to keep Mr. Lobo aware of the activity on the account. Respondent did not keep any records, nor . did he supply records to Mr. Lobo. Respondent represented that his partner and non-lawyer, Mr. Suri, had kept all the records pertaining to Mr, Lobo\u2019s Escrow Account. However, a comparison of Mr. Suri\u2019s records with that of respondent\u2019s bank records shows significant differences, including a substantial difference in the amount of money to be returned to Mr. Lobo. Mr. Lobo\u2019s requests for a full refund illustrate respondent\u2019s failure to inform his client of disbursements. The record provides clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated MRPC 1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">c. Attorney Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Respondent also excepts to the hearing court\u2019s conclusions that respondent was in violation of MRPC 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d). We overrule these exceptions. A criminal conviction is not a prerequisite for finding a violation of Rule 8.4 and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Childress, </em>360 Md. 373, 385, 758 A.2d 117, 123 (2000) (\u201cIt is also clear that a criminal conviction is not a condition precedent for disciplinary proceedings.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Breschi, </em>340 Md. 590, 600, 667 A.2d 659, 664 (1995). All that is required is clear and convincing evidence of conduct that constitutes the commission of the offense or prejudice to the administration of justice. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Proctor, </em>309 Md. 412, 524 A.2d 773 (1987). As we have held that respondent has violated several Rules of Professional Conduct, he necessarily violated MRPC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>8.4(a) as well, which finds professional misconduct where a lawyer \u201cviolate[s] or attempts] to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">MRPC 8.4(b) is violated when a lawyer \u201ccommit[s] a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.\u201d This Court has previously found violations of this rule when an attorney misappropriates money. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vlahos, </em>369 Md. 183, 186, 798 A.2d 555, 556-57 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 381, 773 A.2d 463, 466 (2001); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Williams, </em>335 Md. 458, 473-74, 644 A.2d 490, 497 (1994); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. White, </em>328 Md. 412, 415-16, 614 A.2d 955, 957 (1992). Section 10-606 sets out the penalties for willful violations of handling of attorney trust accounts. That statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-5\">\u201cPenalties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-6\">(b) <em>Attorney trust accounts. </em>\u2014 A person who willfully violates any provision of Subtitle 3, Part I of this title, except for the requirement that a lawyer deposit trust moneys in an attorney trust account for charitable purposes under \u00a7 10-303 of this title, is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">As the trial court had a sufficient factual basis to meet the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof to find as fact, that respondent committed these violations willfully, respondent\u2019s conduct is criminal in nature, as defined by section 10-606.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">We hold that respondent\u2019s willful misappropriation of the funds of Mr. Lobo and Mr. Damani, violates Md. Rule 16-609 and section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code, and is thus criminal conduct under section 10-606 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code. We hold that this blatant misappropriation of client funds, respondent\u2019s inability to abide by his written escrow agreement with Mr. Lobo and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>respondent\u2019s use of Mr. Lobo\u2019s funds for personal gain constitutes a gross violation of MRPC 8.4(b), thus necessarily having severe adverse effects on respondent\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness in other respects, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">This Court has consistently found misappropriation of client funds and deceit to constitute a violation of MRPC 8.4(c). <em>See Vlahos, </em>369 Md. at 186, 798 A.2d at 556-57; <em>Snyder, </em>368 Md. at 260, 793 A.2d at 525-26; <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 381, 773 A.2d at 466; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bernstein, </em>363 Md. 208, 768 A.2d 607 (2001); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tomaino, </em>362 Md. at 486, 765 A.2d at 655 (2001); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 24-26, 741 A.2d 1143, 1156-57 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sabghir, </em>350 Md. 67, 710 A.2d 926 (1998); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Respondent\u2019s conduct was dishonest and deceitful in that he led Mr. Lobo to believe that Mr. Lobo\u2019s $30,000 would be held in trust and returned to him in full, subject to their agreement, while he later disbursed that money without Mr. Lobo\u2019s knowledge or consent. Respondent also made misrepresentations about his authority to distribute this account\u2019s funds to petitioner. Additionally, respondent misled Mr. Damani when respondent indicated that Mr. Damani\u2019s money would be held in trust.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>This Court has also found conduct constituting the misappropriation of client or third party funds to be \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d in violation of Rule 8.4(d). <em>See Snyder, </em>368 Md. at 260, 793 A.2d at 525-26; <em>Hollis, </em>347 Md. 547, 702 A.2d 223; <em>White, </em>328 Md. at 415-16, 614 A.2d at 957. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we hold that respondent\u2019s conduct in the handling of his clients\u2019 trust accounts was directly harmful to the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">This Court has said in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Clark, </em>363 Md. 169, 183, 767 A.2d 865, 873 (2001), that \u201c[pjublic confidence in the legal profession is a critical facet to the proper administration of justice.\u201d If this Court were not to sanction respondent severely, other lawyers would not receive appropriate guidance regarding the standards to which all should be held and public confidence in the legal profession might be greatly diminished. As such and in line with precedent, we hold that respondent violated MRPC 8.4(d) by engaging in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">III. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">We now consider the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Attorney Grievance Commission, through Bar Counsel, argues that disbarment is appropriate, while respondent advocates that he has not violated any of the rules, and proffers that he should not be sanctioned at all. In <em>Clark, </em>we set out the purposes behind and the factors to be considered in our sanctioning process when we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-7\">\u201cThis Court is mindful that the purpose of the sanctions is to protect the public, to deter other lawyers from engaging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>in violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, and to maintain the integrity of the legal profession. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Hess, </em>352 Md. 438, 453, 722 A.2d 905, 913 (1999) <em>(quoting Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Webster, </em>348 Md. 662, 678, 705 A.2d 1135, 1143 (1998)). We have stated that \u2018[t]he public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u2019 <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). Therefore, the appropriate sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including consideration of any mitigating factors. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Atkinson, </em>357 Md. 646, 656, 745 A.2d 1086, 1092 (2000); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Gavin, </em>350 Md. 176, 197-98, 711 A.2d 193, 204 (1998).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-4\"><em>Clark, </em>363 Md. at 183-84, 767 A.2d at 873. In addition, we have stated that \u201c[ijmposing a sanction protects the public interest \u2018because it demonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct which will not be tolerated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 96, 753 A.2d 17, 38 (2000) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ober, </em>350 Md. 616, 631-32, 714 A.2d 856, 864 (1998)) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">In this case, we have upheld the hearing court\u2019s findings, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent violated several rules of professional conduct, including misappropriation of client funds under Md. Rules 16-603, 16-604, 16-606, 16-607 and 16-609, sections 10-302 and 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code, and MRPC 1.15, failing to keep a client reasonably informed under MRPC 1.4(a), and committing professional misconduct under MRPC 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d). The hearing court\u2019s findings and conclusions show that respondent acted willfully and intentionally in his depletion of Mr. Lobo\u2019s $30,000, which was supposed to be held in the Escrow Account and later returned to Mr. Lobo. The facts indicate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>respondent has made continuous misrepresentations throughout these proceedings. Respondent submitted no mitigating evidence and the record does not reflect any extenuating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">In light of these findings, respondent\u2019s numerous violations, his egregious conduct and this Court\u2019s consistent practice of disbarment of lawyers who misappropriate client funds absent mitigation or extenuating circumstances, we hold that the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s conduct is disbarment. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

It is clear to this Court, that these facts and similar reasoning suggest, that Mr. Lobo\u2019s deposition would have also been properly admitted pursuant to Rule 2-419(a)(3)(B). That rule states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-7\">\"Rule 2-419.

In fact, this case arises out of respondent's failure to return money to Mr. Lobo after Mr. Lobo could not obtain entry into the United States. As such, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Mr. Lobo's absence from respondent's hearing was not procured by petitioner, who offered the deposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b898-11\">.

While petitioner\u2019s expert, Laurence Johnson, supplied ample evidence to support the court's findings, this Court does not reach the question of whether the Visa Approval condition of respondent\u2019s agreement with Mr. Lobo was satisfied. It is irrelevant to this disciplinary proceeding because there was sufficient evidence for the hearing court to find respondent in violation of these rules without making this determination, which would be an interpretation of Federal, not Maryland, law. In regard to MRPC 8.4(c), there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that respondent violated this rule without answering that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Additionally, the escrow agreement stated that \"non-performance on project funding and or inability to obtain L-l Visa approval for Mr. Phillip A.
