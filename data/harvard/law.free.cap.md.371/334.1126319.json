The Circuit Court granted him a new trial, based on <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and its progeny on the grounds that he was denied effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. The Court of Special Appeals reversed, reinstating the judgments of conviction. <em>State v. Gross, </em>134 Md.App. 528, 760 A.2d 725 (2000). We granted the petition for writ of certiorari to consider whether petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">In the early morning hours of December 19, 1993, the body of a young woman was discovered in a cornfield in Anne Arundel County. The autopsy revealed that her blood alcohol content was .34% and her urine alcohol content was .42%. When her body was found, she was nude from the waist up, her underwear was wrapped around one leg, and she had on no shoes, blouse, bra, or coat. The cause of death was four gunshot wounds \u2014 two to her neck and two to her chest. There was no purse or identification with the body. The victim was identified several days later as Margaret Ruth Courson when a friend recognized her from a photograph that appeared in the local Annapolis newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The victim had last been seen near the City Dock in Annapolis, at approximately 3:30 a.m., on December 19, 1993. The cornfield where her body was discovered three hours later was approximately twenty miles away from the City Dock area of Annapolis.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">In response to media releases on December 20, 1993, the police received several telephone calls identifying petitioner, Alvin Winslow Gross, as the murderer. On December 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>1993, they received an anonymous telephone call stating that Sidney Scott, Jr. and two other black men were involved in the murder. On January 6 and 7, 1994, the police spoke with three anonymous informants who implicated petitioner, among others, in the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">On January 10, 1994, the police executed search warrants for petitioner\u2019s person, car, and residence. During the search of petitioner\u2019s car, police found physical evidence linking the victim to petitioner\u2019s vehicle. They found a notebook containing handwriting matching that of the victim and fingerprints of the victim on nine separate pages. The police also found two head hairs and one pubic hair in petitioner\u2019s automobile, which were later identified as belonging to the victim. In addition, police gathered carpet fibers from the floor mats in petitioner\u2019s automobile, which were subsequently matched to fibers found on several items of clothing worn by the victim on the night of the murder and found in combings of her pubic hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">On the same day, petitioner was arrested and transported to the police station, where samples of his blood, hair, and saliva were obtained and submitted to the crime laboratory for DNA testing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A vaginal swab was also taken from the victim\u2019s body and examined for possible DNA traces. Initially, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>laboratory attempted to perform DNA Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (\u201cRFLP\u201d) analysis, but there was not enough genetic material present to obtain results with that method. The laboratory then performed a DNA Polymerase Chain Reaction (\u201cPCR\u201d) amplification, which can be performed on a smaller DNA sample, followed by an analysis of the DQ Alpha region of the chromosome (\u201cDQA\u201d). <em>See State v. Isley, </em>262 Kan. 281, 936 P.2d 275, 279 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Prior to trial, petitioner moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude the DNA/PCR evidence on two grounds: first, that PCR analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>was generally not accepted in the scientific community and, therefore, not admissible; and, second, that the test results were inadmissible because the laboratory had not produced population genetics statistics to accompany the lab results and that, absent these statistics, the results of the test were meaningless. At the hearing on the pre-trial motion, the defense called as an expert witness, Dr. Walter Rowe, a professor of forensic sciences. The trial court admitted Dr. Rowe as an expert to testify about population statistics in a general sense but did not accept him as an expert in the field of DNA or DNA/PCR analysis. The trial court denied petitioner\u2019s motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The bullets removed from the victim\u2019s body were too mutilated for a ballistics match, but the State\u2019s firearms identification expert testified at trial that they were .32 caliber bullets that could have been fired from one of five probable makes of revolvers, including one manufactured by Rossi. The police later recovered a Rossi revolver that petitioner had turned over to Troy King in early January 1994. King was a close personal friend of petitioner\u2019s for several years and was not in any way a suspect in the case. Although the ballistics expert could not state that the four bullets had been fired from petitioner\u2019s revolver, he did testify that they were compatible with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">At trial, Troy King testified that, during the last week of December 1993, petitioner had discussed the Courson murder with him, telling him during a telephone conversation that he had been doing \u201ccrazy things\u201d lately, that he and Sidney Scott were with the victim on the night of December 19, 1993, and that they both shot and killed her. King testified that petitioner had told him that he and Scott had picked up the victim and that they felt they had to kill her because they were afraid that the victim would identify them. King also testified that, early in January 1994, he, his cousin Charles Carpenter, and petitioner had gone out to a night club in Washington, D.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Both King and Carpenter testified that petitioner gave King a .32 caliber Rossi revolver from his car and asked King to keep it for him. Both also testified that, at the time that petitioner gave the revolver to King, he had warned King to be careful with it because \u201cit already has one life on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The State also called as a witness Angela Nicolson, King\u2019s fiancee. She testified that she found a handgun in the apartment that she shared with King and that, after petitioner\u2019s arrest, she turned the gun over to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The State introduced other physical evidence linking the victim to petitioner. This evidence included hair found in a notebook in petitioner\u2019s car. Both the notebook and hair sample belonged to the victim. Fibers from petitioner\u2019s car mats were found on the victim\u2019s clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The State presented evidence that DNA samples were collected from the victim\u2019s body and testing using the PCR DQA method. Two DNA experts from Cellmark Diagnostic Laboratory, Melissa Weber and Charlotte Word, testified at trial regarding the PCR DQA testing. At trial, the defense moved <em>in limine, </em>before the State\u2019s Cellmark DNA experts testified, to prevent the State from entering evidence of population frequency statistics. Defense counsel did not object to, or move to strike, the experts\u2019 testimony regarding the DNA laboratory results without accompanying statistical data. Dr. Weber testified that all that could be extrapolated from the PCR tests that were performed was that petitioner could not be excluded from the class of persons who possibly could have been a source of the DNA samples recovered from the victim. Word confirmed in her testimony that PCR testing cannot produce a \u201cmatch\u201d in the sense of a unique identification. Neither Weber nor Word, however, testified regarding the statistical significance of petitioner\u2019s DNA match.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Petitioner testified in his defense at trial. His defense was alibi. He denied any involvement in the murder, admitting that he had sexual intercourse with the victim, but claiming that it was consensual and occurred the evening before the murder. He also testified that he gave the revolver to Troy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>King, claiming, without further explanation, that Sidney Scott had given it to him in December. He testified that, because he had no use for the gun, he had given it to King, who collected guns, as a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">On December 8, 1994, petitioner was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County of first degree felony murder, first degree rape, kidnapping, and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of life without the possibility of parole for murder, with concurrent sentences of twenty-five years for rape, twenty-five years for kidnapping, and fifteen years for the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, raising a multitude of issues. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals held that the evidence was insufficient to sustain petitioner\u2019s conviction for kidnapping, affirmed the judgments of conviction for murder and the handgun violation, and merged the rape conviction into the felony murder conviction for sentencing purposes. This Court denied Gross\u2019 petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Gross v. State, </em>343 Md. 333, 681 A.2d 68 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">On August 18, 1997, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, petitioner filed a Petition for Postconviction Relief pursuant to the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 645A (current version at Maryland Code (1957, 2001 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 7-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Criminal Procedure Article). He alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, and trial court error. At the postconviction hearing, he argued that his trial counsel mishandled the DNA evidence at trial and that his appellate counsel was deficient in failing to raise the DNA issues on appeal. He also argued that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel when his attorney failed to object to the State\u2019s allegedly improper cross-examination of his character witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Petitioner raised three issues as trial court error. He argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to exclude the DNA/PCR evidence, that the trial court erred in refusing to accept Dr. Rowe as a DNA/PCR expert, and that the trial court erred in permitting the State to introduce PCR evidence without accompanying population genetics statistics.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The Circuit Court rejected all three of petitioner\u2019s arguments regarding trial court error, finding no error, but granted postconviction relief for ineffective assistance of counsel. The postconviction court found that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the use of DNA/PCR testing at trial, for failing properly to investigate, hire, and prepare a qualified, competent DNA/PCR expert, and for failing to object to the introduction of DNA/PCR evidence at trial without accompanying population genetics statistics. The postconviction court repeatedly ruled that petitioner was prejudiced by certain of trial counsel\u2019s errors because, in failing to object, trial counsel did not preserve an issue for appeal. In finding a <em>Strickland </em>violation, the postconviction court did so without conducting the proper assessment of prejudice under <em>Strickland, </em>finding that petitioner was <em>per se </em>prejudiced by the failure of trial counsel to preserve these issues for appeal, without any consideration of whether the waived issues had merit and despite its finding that the trial court committed no error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Gross argued before the postconviction court that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the State\u2019s cross-examination of his character witnesses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>asked four defense character witnesses who had expressed opinions as to Gross\u2019 character whether their opinion would be affected if the witness had observed Gross with a handgun, if the witness had heard Gross say the gun \u201chad a life on it,\u201d or if the witness knew Gross had confessed to a friend that he had killed the victim. Petitioner argued that the questions were impermissible \u201cguilt-assuming\u201d questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The postconviction court concluded that the cumulative effect of trial counsel\u2019s errors denied petitioner his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel and that petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel, on direct appeal, was constitutionally ineffective for failing to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the DNA/PCR evidence and for failing to appeal the trial court\u2019s refusal to qualify petitioner\u2019s expert in DNA/PCR evidence. The postconviction court also rejected petitioner\u2019s argument that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the guilt-assuming questions asked by the State during cross-examination of his character witnesses. The postconviction court granted petitioner a new trial and, in an amended order, granted conditional alternative relief in the form of a belated appeal in the event that the granting of a new trial was set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Both parties sought leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 6451 (current version at Maryland Code (1957, 2001 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 7-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Criminal Procedure Article) and Maryland Rule 8-204. The Court of Special Appeals granted the State\u2019s application for leave to appeal the grant of postconviction relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The intermediate appellate court reversed the postconviction court\u2019s grant of a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>and the alternative relief of a belated appeal. <em>State v. Gross, </em>134 Md.App. 528, 619, 760 A.2d 725, 773 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the performance of petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel \u201cwas not only effective but highly commendable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561, 760 A.2d at 742. Before turning to the issue of the effectiveness of trial counsel, the intermediate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">\u201cWe initially expected that at this point we would be able to move from a consideration of the effectiveness of appellate counsel back to a consideration of the effectiveness of trial .counsel by stepping from one neat and water-tight compartment of analysis to another. On closer examination, however, we are unable to do so. Two-thirds of what we expected to be a traditional examination of the effectiveness of trial representation and trial prejudice turns out to be a <em>hybrid </em>issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 581, 760 A.2d at 753 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In creating what Gross calls a \u201chybrid test\u201d to address trial counsel\u2019s failure to preserve admissibility issues for subsequent appellate review, the court pointed out the possibility of errors by trial counsel that would not have resulted in prejudice to a petitioner at the trial level, but that, nonetheless, resulted in prejudice at the appellate level, such as when counsel\u2019s errors consist only of failing to renew an earlier objection that had been overruled by the trial court. <em>See id. </em>at 581-84, 760 A.2d at 753-55. The court defined this \u201chybrid issue\u201d as requiring a determination of whether there was a \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 that, but for trial counsel\u2019s failure to preserve an issue for appellate review, Gross \u2018would have prevailed on his appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, 760 A.2d at 753. In doing so, the court framed the issue as one of \u201ca reasonable likelihood of a different appellate result, not a different trial result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then concluded that the most appropriate remedy would be to grant a belated direct appeal, not a new trial, and thereby allow the appellate court to consider those issues on their merits, notwithstanding their non-preservation. <em>See- id. </em>at 585-86, 760 A.2d at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>After laying out this test for assessing appellate prejudice from deficient trial counsel performance, the court concluded that, since the trial judge\u2019s rulings were not in error, trial counsel\u2019s performance in failing to preserve issues for appeal was not deficient and that there could not possibly have been any appellate prejudice in trial counsel\u2019s failure to preserve them. <em>See id. </em>at 608-09, 760 A.2d at 767-68. The Court of Special Appeals also addressed petitioner\u2019s contention that trial counsel had been ineffective because he failed to object when the State allegedly conducted improper cross-examination of four of petitioner\u2019s character witnesses at trial by asking \u201cguilt-assuming\u201d questions. <em>See id. </em>at 619-28, 760 A.2d at 774-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Gross filed in this Court a petition for writ of certiorari, presenting three questions relating to the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The three questions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">I. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that Petitioner was not denied the effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">II. Did the lower court erroneously conclude that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to improper guilt-assuming questions asked by the State of petitioner\u2019s several character witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">III. Whether the lower court erred in creating a new \u201chybrid test\u201d for judging certain claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims which conflicts with long standing Supreme Court and Court of Appeal precedent?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-9\"><em>Gross v. State, </em>362 Md. 623, 766 A.2d 147 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Petitioner contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in crafting a new \u201chybrid test\u201d for assessing claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel that result in appellate prejudice. In contrast, the State argues that the Court of Special Appeals did not invent a new \u201chybrid\u201d test for assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel but instead properly analyzed petitioner\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under traditional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Whether the Court of Special Appeals did or did not adopt a new \u201chybrid\u201d test for assessing ineffective assistance of counsel claims does not determine the outcome of this case and need not be further explored by us. The principles governing ineffective assistance of counsel claims under the Sixth Amendment, both with regard to trial counsel and appellate counsel, are those set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Redman v. State, </em>363 Md. 298, 309-14, 768 A.2d 656, 662-65, <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 140, 151 L.Ed.2d 92 (2001); <em>Perry v. State, </em>357 Md. 37, 78-87, 741 A.2d 1162, 1184-89 (1999); <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>352 Md. 580, 602-03, 724 A.2d 1, 12, <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 832, 120 S.Ct. 90, 145 L.Ed.2d 76 (1999); <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 282-300, 681 A.2d 30, 43-52 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1079, 117 S.Ct. 742, 136 L.Ed.2d 681 (1997); <em>Bowers v. State, </em>320 Md. 416, 423-27, 578 A.2d 734, 737-39 (1990). The principles applied in the above-cited cases should govern the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decisions regarding ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The same principles shall determine our decision in the present case. Petitioner must satisfy the <em>Strickland </em>test for ineffective assistance of counsel \u2014 petitioner must establish that any deficient performance resulted in prejudice. If there is no reasonable possibility that the appellate court would have ruled in his favor, there can be no <em>Strickland </em>prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">We recently reiterated the standard to be applied in determining whether a person has been denied effective assistance of counsel in <em>Wiggins. </em>Writing for the Court, Judge Wilner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">\u201cThe standard to be applied in determining whether counsel\u2019s representation comported with the requirements of the Sixth Amendment is that enunciated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>see Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993); <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 283, 681 A.2d 30, 43 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1079, 117 S.Ct. 742, 136 L.Ed.2d 681 (1997). To prove a claim of Constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant must establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>\u2018that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u2019 <em>Oken, supra, </em>at 283, 681 A.2d at 43. To show a deficiency, appellant must (1) demonstrate that counsel\u2019s acts or omissions, given the circumstances, \u2018fell below an objective standard of reasonableness considering prevailing professional norms,\u2019 <em>id., </em>and (2) overcome the presumption that the challenged conduct \u2018be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>To show that a deficiency prejudiced the defense, appellant must establish that counsel\u2019s error was \u2018so serious as to deprive [him] of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable,\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 284, 681 A.2d at 43, quoting from <em>Lockhart v. Fretwell, supra, </em>506 U.S. 364, 369, 113 S.Ct. 838, 842, 122 L.Ed.2d 180, 189, quoting, in turn, from <em>Strickland,, supra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\"><em>Wiggins, </em>352 Md. at 602-03, 724 A.2d at 12. Deficient performance is prejudicial to a petitioner if there is a substantial possibility that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>Bowers, </em>320 Md. at 425-27, 578 A.2d at 738-39 (holding that, in defining the reasonable probability language in <em>Strickland </em>with more precision, substantial possibility describes the prejudice standard in <em>Strickland). </em>Although <em>Strickland </em>and its progeny promulgated standards for determining the effectiveness of trial counsel, the same standards apply in assessing appellate counsel effectiveness. <em>See, e.g., State v. Calhoun, </em>306 Md. 692, 729, 511 A.2d 461, 479-80 (1986); <em>United States v. Cook, </em>45 F.3d 388, 392 (10th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>1 F.3d 1080, 1083 (10th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Walling, </em>982 F.2d 447, 449 (10th Cir.1992); <em>Duhamel v. Collins, </em>955 F.2d 962, 967 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Heath v. Jones, </em>941 F.2d 1126, 1130 (11th Cir.1991); <em>Miller v. Keeney, </em>882 F.2d 1428, 1433 (9th Cir.1989); <em>Orazio v. Dugger, </em>876 F.2d 1508, 1511 (11th Cir.1989); <em>Gray v. Greer, </em>800 F.2d 644, 646 (7th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Birtle, </em>792 F.2d 846, 847 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The question of prejudice, in the context of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim for the failure to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>serve or raise an appellate claim, necessarily requires a reviewing court to look at the merits of the underlying claim. <em>See Hartey v. Vaughn, </em>186 F.3d 367, 372 (3d Cir.1999); <em>Banks v.

As a result, in assessing the effectiveness of trial counsel in failing to preserve issues and of appellate counsel in failing to raise them on appeal, <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>performance and prejudice prongs naturally overlap because the questions of whether counsel\u2019s performance was adequate and whether it prejudiced the petitioner both will turn on the viability of the omitted claims, <em>i.e., </em>whether there is a reasonable possibility of success. <em>See Cook, </em>45 F.3d at 394-95; <em>Miller, </em>882 F.2d at 1434; <em>cf. Oken, </em>343 Md. at 294, 681 A.2d at 49 (holding that, because the State\u2019s comments during closing arguments were not improper, defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to them was <em>\u201ca fortiori\u201d </em>not prejudicial); <em>State v. Colvin, </em>314 Md. 1, 21-22, 548 A.2d 506, 516 (1988) (finding no ineffective assistance of counsel for the failure to object to testimony that was admissible); <em>Grubbs v. State, </em>760 S.W.2d 115, 121 (Mo.1988) (finding no ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to object to testimony that was not inadmissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Of course, the failure to preserve or raise an issue that is without merit does not .constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Cooper v. State, </em>128 Md.App. 257, 273, 737 A.2d 613, 621 (1999). The Sixth Amendment does not require an attorney to argue every possible issue on appeal. <em>See Smith v.

An advocate does render ineffective assistance of counsel, however, by failing to preserve or omitting on direct appeal a claim that would have had a substantial possibility of resulting in a reversal of petitioner\u2019s conviction. <em>See, e.g., Banks, </em>54 F.3d at 1515; <em>Cook, </em>45 F.3d at 395; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number><em>Duhamel, </em>955 F.2d at 967; <em>Heath, </em>941 F.2d at 1132; <em>Cross, </em>893 F.2d at 1290; <em>Page v. United States, </em>884 F.2d 300, 302 (7th Cir.1989); <em>Gray, </em>800 F.2d at 646. The crucial inquiry is whether confidence in the reliability of the conviction is undermined by the failure to preserve or raise the claims on appeal. <em>See Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 369, 113 S.Ct. 838, 842, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993); <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>Banks, </em>54 F.3d at 1516; <em>Heath, </em>941 F.2d at 1132; <em>Oken, </em>343 Md. at 284, 681 A.2d at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to Gross\u2019 arguments in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">A <em>DNA/PCR Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The dispute over the admissibility of the DNA evidence in this case is a tempest in a teapot. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the trial court should not have admitted the PCR-related testimony without accompanying population genetic frequency statistics, any such error was not prejudicial because it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). As such, under the <em>Strickland </em>standard, there was virtually no likelihood of success on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">A review of the entire record confirms that the uncontested evidence supporting petitioner\u2019s conviction was ovexwhelming. The State\u2019s experts testified that, based on the PCR DQA analysis, they could not exclude petitioner as a donor of the semen found on the victim. They did not testify that petitioner was the source of the semen sample. The DNA evidence was cumulative evidence that did not injuriously affect petitioner\u2019s rights. The significant inference from the DNA evidence in this case was that petitioner had sexual relations with the victim close to the time of her death \u2014 a fact that petitioner <em>admitted </em>in his trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Petitioner argues that, but for the introduction of the DNA evidence, his testimony may not have been necessary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>argument stands in sharp contrast to the testimony of petitioner\u2019s lead trial counsel at the postconviction hearing, who testified that petitioner had planned to testify prior to trial. Counsel testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">\u201c[T]he way I looked at it, Alvin needed to explain the pubic hair. Alvin needed to explain the head hair. Alvin needed to explain the blanket fibers. Alvin needed to explain the fibers from the \u2014 I think the mat of the car and there [were] other additional fibers. So there were five independent issues \u2014 excuse me, six, because the \u2014 seven. The \u2014 the notebook and the fingerprints. There [were] seven independent pieces of evidence linking him to this victim above and beyond the issue of the DNA. So I think unless there was some compelling reason not to put him on the stand, and I didn\u2019t know of any reason not to put Alvin on the stand, ... coupled with the fact that he wanted to testify.... I mean, we certainly guide him along the way, but he direct \u2014 he wanted to take the witness stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In addition, there was Gross\u2019 confession he made to his friend, Troy King. Along these same lines, the Court of Special Appeals noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\u201cGross could not leave unchallenged the undisputed evidence from the FBI\u2019s hair and fiber examiner that Peggy Courson had been in his automobile. He took the stand in his own defense and his testimony, though intended to be exculpatory, was heavy with inculpatory potential. His taking of the stand was a desperate but necessary effort to put some kind of exculpatory spin on that evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-8\"><em>Gross, </em>134 Md.App. at 541-42, 760 A.2d at 732. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">The DNA evidence was consistent with Gross\u2019 defense. He was not unfairly prejudiced by its admission. Furthermore, there was ample other evidence linking him to the victim near <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the time of her murder. This other evidence independently constituted compelling circumstantial evidence of petitioner\u2019s guilt, rendering the admission of the DNA evidence, if error, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Because any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, it stands to reason that petitioner\u2019s counsels\u2019 errors, (if any), relating to the DNA evidence, could not have prejudiced the outcome of his case in the sense contemplated by <em>Strickland. </em>Therefore, he was not unconstitutionally denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\n<em>B. Cross-examination of Defense Character Witnesses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Petitioner also alleges that he is entitled to a new trial because his trial counsel were ineffective for their failure to object to what he characterizes as \u201cguilt-assuming\u201d questions asked by the State in cross-examination of his character witnesses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioner argued before the postconviction court, and makes the same argument before this Court, that his trial counsel\u2019s deficient performance in failing to object to the guilt-assuming questions prejudiced him because it deprived him \u201cof one of his two (2) defenses at trial,\u201d that is, good character testimony and alibi. Petitioner reasons that the improper guilt-assuming questions on cross-examination and the answers given by his character witnesses completely destroyed the credibility of the character witnesses. He concludes that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object prejudiced petitioner \u201cin that the complete undercutting of one of [petitioner\u2019s] two defenses created a \u2018substantial or significant possibility that the verdict of the trier of fact would have been affected.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The State argues that the postconviction court and Court of Special Appeals properly rejected Gross\u2019 argument that trial counsel was ineffective in\u2019 failing to object to these questions. The Court of Special Appeals addressed the prejudice prong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>of <em>Strickland, </em>holding that the outcome of Gross\u2019 trial would not have been different had trial counsel objected to the last three of the four affected witnesses. We agree that there is no reasonable possibility that the outcome of the trial would have been different; therefore, Gross was not prejudiced and accordingly, was not denied effective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We summarize the testimony of the character witnesses. The first witness, Edwin Plater, testified that Gross was \u201ca good person,\u201d \u201cstraight-forward,\u201d and \u201chonest.\u201d When asked if his opinion of Gross would change \u201cif you knew that shortly after this murder several people saw him with a gun,\u201d that people had heard Gross say \u201cthis gun has a life on it,\u201d or if Gross had admitted that \u2019 he shot a woman, Plater testified, over defense objection, that his opinion of Gross would not change.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">April Muller, a friend of Gross, testified that Gross had a good reputation and was not violent. In response to the prosecutor\u2019s question whether she would be surprised to learn that in December, several people saw him with a gun, she responded, \u201cvery.\u201d Defense counsel withdrew his objection to this question. Muller testified that her opinion of Gross would not change if she knew that he said the gun had a life on it or that he had confessed to a friend that he killed a person. She said: \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t sound like Alvin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Kirk Butler testified that Gross\u2019 reputation in the community was good and that he had never known Gross to be violent. Butler testified in response to the State\u2019s question, that he would be surprised to learn that several people saw Gross with a gun in December, but that information would not change his opinion of Gross. He also testified that his opinion of Gross would not change if he knew that Gross had confessed to a killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Erica Estep, Gross\u2019 girlfriend for six years, testified that Gross had many friends, was popular, and was an honest person. In response to the gun question, she said that if she knew that several people had seen Gross with a gun, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>opinion would not change. Her opinion would not change if she knew he had confessed to a murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We need not \u201cgrade\u201d counsel\u2019s performance in failing to object or determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d at 674, because even if the failure to object was deficient performance, Gross was not prejudiced. We agree with the observations of the Court of Special Appeals finding lack of prejudice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\u201cThe trial judge had just overruled the objection when made with respect to the first witness and the issue was identical with respect to the next three witnesses. There was no reasonable likelihood that the ruling would not have been precisely the same even if objections had been made when the issue just ruled upon came up again for a second, a third, and a fourth time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-7\"><em>Gross, </em>134 Md.App. at 623, 760 A.2d. at 775. The trial judge had just overruled counsel\u2019s objection and there is little reason to believe that the trial court would rule differently if the objection again was asserted when the issue arose with the other witnesses. There was no reasonable possibility that the result of the trial would have been different and thus, Gross suffered no prejudice under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">In his briefs, Gross argues that he was prejudiced because his trial counsel failed to protect the record for appeal and thus, if different appellate counsel chose to raise the issue on appeal, counsel would have been met with a \u201cfailure to preserve\u201d argument from the State.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Simply failing to preserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>an issue for appellate review is not, <em>per se, </em>prejudicial or ineffective assistance of trial counsel. We need not go further in our analysis of this claim because petitioner does not argue that had this particular claim been preserved for appellate review, appellate counsel would have chosen to raise the issue, and if raised, that petitioner would have had a reasonable possibility of success.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">For all of the above stated reasons, we hold that petitioner was not denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Chief Judge BELL concurs in the result only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\">.
