(\u201cAlgodonera\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of its diversity suit for improper venue. The district court based its dismissal on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(a)(3), which provides that diversity suits may be brought in a \u201cjudicial district in which any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced, if there is no district in which the action may otherwise be brought.\u201d The district court concluded that because the suit could have been brought in New York, Algodonera could not rely on \u00a7 1391(a)(3), and the suit was due to be dismissed. However, as Algodonera explained in both its motion for reconsideration and on appeal, it did not rely on \u00a7 1391(a)(3). Rather, venue was proper under \u00a7 1391(a)(1), which provides that in diversity cases, venue lies \u201cin a judicial district where any defendant resides, if all defendants reside in the same State.\u201d As both the defendants here were \u201cresidents\u201d of the Southern District of Florida within the meaning of \u00a7 1391(c), venue was conferred by \u00a7 1391(a)(1). Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-14\">Algodonera filed this diversity suit in the Southern District of Florida, alleging that the defendants failed to perform an agreement to sell it certain Venezuelan sovereign bonds. The complaint alleged that venue was proper under the terms of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(a). The complaint did not specify which subsection of \u00a7 1391(a) conferred venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-15\">The defendants were served with process in the Southern District of Florida but failed to respond or otherwise appear. Upon Algodonera\u2019s motion, the clerk of court entered default judgment against the defendants. The district court then held a hearing to determine damages. At the close of the hearing, the district court requested a memorandum of law concerning the recovery of lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>However, before Algodonera filed such a memo, the district court entered a <em>sua sponte </em>order dismissing the case based on improper venue. The district court\u2019s order proceeded on the assumption that Algodonera relied on \u00a7 1391(a)(3), under which venue was not proper because the case could have been filed in New York. Algodonera timely filed a motion for reconsideration, explaining that venue was proper under \u00a7 1391(a)(1), given that both defendants were residents of Florida and the Southern District within the meaning of \u00a7 1391(c). The district court denied the motion for reconsideration, explaining only that it remained \u201cunconvinced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a lawsuit for a lack of venue for an abuse of discretion. <em>Home Ins. Co. v. Thomas Industries, Inc., </em>896 F.2d 1352, 1355 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-8\">Section 1391(a)(1) provides that in diversity suits, venue is proper \u201cin a judicial district where any defendant resides, if all defendants reside in the same State.\u201d A defendant is a resident of a judicial district if it is subject to personal jurisdiction there at the time the case is initiated. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-9\">In this case, both of the defendants conducted business through their offices in the Southern District of Florida, received correspondence there, and were subject to service of process there. Accordingly, both defendants were \u201cresidents\u201d of the Southern District of Florida, within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(c). Venue was thus proper in the Southern District within the meaning of \u00a7 1391(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-12\">While the district court relied on \u00a7 1391(a)(3) to hold that venue was improper because the action could be brought in New York<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, venue may be predicated on \u00a7 1391(a)(3) only when neither \u00a7 1391(a)(1) or (2) are satisfied. <em>Doctor\u2019s Assocs. v. Stuart, </em>85 F.3d 975, 983 (2d Cir.1996); <em>see also, </em>17 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00a7 110.02 (describing \u00a7 1391(a)(3) as a \u201cfail-back provision\u201d used where \u201cvenue will be unavailable under \u00a7 1391(a)(1)\u201d). Section 1391(a)(3) does <em>not </em>dictate that venue is improper in diversity cases any time the case could be brought in another district. <em>Stuart, </em>85 F.3d at 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-13\">Moreover, we have previously made clear that while a district court may dismiss a suit <em>sua sponte </em>for lack of venue, it may not do so \u201cwithout first giving the parties an opportunity to present their views on the issue.\u201d <em>Lipofsky v. N.Y. State Workers Comp. Bd., </em>861 F.2d 1257, 1259 (11th Cir.1988). This rule gives defendants an opportunity to waive the venue defense and plaintiffs an opportunity to present arguments as to why venue is proper <em>before </em>the case is dismissed. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the district court dismissed the case <em>sua sponte </em>before receiving <em>any </em>submissions or arguments from the parties on the propriety of venue in the Southern District. While the district court opined that Agodonera\u2019s motion for reconsideration gave it the opportunity to present its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>position on venue, that opportunity came only after the district court had dismissed the case and ordered the clerk of court to close it. This does not satisfy <em>Lipofsky\u2019s </em>command that the parties be given an opportunity to present their views, and bolsters our conclusion that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">In short, because \u00a7 1391(a)(1) indisputably provided venue, and as the parties were not given an opportunity to present their views prior to dismissal, the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1385-10\">. We note Algodonera\u2019s argument that venue is not even proper in New York, given newly-discovered information suggesting that the defendants never actually conducted business there. We need not reach these contentions, however, as we find \u00a7 1391(a)(1) to be dispositive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
