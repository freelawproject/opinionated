Petitioner contends that she is not removable because she obtained derivative United States citizenship upon her mother\u2019s naturalization while her parents allegedly were separated. Because petitioner cannot establish that her parents were legally separated at the time her mother was naturalized, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-17\">Under former section 321(a) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a), a child born outside the United States automatically acquires United States citizenship if, while the child is under the age of eighteen, the parent with legal custody of the child is naturalized while that child\u2019s parents are legally separated. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-18\">Petitioner was born in Jamaica in 1968. Her parents married in that country in 1974. Four years later, her mother, Verna Mae Morgan, entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident. In 1981, petitioner joined her mother in the United States, also entering as a lawful permanent resident. On July 25, 1984, when petitioner was age sixteen, her mother was naturalized. Her father, Hopeton Morgan, entered the United States on December 23, 1984 and lived with her mother in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Neither petitioner nor her father have ever been naturalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-19\">In April 2003, petitioner was charged with being an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and therefore subject to removal. She applied for withholding of removal, asylum and relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-20\">The IJ refused the petitioner\u2019s requests for a continuance of the proceedings and, after a hearing, denied asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. The IJ also rejected the petitioner\u2019s contention that, because she was born out of wed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>lock, she was eligible for derivative citizenship under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432 upon her mother\u2019s naturalization. Petitioner appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), again asserting derivative citizenship, but on this occasion she contended that she was eligible because her mother and father were legally separated at the time of the naturalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The BIA dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal on July 9, 2004, finding that she had failed to establish derivative citizenship because there was no evidence that the petitioner\u2019s mother was ever legally separated from her father. In reaching this conclusion, the Board relied on case law that interpreted the statutory term \u201clegal separation\u201d to mean separation recognized or achieved through judicial proceedings. The Board noted that the petitioner\u2019s request for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, based on the same claim for derivative citizenship, had been denied. <em>See Hurde-Morgan v. Ashcroft, </em>No. 04-cv-936, 2004 WL 1166588 (E.D.Pa. May 24, 2004). The Board also rejected the petitioner\u2019s complaint about the IJ\u2019s refusals of continuances because the motions lacked sufficient articulation of the facts or evidence that could have demonstrated that actual prejudice or harm resulted from the denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In this petition for review, petitioner has abandoned her claims for withholding of removal, asylum and relief under the Convention Against Torture. She argues only that the IJ erred in concluding that she had not obtained derivative citizenship and in denying her motions for continuance of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(A) grants us jurisdiction to review a claim of nationality if there is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to that claim. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), however, provides in relevant part, that \u201cexcept as provided in sub-paragraph (D), no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense ... covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii).\u201d Subparagraph (D) provides that we have jurisdiction to consider any constitutional and legal questions that may be presented in this petition for review, notwithstanding anything in subparagraph (C). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Though subparagraph (D), as part of the REAL ID Act, did not become law until May 11, 2005, the Act applies retroactively to any ease, \u201cin which the final administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion was issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this division.\u201d REAL ID Act of 2005 \u00a7 106(b), Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231. We have held that the REAL ID Act amendments \u201crestoring our jurisdiction\u201d apply to all \u201cpending or future petitions for direct review challenging final orders of removal, except as may otherwise be provided in \u00a7 1252.\u201d <em>Papageorgiou v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 356, 358 (3d Cir.2005). Thus, we have jurisdiction to consider any constitutional or legal claims that may be presented in this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">The issue of derivative citizenship is a purely legal issue of statutory interpretation. <em>See Jordon v. Attorney General, </em>424 F.3d 320, 328 (3d Cir.2005). We also have jurisdiction to consider the constitutional claim that the IJ violated the petitioner\u2019s due process rights. <em>See Papageorgiou, </em>413 F.3d at 358-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">The Immigration and Nationality Act confers citizenship on children born outside of the United States to alien parents when certain statutory conditions are met. <em>See Miller v. Albright, </em>523 U.S. 420, 424, 118 S.Ct. 1428, 140 L.Ed.2d 575 (1998) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>(citing <em>United States v. Wong Kim Ark, </em>169 U.S. 649, 702, 18 S.Ct. 456, 42 L.Ed. 890 (1898), for the proposition that persons born outside of the United States may acquire United States citizenship \u201conly as provided by acts of Congress\u201d); <em>Minasyan v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 1069, 1075 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201cSince the enactment of the first naturalization statute in 1790, our immigration laws have conferred derivative citizenship on the children of a naturalized citizen, provided certain statutorily prescribed conditions are met.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The law applicable is that in effect at the time the critical events giving rise to the claim for derivative citizenship occurred. <em>Minasyan, </em>401 F.3d at 1075. The relevant times are the date of the child\u2019s birth, the time of the child\u2019s entry into the United States, and the date of the parent\u2019s naturalization. <em>See Bagot v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 252, 257 n. 3 (3d Cir.2005) (listing \u201crelevant times\u201d for derivative citizenship claims). In this case, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432 was in effect when all of the critical events occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">In relevant part, \u00a7 1432(a) provides that a \u201cchild born outside of the United States of alien parents ... becomes a citizen of the United States upon ... [t]he naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a). The child must also be under eighteen years of age at the time of the parent\u2019s naturalization and be residing in the United States as a lawful permanent resident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">Here, all of the time requirements have been satisfied and no dispute exists about \u201clegal custody\u201d of the child. The sole issue before us is whether the petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>mother was \u201clegally separated\u201d from her husband at the time of her naturalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In <em>Jordon, </em>we held that derivative citizenship had not been established because the legal separation in that case, a New York divorce, occurred after the naturalization proceeding. <em>Jordon, </em>424 F.3d at 329-30. <em>Jordon </em>specifically declined to decide the meaning of \u201clegal separation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Although this Court has not yet expressed its views on the meaning of \u201clegal separation,\u201d we considered the related concept of \u201clegal custody\u201d in <em>Bagot. </em>There, the panel concluded that in the absence of a judicial decree awarding custody, longstanding BIA precedent defining \u201clegal custody\u201d as \u201cactual uncontested custody\u201d would apply. <em>Bagot, </em>398 F.3d at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\"><em>Bagot, </em>however, clearly stated that \u201clegal separation\u201d was distinguishable from \u201clegal custody\u201d in the derivative citizenship context. <em>See id. </em>at 267. Judge Becker\u2019s opinion observed that \u201cthere is no inconsistency in requiring a court order for legal separation while allowing legal custody to be based on the consent of the parties or an undisputed physical custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Judge Rosenn\u2019s concurring opinion, joined by Judge Nygaard, agreed: \u201cThe opinion of the court also rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument -that \u2018legal custody\u2019 like \u2018legal separation,\u2019 requires a court decree. I fully agree with both propositions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Courts of appeals have held that \u00a7 1432(a)(3), as part of the INA, is subject to the constitutional requirement of a \u201cuniform Rule of Naturalization\u201d provided for in Article I, section 8 of the Constitution. <em>See, e.g., Brissett v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 130, 133-34 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Nehme v. INS, </em>252 F.3d 415, 429 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The statute, however, does not contain a definition of the term \u201clegal separation.\u201d That lacuna has led the courts to inquire to what degree state 'laws may provide the rule of decision to determine whether a couple is legally separated for purposes of \u00a7 1432(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">In <em>Nehme, </em>the Court held that \u201cin interpreting a federal statutory term, a court may devise a federal rule by reference to state law,\u201d but rejected \u201cany contention that the law of any one state should govern the determination whether an alien child\u2019s parents were legally separated.\u201d 252 F.3d at 423-24. The <em>Nehme </em>Court considered the divorce and separation laws of the fifty states and found that \u201cin the United States, the term \u2018legal separation\u2019 is uniformly understood to mean <em>judicial </em>separation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">After a review of the legislative history, the Court concluded that Congress intended to grant derivative citizenship only to children whose \u201creal interests\u201d are located in America with custodial parents. <em>Id. </em>at 425. The Court reasoned, \u201cIt makes sense ... that when the child\u2019s parents are still married, the child does not <em>automatically </em>acquire a new citizenship upon the naturalization of only one parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court thus held that when only one parent has been naturalized, \u00a7 1432(a)(3) requires a formal judicial alteration of the marital relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 425-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\"><em>Brissett </em>agreed with <em>Nehme </em>that \u201cnaturalization laws must be \u2018construed according to a federal, rather than state, standard.\u2019 \u201d 363 F.3d at 133 (quoting <em>Nehme, </em>252 F.3d at 422). <em>Brissett, </em>however, took issue with <em>Nehme\u2019&amp; </em>insistence upon a judicial decree as evidence of a legal separation, reasoning that \u201c[njothing in the language of the statute suggests the requirement of a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135 n. 3. <em>Brissett </em>declined to articulate exactly what circumstances would control, but held that at a minimum, \u201c \u2018legal separation\u2019 is satisfied only by a formal act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>which, under the laws of the state or nation having jurisdiction of the marriage, alters the marital relationship either by terminating the marriage (as by divorce) or by mandating or recognizing the separate existence of the marital parties.\u201d 363 <em>F.3d </em>at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><em>Wedderburn v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 795 (7th Cir.2000), adopted the BIA definition of \u201clegal separation\u201d: \u201ca limited or absolute divorce obtained through judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 799 (quoting <em>Matter of H, </em>3 I &amp; N Dec. 742, 744 (1949)). The Court also stated that \u201cfederal law may point to state (or foreign) law as a rule of decision.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>With respect to the issue of what law governs, the Court observed that \u201cthe INS determines the existence, validity and dissolution of wedlock using the legal rules of the place where the marriage was performed (or dissolved).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><em>Minasyan </em>also recognized the requirement of uniformity in immigration laws, but commented that where the legal relationship in question is \u201ccreated by\u201d state or foreign law, a \u201ccourt must begin its analysis by looking to that law.\u201d 401 F.3d at 1076. The Court reasoned that \u201clegal separation\u201d means \u201ca separation recognized by law,\u201d and \u201cbecause there is no federal law of domestic relations, that necessarily means a separation recognized by state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the Court held that the law of the state with jurisdiction over an alien\u2019s parents\u2019 marriage controls the determination of whether a couple is legally separated. The Court also concluded that because \u201c \u2018legal separation\u2019 cannot possibly be limited to orders expressly so titled, ... it encompasses other forms of court-ordered recognition of the final breakup of a marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1078. Because there was a court order of separation, the Court declined to consider \u201cwhether, in the absence of a judicial order, a complete and final break in a California marital relationship would constitute a legal separation within the meaning of \u00a7 321(a)(3).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1079 n. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Thus, every court of appeals that has considered the question has concluded that a \u201clegal separation\u201d requires some formal action. There remains, however, some ambiguity about what form the action must take.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\"><em>Nehme </em>took a rather restrictive view of the use of state law as a rule of decision. Other case law recognizes that since there is no federal law of domestic relations, state law should be consulted when relevant to determine the meaning of a family law term. <em>De Sylva v. Ballentine, </em>351 U.S. 570, 580, 76 S.Ct. 974, 100 L.Ed. 1415 (1956); <em>Minasyan, </em>401 F.3d at 1076. The law of a foreign country may be applicable in some instances as an alternate or in addition to state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">We are persuaded that in this case we should look to the laws of both Jamaica and Pennsylvania, the states with potential jurisdiction over the Morgans\u2019 marriage. In the circumstances here, only two governmental entities had the authority to formally modify the petitioner\u2019s parents\u2019 marital relationship. A general review of the procedures and requirements of various states, as conducted in <em>Nehme, </em>is inadequate because of the lack of focus on the forums that actually possess the power to decree that a separation recognized and enforceable by law has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">As the Supreme Court has recognized, \u201c[t]he scope of a federal right is ... a federal question, but that does not mean that its content is not to be determined by state, rather than federal law.\u201d <em>De Sylva, </em>351 U.S. at 580, 76 S.Ct. 974. Further, \u201c[T]his is especially true where a statute deals with a familial relationship.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Brea-Garcia v. INS, </em>531 F.2d 693 (3d Cir.1976), we held that the term \u201cadul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>tery\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the Immigration and Naturalization Act derives it meaning from state law, reasoning that \u201cin the absence of a federal definition of adultery, [the provision] must be construed with reference to state civil law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695. Further, we concluded that \u201cdeferring] to the state in which an alien chooses to live\u201d to define adultery is appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 697-98. Likewise, in the present case, it is appropriate to defer to the jurisdictions with authority over the marriage to determine the meaning of legal separation for purposes of \u00a7 1432(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">At the time the parties were married in 1974, Jamaica had in effect a procedure for obtaining a \u201cdecree of judicial separation.\u201d <em>See </em>Divorce Act \u00a7\u00a7 9-13 (1973) (Jamaica), <em>repealed by </em>Matrimonial Causes Act \u00a7 35(1) (1989) (Jamaica). However, in 1989 Jamaica abolished the practice and did not replace it with any similar mechanism. <em>See </em>Matrimonial Causes Act \u00a7 35(1). At the time of the petitioner\u2019s mother\u2019s naturalization in 1984, Jamaica recognized a right to a judicial separation which Jamaican law distinguished from absolute divorce; however, Jamaica required a formal court order to establish a \u201clegal separation\u201d under section 9 of its Divorce Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">There is no evidence that any Jamaican court ever issued a decree of judicial separation to the petitioner\u2019s parents. In the absence of such a judicial act, there was no \u201clegal separation\u201d under Jamaican law, although the mother had lived apart physically from her husband for four years before naturalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">During the period between the petitioner\u2019s mother\u2019s arrival in the United States and her naturalization, Pennsylvania had jurisdiction over the marriage. Pennsylvania courts may issue a decree of divorce \u201cif, at the time the action was filed, [at least one party] had been a \u2018bona fide resident\u2019 of [the] Commonwealth for a period of at least one year.... \u2018Bona fide residence\u2019 means domicile; i.e., actual residence coupled with the intention to remain there permanently or indefinitely.\u201d <em>Zinn v. Zinn, </em>327 Pa.Super. 128, 475 A.2d 132, 133 (1984) (internal citations omitted). The petitioner\u2019s mother, a lawful permanent resident of the United States residing in Philadelphia, was clearly a bona fide resident of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">A party to a Pennsylvania divorce proceeding need not be a citizen of the United States, nor is it necessary for the marriage to have occurred in the United States. <em>Sinha v. Sinha, </em>834 A.2d 600 (2003) (holding that Pennsylvania courts had jurisdiction over the dissolution of a marriage that occurred in India between two Indian citizens).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">At the time the petitioner\u2019s mother came to the United States, a Pennsylvania statute allowed a woman to seek a limited divorce, <em>a mensa et thoro, </em>from bed and board. 23 P.S. \u00a7 11. That statute was repealed in 1980 and no similar provision was enacted. The petitioner\u2019s mother, had not obtained a divorce under that statute before the naturalization occurred, nor is there any evidence that she ever sought a decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">The Pennsylvania legislature enacted a \u201cno fault\u201d divorce law in 1980. 23 Pa.C.S. A. \u00a7 3301. It provides that a court may grant a divorce when the parties \u201chave lived separate and apart for a period of at least two years\u201d and where the marriage is \u201cirretrievably broken.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Separate and apart is defined as \u201ccessation of cohabitation, whether living in the same residence or not.\u201d 23 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3103. For purposes of the Pennsylvania divorce statute, \u201cPhysical separation alone does not satisfy the separate and apart requirement....\u201d <em>Sinha v. Sinha, </em>515 Pa. 14, 526 A.2d 765, 767 (1987). An independent intent to dissolve the marital union must be \u201cclearly manifested and communicated to the other spouse.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWX\">Relying on the \u201cno fault\u201d statute, petitioner argues that because her parents lived apart for more than two years, they were legally separated under Pennsylvania law. Petitioner, however, has not established that her parents were ever living \u201cseparate and apart\u201d because there is no evidence that either party ever communicated to the other party an intention to dissolve the marital union. Further, the petitioner\u2019s argument overlooks the requirement that separation in Pennsylvania is recognized only by a divorce secured through a judicial order.</p>\n<p id=\"Au18\">Without the entry of the decree there has been no change in the legal existence of the marriage here. Petitioner has not pr\u00e9sented any evidence of a divorce between her parents and therefore her parents were not legally separated under Pennsylvania law at the time of the mother\u2019s naturalization.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5J\">Petitioner has failed to produce any evidence of a court decree or any other formal government action establishing that her parents were separated by action of law. Therefore, she has not established derivative citizenship. As <em>Brissett </em>observed, \u201cincluding an informal separation within the provision\u2019s terms would effectively eviscerate the force of the term \u2018legal\u2019 from the statute.\u201d <em>Brissett, </em>363 F.3d at 134. Furthermore, the requirement of a formal action of a competent governmental authority provides a certainty that is important to administration of the immigration laws.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2W\">We hold that a legal separation for purposes of \u00a7 1432(a) occurs only upon a formal governmental action, such as a decree issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that, under the laws of a state or nation having jurisdiction over the marriage, alters the marital relationship of the parties. In this case, the courts in both Jamaica and Pennsylvania had jurisdiction and neither decreed a separation.</p>\n<p id=\"Acq\">Petitioner also complains that the IJ improperly denied her requests for continuances of her hearing date. Aliens are entitled to due process protection during removal proceedings. <em>Kamara v. Attorney General, </em>420 F.3d 202, 211 (3d Cir.2005); <em>Xu Yong Lu v. Ashcroft, </em>259 F.3d 127, 131 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"A7N\">To establish that the IJ violated her due\u2019 process rights, petitioner must show that the IJ\u2019s decision was an abuse of discretion which caused her to suffer actu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>al prejudice. <em>Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, </em>331 F.3d 369, 374-77 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The motions for continuances requested additional time for petitioner to obtain documentation, some of which related to her most recent conviction. Petitioner explained neither the relevance of those documents nor the reason why they could not be obtained within a reasonable time. None of the requests pertained to the alleged legal separation of the petitioner\u2019s parents, the legal issue that predominates in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Petitioner has not demonstrated how any evidence she might have found would have affected the outcome of her case. She did not suffer any actual prejudice as a result of the denials of her requests for continuances and thus there was not a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">We are not persuaded that the IJ abused her discretion in denying the motions for continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The petition for review will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-5\"><em>. 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\"A child born outside of the United States of alien parents, or of an alien parent and a citizen parent who has subsequently lost citizenship of the United States, becomes a citizen of the United States upon fulfillment of the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkO\">(1) The naturalization of both parents; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">(2) The naturalization of the surviving parent if one of the parents is deceased; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">(3) The naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents or the naturalization of the mother if the child was born out of wedlock and the paternity of the child has not been established by legitimation; and if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">(4) Such naturalization takes place while such child is under the age of eighteen years; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">(5) Such child is residing in the United States pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of the naturalization of the parent last naturalized under clause (1) of this subsection, or the parent naturalized under clause (2) or (3) of this subsection, or thereafter begins to reside permanently in the United States while under the age of eighteen years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkY\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a).</p>\n<p id=\"A1Bp\">. On October 30, 2000, Congress repealed \u00a7 1432 by enacting the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Pub.L. No. 106-395, 114 stat. 1631, effective February 27, 2001. Under the new Act all children born- outside of the United States automatically obtain United States citizenship when,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABK\">\"(1) At least one parent of the child is a citizen of the United States, whether by birth or naturalization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG5q\">(2) The child is under the age of eighteen years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8P\">(3) The child is residing in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the citizen parent pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abl\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 101. The statute no longer includes a reference to legal separation of the parents. The law, however, does not apply retroactively to persons, like petitioner, who turned eighteen before Congress passed the Child Citizenship Act. <em>See Jordon v. Attorney General, </em>424 F.3d 320, 328 (3d Cir.2005) (\"Because all relevant events respecting [petitioner's] claimed derivative citizenship occurred prior to the [Child Citizenship Act\u2019s] effective date, \u00a7 1432 <em>controls our analysis.\") (citing Bagot v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 252, 257 n. 3 (3d Cir. 2005)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">. We recognize that Congress has repealed the provision of the INA, 8 XJ.S.C. 1101(f)(2), that provided that adultery was grounds for removal of an alien. <em>See </em>Pub.L. 97-116, \u00a7 2(c)(1), Dec. 29, 1981, 95 Stat. 1611. This does not affect our analysis of what law may provide the rule of decision in interpreting a federal statutory term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A7V\">. We need not decide whether a divorce decree within two years following the petitioner's mother\u2019s naturalization and effective before the petitioner's 18th birthday might have acted as a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>court order establishing a prior legal separation. The record establishes that the petitioner's parents never sought a divorce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A84\">. The formal action need not necessarily be a judicial decree. A state or foreign nation, for example, could allow an administrative agency or other governmental body to issue orders of separation. There is nothing in the language of the statute that requires that a court must act for a legal separation to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac8\">Conceivably, some jurisdictions might consider parties \"legally separated\u201d if they lived apart for a period of time without seeking any governmental imprimatur. We know of no jurisdiction that has adopted such a policy and we leave that issue for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
