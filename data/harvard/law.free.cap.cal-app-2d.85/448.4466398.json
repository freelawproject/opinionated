Defendants pleaded not guilty and waived a jury trial. The court adjudged appellant guilty as charged in both counts. Appellant made a motion for a new trial which was denied. The appeal is from the judgment and from the order denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">While Deputy Sheriffs Hines, McKinney and Jones were sitting in an automobile near the corner of Atlantic and Whittier Boulevards a coup\u00e9 approached from the west on Whittier Boulevard and defendant Boulad, who had been standing near the corner, walked into the crosswalk, stepped onto the running board of the coup\u00e9, and motioned with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>right arm. The eoup\u00e9 turned into Atlantic Boulevard and stopped after proceeding about a half block. The officers followed and stopped beside the coup\u00e9, which was being driven by appellant. Defendant Mathews was seated at the right-hand side and a woman named Frances was seated between the men. As the coup\u00e9 stopped Boulad stepped off the running board. Officer Hines observed defendant Mathews throw a black article from the right-hand window of the eoup\u00e9. Hines immediately got out of the officers\u2019 car and grabbed Mathews, who said that appellant had told him to throw the object away in the event they were stopped. Appellant made no reply to this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Officer McKinney recovered the black article, which proved to be a woman\u2019s glove containing a white envelope in which were enclosed 13 packages or bindles. It was stipulated that the bindles contained heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The three defendants and Frances were taken to the sheriff\u2019s substation for questioning. One of the officers testified that the statements made by the parties were all free and voluntary without hope of immunity or reward and free from threats of force or violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Before admitting evidence of the conversation, the court, at the request of appellant\u2019s counsel, heard testimony on <em>voir dire </em>on the question whether or not the statements of appellant were free and voluntary. Thereupon appellant testified that the conversation at the substation lasted four or five hours and was engaged in by several officers. They questioned him about the package that had been thrown from the window, about telephone calls and other matters. He refused to answer the questions. Frances, who was his fianc\u00e9e, was in custody at the time. Appellant stated that after a few hours the officers told him that if he did not talk they would lock Frances up and she would not see her baby for a year; that while resting his chin on his arm one of the officers knocked his arm from the table; that he saw the officers talking with Frances and believed that she would be released if he answered the questions; that he then made his statement to the officers and Frances was released from custody. Frances gave similar testimony. Officer Hines denied that appellant was told that Frances would be locked up and that she would not see her baby for a year unless appellant talked; that no one struck or threatened appellant or knocked his arm from the table. Two other officers testified to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Upon completion of the hearing on <em>voir dire </em>the court overruled the objection to the evidence as to the conversation. Officer Hines then testified that Boulad and Mathews made certain statements in the presence of appellant; that appellant at first refused to answer as to the truth of the statements and then said he would talk if everybody except Hines left the room. Appellant then stated to Hines that he had procured $300 from his aunt and used it to purchase a half ounce of heroin in Mexico, brought it back to Los Angeles and had it rolled into bindles; that he took the narcotic to his car and he, Prances and Mathews drove to the point where they were arrested; that he gave the glove containing the narcotic to Mathews and told him to throw it away in the event they were stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Prances testified that she saw the glove in question on the night of the arrest of appellant and his codefendants, and that it quite possibly was hers. Officer Hines testified that a second black glove, similar to the one which was thrown from the car, was found in the coup\u00e9 occupied by appellant, Mathews and Prances. Both gloves were introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Mathews, testifying in his own behalf, stated that he was riding with appellant and Frances; that Boulad stepped on the running board and told appellant \u201cto pull around the corner and stop,\u201d which appellant did; that within a few seconds Mathews heard appellant say, \u201cTake it;\u201d that without thinking he, Mathews, took the object, which he saw to be a glove with something like paper in it; that appellant said, \u201cIf we are stopped throw that out the window;\u201d Mathews asked \u201cWhat for?\u201d Appellant replied, \u201cNever mind asking questions, just throw it out if we are stopped;\u201d that when the sheriff\u2019s car came alongside the coup\u00e9 appellant whispered, \u201cThrow it,\u201d and Mathews threw it. Mathews denied that he knew the contents of the glove.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Boulad testified in his own behalf. He admitted that he stepped on the running board of the coup\u00e9 and said that appellant told Mathews to take a package and to throw it.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Appellant denied having given Mathews a glove, denied haying told him to throw it out if anything happened, and denied knowing that there were narcotics in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The foregoing statement negates appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Whether a confession is free and voluntary is a preliminary question to be determined by the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Siemsen, </em>153 Cal. 387, 394 [95 P. <em>863]; People </em>v. <em>Ferdinand, </em>194 Cal. 555, 567 [229 P. 341].) Where there is a conflict of evidence as to whether confessions had been freely and voluntarily made the determination of the question rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge, and if it is supported by substantial evidence his finding is binding upon a reviewing court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>38 Cal.App.2d 96, 98 [100 P.2d 791].) The ruling of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal unless there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roebling, </em>14 Cal.App.2d 586, 588 [58 P.2d 929].)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The fact that a confession may have been made after the accused had been interrogated for many hours does not render his statements involuntary. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McEvers, </em>53 Cal.App.2d 448, 451 [128 P.2d 93].) When the evidence is in conflict on the question of freedom from coercion the determination of that question by the trier of facts will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kazarian, </em>83 Cal.App.2d 471, 472 [189 P.2d 39] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>81 Cal.App. 752, 757 [254 P. 666]; <em>Lisenba </em>v. <em>California, </em>314 U.S. 219, 238 [62 S.Ct. 280, 86 L.Ed. 166].)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We find no error in the admission of appellant\u2019s confession. It may be added that the evidence concerning the movement of the coup\u00e9 driven by appellant and the glove containing narcotics, together with the testimony given by appellant\u2019s codefendants Mathews and Boulad, is sufficient to sustain the judgment of conviction even if there had been no confession by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Appellant contends that the court erred in admitting in evidence the accusatory statement made by defendant Mathews in appellant\u2019s presence after Mathews had thrown the glove from the coup\u00e9 and had been grabbed by officers. When the officer was asked to repeat Mathews\u2019 statement objection was made to the conversation and the objection was sustained. Later, when the officer was asked what Mathews said, he related Mathews\u2019 statement and, without objection from appellant, testified that appellant did not say anything in response to what Mathews had said. Objection was made after the answer had been given. The objection was overruled subject to a motion to strike. No motion to strike the evidence was made. If a witness answers so quickly that an objection cannot be made a motion to strike the answer is the proper remedy. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>165 Cal. 645, 652-3 [133 P. 298]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Dong Pok Yip, </em>164 Cal. 143, 149 [127 P. 1031].) A failure to move to strike the evidence is a waiver of any objection that might have been made to its admission. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guiterez, </em>126 Cal.App. 526, 530 [14 P.2d 838] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewandowski, </em>143 Cal. 574, 579 [77 P. 467].)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The final objection made by appellant is that the evidence is insufficient to establish the corpus delicti of the offense charged in the information. Aside from appellant\u2019s confession the evidence shows that he was in possession of a narcotic and was transporting it (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11500) for the purpose of disposing of it to another person or persons and that he had knowledge of the character of the material in his possession. The trier of facts having determined the elements of the crime that were established by the evidence it will not be set aside on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bassett, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 241, 246 [156 P.2d 457].)  Neither intent nor knowledge is an element of the offense. The mere possession is a violation of the statute and the only perfect defense is a valid prescription under the act. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>133 Cal.App. 192, 196 [23 P.2d 777]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>66 Cal.App.2d 855, 859 [153 P.2d 371].)  The evidence that appellant was in possession of the glove containing the narcotic and that while they were riding in the automobile he handed the glove to Mathews with instructions to throw it if they were stopped, supports the judgment that he was unlawfully in possession of the heroin and that he was transporting it in violation of the law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Randolph, supra. ) </em> The order of proof is within the discretion of</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">the trial judge and a defendant may not complain because proof of the corpus delicti did not precede the evidence of an admission or confession. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Housman, </em>44 Cal.App.2d 619, 627 [112 P.2d 944] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>138 Cal.App. 652, 656-7 [33 P.2d 77] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>139 Cal.App. 543, 545 [34 P.2d 741].)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">The judgment and the order denying appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial are and each is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Moore, P. J., and McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
