A jury being waived, the matter was tried by the court upon a stipulation that the cause be submitted on the testimony presented at the preliminary examination, subject to the right to present other evidence. After reading the transcript of the preliminary examination and listening to additional evidence, the trial court found the defendant guilty of manslaughter; a motion for a new trial was denied and the defendant sentenced to State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The record discloses that the defendant, Jesus Toledo, and one Pedro Mendez, lived in a small, two-room shack in El Monte, California; that on the evening of February 22, 1947, the deceased, Andres Lopez, a friend, came over to the shack. Joe Lopez, a neighbor, and not related to the deceased, was also present several times during the evening, the last time being about 1 a. m. Sunday, February 23d. The parties were all Mexicans; the age of the deceased was 62 while the defendant was 38 years old. There was considerable drinking during the evening,- and according to the testimony of Joe Lopez, about one o\u2019clock Sunday morning, the defendant and the deceased were both intoxicated. It appears that at this time the defendant, who was either sitting or lying on the bed, requested Andres Lopez, the deceased, to be quiet, or to leave, whereupon the deceased struck'the defendant over the head with a bottle, breaking the bottle. Joe Lopez then upbraided the deceased for striking the defendant, and testified: \u201cI told him he shouldn\u2019t do it, that it wasn\u2019t right. And right at the time he (the deceased) took his knife out. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>. . . He had it in his hand with the knife open.\u201d This knife is elsewhere referred to as a \u201cBoy Scout\u201d knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Following this initial difficulty, Joe Lopez started to go home and was followed out of the shack by the deceased who then, after an obscene comment, struck with the knife and knocked Joe Lopez to the ground. The latter testified that a wrist cut resulted from this assault, and in the language of appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cAs Joe Lopez got free of the deceased he picked up a piece of board lying on the ground and as the deceased again advanced with the knife, he struck the deceased with the board, \u201d and then ran home.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">There is evidence that the defendant, hearing the sound of the struggle outside the door, went out, took hold of the deceased\u2019s collar, and pulled the deceased away from Joe Lopez. According to the defendant, the deceased struck at defendant with the knife, cutting a leather jacket worn by the latter. Jesus Toledo, the defendant, then picked up a piece of pipe which was on the ground near by, and struck the deceased twice as deceased advanced with the knife. With the striking of the second blow the deceased fell to the ground. It was the defendant\u2019s testimony that there was no intent to kill, and upon being asked, \u201cWhy did you kill him?,\u2019\u2019replied \u201cBecause if he killed me I was afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The defendant first covered the deceased with a piece of canvas; later on, on concluding that Andres Lopez was dead, defendant and Pedro Mendez buried the body in a shallow excavation near by. Defendant slept under a bridge Sunday afternoon and night, went to Los Angeles the next day, and on the third day took a bus to King City, remaining there until arrested May 8, 1947. There is evidence that when arrested the defendant denied being in El Monte or knowing the deceased. Later defendant made a statement to the officers which was in substantial conformity with the testimony at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">On this appeal it is contended that \u201cthe verdict of the trial court finding the defendant guilty of the crime of manslaughter is contrary to and unsupported by the evidence,\u201d and that such verdict \u201cis contrary to the law.\u201d The gist of appellant\u2019s argument is that \u201cWhere the undisputed evidence shows that the deceased had attacked the defendant with a knife and had shortly prior thereto attacked the defendant with a bottle, the defendant was justified in defending himself and even taking the life of the aggressor where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>there is no evidence of undue advantage.\u201d In this connection appellant claims that \u201cthe evidence presented in behalf of the people in itself proves that the conduct of the defendant toward the deceased was that conduct defined in Section 197 of the Penal Code and for which there is no criminal responsibility,\u201d and that under section 1105 of that code, \u201cthere was no necessity for the defendant to present any evidence in his own behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Section 1105 of the Penal Code provides that \u201cthe burden of proving circumstances of mitigation, or that justify or excuse it (the homicide) devolves upon him (the defendant), <em>unless the proof on the part of the prosecution tends to show that the crime committed only amounts to manslaughter, or that the defendant was justifiable or excusable.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The respondent insists that \u201cThe evidence is sufficient to sustain the judgment, as a matter of law and fact, and that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Justifiable homicide, as defined in section 197 of the Penal Code, includes homicide committed \u201c1. When resisting any attempt to murder any person, or to commit a felony, or to do some great bodily injury upon any person; or, 2. When committed in defense of habitation, property or person, against one who manifestly intends or endeavors, by violence or surprise, to commit a felony,\u201d etc.; \u201cor 3. When committed in the lawful defense of such person . . . when there is reasonable ground to apprehend a design to commit a felony or to do some great bodily injury, and imminent danger of such design being accomplished; but such person, ... if he was the assailant or engaged in mutual combat, must really and in good faith have endeavored to decline any further struggle before the homicide was committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The right of necessary self-defense, long recognized and protected by the law, obviously deals with an emergency situation in which a certain degree of elasticity is essential if the defense is to be of any practical value to the person assaulted. For example, it is well established that reasonably apparent danger, as distinguished from actual danger, may be sufficient to justify a killing in self-defense.  Likewise, as appellant\u2019s brief points out, the defense need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt or even by a preponderance of the evidence. In the language of <em>People </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>43 Cal.App.2d 40, 44 [110 P.2d 98], \u201cit is necessary only that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>fendant produce evidence the weight of which is sufficient to create in the minds of the jurors a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the alleged circumstances which justified the homicide. \u2019 \u2019 There can, of course, be no doubt that these rules apply as forcibly in a case tried by a judge as in one where a jury is empanelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In the instant case, as appellant\u2019s brief asserts, \u201cthe record is silent of any evidence to bring home to the defendant any violent act committed by him toward the deceased,\u201d other than that done in repelling the knife assault of the deceased. \u201cUnless,\u201d as appellant says, \u201cwe arbitrarily see fit to believe only those words of the defendant\u2019s statement and testimony wherein he acknowledges striking the decedent and disbelieve all the rest of his statement and testimony and further disbelieve the testimony of other witnesses as to the circumstances leading up to the blows being struck by Toledo, it cannot be determined that a criminal homicide was committed. The prosecution having presented as a part of its case the statement of the defendant which justified the homicide is bound by that evidence in the absence of proof to the contrary. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In this connection may be noted the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Salaz, </em>66 Cal.App. 173, 181 [225 P. 777], where the court said: \u201cThe jury could not have found, from the evidence for the people, that the killing was done by appellant except upon the latter\u2019s admissions, which carried, in close and immediate connection with proof of the killing, circumstances of necessary self-defense. ... No presumption of guilt weighed against the presumption of innocence.\u201d So also in <em>People </em>v. <em>Estrada, </em>60 Cal.App. 477, 482 [213 P. 67], the court made use of the same doctrine and said: \u201cAs the defendant pictured the encounter, no particular interval of time elapsed between the acts of assault committed by deceased until the fatal blow was struck. There was no duty resting upon the defendant to retreat under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Prom the record herein it is indicated that the previous relations between the deceased and the defendant had been of a friendly nature, but that on the occasion in question the deceased was quarrelsome and threatening; that the deceased inaugurated the difficulty by breaking a wine bottle over the defendant\u2019s head; that immediately thereafter the deceased violently assaulted another member of the party, Joe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Lopez, with a knife; that defendant attempted to intervene, whereupon the deceased, as testified to by the defendant on cross-examination, \u201ccame toward me with a knife, and then was the time I fell. ... He came toward me and I picked up the pipe. . . . He turned around and struck at me toward here (indicating the neck). ... I only got it and told him not to\u2014that I didn\u2019t want to fight. He told me he was going to kill me, and then is the time that he struck at me.\u201d On direct examination the defendant had previously stated: \u201cI told him that I didn\u2019t want to fight, and he still came toward me with the knife, and when I felt that he cut me it was the time when I hit him.\u201d As hereinbefore indicated the defendant\u2019s jacket showed a knife cut almost entirely across the left side of the jacket, \u201cacross the abdomen.\u201d The defendant also testified that the deceased struck with the knife \u201cmany\u201d times before the jacket cut was made, \u201cbut I got away from him.\u201d In answer to the inquiry, \u201cYou kept backing away from him, did you?,\u201d the defendant replied, \u201cYes, very much. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The following excerpt from appellant\u2019s brief, is eminently pertinent: \u201cCan it be reasonably urged that such an attack was not more than sufficient to create in the mind of any reasonable person the very positive belief that the person so assaulted was in great danger of death or sustaining great bodily harm ? This was no apparent danger. This was a very real and substantial danger.\u201d The record nowhere indicates that the killing was perpetrated \u201cin a spirit of revenge for the assault previously made upon him (defendant) in the shack with a bottle,\u201d as suggested by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Respondent\u2019s brief lays considerable stress upon alleged \u201cincriminating\u201d circumstances such as the fact that after burying the body, defendant fled to King City, and when apprehended more than two months later at first denied knowing the deceased or being in El Monte at the time in question. While doubtless, circumstances of flight, etc., may, in a proper case, furnish some evidence of guilt, particularly where the defendant\u2019s identity is in question, in the instant case and as bearing on the issue of self-defense, such facts cannot be deemed indicative of guilt. As appellant\u2019s brief suggests, these circumstances may easily be accounted for \u201cas the act of an ignorant, frightened person of Mexican national origin.\u201d In the final analysis, defendant\u2019s conviction is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The order appealed from is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">York, P. J., and White, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 3, 1948, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 17, 1948. Shenk, J., and Edmonds, J., voted for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
