Johnson, deceased, the probate of which was set aside by the trial court on the ground of incompetency and undue influence. The salient facts of the case, as stated in the appellant\u2019s brief, are as follows: \u201cFrom 1902 until the death of George C. Johnson on April 26, 1932, ... E. A. Miller, whose widow and executrix brings this appeal, was attorney for George C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>Johnson .... Mr. Miller probated his estate for his widow . . . and acted as her attorney until her death 12 years later on July 29, 1944, she being at that time 87 years of age. She had no relatives. On June 25, 1936, when 79 years of age, she executed a Will leaving her residuary estate to two charities, to wit: the Contestants-Respondents herein. . . . On December 18, 1940, . . . Elizabeth M. Johnson executed a Codicil to her said Will, by which she left the residuary estate to said E. A. Miller (attorney), who passed away shortly after the judgment herein appealed from was entered. Testatrix lived for approximately three and one-half years after this Codicil was executed. This Codicil was probated together with the Will, and thereafter the said charities . . . brought this proceeding to set aside the probate of the Codicil on the double ground of incompetency and undue influence.\u201d The case was tried without a jury and resulted in a judgment setting aside probate of the codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The trial court was \u201cof the opinion (that) Mrs. Elizabeth M. Johnson at the time of the execution of the purported codicil was not of sound and disposing mind and memory and that she was at that time acting under fraud and undue influence of E. A. Miller.\u201d In reference to undue influence the trial judge relied upon <em>Estate of Witt, </em>198 Cal. 407, 419 [245 P. 197], holding that \u201cwhere the relation of attorney and client existed between testatrix and the beneficiary under the will, the burden of proof is upon the defendant (attorney) to overcome the presumption of fraud and unfair dealing. All dealings between an attorney and his client for the benefit of the former are not only closely scrutinized but are presumably invalid on the ground of conscious fraud; and such presumption is to be overcome only by the clearest and most satisfactory evidence that the transaction was fair and equitable and no advantage was taken .by the attorney, and that the client was fully informed of all matters relative to the transaction and was so placed as to be able to act understandingly and to deal with the attorney at arm\u2019s length. A presumption of undue influence arises from proof of the existence of a confidential relation between the testatrix and the beneficiary coupled with the activity on the part of the latter in the preparation of the will. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">In reference to the mental condition of the testatrix, the evidence was in conflict. A number of \u201cintimate acquaintances\u201d testified that the testatrix was mentally incompetent, the reasons given for such opinion being that Mrs. Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>was feeble and forgetful, childish, rambling in conversation, ragged, dirty and unkempt in person. Some of these witnesses testified that in 1940, testatrix seemed irrational, but at times was fairly rational; Mrs. Johnson is also characterized as a woman of fixed opinions and very stubborn. Other witnesses, including a physician and a nurse, expressed the opinion that testatrix was sane up to the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Concerning the attorney\u2019s active participation in the making of the codicil, the record discloses that Attorney Miller and Mrs. Nelle Phillips who for many years had acted as secretary to the attorney, went to the home of testatrix (at the latter\u2019s repeated requests, according to the testimony of the attorney and secretary,) whereupon testatrix stated that the attorney was to be substituted as residuary legatee in place of the two charities mentioned in the will. Attorney Miller and Mrs. Phillips then returned to the attorney\u2019s office where Mrs. Phillips prepared the codicil which was to effect the desired substitution; several days later Mr. Miller and Mrs. Phillips went to testatrix\u2019 residence and the codicil was executed before Mrs. Phillips and one J. A. Kirkham as witnesses. According to the appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cMr. Miller took no active part in the transaction although it is a fact that he was present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that (1), \u201cThe evidence of incompetency introduced by respondent is insufficient to uphold the judgment on that ground\u201d; (2), \u201cAssuming that respondents made out a prima facie case of incompetency the clear evidence to the contrary offered by appellant more than overcomes it\u201d; and (3), that the judgment \u201ccannot be sustained on the ground of undue influence because there is no actual evidence thereof, no presumption thereof in this ease and any possible presumption is overcome by appellant\u2019s evidence.\u201d In this connection appellant argues that Attorney Miller did not \u201cactively participate\u201d in the composition of the codicil; therefore that the presumption mentioned in <em>Estate of Witt, supra, </em>does not apply. On the other hand, the respondent\u2019s brief avers that \u201cThere was ample evidence introduced to support the judgment of the lower court holding that Elizabeth M. Johnson, deceased, was incompetent when the codicil was signed,\u201d and that \u201cThe evidence .as well as the law supports the finding below of undue influence exercised by the (attorney) beneficiary of the purported codicil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\"><em> </em>As stated in respondent\u2019s brief, \u201cThe trial court had an opportunity to study the demeanor of all the witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>and ... his written opinion indicates the impression they (contestant\u2019s witnesses) made upon him in contrast to that made by proponent\u2019s witnesses. The rule of law that an Appellate Court will not reverse a lower Court when there is a direct conflict of testimony when there is sufficient evidence to sustain the opinion of that lower Court is too well known to require any citation of authorities.\u201d That the record herein discloses substantial evidence to support the decision of the trial court cannot well be doubted. Such being the case, and notwithstanding the conflict in testimony concerning the decedent\u2019s mental condition, there can be no appellate review of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The written opinion of the trial court, after reviewing the evidence, concludes that \u201cFrom the testimony of the above witnesses it can very easily be inferred that Mrs. Johnson long had intended to remember the two organizations in her will and when she did in fact execute the will on January 25, 1936, it was but the culmination in action of a long and many times expressed desire to provide for them.\u201d Such disposition also represented \u201cthe expressed desire of a deceased spouse from whom all of the property came.\u201d The trial court further observes that the alteration of such a will \u201cis not apt to be made except for one of two reasons. First, some act on the part of the beneficiary which alienated the affections of the testator. Secondly, influence or pressure brought to bear by or on behalf of another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">In this connection it is to he noted that Attorney Miller testified that shortly before the codicil was made, Mrs. Johnson \u201csaid she did not want them (the two charitable organizations) to receive what was left of her estate, because they had done nothing at all for her and she said I had done so much for her that she wanted me to receive what was left after the special bequests of her furniture and furnishings.\u201d Apparently, the two organizations had done nothing to antagonize the deceased, unless, as said by the trial court, \u201cit be the failure to do something which under no circumstances they could do,\u201d since one of the organizations was an orphanage and the other an institution for handicapped children.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The essential facts in <em>Estate of Witt, </em>198 Cal. 407 [245 P. 197], are strikingly similar to those of the instant case. In both cases the beneficiaries were attorneys occupying close confidential relationships with testatrix; both ladies were of weak or impaired mentality, personally unkempt and inclined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>to rambling conversation. In the Witt case the will, drafted in the attorney\u2019s office, as was the codicil in the present case, was witnessed by the attorney\u2019s employees, one of whom testified that the attorney was in the room and talked to Mrs. Witt about the will before it was executed. In the instant case it will be remembered that Attorney Miller and the secretary, Mrs. Phillips, first called on Mrs. Johnson in reference to the codicil; after same had been drafted in the attorney\u2019s office both returned to Mrs. Johnson\u2019s home where the instrument was executed with Mrs. Phillips acting as one of the subscribing witnesses, and in the attorney\u2019s presence. In answer to a question whether Miller said anything about making the codicil, the attorney finally said: \u201cVery well. I may have mentioned it to her (the secretary) to go ahead and prepare the codicil. Most likely did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">In the light of the above and other evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the execution of the codicil making the attorney the principal beneficiary, it is useless to contend that there is no evidence of \u201cactive participation\u201d on the part of the attorney. In this state of the record, the rule expressed in the Witt case is clearly applicable; namely, that \u201cA presumption of undue influence arises from proof of the existence of a confidential relation between the testatrix and the beneficiary coupled with the activity on the part of the latter in the preparation of the will, \u201d or as in the instant ease, the codicil. The weight and credibility of the testimony claimed to rebut such presumption was, of course, a question for the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">York, P. J., and White, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
