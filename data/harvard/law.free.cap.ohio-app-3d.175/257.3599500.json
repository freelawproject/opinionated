Ferron, statutory damages, costs, and attorney fees under Ohio\u2019s Consumer Sales Practices Act (\u201cOCSPA\u201d) as a result of RadioShack\u2019s unfair or deceptive acts or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>practices, in violation of R.C. 1345.02. The complaint asserted that RadioShack provided plaintiff electronically printed receipts that violated R.C. 1349.18 by displaying the expiration date of his debit card. Because we must remand for the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether federal preemption bars plaintiffs state-law claims underlying this appeal, we vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment, not reaching the merits of RadioShack\u2019s assigned errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 2} As a result of the parties\u2019 stipulation in the trial court, the facts are largely undisputed. In September and October 2005, plaintiff made seven separate purchases of merchandise at various RadioShack stores in the Columbus area, each time using his debit card to pay for the items. For each transaction, RadioShack issued plaintiff an electronically printed receipt that displayed the expiration date of plaintiffs debit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 3} On March 7, 2006, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Franklin County Municipal Court seeking relief under the OCSPA. Specifically, plaintiff alleged that RadioShack committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of R.C. 1345.02(A) each time it provided him a receipt containing his debit card\u2019s expiration date, though plaintiff did not allege that he experienced resulting identity theft or economic loss. Plaintiff predicated his OCSPA claims on an express determination in <em>Kimmel v. Ulrey Foods, Inc. </em>(Apr. 27, 2005), Franklin Cty. M.C. No. 2005-CVH-006795, a consent judgment filed in the Ohio Attorney General\u2019s Public Inspection File in accordance with R.C. 1345.05(A)(3) prior to the consumer transactions at issue here. In <em>Kimmel, </em>the court held that a merchant violates the truncation requirements contained in R.C. 1349.18, and thus commits an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of R.C. 1345.02, when the receipt the merchant prints and provides to the customer bears the expiration date of a debit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">{\u00b6 4} Pursuant to R.C. 1345.09, plaintiff requested an award of $200 in statutory damages for each of RadioShack\u2019s seven violations of R.C. 1345.02(A), as well as costs and reasonable attorney fees. In addition to monetary relief, plaintiff requested the trial court to issue a declaratory judgment \u201c[tjhat it is an unfair and deceptive act or practice, and a violation of R.C. 1345.02(A), for a supplier to print the expiration date of a consumer\u2019s debit or credit card on any receipt provided to the cardholder who is a consumer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">{\u00b6 5} RadioShack moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), or alternatively, for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Civ.R. 12(C). RadioShack conceded that a consumer need establish only a violation of a statute to seek recovery under the OCSPA. R.C. 1345.09; <em>Whitaker v. M.T. Automotive, Inc., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 177, 2006-Ohio-5481, 855 N.E.2d 825, at \u00b6 17; <em>Crye v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number><em>Smolak </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 504, 674 N.E.2d 779. RadioShack, however, contended that R.C. 1349.18 requires more. According to RadioShack, R.C. 1349.18 requires that the violation cause injury before a person may seek relief for a violation of the statute\u2019s truncation requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">{\u00b6 6} With that predicate, RadioShack thus argued that plaintiff both lacked standing and failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because he did not allege or establish actual injury, such as identify theft or unauthorized purchases made on his debit card. In response, plaintiff asserted he has a legally protected right under R.C. 1349.18 to receive a receipt without his debit card\u2019s expiration date printed on it. Plaintiff contended that RadioShack\u2019s violation of that statutory right constitutes legal injury that confers standing upon plaintiff and supports his claims. Without ruling on RadioShack\u2019s motions, the trial court ordered the parties to submit stipulations of fact and trial briefs on the legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">{\u00b6 7} In its March 23, 2007 decision, the trial court declared that RadioShack violated R.C. 1349.18 and thus committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of Section 1345.02 of the OCSPA, when it printed plaintiffs debit card expiration date on the receipts it provided to him. Noting that \u201c[ijnjury is broadly defined through its common and ordinary meaning,\u201d the court determined that plaintiff had been \u201cinjured by the violations\u201d and therefore was entitled to relief provided in R.C. 1345.09. After conducting an evidentiary hearing on the issue of attorney fees, the court entered judgment awarding plaintiff statutory damages of $200 for each of the seven OCSPA violations that plaintiff had alleged, attorney fees and costs in the amount of $3,937.27, plus interest from the date of judgment, and a declaratory judgment that RadioShack committed unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of R.C. 1345.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">{\u00b6 8} RadioShack appeals, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">1. The trial court erred in finding that plaintiff-appellee John W. Ferron pleaded or established injury sufficient to support his Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act claims premised on violations of the failure-to-truncate statute and in declaring that RadioShack violated the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">2. The trial court erred in implicitly finding that Mr. Ferron pleaded or established injury sufficient to fulfill the \u201cjusticiable matter\u201d requirement of Article IV, Section 4(B) of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-11\">3. The trial court erred in awarding Mr. Ferron his costs and attorney\u2019s fees and finding that his attorney\u2019s fees were reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>III. The Truncation Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">{\u00b6 9} RadioShack\u2019s first assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred as a matter of law in determining that RadioShack violated R.C. 1349.18, and thus committed unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of R.C. 1345.02(A), when it provided plaintiff with electronically printed receipts that displayed the expiration date of his debit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 1349.18, commonly referred to as Ohio\u2019s truncation statute, was signed into law by Ohio\u2019s governor on January 2, 2003, and became effective on July 1, 2004. Like similar state and federal statutes, the purpose of R.C. 1349.18 appears to be curtailing identify theft. The statute, which \u201capplies only to receipts that are electronically printed,\u201d provides that no person or limited liability company that accepts credit or debit cards in transacting business \u201cshall print more than the last five digits\u201d of the credit or debit card account number, \u201cor print the expiration date\u201d of a credit or debit card, on any receipt it provides to the cardholder. R.C. 1349.18(A) and (B). According to R.C. 1349.18(C), violation of the section \u201cis deemed an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of section 1345.02 of the Revised Code,\u201d giving a \u201cperson injured by a violation * * * a cause of action\u201d and entitlement \u201cto the same relief available to a consumer under section 1345.09 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">{\u00b6 11} As in the trial court, RadioShack contends on appeal that unlike the OCSPA, which requires a consumer to establish merely a violation of a statute in order to seek relief under its provisions, R.C. 1349.18(C) incorporates a specific injury requirement in stating that only a \u201cperson injured by a violation\u201d of the statute is entitled to assert a cause of action and seek relief for a truncation violation. RadioShack argues that the trial court obviated R.C. 1349.18\u2019s specific injury requirement when it found that RadioShack\u2019s violations of R.C. 1349.18 injured plaintiff. RadioShack asserts that the trial court should have dismissed plaintiffs claims because, without any showing of actual, tangible injury resulting from RadioShack\u2019s noncompliance with R.C. 1349.18, plaintiff was not a person \u201cinjured by a violation\u201d of the truncation statute and thus was not entitled to seek relief under the OCSPA for violations of R.C. 1349.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">IY. Preemption Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">{\u00b6 12} At the outset, we note the issue subject of the parties\u2019 supplemental briefing: whether federal legislation that, like Ohio\u2019s truncation statute, requires merchants to truncate credit and debit card information on electronically printed receipts given to customers preempts and precludes plaintiffs claims under Ohio law. Examination of the issue revolves around the language of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (\u201cFACTA\u201d) amendment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) codified at Section 1681c(g), Title 15, TJ.S.Code (\u201cSection 1681c[g]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">{\u00b6 13} Congress enacted the FCRA in 1970 \u201cto ensure fair and accurate credit reporting, promote efficiency in the banking system, and protect consumer privacy.\u201d <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr </em>(2007), \u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2201, 2205, 167 L.Ed.2d 1045. Following the lead of several states, including Ohio, Congress enacted the FACTA in December 2003, in part to combat the growing problem of identify theft and to \u201censure the operational efficiency of our national credit system by creating a number of preemptive national standards.\u201d 108 P.L. 159 (2003); H.R. Conf. Rep. 108-396 (2003), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 2003, p. 1753, 1754; <em>Korman v. Walking Co. </em>(E.D.Pa.2007), 503 F.Supp.2d 755, 757; <em>Iosello v. Leiblys, Inc. </em>(N.D.Ill.2007), 502 F.Supp.2d 782, 786. See generally Epshteyn, The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003: Will Preemption of State Credit Reporting Laws Harm Consumers? (2005), 93 Geor.L.J. 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">{\u00b6 14} Consistent with congressional intent and Ohio\u2019s statutory truncation requirements, Section 1681c(g)(l) expressly provides that \u201c[n]o person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of the sale or transaction.\u201d As in Ohio, the federal truncation requirements apply only to electronically printed receipts. Section 1681c(g)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">{\u00b6 15} Under the federal scheme, a \u201cconsumer\u201d has a private right of action against \u201cany person\u201d who either \u201cwillfully fails to comply\u201d or is \u201cnegligent in failing to comply\u201d with any FCRA requirement, as amended by the FACTA. Sections 1681n and 1681o; <em>Arcilla v. Adidas Promotional Retail Operations, Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal.2007), 488 F.Supp.2d 965, 969; <em>Nelson v. Chase Manhattan Mtge. Corp. </em>(C.A.9, 2002), 282 F.3d 1057, 1059. If noncompliance with a requirement is negligent, the affected consumer is entitled to recover actual damages as well as the costs of the action and reasonable attorney fees. Section 1681o(a). If noncompliance is willful, the affected consumer is entitled to recover actual damages <em>or </em>statutory damages between $100 and $1,000, punitive damages as the court allows, plus the costs of the action and reasonable attorney fees. Section 1681n. See also <em>Safeco, </em>\u2014U.S. at-, 127 S.Ct. at 2206, 167 L.Ed.2d 1045; <em>Korman, </em>503 F.Supp.2d at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">{\u00b6 16} A person may commence an action to enforce any liability created under the FCRA, as amended by the FACTA, in any appropriate United States district court or \u201cany other court of competent jurisdiction}.]\u201d Section 1681p.

Lifetime Brands, Inc. </em>(E.D.Pa.2007), 498 F.Supp.2d 753, 755-756; <em>Arcilla, </em>488 F.Supp.2d at 972-974; <em>Follman v. Village </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>Squire, Inc. </em>(N.D.Ill.2007), No. 07C3767, 2007 WL 4522614 (all determining that an affected consumer seeking statutory damages for a violation of the federal statutes has standing to assert a claim without showing actual injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">{\u00b6 17} Congress provided that the federal truncation requirements would take effect in two phases. Cash registers or machines that electronically print receipts for credit or debit card transactions and first put into use on or after January 1, 2005, were required to comply with the truncation requirements immediately. Those in use before that date were required to comply with the truncation requirements by December 4, 2006. See Section 1681c(g)(3); <em>Arcilla, </em>488 F.Supp.2d at 969. Because Congress included a preemption clause in the relevant provisions, we must address preemption before we address RadioShack\u2019s assigned errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">{\u00b6 18} As this court recently noted in <em>Charvat v. Telelytics, L.L.C., </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-1279, 2006-Ohio-4623, 2006 WL 2574019, at \u00b6 23, \u201c[t]he Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that \u2018the Laws of the United States * * * shall be the supreme Law of the Land; * * * any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding/ Article VI, United States Constitution.\u201d We noted that the critical question in any preemption analysis is whether Congress intended federal law to supersede state law. Id. at \u00b6 24, citing <em>In re Miamisburg </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 255, 260, 626 N.E.2d 85. In considering issues arising under the Supremacy Clause, \u201ccourts must start with a presumption against preemption and instead assume federal law is not to supersede the historic police powers of the states unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d Id., citing <em>Minton v. Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 62, 69, 684 N.E.2d 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\"> {\u00b6 19} \u201cPre-emption may be either express or implied, and is compelled whether Congress\u2019 command is explicitly stated in the statute\u2019s language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.\u201d <em>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 374, 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157, citing <em>FMC Corp. v. Holliday </em>(1990), 498 U.S. 52, 56-57, 111 S.Ct. 403, 112 L.Ed.2d 356; <em>Telelytics, </em>2006-Ohio-4623, 2006 WL 2574019, at \u00b6 25; <em>Minton, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 68, 684 N.E.2d 648 (noting that courts initially consider express preemption and whether Congress explicitly defined the extent to which its enactment preempts state law). Because the question is essentially one of statutory intent, we \u201c \u2018 \u201cbegin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Morales </em>at 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157, quoting <em>Holliday </em>at 57, 111 S.Ct. 403, 112 L.Ed.2d 356, quoting <em>Park \u2019N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park &amp; Fly, Inc. </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 189, 194, 105 S.Ct. 658, 83 L.Ed.2d 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Congress set forth the preemption provisions in Section 1681t, entitled \u201cRelation to State laws.\u201d The general provision is contained in subsection (a), which states, \u201cExcept as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, this subchapter does not annul, alter, affect, or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this subchapter from complying with the laws of any State with respect to the collection, distribution, or use of any information on consumers, or for the prevention or mitigation of identify theft, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.\u201d Under the plain language of the general provision, state laws with respect to the prevention or mitigation of identify theft are not federally preempted except to the extent the state laws are inconsistent with any provision of the FCRA, as amended by the FACTA. Thus, pursuant to Section 1681t(a), plaintiffs state law truncation claims under the OCSPA and R.C. 1349.18 are federally preempted only to the extent they are inconsistent with any FCRA or FACTA provision, including any provision that confers a right of action or remedies to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">{\u00b6 21} Nonetheless, after setting forth the general provision, Congress carved out numerous exceptions in subsection (b). Pertinent to our analysis here, Section 1681t(b)(5)(A) states, \u201cNo requirement or prohibition may be imposed under the laws of any State * * * <em>with respect to the conduct required by the specific provisions of section 1681c(g) </em>[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) The key phrase is \u201cwith respect to,\u201d and it has an ordinary meaning of \u201creferring to\u201d or \u201cconcerning.\u201d Random House Unabridged Dictionary (2006). The language that Congress employed in the exception evidences a broad preemptive purpose and expresses its intent that Section 1681c(g) preempt any state law imposing a requirement or prohibition concerning the conduct Section 1681c(g) requires: the truncation of credit and debit card information on electronically printed receipts provided to a cardholder. See <em>Morales, </em>504 U.S. at 383-387, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (construing the \u201csweep\u201d of the analogous phrase \u201crelating to\u201d as expressing a broad preemptive purpose with respect to state laws of not only specific applicability but also general applicability, such as state consumer protection laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">{\u00b6 22} Under the broad language of 1681t(b)(5)(A), R.C. 1349.18\u2019s truncation requirements fall squarely within the preemptive scope of Section 1681c(g) because in prohibiting retailers from printing the expiration date of credit and debit cards on electronically printed receipts provided to cardholders, Ohio\u2019s truncation statute directly imposes requirements or prohibitions with respect to the conduct that its federal counterpart addresses in Section 1681c(g). Further, Section 1681c(g) preempts not only R.C. 1349.18, as a state law that specifically addresses the conduct at issue, but also sweeps within its broad preemptive scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the OCSPA, a law of general application, to the extent that the state consumer protection laws provide for a cause of action premised upon conduct within Section 1681c(g)\u2019s boundaries. See <em>Morales </em>and <em>Kneuss v. Ritenour, </em>Tuscarawas App. No. 2001AP110097, 2002-Ohio-6126, 2002 WL 31518175 (finding federal preemption of actions under state consumer protection laws for allegedly deceptive practices of airlines). See also <em>Carney v. Experian Information Solutions, Inc. </em>(W.D.Tenn.1999), 57 F.Supp.2d 496 (finding FCRA preempts a consumer\u2019s state law claims under consumer protection act).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">{\u00b6 23} As noted, however, Congress expressly provided that Section 1681c(g)\u2019s truncation requirements would take effect in two phases, with the applicable effective date depending upon when the cash register or machine that electronically printed the debit card receipt at issue first was put into use. A federal provision does not regulate its subject matter and, consequently, does not preempt state law until the federal provision becomes effective, so that an existing state law remains in effect until such time as the respective federal provision comes into effect and preempts the state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">{\u00b6 24} In this case, the receipts at issue were printed at three different RadioShack locations in September and October 2005. If a machine that printed a receipt for plaintiff was first put into use after January 1, 2005, then Section 1681c(g) would apply to the transaction at issue, and federal preemption would preclude plaintiffs state law truncation claims with respect to that transaction. Section 1681c(g)(3)(B). On the other hand, if a machine had been put into use before January 1, 2005, then Section 1681c(g) would not become effective as to the transactions involving that machine until December 4, 2006, and federal legislation would not preempt plaintiffs state law truncation claims concerning his September and October 2005 transactions. Section 1681c(g)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">{\u00b6 25} Because the record before this court is silent about the dates on which the machines at issue were first put into use, we are unable to determine whether plaintiffs state law claims are federally preempted. Accordingly, we vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand this matter to the trial court so it may (1) conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine when the cash registers or machines at issue here first were put into use and (2) determine whether federal preemption bars plaintiffs state law truncation claims. Because RadioShack\u2019s claims of error are moot in the event of federal preemption, we do not reach their merits in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Judgment vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b301-9\">Klatt and Tyack, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
