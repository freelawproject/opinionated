We affirm the decision of the trial court in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>{\u00b6 2} This case is the result of an alleged unauthorized credit check performed by Jill Woodyard while working at CFIC Home Mortgage on behalf of Patty; however, the case is only one matter in a series of contentious events involving a divorced couple and their new spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">{\u00b6 3} In May 2004, Sharon Hall divorced Donovan Burke. During their marriage, the couple had two children. Under the decree of divorce, Sharon was granted possession of the marital residence and was required to \u201cassume any outstanding mortgage(s) on said real estate, holding [Donovan Burke] harmless from any payment thereon.\u201d Shortly after the divorce, Donovan Burke married Patty Burke, while Sharon married Steven Hall. By all accounts, the interaction between the new couples was anything but cordial.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">{\u00b6 4} On January 19, 2005, Sharon telephoned the Burke residence after one of the children informed Sharon that Patty referred to her as \u201cstupid.\u201d Sharon told Donovan that she did not appreciate \u201cPatty and Don degrading her to her children.\u201d Donovan denied making any disparaging remarks about the Halls, and the call ended. Patty immediately called the Hall residence, requesting to talk to the children about the alleged remark. After speaking with the children, Patty and Sharon had a discussion. According to Sharon, Patty asked her why she had not refinanced the home and removed Donovan from the mortgage. Sharon replied that her credit was bad due to the divorce. According to Sharon, Patty allegedly challenged this excuse by admitting that she knew Sharon\u2019s credit score and stated that it was \u201cnot that bad, it is 600.\u201d Further, Patty allegedly informed Sharon of other information that appears to have been gleaned from a credit report and of a debt that was not included on Sharon\u2019s report. Sharon then inquired from Patty what other information she knew from the credit report. Steven Hall was allegedly on another phone in the house listening to the exchange and stated to Patty that it was a violation of federal law to pull someone\u2019s credit report. Patty then allegedly became quiet and made no further statements about Sharon\u2019s credit. Patty denied mentioning Sharon\u2019s credit score and the other credit information during the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">{\u00b6 5} As a result, Sharon decided to investigate how Patty had obtained information about her creditworthiness. The following day, Sharon obtained a copy of her credit report via the Internet. She discovered that Equidata evaluated and reported her credit as a result of an inquiry made for a potential real-estate loan. Sharon called Equidata and discovered that CFIC Home Mortgage had made the inquiry on December 6, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">{\u00b6 6} Sharon called CFIC, and the call was forwarded to appellee Jill Wood-yard. Jill asked if Sharon knew R.J. Ball, stating that R.J. works at CFIC and may have pulled the credit by error. Jill then indicated that she would check into the matter and get back to Sharon. In the interim, Sharon discovered that Jill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>had notarized a land contract for the Burkes. Further, Sharon\u2019s 12-year-old daughter purportedly reported that she had witnessed Jill with Patty on multiple occasions and she was present at the Burke\u2019s home multiple times when Jill had been over to their house.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">{\u00b6 7} Sharon again called Jill to confront her with this information. Jill initially denied knowing the Burkes. However, according to Jill, after clearing up some confusion regarding Patty\u2019s name change as a result of her marriage, Jill affirmed that she knew Patty because she had transacted business with her through CFIC. Patty operated PCS Services and Patty\u2019s Closing Services, frequently conducting mortgage closings for CFIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 8} Jill thereafter informed Sharon that her name was submitted to CFIC on a lead sheet dated November 25, 2004, supplied by Patty to loan officer Ron Ball. This lead sheet was a handwritten sheet of paper identifying three individuals who were potentially interested in mortgage services from CFIC. Sharon\u2019s name and information were listed at the top of the sheet with the information of two other individuals. The other names on the lead sheet were Sharon Lawrence and Gail Taylor. Jill stated that the second lead, Sharon Lawrence, had expressed an interest in applying for a new mortgage loan and Ball instructed her to \u201cdo a full application\u201d which included pulling a credit report. Jill claimed that she confused Sharon Hall with Sharon Lawrence since they share the same first name and inadvertently pulled Sharon Hall\u2019s credit report. Further, Jill stated that she did not download Sharon\u2019s credit report and closed the inquiry upon realizing her mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 9} Sharon did not believe Jill\u2019s explanation and filed the instant action, alleging multiple claims against CFIC, Patty, Jill Woodyard, PCS Services, and Patty\u2019s Closing Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 10} Additional investigation and discovery was conducted. Sharon submitted an affidavit of Stephanie Kief. Kief stated that she was present with Patty while Patty was on the telephone talking to a person she referred to as Jill. According to Kief, Patty and Jill were discussing how to conceal the fact that they had accessed Sharon\u2019s credit report. Kief further stated that Patty informed her that she had Jill access Sharon\u2019s credit for her as a favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 11} Sharon also submitted affidavits from Gail Taylor and Sharon and David Lawrence, the other individuals identified on the lead sheet. Gail Taylor stated that she does not know either Patty or Jill, the telephone number and social security number listed on the sheet does not belong to her, and she knew of no reason for CFIC or \u201ca Patty to run a credit check on me in November 2004.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">{\u00b6 12} The Lawrences stated that they never dealt with Patty Burke, R.J. Ball, or anyone from CFIC on or about November 25, 2004, and the social security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>number listed on the sheet is not theirs. Further, the Lawrences stated that the lead sheet \u201cappears to claim we spoke with someone on 12-1-04 regarding credit and we requested something that required a \u2018full [application].\u2019 On or about 12-1-04 we did not request a loan or anything that required a loan application, credit check nor did we speak with anyone regarding these items.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 13} On April 10, 2006, Jill filed a motion for summary judgment. On May 4, 2006, Sharon filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint to enlarge the alleged conspiracy claims under Ohio\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (\u201cRICO\u201d) statute, R.C. 2923.31 et seq. On May 8, 2006, Patty filed a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 14} On November 3, 2006, Sharon moved for a decision on the motions for summary judgment. On January 10, 2007, an agreed order of dismissal was filed with the trial court stating that Sharon and CFIC had entered into a settlement and CFIC was dismissed from the suit. Thereafter, on February 12, 2007, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees in separate opinions. The trial court held that regardless of whether the credit report was accessed, Patty had a permissible purpose to access the report because she was a potential creditor of Sharon as a result of her marriage to Donovan Burke. Further, the trial court found that Jill had a permissible purpose to access the report for a possible extension of credit to Sharon by CFIC. Sharon timely appealed, raising five assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 15} On September 11, 2007, less than one week before oral argument in this case, Jill filed a motion with this court to dismiss the appeal and entry granting summary judgment on the basis that the settlement agreement between Sharon and CFIC also released her because she was an employee or agent of CFIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 16} Our review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment is de novo. <em>Broadnax v. Greene Credit Serv. </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 881, 887, 694 N.E.2d 167. In reviewing a summary judgment, an appellate court must apply the standard found in Civ.R. 56. According to Civ.R. 56, a trial court should grant summary judgment only when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. In the interest of convenience, we will address Sharon\u2019s assignments of error out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe court erred when it ruled that defendant, Patty, did not violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) because she had a permissible purpose to access plaintiffs credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 19} Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe trial court erred when it ruled that defendant, Jill Woodyard, did not violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) because she had two permissible purposes despite her testimony she accessed the credit by accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">{\u00b6 21} As the trial court noted in its decision, the gravamen of Sharon\u2019s complaint is that appellees worked together to fraudulently obtain her credit report. In her first assignment of error, Sharon argues that the trial court erred in finding that Patty had a permissible purpose to access the credit report. Similarly, in her third assignment of error, Sharon argues that the trial court erred in finding that Jill also had a permissible purpose. Sharon notes that Patty testified in her deposition that she never took steps to access Sharon\u2019s credit nor did she see it. Similarly, Sharon cites Jill\u2019s testimony that she accidentally accessed the report based on a lead sheet submitted by Patty. As a result, Sharon argues that the trial court ignored appellees\u2019 testimony because the legal theory used by the trial court to resolve the case is not supported by the record. Further, Sharon disputes the trial court\u2019s finding that Patty is a creditor of Sharon by virtue of her marriage to Donovan Burke. Since Sharon\u2019s first and third assignments of error factually interrelate, we will consolidate them into single discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">{\u00b6 22} The Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), codified at Section 1681 et seq., Title 15, U.S.Code, was enacted to protect \u201cconsumers from inaccurate information in consumer reports and at the establishment of credit reporting procedures that utilize correct, relevant, and up-to-date information in a confidential and responsible manner.\u201d <em>Jones v. Federated Financial Res. Corp. </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 144 F.3d 961, 965. While the FCRA\u2019s primary purpose is to regulate consumer-credit reporting agencies, it also covers the conduct of individuals requesting credit information. <em>Pappas v. Calumet City </em>(N.D.Ill.1998), 9 F.Supp.2d 943, 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">{\u00b6 23} Section 1681n(b), Title 15, U.S.Code provides civil liability against \u201c[a]ny person who obtains a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose.\u201d Accordingly, the necessary inquiries are (1) whether the user had a permissible purpose enumerated in Section 1681b, Title 15, U.S.Code and (2) whether the information was obtained under false pretenses. If the report is obtained under false pretenses and is not for a permissible purpose under Section 1681b, then liability attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>{\u00b6 24} However, the showing of a permissible purpose to obtain a credit report is an absolute defense to a claim that a person obtained a credit report under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose. <em>Edge v. Professional Claims Bur., Inc. </em>(E.D.N.Y.1999) 64 F.Supp.2d 115, 117. Further, misrepresentation is nonactionable if the FCRA would permit the requesting party to receive a credit report for an unstated but permissible purpose. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">{\u00b6 25} Section 1681b, Title 15, U.S.Code lists the permissible purposes for obtaining a credit report. Further, Section 1681b(f), Title 15, U.S.Code states, <em>\u201cA </em>person shall not use or obtain a consumer report for any purpose unless[:] (1) the consumer report is obtained for a purpose for which the consumer report is authorized to be furnished under this section; and (2) the purpose is certified in accordance with [SJection 1681e of this title by a prospective user of the report through a general or specific certification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 26} In this case, the trial court held that appellees had a permissible purpose to obtain Sharon\u2019s credit report and as a result no inquiry was necessary to determine whether it was obtained under false pretenses. In making this decision, the trial court relied on <em>Marzluff v. Verizon Wireless, </em>151 Ohio App.3d 733, 2003-Ohio-913, 785 N.E.2d 805. In <em>Marzluff, </em>following dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage, Karen Wiegand and Steve Marzluff entered into an oral agreement in which Wiegand agreed to transfer her interest in the marital property to Marzluff. In exchange, Marzluff agreed to pay Wiegand $6,000 and refinance the mortgage on the residence with Marzluff as the sole debtor. Id. at \u00b6 5. Marzluff never refinanced the property. Id. Six years later, Wiegand discovered that she remained indebted on the mortgage when she applied for a mortgage loan on a new residence. Id. at \u00b6 7. As a result, Wiegand, who was employed as a senior business-account executive for Verizon Wireless, accessed Marzluff s credit scores via Verizon\u2019s computer network to determine whether he could have refinanced the mortgage. Id. Marzluff learned that his credit had been accessed when he received a computer-generated letter from Verizon referring to his \u201capplication for cellular telephone service.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">{\u00b6 27} Marzluff filed suit against Wiegand and Verizon, alleging violations of the FCRA. The trial court determined that Wiegand had a permissible purpose for accessing Marzluff s credit report and granted summary judgment to Wiegand. Id. at \u00b6 9. On appeal, the Second District Court of Appeals agreed with the conclusions of the trial court, holding that \u201cthe material relationship between Marzluff and Wiegand was one of debtor and creditor\u201d because the parties had entered into an agreement to refinance the mortgage. Id. at \u00b6 16, 21. As a result, Wiegand had a reasonable belief that Marzluff owed her a debt and had a permissible purpose under the FCRA to inquire into Marzluffs credit. Id. at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Similarly, in this case, the trial court found that \u201c[Sharon] Hall was ordered to refinance the marital residence she shared with [Donovan] Burke as part of their divorce decree.\u201d In a footnote, the trial court acknowledged that \u201cthis key fact is the cornerstone\u201d of appellees\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">{\u00b6 29} As a result, the trial court held that \u201c[i]f Patty Burke actually accessed and used Hall\u2019s credit report, it was only in the context of gathering information about refinancing the marital home. Patty Burke reasonably believed that she was a creditor to Hall by virtue of her marriage to Donovan Burke. Thus, she had a permissible purpose to access Hall\u2019s credit report. Since Patty Burke had a permissible purpose to access Hall\u2019s credit, as a matter of law she could not have obtained the information under false pretenses.\u201d Further, the court held, \u201cBecause Patty Burke had a permissible purpose for accessing Hall\u2019s credit, then too Woodyard would have had a permissible purpose for accessing the credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 30} A review of the record demonstrates that the trial court\u2019s cornerstone assumption of fact is erroneous. In examining the divorce decree, we find no support for the trial court\u2019s finding that Sharon has been \u201cordered to refinance the marital residence.\u201d Rather, the divorce decree specifically states, \u201cPlaintiff [Sharon] shall retain the residence located at 323 Park Avenue, Hamilton, Ohio 45013, free and clear of any interest in defendant [Donovan Burke], and she shall assume any outstanding mortgage(s) on said real estate, holding the defendant harmless from any payment thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 31} The divorce decree requires Sharon only to assume the outstanding mortgage and hold Donovan Burke harmless from any further payments. Nowhere in the divorce decree, or the record, do we find any evidence that Sharon was required or ordered to refinance the marital residence; nor is there any evidence that Donovan Burke is a judgment creditor of Sharon. We also disagree with the trial court\u2019s finding that simply by virtue of her marriage to Donovan Burke, Patty is automatically a creditor of Sharon and as a result may permissibly access Sharon\u2019s credit. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s foundational assumption, and its subsequent reliance on <em>Marzluff, </em>is incorrect. Further, without this foundational assumption, appellees\u2019 arguments in these assignments of error begin to unravel when viewed in light of the submitted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">{\u00b6 32} We also find no factual support for the assumption that Patty was entitled to inquire into appellant\u2019s credit because she could reasonably believe that she was a creditor of Sharon. Patty denied seeking access to Sharon\u2019s credit report and testified that she never received any information regarding Sharon\u2019s credit. Jill, however, stated in her deposition that she mistakenly inquired into Sharon\u2019s credit after receiving a lead sheet, which she believed was submitted to CFIC by Patty. Appellees\u2019 accounts contain inconsistencies. Further, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>affidavits submitted by Sharon suggest that appellees may have accessed Sharon\u2019s credit report under false pretenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">{\u00b6 33} After reviewing the evidence, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s assumptions of fact in this case. Having granted summary judgment to appellees on the basis of permissible purpose, the trial court ignored Sharon\u2019s affidavits that when viewed in the light most favorable to Sharon, contradict appellees\u2019 inconsistent portrayals of the events. Based on our foregoing analysis, we find that a genuine issue of material fact exists whether a permissible purpose existed for appellees to access Sharon\u2019s credit report and whether appellees accessed Sharon\u2019s credit report under false pretenses. See <em>Thibodeaux v. Rupers </em>(S.D.Ohio, 2001), 196 F.Supp.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 34} Appellees urge in their briefs, however, that regardless of Sharon\u2019s allegations or whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, Sharon has presented no evidence of any actual damages. Specifically, appellees direct this court to consider Sharon\u2019s deposition testimony that her credit score improved after being accessed by Jill. Similarly, in its decision, the trial court found that \u201cby her own testimony, [Sharon] Hall was not <em>harmed </em>by Woodyard\u2019s credit inquiry. In fact, her credit score actually <em>improved </em>in the time following the inquiry.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 35} We acknowledge appellees\u2019 argument. However, it has no merit. Section 1681n(a)(l)(B), Title 15, U.S.Code, provides for statutory damages regardless of whether any actual damages are proven. That section states, \u201c[I]n the case of liability of a natural person for obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose, actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or $1,000, whichever is greater.\u201d Further, 1681n(a)(2) authorizes punitive damages to be awarded and 1681n(a)(3) allows for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Accordingly, if Sharon proves a violation, she is entitled, at the very least, to a statutory damage award of $1,000, and possibly to punitive damages and an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 36} Sharon\u2019s first and third assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">{\u00b6 37} Assignment of Error No. 4:</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe trial court erred when it dismissed the plaintiffs claims based upon Ohio\u2019s Little RICCO [sic] law, R.C. 2923.34.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">{\u00b6 39} In her fourth assignment of error, Sharon argues that the trial court erred by dismissing her civil claim under Ohio\u2019s RICO law. Specifically, Sharon argues that appellees engaged in a pattern of corrupt activity by fraudulently accessing her and Sharon Lawrence\u2019s credit reports and creating a phony lead sheet. Sharon argues that appellees committed perjury by creating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the phony lead sheet. In addition, Sharon makes further accusations that these actions are part of a grand scheme to take her daughters away from her. Sharon claims that Patty fabricated a child-molestation claim against her husband, when Patty actually molested the child. Further, Sharon argues that Patty committed perjury during Sharon\u2019s divorce hearing. Sharon argues that all of these incidents are related to a single pattern of corrupt activity involving appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">{\u00b6 40} R.C. 2923.32(A) makes it unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise to \u201cconduct or participate in, directly or indirectly, the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of corrupt activity or the collection of an unlawful debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">{\u00b6 41} R.C. 2923.34(B) permits an individual who is injured or threatened with injury by conduct under R.C. 2923.32 to bring a civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 42} To prevail on a civil action based on R.C. 2923.34, a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that the conduct of the defendant involves the commission of two or more specifically prohibited state or federal criminal offenses, (2) that the prohibited criminal conduct of the defendant constitutes a pattern of corrupt activity, and (3) that the defendant has participated in the affairs of an enterprise or has acquired and maintained an interest in or control of an enterprise that exists separate and apart from the defendant. R.C. 2923.34(B); <em>U.S. Demolition &amp; Contracting, Inc. v. O\u2019Rourke Constr. Co. </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 75, 83, 640 N.E.2d 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">{\u00b6 43} R.C. 2923.31(1) defines \u201ccorrupt activity\u201d and lists the offenses that constitute corrupt activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">{\u00b6 44} In its decision, the trial court noted that Sharon does not indicate which enumerated crimes she believes appellees committed. Rather, the trial court stated that Sharon only makes the generalized accusations that appellees violated the FCRA, committed perjury, and manufactured evidence. Similarly, in this appeal, Sharon makes the same generalized accusations, failing to identify any specific violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">{\u00b6 45} As a preliminary matter, we note that a violation of the FCRA is not a predicate offense included in the definition of \u201ccorrupt activity.\u201d Further, there is no evidence that Jill engaged in any activity other than the incidents involving Sharon\u2019s credit report and was not connected in any way with a scheme involving Sharon\u2019s daughter. Further, Sharon has presented no evidence that the credit check relates in any way to the claim that Patty attempted to take her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">{\u00b6 46} Sharon\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">{\u00b6 47} Assignment of Error No. 5:</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>{\u00b6 48} \u201cThe trial court erred when it found there was no invasion of privacy when both defendants testified they had no permissible purpose and there was no court order to refinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 49} Sharon argues in her fifth assignment of error that the trial court erred by failing to find a genuine issue of material fact for her invasion-of-privacy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 50} The tort of invasion of privacy consists of four distinct components: (1) intrusion into the plaintiffs seclusion, solitude, or public affairs; (2) public disclosure of embarrassing private facts about the plaintiff; (3) publicity that places the plaintiff in a false light; and (4) appropriation of the plaintiffs name or likeness for the defendant\u2019s advantage. <em>Housh v. Peth </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 35, 133 N.E.2d 340, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 51} The trial court in this case duly noted in its decision that Sharon \u201cnever articulated which theory of invasion of privacy entitles her to damages.\u201d As a result, the trial court compared the facts of the case with the elements for each component, finding that Sharon has failed to show that any genuine issue of material fact exists for any of the components. Similarly, in her appellate brief, Sharon again fails to identify which cause of action she relies upon. Rather, Sharon simply repeats the general allegations included in her previous assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">{\u00b6 52} Accordingly, Sharon\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">{\u00b6 53} Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cThe trial court erred when it failed to rule upon the plaintiffs motion to amend the complaint to include negligent access.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">{\u00b6 55} In her second assignment of error, Sharon argues that the trial court erred by failing to rule upon her motion to amend the complaint. Sharon claims that the \u201ccourt erred in not granting this motion since the defendant Patty Burke manufactured a sexual abuse claim against the plaintiffs husband as part of her goal to get the plaintiffs daughters removed. The court erred in not allowing the plaintiff to amend to add negligence when defendant Jill Woodyard testified she accessed the plaintiffs credit \u2018by accident.\u2019 \u201d Sharon argues that since leave of court to amend a complaint is to be freely given, the court abused its discretion in not ruling on the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">{\u00b6 56} Jill filed a motion for summary judgment on April 10, 2006. Sharon then filed her motion for leave to amend her complaint on May 4, 2006. Further, on May 8, 2006, Patty filed her motion for summary judgment. Thereafter, on November 3, 2006, Sharon filed a motion requesting a decision on all motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>{\u00b6 57} In her motion, Sharon only requested a decision on the pending summary-judgment motions, which the trial court ruled upon. As a result, we find no abuse by the trial court in failing to rule upon Sharon\u2019s motion to amend her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 58} Sharon\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">MOTION TO DISMISS</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 59} In addition to Sharon\u2019s assignments of error, Jill has filed a motion to dismiss with this court arguing that the settlement agreement between CFIC and Sharon includes Jill because she is an employee or agent of CFIC. Jill argues that the settlement agreement renders the appeal moot as against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 60} The settlement agreement was entered into in December 2006, and Jill admits receiving a copy of the agreement on January 11, 2007, while her motion for summary judgment was still pending with the trial court. However, Jill never filed a motion to dismiss with the trial court. Further, Jill filed a brief in the instant appeal, mentioning nothing about being a potential party to the settlement agreement, and did not file the motion to dismiss until September 11, 2007, less than one week before oral argument was held for the instant appeal on September 17, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">{\u00b6 61} In light of Jill\u2019s failure to raise this issue while the case remained pending in the trial court and our remand of the case at bar, we overrule Jill\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">{\u00b6 62} The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded with further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">Judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b635-12\">Walsh and Powell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
