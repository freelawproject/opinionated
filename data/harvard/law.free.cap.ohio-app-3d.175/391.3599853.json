For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 2} Plaintiff-appellee, the city of Columbus, charged appellant with one count of disorderly conduct, a fourth-degree misdemeanor, in violation of Columbus City Codes (\u201cC.C.\u201d) 2317.11(A)(3). Specifically, appellee alleged that appellant had \u201crecklessly cause[d] inconvenience, annoyance, alarm to another, to wit: Kimberly Richardson and Demetrius Richardson, by insulting/taunting/threatening, under circumstances [in] which * * * such conduct is likely to provoke a violent response, to wit: screaming and cursing [at] [the Richardsons] after having been warned by [Police Officer] J. Brandt and [Police Officer] Clark.\u201d Appellee also charged appellant with one count of resisting arrest, a second-degree misdemeanor, in violation of C.C. 2321.33(A). In particular, appellee alleged that appellant \u201crecklessly/by force, resisted] the lawful arrest of herself * * * in the following manner, to wit: jerking arms away from [0]fficer [Clark] and pulling away from [0]fficer [Clark] while screaming \u2018don\u2019t you put your hands on me.\u2019 \u201d Appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges, and the case proceeded to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 3} At trial, Demetrius Richardson testified on behalf of appellee as follows. At approximately 11 p.m. on January 23, 2006, Demetrius was involved in an automobile accident with a vehicle driven by appellant\u2019s brother. Shortly thereafter, appellant and her parents arrived at the scene. Appellant and her father were irate about the accident; appellant, in particular, directed verbal threats and profanity at Demetrius. As appellant and her father became increasingly upset, Demetrius felt \u201cvery threatened and fearful\u201d; accordingly, he made an effort to keep a safe distance from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 4} Columbus Police Officers Brandt, Love, and Clark arrived at the scene; Demetrius reported that appellant and her father had threatened him. Appellant, still angry and upset, was uncooperative and disrespectful toward the officers. Officer Clark repeatedly admonished her to calm down. After appellant refused to comply and used profanity toward him, Officer Clark informed her that he was placing her under arrest for disorderly conduct. After appellant \u201cpulled away\u201d from Officer Clark, he forced her to the ground and restrained her.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">{\u00b6 5} Demetrius\u2019s mother, Kimberly Richardson, also testified on appellee\u2019s behalf as follows. Shortly after the collision, Demetrius telephoned Kimberly to report the accident. She overhead appellant\u2019s father threatening Demetrius; accordingly, she resolved to come to the accident scene. Upon arrival, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>approached appellant\u2019s father to inquire about his son, who had been injured in the accident. Appellant, standing nearby, became upset and began conversing with her father in a loud, disrespectful manner. Although appellant spoke in a language unfamiliar to Kimberly, she believed, from appellant\u2019s body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions, that she was the subject of appellant\u2019s verbal tirade; consequently, she felt \u201cunder attack pretty much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 6} According to Kimberly, Officer Clark interceded and repeatedly asked appellant to calm down and wait in her car; appellant refused to comply with his requests and \u201cverbally attacked\u201d him. Thereafter, Officer Clark informed appellant that he was going to arrest her for disorderly conduct. Appellant then \u201cpulled back from\u201d and \u201cstruggled with\u201d Officer Clark. In doing so, appellant fell to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 7} Officer Brandt testified on behalf of appellee as follows. When Officer Brandt arrived at the accident scene, appellant was \u201cverbally attacking\u201d Demetrius; i.e., she was \u201cyelling, screaming profanities, insulting, [and] being very rude\u201d to him. Demetrius\u2019s demeanor was \u201claid back\u201d and \u201cnonconfrontational\u201d; indeed, it appeared to Officer Brandt that Demetrius was attempting to ignore appellant and get away from her because he felt threatened by her. Appellant exhibited the same behavior toward Officers Brandt, Love, and Clark; in addition, appellant did not heed the officers\u2019 verbal commands to stay out of the roadway and cease communicating with other persons at the accident scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 8} Officer Brandt eventually returned to her cruiser to process paperwork. At some point, she looked up and observed Officer Clark attempting to handcuff appellant; they were \u201cgoing in circles,\u201d which, according to Officer Brandt, typifies a person attempting to avoid being handcuffed. As a result of this struggle, Officer Clark performed an \u201carm-bar takedown,\u201d a technique utilized by police to gain control of a person in order to effectuate an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 9} Officer Love testified on appellee\u2019s behalf as follows. Upon arriving at the scene, Officer Love observed appellant shouting and motioning at Officer Clark; he could not, however, hear what appellant was shouting. Sometime later, as he was processing paperwork in his cruiser, he looked up and observed Officer Clark \u201creach for\u201d appellant. When appellant pulled away, Officer Clark attempted to grab her, and the two went around in circles. Officer Clark eventually wrestled appellant to the ground and handcuffed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">{\u00b6 10} Officer Clark also testified on behalf of appellee as follows. When he arrived at the scene, appellant was \u201cbelligerent\u201d toward Demetrius \u2014 i.e., shouting and cursing at him; however, he could not discern exactly what appellant was shouting. Demetrius reported to Officer Clark that appellant and her father had threatened him; he also indicated he wanted to file an official report to that effect. According to Officer Clark, Demetrius seemed \u201cconcerned for his safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Appellant continually ignored the officers\u2019 repeated admonitions to calm down and stay out of the roadway. At some point, Officer Clark observed Kimberly talking to appellant\u2019s father. Appellant began screaming at Officer Clark to make Kimberly leave. Officer Clark told appellant to return to her car or he would place her under arrest. At her father\u2019s urging, appellant began walking toward her car; en route, however, she turned around, uttered an expletive, and began walking toward Officer Clark. Officer Clark then informed her that she was under arrest. When he placed his hand on her left arm, she jerked away, spun around, and told him to take his hands off of her. At that point, appellant began to \u201cstiffen up\u201d and pull away. Id. Officer Clark eventually resorted to the \u201carm-bar takedown\u201d to subdue appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 12} Following the presentation of its case-in-chief, appellee rested its case. Appellant moved pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A) for an acquittal on grounds that appellee failed to prove the elements of disorderly conduct, and in so doing, necessarily failed to prove the \u201clawful arrest\u201d element of resisting arrest. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 13} Thereafter, appellant presented her case-in-chief. Abiodun Ilerhunwa, appellant\u2019s mother, testified on appellant\u2019s behalf as follows. Following the accident, Abiodun arrived at the scene separately from her husband and appellant. Kimberly arrived shortly thereafter. Appellant did not interact with either Demetrius or Kimberly. Thereafter, the police arrived and commenced their investigation. When Officer Clark arrested appellant, he came up behind her, grabbed her, and told her she was under arrest. After appellant asked why she was being arrested, Officer Clark knocked her to the ground, handcuffed her, and placed her in his cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 14} Richard Obasohan, appellant\u2019s father, also testified on behalf of appellant. After he arrived at the scene, he was \u201cvery upset\u201d with Demetrius about the accident. When Kimberly arrived, she and Richard began shouting at one another. Appellant shouted at Richard in their native language to leave Kimberly alone; she did not speak directly to Kimberly or Demetrius.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 15} Subsequently, Officer Clark approached appellant, who was standing behind Richard; he inquired as to appellant\u2019s age, told her she was under arrest, kicked her to the ground, handcuffed her, and placed her in his cruiser. According to Richard, Officer Clark had \u201cno reason\u201d to arrest appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant testified on her own behalf as follows. At the accident scene, appellant had no interaction with Demetrius or Kimberly until after her father became upset and engaged them in a shouting match. At that point, appellant raised her voice to be heard over the din; she admonished her father in their native language to calm down and leave Kimberly and Demetrius alone. After this discourse, Officer Clark \u201cmade comments\u201d to appellant and told her to go to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>her car. Appellant uttered an expletive as she walked toward the car. She then felt someone grab her shoulder from behind; she thought it was her parents, who were walking behind her. Immediately thereafter, Officer Clark knocked her to the ground. When she asked what was going on, Officer Clark informed her she was under arrest. Appellant responded that if Officer Clark had told her she was under arrest before grabbing her shoulder, she would have \u201cgladly give[n] [him her] hand.\u201d She further stated she had no idea why Officer Clark arrested her.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 17} Based upon the foregoing evidence, the jury found appellant not guilty of disorderly conduct but guilty of resisting arrest, and the trial court sentenced appellant accordingly. On July 26, 2006, the trial court entered judgment consistent with the jury verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 18} Thereafter, appellant filed a motion for judgment of acquittal, pursuant to Crim.R. 29(C), and a motion for new trial, pursuant to Crim.R. 33. Following a hearing, the trial court denied both motions by entry filed March 29, 2007. On April 10, 2007, appellant filed this timely appeal from the July 26, 2006 judgment. See App.R. 4(B)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant raises four assignments of error, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">I. The evidence was insufficient to find Appellant guilty and thus Appellant is entitled to a Judgment of Acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">II. Appellant\u2019s conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">III. The Trial Court abused its discretion in violation of the Rules of Evidence regarding the admission of testimony at trial and the cumulative effect of such errors was prejudicial to Appellant and deprived Appellant of her Constitutional right to a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-11\">IV. The cumulative effect of trial counsel\u2019s errors at trial denied Appellant her Constitutional right to affective [sic] assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">{\u00b6 20} As appellant\u2019s third assignment is dispositive, we will address it first. Appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding testimony from defense witnesses on the issue of Officer Clark\u2019s possible bias against appellant stemming from his mistaken perception of her nationality.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">{\u00b6 21} During her direct testimony, Abiodun averred that when Officer Clark arrived at the accident scene, he made a comment about \u201c[t]he damn Somalians again.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee objected to the statement on hearsay grounds, and following a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>bench conference, the court sustained the objection and indicated that it would caution the jury to disregard it. The record reflects that the court did not so admonish the jury during Abiodun\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 22} Later, during his direct testimony, Richard averred that Officer Clark had made a comment about Somalians. Appellee again objected to this testimony on hearsay grounds. Following a sidebar at which the prosecution noted that the trial court had failed to admonish the jury regarding Abiodun\u2019s comparable testimony, the trial court sustained the objection and cautioned the jury to disregard Richard\u2019s statement. Appellee concedes that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony about Officer\u2019s Clark\u2019s alleged bias toward appellant, but argues that that error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 23} Error in the admission or exclusion of evidence in a criminal trial must be considered prejudicial unless the court can declare, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error was harmless, and unless there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence, or the exclusion of evidence, may have contributed to the accused\u2019s conviction. <em>State v. Bayless </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 73, 106, 2 O.O.3d 249, 357 N.E.2d 1035, vacated in part on other grounds (1978), 438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1155. \u201cWhether [the] error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is not simply an inquiry into the sufficiency of the remaining evidence. Instead, the question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that [exclusion of] the evidence * * * might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Conway, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, at \u00b6 78. \u201c \u2018When a claim of harmless error is raised, the appellate court must read the record and decide the probable impact of the error on the minds of the average juror.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Auld, </em>Delaware App. No. 2006-CAC-120091, 2007-Ohio-3508, 2007 WL 1977748, at \u00b6 28, quoting <em>State v. Young </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 221, 226, 5 OBR 484, 450 N.E.2d 1143. \u201cAn appellate court must reverse if the government does not meet its burden.\u201d <em>Auld, </em>citing <em>State v. Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 121, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 24} In determining harmless error, a reviewing court must examine an array of factors, including the importance of the witness\u2019s testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, the cumulative nature of the testimony, the presence or absence of corroborating or contradictory evidence, the scope of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. <em>State v. Lukens </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 794, 805-806, 586 N.E.2d 1099, citing <em>Delaware v. VanArsdall </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 25} Here, the jury found appellant guilty of resisting arrest, in violation of C.C. 2321.33(A), which provides that \u201c[n]o person, recklessly or by force, shall resist or interfere with the lawful arrest of himself or another.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Arrest involves four elements: \u201c(1) [a]n intent to arrest, (2) under a real or pretended authority, (3) accompanied by an actual or constructive seizure or detention of the person * * * (4) which is so understood by the person arrested.\u201d <em>State v. Darrah </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 22, 26, 18 O.O.3d 193, 412 N.E.2d 1328, citing <em>State v. Terry </em>(1966), 5 Ohio App.2d 122, 128, 34 O.O.2d 237, 214 N.E.2d 114. Thus, in order to prove that appellant resisted arrest, appellee was required, inter alia, to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant understood that she was under arrest before she resisted that arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 26} The evidence on this point was conflicting; thus, credibility was crucial. As noted, Officer Clark testified that appellant was walking toward him when he informed her she was under arrest, and she thereafter resisted his efforts to effectuate that arrest. In contrast, appellant testified that someone seized her from behind; she pulled away only because she assumed it was her parents, who were walking behind her. According to appellant, Officer Clark did not inform her that she was under arrest until after he knocked her to the ground. Indeed, she told him that if he had informed her that she was under arrest before grabbing her shoulder, she would have \u201cgladly give[n] [him her] hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cBecause the possible bias of a witness is always significant in assessing credibility, the trier of fact must be sufficiently informed of the underlying relationships, circumstances, and influences operating on the witness \u2018so that, in the light of his experience, he can determine whether a mutation in testimony could reasonably be expected as a probable human reaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1988), 61 Ohio App.3d 594, 597, 573 N.E.2d 704, quoting 3 Weinstein, Evidence (1988) 607-627, Section 607[03].</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 28} Appellee contends that exclusion of the testimony as to Officer Clark\u2019s possible bias against appellant was harmless because three other witnesses\u2014 Demetrius, Kimberly, and appellant\u2019s own father' \u2014 corroborated Officer Clark\u2019s testimony that he informed her she was under arrest before she resisted that arrest. As noted, the standard for assessing harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt does not simply involve an inquiry into the sufficiency of the remaining evidence. Rather, the question to be resolved is whether there is a reasonable possibility that exclusion of the evidence might have contributed to the conviction. <em>Conway, </em>supra. Upon review of the record, we conclude that the error in this case was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 29} Here, Officer Clark\u2019s testimony was significant to the jury\u2019s determination of appellant\u2019s guilt, despite the fact that his testimony was supported by that of other witnesses. The jury may well have attached considerable weight to Officer Clark\u2019s testimony, given his status as the arresting officer. Moreover, Officer Clark was afforded the opportunity to refute the allegations of bias. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Officer Clark if he at any point during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the incident stated that he was \u201ctired of these Somalians.\u201d Officer Clark denied making such a statement and specifically testified that he did not make any derogatory comments or use profanity while interacting with appellant. The trial court\u2019s subsequent ruling denying appellant\u2019s witnesses the opportunity to testify to the contrary left appellant without the means to impeach Officer Clark\u2019s denial. Testimony from appellant\u2019s witnesses concerning Officer Clark\u2019s statement might reasonably have damaged his credibility with the jury, especially given the derogatory nature of his alleged comments. Whether or not Officer Clark was actually biased is a matter for the jury after hearing all of the circumstances surrounding the pertinent events.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 30} We further note that neither Officer Brandt nor Officer Love corroborated Officer Clark\u2019s testimony as to the arrest of appellant. Indeed, Officer Brandt testified that she did not observe or hear anything leading up to Officer\u2019s Clark\u2019s attempt to handcuff appellant and did not know where Officer Clark was standing when he attempted to place appellant under arrest. Similarly, Officer Love testified that he did not hear any of the interaction between appellant and Officer Clark, as he was seated in his police cruiser 20 to 30 feet away with the windows rolled up; he merely observed Officer Clark \u201creach for\u201d appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 31} Moreover, exclusion of the testimony regarding Officer Clark\u2019s potential bias against appellant also impacted the credibility of other prosecution witnesses. Demetrius, Kimberly, and Officer Brandt all testified on direct examination that Officer Clark did not make any inappropriate comments or use profanity in communicating with appellant. Again, the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding appellant\u2019s witnesses from testifying to the contrary left appellant without a means of impeaching the testimony of these three prosecution witnesses. Had the challenged testimony been permitted, the jury would have been required to weigh the credibility of the prosecution witnesses against the credibility of the defense witnesses on the bias issue. As a result of the trial court\u2019s error, the jury was not provided the opportunity to do so and thus rendered a verdict based upon an incomplete record on the bias issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 32} In short, we conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that exclusion of testimony as to Officer Clark\u2019s possible bias against appellant might have contributed to appellant\u2019s conviction; therefore, the trial court\u2019s error in excluding such evidence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Conway, </em>supra. The third assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 33} Appellant\u2019s first, second, and fourth assignments of error contend, respectively, that her conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence, that her conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence, and that she did not receive the effective assistance of counsel at trial. Because appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence are vacated pursuant to appellant\u2019s third assignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>error, the remaining assignments of error are rendered moot. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 34} For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained, rendering appellant\u2019s first, second, and fourth assignments of error moot. The judgment of the Franklin County Municipal Court is reversed, and the matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings in accordance with law and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-7\">French, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b436-8\">McGrath, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b436-9\">Whiteside, J., retired, of the Tenth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-14\">.

Majority opinion at \u00b6 23, citing <em>State v. Bayless </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 73, 2 O.O.3d 249, 357 N.E.2d 1035. In those circumstances, it is the duty of the appellate court to read the record and decide the probable impact of the error on the minds of the average juror. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">{\u00b6 37} Upon review of the record, I find that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the error was harmless and that there is no reasonable probability that the exclusion of evidence may have contributed to the appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">{\u00b6 38} Officer Clark testified that while he repeatedly admonished appellant to calm down, appellant refused and used profanity at him. Officer Clark described that he told appellant\u2019s father that he was going to place appellant under arrest if she did not go to her car as instructed. Despite being \u201ccoaxed\u201d by her father to go to the car, appellant said \u201cFuck that\u201d and began walking back towards Officer Clark. According to Officer Clark, at this time, he told appellant she was under arrest, and as he put his hands on her left arm, she started to jerk away and told him to get his hands off of her as she began to stiffen up and pull away. Therefore, Officer Clark performed the \u201carm-bar\u201d technique to restrain appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>{\u00b6 39} Officer Brandt and Officer Love corroborated Officer Clark\u2019s testimony to the extent that they both saw appellant evading Officer Clark prior to his using the \u201carm-bar\u201d technique to restrain appellant. Officer Brandt described that at the time of the incident with appellant, she was in her cruiser when she looked up and saw a struggle between Officer Clark and appellant. It looked to Officer Brandt as if \u201c[Officer Clark] was attempting to gain control of her to handcuff her.\u201d Officer Brandt explained, \u201cmeaning there was struggling, meaning he tried to grab her arm and she was trying to get away from him, so they went in circles, then he did eventually place her on the ground and get her handcuffed.\u201d Officer Love was doing the accident report when he looked up to see Officer Clark reach for appellant and appellant pull away. Officer Love testified, \u201cThen I saw Officer Clark grab ahold of her again. Then they started going around in circles. I saw Officer Clark take her to the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 40} According to Kimberly Richardson, Officer Clark gave appellant repeated verbal warnings to calm down and move away from the accident scene. Finally, Officer Clark stated that he was going to arrest appellant for disorderly conduct, when appellant pulled back from Officer Clark and was \u201ckind of struggling with him\u201d prior to falling on the ground. Demetrius Richardson testified that he remembers Officer Clark saying, \u201c \u2018Young lady, I\u2019m placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 41} Abiodum Ilerhunwa, appellant\u2019s mother, testified that Officer Clark told appellant she was under arrest. Abiodum testified on cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">[The State]: Okay. And you testified that Officer Clark grabbed your daughter from behind and knocked her to the ground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">[Witness]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">[The State]: Before Officer Clark did that, he told her she was under arrest, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-12\">[Witness]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">{\u00b6 42} Richard Obasohan, appellant\u2019s father, testified on direct examination that Officer Clark had asked appellant how old she was, and after she responded, Officer Clark said that she was under arrest. Richard testified on cross-examination that Officer Clark said, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d and then he said, \u2018You\u2019re under arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">{\u00b6 43} Given that the remaining evidence corroborating Officer Clark\u2019s version of events as to whether or not he told appellant she was under arrest, which includes the testimony of appellant\u2019s own mother and father, overwhelmingly supports his version of the matter as opposed to appellant\u2019s, it makes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>question of whether or not the officer is or is not biased against Somalians irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">{\u00b6 44} The statement introduces a matter that is collateral and volatile to the extent that where demonstrably irrelevant to the issue, it creates a danger that the question at hand is not decided upon the facts, but upon whether someone harbors a bias. In this case, the corroborating evidence overwhelms the collateral claim of bias. The majority says that the other officers did not corroborate Officer Clark\u2019s version of events, but it should be pointed out that these officers did not discredit his testimony, as they simply did not hear the conversations. The officers did corroborate that appellant appeared to be \u201cresisting\u201d being handcuffed as she was going in circles with Officer Clark and that Officer Clark ultimately performed an \u201carm-bar\u201d technique on appellant in order to restrain her.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 45} For these reasons, I cannot find, based on this record, that exclusion of the evidence contributed to appellant\u2019s guilt and instead truly was error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
