Case No. 06 CA 135 is an appeal from an order committing J.R.P. to the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>of Youth Services (\u201cDYS\u201d) (November 28, 2006 entry). Case No. 07 CA 20 is an appeal from a judgment of October 20, 2004, reflecting that J.R.P. had been adjudicated a delinquent and placing him on probation. By decision and entry of October 17, 2007, we determined that the appeal from the 2004 judgment was timely because the clerk had failed to notify J.R.P. of the judgment as required by Civ.R. 58(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 2} J.R.P. advances two assignments of error. The first assignment of error deals with the October 20, 2004 disposition and the proceedings in 2006 that resulted in the juvenile court\u2019s revoking J.R.P.\u2019s probation and committing him to DYS. The second assignment of error pertains to the proceedings in 2004 adjudicating J.R.P. a delinquent child. We will first discuss the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c2. [J.R.P.]\u2019s admission to receiving stolen property was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, Sections 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution, and Juvenile Rule 29.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 4} On September 9, 2004, J.R.P. appeared before the juvenile court magistrate and entered an admission to a fourth-degree-felony charge of receiving stolen property. J.R.P. contends that his admission was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, because the magistrate failed to engage him in the dialogue required by Juv.R. 29(D), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe court may refuse to accept an admission and shall not accept an admission without addressing the party personally and determining both of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c(1) The party is making the admission voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the allegations and the consequences of the admission;</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(2) The party understands that by entering an admission the party is waiving the right to challenge the witnesses and evidence against the party, to remain silent, and to introduce evidence at the adjudicatory hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">{\u00b6 8} The state contends that the magistrate \u201csubstantially and strictly complied\u201d with Juv.R. 29(D). The exchange among the court, defense counsel, and J.R.P. was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cMR. KAECH (defense counsel): Yes, your Honor. If the Court please, at this time [J.R.P.] is going to admit the charge of receiving stolen property as a felony of the fourth degree. He understands by admitting that charge he gives up his right to have a trial. At that trial he understands the court would require the State of Ohio \u2014 the law would require the State of Ohio to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, present witnesses to try to establish the facts. I, as [J.R.PJ\u2019s attorney, would have the right to ask questions or cross-examine those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>witnesses, present information that was to his benefit, call witnesses on his behalf, and he could testify about what happened if he wished to, but he wouldn\u2019t be required to.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cHe understands that by admitting this charge he\u2019s not going to have a trial. He\u2019s admitting the charge because it\u2019s true.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cTHE COURT: [J.R.P.], do you understand the charge that you\u2019re admitting to here today?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cTHE YOUTH: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand the possible commitment to the Department of Youth Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cTHE YOUTH: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Kaech went through rights of trial. Do you understand those fully and completely?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cTHE YOUTH: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you have any questions about those at all?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cTHE YOUTH: No, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand you waive your right to trial when you are here today and admitting this charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cTHE YOUTH: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-16\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cTHE COURT: And that\u2019s what you want to do?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-17\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cTHE YOUTH: Yep.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-18\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cTHE COURT: Is anybody forcing you to admit to this charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-19\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cTHE YOUTH: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-20\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cTHE COURT: Anybody promise you anything?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-21\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cTHE YOUTH: No, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-22\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cTHE COURT: I will accept your admission on this charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-23\">{\u00b6 28} Although approving substantial compliance with Juv.R. 29(D), the Supreme Court has recently expressed its preference for strict compliance with Juv.R. 29(D). <em>In re C.S., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 267, 2007-Ohio-4919, 874 N.E.2d 1177, \u00b6 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-24\">{\u00b6 29} Although the magistrate might have been less reliant on the representations of defense counsel, we nevertheless conclude that her discussion with J.R.P. did substantially comply with Juv.R. 29(D) in most respects: determining voluntariness, consequences, and trial rights that are waived. However, there was one glaring deficiency in the exchange between the magistrate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>J.R.P. (which was not ameliorated by counsel\u2019s representations) that was fatal to the admission: there was no inquiry made as to J.R.P.\u2019s \u201cunderstanding of the nature of the allegations\u201d as required by Juv.R. 29(D)(1). The court asked J.R.P. only whether he understood the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">{\u00b6 30} On similar facts, we reversed the judgment in <em>In re J.T.C., </em>Miami App. No. 06-CA-34, 2007-Ohio-436, 2007 WL 293916:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cIt is clear from reading the record that the juvenile court never personally addressed J.T.C. and determined that he understood the nature of the allegations surrounding the two charges of gross sexual imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe Ross County Court of Appeals reversed a juvenile\u2019s delinquency adjudication when it found the trial court violated the juvenile\u2019s rights to due process by accepting the juvenile\u2019s admission to a rape charge without complying with Juv.R. 29(D)\u2019s requirement that the court personally address the juvenile and determine whether he understood the nature of the rape allegation. <em>In re Beechler </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 567, 685 N.E.2d 1257. That court noted that at no time did the referee ascertain whether the juvenile understood the nature of the rape allegation. Id. at 570 [685 N.E.2d 1257], Ohio courts have held that in a delinquency case, an admission is similar to a guilty plea made by an adult pursuant to Crim.R. 11(C) in that it constitutes a waiver of rights to challenge the allegations in the complaint. <em>State v. Penrod </em>(1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 720, 723, 577 N.E.2d 424. Both rules require the respective courts make careful inquiries in order to ensure that the admission is entered voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly. <em>In re Flynn </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 778, 781, 656 N.E.2d 737. Substantial compliance with the respective rules is required. <em>In re Jenkins </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 177, 179, 655 N.E.2d 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cThis court held that a defendant\u2019s mere affirmative response to the court\u2019s question whether he understands the nature of the charge against him, without more, is insufficient to comply with Crim.R. 11. <em>State v. Blair </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 435, 715 N.E.2d 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cWe agree with the Appellant that the trial court did not substantially comply with Juv.R. 29(D) in determining whether he understood the nature of the allegations against him. The Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is Sustained.\u201d <em>In re J.T.C. </em>at \u00b6 57-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">{\u00b6 35} The second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c1. The trial court violated [J.R.P.\u2019s] right to counsel and to due process under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution, Ohio Revised Code Section 2151.352 and Juvenile Rules 3, 4, and 29.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>{\u00b6 37} In this assignment of error, J.R.P. contends that the juvenile court failed to obtain valid waivers of counsel from him on three dates: October 20, 2004, when the court conducted the first dispositional hearing; November 8, 2006, when J.R.P. admitted he was in violation of his probation; and November 20, 2006, when the juvenile court committed J.R.P. to DYS. The state concedes that valid waivers of counsel were not obtained on October 20, 2004, and November 20, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 38} Juv.R. 29(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cAt the beginning of the hearing, the court shall do all of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c(3) Inform unrepresented parties of their right to counsel and determine if those parties are waiving their right to counsel;</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c(4) Appoint counsel for any unrepresented party under Juv.R. 4(A) who does not waive the right to counsel;</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(5) Inform any unrepresented party who waives the right to counsel of the right: to obtain counsel at any stage of the proceedings, to remain silent, to offer evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and, upon request, to have a record of all proceedings made, at public expense if indigent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">{\u00b6 44} As it relates to Juv.R. 29(B)(3) through (5), the magistrate\u2019s exchange with J.R.P. was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand that you do have a right to have an attorney?</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cYOUTH: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cTHE COURT: If you can\u2019t afford an attorney, one would be provided to you. Do you understand this right?</p>\n<p id=\"b522-15\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cYOUTH: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-16\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand that you do have a right to a trial in this matter? The State would have to prove you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. You are presumed innocent until proven guilty by that standard. Do you understand this right?</p>\n<p id=\"b522-17\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cYOUTH: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-18\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand you have a right to confront and cross-examine State\u2019s witnesses?</p>\n<p id=\"b522-19\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cYOUTH: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>{\u00b6 53} \u201cTHE COURT: You have a right to bring in your own witnesses who you feel would be helpful to your case. If those witnesses do not appear voluntarily, you can have the court order them in. Do you understand this right?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cYOUTH: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cTHE COURT: And do you understand your right to remain silent at your trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">{\u00b6 56} \u2018YOUTH: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cTHE COURT: All of these rights of trial you understand and you wish to give them up by admitting here today?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cYOUTH: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And when I say admit, or you say you admit, you\u2019re saying, I committed this violation and I don\u2019t need a trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">{\u00b6 60} \u2018YOUTH: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I\u2019ll accept your admission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">{\u00b6 62} Although the magistrate informed J.R.P. of his right to appointed counsel, she failed to ask him if he was waiving counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">{\u00b6 63} In <em>In re B.M.S., </em>165 Ohio App.3d 609, 2006-Ohio-981, 847 N.E.2d 506, we found reversible error in the juvenile court\u2019s conducting a dispositional hearing without obtaining a waiver of counsel. Given that J.R.P. was entitled to representation \u201cat all stages of the proceedings,\u201d <em>In re Gault </em>(1967), 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527, the result can be no different here.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">{\u00b6 64} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">{\u00b6 65} The judgments are reversed, and the matter is remanded to the juvenile court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-17\">Judgments reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b523-18\">Fain and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
