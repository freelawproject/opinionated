Turner appeals from a judgment of the Clark County Court of Common Pleas, which denied his request to withdraw his guilty plea. The trial court conducted a hearing on the motion before rendering its decision, as required by our judgment and remand in <em>State v. Turner, </em>171 Ohio App.3d 82, 2007-Ohio-1346, 869 N.E.2d 708 <em>{\u2018Turner I\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">{\u00b6 2} In 2003, Turner entered into a plea agreement in which he pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter with a firearm specification. At the plea hearing, the prosecutor stated that the voluntary-manslaughter offense arose from a drug deal that went awry. Several persons from whom Turner planned to purchase marijuana attempted to rob him. In the process, one man pointed a gun at Turner while two others struck him. Turner then pulled his own gun, and several shots were exchanged. One of Turner\u2019s assailants was killed. Id. at \u00b6 3. The court accepted Turner\u2019s plea and sentenced him to an aggregate term of 12 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">{\u00b6 3} More than two years later, Turner filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. Although Turner presented several arguments in his motion, only one is pertinent to this appeal: Turner asserted that his trial counsel had incorrectly advised him that a claim of self-defense was unavailable to him because he had been engaged in criminal activity \u2014 the purchase of drugs \u2014 when the shooting occurred. Turner supported his argument with a letter from his trial attorney, written approximately seven months after he pleaded guilty, in which the attorney did, in fact, advise Turner that a claim of self-defense was unavailable to him because of his own criminal activity. The trial court overruled Turner\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>without a hearing and without addressing Turner\u2019s argument that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">{\u00b6 4} In <em>Turner I, </em>we observed that Turner\u2019s claims that he was not the first aggressor and that he fired his gun in self-defense after one of his assailants held a gun on him were supported by the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of facts at the plea hearing. We also noted that the letter from Turner\u2019s trial attorney supported Turner\u2019s assertion that he had been told that a self-defense claim was unavailable to him because he was engaged in a drug deal when the shooting occurred. We pointed out that it was immaterial whether Turner was involved in criminal conduct when the shooting occurred as long as his conduct did not give rise to the affray and he was not the first aggressor. We concluded that the trial court had erred in failing to conduct a hearing on Turner\u2019s motion, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[I]f defendant was denied an opportunity to present a self-defense claim at trial because of his trial counsel\u2019s erroneous advice that defendant was not entitled to assert that defense, the trial court would be obligated to permit withdrawal of defendant\u2019s * * * plea because counsel\u2019s deficient performance created a manifest injustice by impairing the knowing, intelligent, and voluntary character of defendant\u2019s plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">{\u00b6 6} Having so held, we remanded to the trial court for a hearing on Turner\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. After conducting such a hearing, the trial court again overruled Turner\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">{\u00b6 7} Turner raises two assignments of error on appeal. We will address these assignments together.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">{\u00b6 8} I. \u201cThe trial court erred when it unreasonably determined that defendant-appellant received effective assistance of counsel based on what trial counsel stated he meant rather than upon what [trial] counsel stated to defendant-appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">{\u00b6 9} II. \u201cThe trial court erred when it unreasonably relied upon incorrect facts and misstatements of law in denying defendant[-]appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw guilty plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">{\u00b6 10} Turner contends that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling his motion to withdraw his plea because it ignored the attorney\u2019s misstatement of the law despite Turner\u2019s reliance on it and relied upon \u201cincorrect facts and misstatements of law\u201d in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">{\u00b6 11} Pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1, a trial court may permit a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea after sentence has been imposed in order to correct a manifest injustice. <em>State v. Bush, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 235, 2002-Ohio-3993, 773 N.E.2d 522, \u00b6 8; <em>State v. Smith </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St.2d 261, 264, 3 O.O.3d 402, 361 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>1324; <em>State v. Hartzell </em>(Aug. 20, 1999), Montgomery App. No. 17499, 1999 WL 957746. The manifest-injustice standard demands a showing of extraordinary circumstances, and the defendant bears the burden of proof. <em>Smith, </em>49 Ohio St.2d at 264, 3 O.O.3d 402, 361 N.E.2d 1324; <em>Hartzell, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">{\u00b6 12} At the hearing, Turner and his grandmother testified that in their conversations with the attorney, James Heath, Heath had told them that Turner was \u201cnot entitled to self[-]defense\u201d because he had been engaged in a drug transaction at the time of the shooting. This representation is consistent with the following statement in the above-referenced letter from Heath to Turner: \u201cI told you case law indicates to me that, since you were in the act of committing a crime when the shooting occurred, the defense of self-defense was not available to you. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">{\u00b6 13} Heath also testified at the hearing. After some discussions about attorney-client privilege, the full substance of Heath\u2019s testimony was contained in the following statement, which refers to the letter mentioned above:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cWhat I meant by the availability of the defense of self-defense in that letter was the same as it had been in numerous conversations between the defendant and myself about the defense of self-defense; and that was that he can raise the defense, but I did not believe that he could raise it successfully. If he raised it unsuccessfully, the penalties would be much more severe than those which resulted on the plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">{\u00b6 15} The court denied Turner\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. Because the court\u2019s reasoning is critical to our resolution of the case, we quote it extensively herein:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe Court has a difficult time believing that a defendant would be under the impression that he couldn\u2019t advance a certain defense. I mean, he has the right to testify at his trial; and Judge Lorig went over those rights with the defendant at the time of the plea. He told the defendant you would have the right to testify at your hearing but that you could not be compelled to do so. Those are not exact words, but he explained that right to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cSo the defendant knew at the time he entered the guilty plea that he could go to trial; get on the witness stand; give his version of the events; tell the jury that he was in fear of imminent danger, death, or great bodily harm; and that he fired shots in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cAnd in any case where a defendant is charged with shooting another person, killing another person, anybody can raise self-defense. Anybody can claim self-defense. Self-defense is available to everybody so it\u2019s the law of the land. Anybody can raise it, just like anybody can raise alibi, just like anybody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>could raise identity that it wasn\u2019t the \u2014 that they\u2019re not the one that perpetrated the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThat\u2019s what defenses are. They\u2019re available to anybody. Anybody can raise \u2014 he could have raised not guilty by reason of insanity if he chose to do that. So defenses are out there and available. The question is whether or not they would be successful at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cMr. Heath indicated or testified today that what he conveyed to the defendant or his understanding of what he conveyed to the defendant was that advancing that defense would not be successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cAnd I find that explanation to be credible in light of the facts * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cSo given all those facts, it\u2019s hard for me to believe that the defendant would be successful at a jury trial on the first element of self-defense; and that is that the defendant was not at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cI think all these factors show that he was at some fault in creating that situation. The law isn\u2019t that the defendant has to be totally responsible for the situation. It\u2019s that he was at fault in creating the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cNow, certainly the other individuals there were at fault, probably more at fault because they had a scheme to rob the defendant; but they\u2019ve been punished for their offenses, but this defendant didn\u2019t have clean hands. He was at fault as well for creating the situation. He was there to engage in a felony drug transaction with a loaded firearm that he wasn\u2019t supposed to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cSo in looking at the evidence \u2014 the explanation that Mr. Heath has given, the understanding that the defendant had, it is the defendant\u2019s burden to prove or to establish the existence of a manifest injustice; and because I find Mr. Heath\u2019s explanation to be a credible one, I find that the defendant has not met the burden of proving a manifest injustice. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">{\u00b6 26} We find several problems with the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">{\u00b6 27} First, we are of the view that the trial court overestimates the average defendant\u2019s knowledge of the law, especially when faced with evidence that the defendant\u2019s attorney gave him a different appraisal of the law. Whether the defendant \u201cknew\u201d he could \u201cget on the witness stand\u201d and testify in support of the elements of self-defense was precisely the issue the court was charged to determine in our remand. While one\u2019s legal rights and the elements of crimes and defenses may be common knowledge to attorneys, we do not assume that every defendant is aware of these facts. Indeed, many safeguards are built into our legal processes on the assumption that defendants do NOT intuitively know these facts. Thus, we are troubled by the trial court\u2019s lengthy discussion of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u201ceverybody\u201d and \u201canybody\u201d readily knows about the availability of a self-defense claim and the rights inherent in the trial process. In our view, the court overstated the simplicity of these issues and the level of knowledge that a defendant is presumed to have, especially when an attorney has allegedly provided conflicting information.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">{\u00b6 28} Second, we have expressly rejected the trial court\u2019s view that Turner\u2019s involvement in criminal activity at the time of the alleged attack precluded a claim of self-defense. The first prong of a claim of self-defense \u2014 that the defendant was not at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray\u2014 does not preclude the defense if the defendant was engaged in criminal conduct when he was attacked. Rather, it requires a defendant to show that he was not at fault in creating the situation, i.e., that he had not engaged in such wrongful conduct toward his assailant that the assailant was provoked to attack. <em>State v. Gillespie, </em>172 Ohio App.3d 304, 2007-Ohio-3439, 874 N.E.2d 870, \u00b6 17. As we said in <em>Turner I, </em>\u201c[t]hat Turner was engaged in other criminal conduct when he caused the victim\u2019s death is immaterial, so long as his criminal conduct did not give rise to the affray and he was not the first aggressor.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>171 Ohio App.3d 82, 2007-Ohio-1346, 869 N.E.2d 708, at \u00b6 25. We have also expressly rejected the view that possession of a firearm rises to a level of wrongdoing such that reasonable persons could not doubt the defendant\u2019s criminal liability. <em>Gillespie, </em>172 Ohio App.3d 304, 2007-Ohio-3439, 874 N.E.2d 870, at \u00b6 18. Thus, the trial court abused its discretion in relying on Turner\u2019s \u201cunclean hands\u201d in overruling the motion when there was no evidence to suggest that Turner provoked the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">{\u00b6 29} On the whole, the trial court seems to have relied on improper or irrelevant factors in overruling Turner\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. The court made only a passing reference to the witnesses\u2019 credibility. The court expressly found that when Turner entered his guilty plea, he knew that self-defense was available to him as a defense and that Heath merely told him that his claiming self-defense would not be successful. While we are deferential to the findings of a trial court, we are not bound by findings that are not based on credible evidence. Here, Turner and his grandmother testified unequivocally that Heath advised Turner that the defense of self-defense was not available to him. Heath did not deny that he so advised Turner, although he testified that he advised Turner that his assertion of self-defense would not be successful. His letter to Turner, however, is entirely consistent with the testimony of Turner and his grandmother: \u201cI told you case law indicates to me that, since you were in the act of committing a crime when the shooting occurred, the defense of self-defense was not available to you.\u201d In other words, we are not confident, based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Heath\u2019s testimony, that his conversations with Turner about the availability of a self-defense claim were more accurate than what he put in his letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">{\u00b6 30} Turner presented substantial evidence that incorrect information from his attorney created a manifest injustice by persuading him to plead guilty rather than to pursue a viable defense. Of course, there is no guarantee that Turner\u2019s claim of self-defense will succeed at trial, and he will run the risk of a more severe penalty if he does not succeed. However, justice requires that he be allowed to make an informed choice in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">{\u00b6 31} The assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">{\u00b6 32} This case is remanded to the trial court with specific direction to the trial court: (1) to permit Turner to withdraw his guilty plea to voluntary manslaughter with a firearm specification, (2) to vacate the conviction and sentence entered pursuant to that guilty plea, and (3) for further proceedings in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b293-9\">Grady and Donovan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
