(\u201cSteubenville Orthopedics\u201d) and Kumar Amin, M.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Appellant worked as an x-ray technician in the office of Steubenville Orthopedics and Dr. Amin. Whether these appellees were appellant\u2019s employer is a central issue in this case. Appellees directed appellant\u2019s day-to-day work activities. However, Health Management Resources, Inc. (\u201cHMRI\u201d) issued appellant\u2019s paychecks and paid for her unemployment and workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant was injured at work on August 20, 2004. She filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, which was allowed by the Industrial Commission. Her allowed injury was for a lumbar sacral sprain and a contusion of her right knee. The Industrial Commission found HMRI to be appellant\u2019s employer. According to a letter written by HMRI\u2019s president to appellant, appellant was employed by HMRI to serve as an x-ray technician for Steubenville Orthopedics.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant continued to work after her injury. But on or about March 29, 2005, appellant became unable to work due to pain that she alleged was caused by the previous work injury. Appellant received workers\u2019 compensation for the period of March 29 to May 2, 2005. A workers\u2019 compensation hearing officer determined that appellant\u2019s inability to work was due to her August 2004 work injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">{\u00b6 5} On April 26, 2005, appellant informed appellees that she would be able to return to work on May 2, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">{\u00b6 6} On April 27, 2005, appellant received a certified letter from HMRI\u2019s president. The letter stated that appellant was employed by HMRI as an at-will employee to serve as the x-ray technician for appellees. It then informed her that she was being reclassified to \u201clayoff\u2019 status.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant filed a complaint against Steubenville Orthopedics, Dr. Amin, and HMRI, raising four claims: (1) the defendants discharged appellant because she filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim in violation of R.C. 4123.90, (2) the defendants regarded appellant as having a disability and discharged her without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>just cause in violation of R.C. 4112.02, (3) the defendants discharged appellant in violation of public policy because she filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, and (4) the defendants discharged appellant in violation of public policy because they perceived her as having a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant later dismissed her case against HMRI because she and HMRI reached a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">{\u00b6 9} Appellees filed a motion for partial summary judgment and then a subsequent motion for summary judgment on all counts. They alleged that HMRI was appellant\u2019s employer and, therefore, they were not responsible for her discharge. They also argued that even if they could be found to be appellant\u2019s employers, summary judgment was still warranted. Appellant also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The court found that appellant was an employee of HMRI and not of Steubenville Orthopedics or Dr. Amin. Therefore, the court found that summary judgment was proper. The court also stated that during oral arguments on the motion, appellant conceded that Dr. Amin was not a proper party under counts one and two, the statutory claims, and agreed that Dr. Amin should be dismissed from those counts. Furthermore, the court went on to find that appellant had not set forth any facts that would lead reasonable minds to find that appellees had engaged in a retaliatory discharge or in a wrongful termination of appellant. In a separate judgment entry, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on May 23, 2007. She appeals only from the trial court\u2019s judgment granting summary judgment in favor of appellees and does not appeal from the court\u2019s denial of her summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant raises two assignments of error, which state:</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe lower court in its May 2, 2007 nunc pro tunc journal entry committed error when it awarded summary judgment to defendant/appellee Steubenville Orthopedics and Sports Medicine (\u2018Steubenville Orthopedics\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe lower court in its May 2, 2007 nunc pro tunc journal entry committed error when it awarded summary judgment to defendant/appellee Kumar Amin, M.D.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">{\u00b6 15} Initially, it should be noted that appellant attached several uncertified and incomplete depositions to her motion for summary judgment. There is no indication that appellant filed the actual certified depositions with the trial court, nor did she file them with this court. Additionally, both parties attached various documents to their motions for summary judgment/responses, which are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>proper summary judgment evidence. However, both parties rely on and cite the deposition excerpts and other documents. Civ.R. 56(C) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the <em>pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, </em>if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. No evidence or stipulation may be considered except as stated in this rule.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">{\u00b6 17} Since the depositions were never actually filed in the trial court, they are not proper summary judgment evidence. Additionally, the other documents were simply attached to the parties\u2019 motions/responses. However, it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to consider nonconforming summary judgment evidence when there is no objection. <em>Bell v. Holden Surveying, Inc., </em>7th Dist. No. 01-AP-766, 2002-Ohio-5018, 2002 WL 31115653, at \u00b6 22. It appears from the trial court\u2019s judgment entry that it considered all of the evidence the parties attached to their motions and responses regardless of whether it was proper summary judgment evidence. Furthermore, both parties relied on this evidence and voiced no objections. Therefore, we too will consider the deposition excerpts and other evidence despite their noncompliance with Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">{\u00b6 18} In reviewing an award of summary judgment, appellate courts must apply a de novo standard of review. <em>Cole v. Am. Industries &amp; Resources Corp. </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 546, 552, 715 N.E.2d 1179. Thus, we shall apply the same test as the trial court in determining whether summary judgment was proper. Civ.R. 56(C) provides that the trial court shall render summary judgment if no genuine issue of material fact exists, and when construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can conclude only that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>State ex rel. Parsons v. Fleming </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 509, 511, 628 N.E.2d 1377. A \u201cmaterial fact\u201d depends on the substantive law of the claim being litigated. <em>Hoyt, Inc. v. Gordon &amp; Assoc., Inc. </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 598, 603, 662 N.E.2d 1088, citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 242, 247-248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant addresses her assignments of error by breaking her argument down into three issues. These issues will be addressed individually. Appellant\u2019s first issue states:</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe trial court committed error when it determined that no genuine issue of fact existed as to the identity of the appellant\u2019s employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">{\u00b6 21} To rebut appellees\u2019 contention that HMRI was appellant\u2019s employer and they were not, appellant relied on HMRI\u2019s denials to requests for admissions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>answers to interrogatories, as well as on the deposition testimony of HMRI\u2019s president, Richard DeLuca. In these items, HMRI denied that it was appellant\u2019s employer. Without specifically stating that it was doing so, the trial court appears to have determined that appellant could not use these evidentiary materials in support of her case because HMRI is no longer a party to this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant argues that this evidence was proper summary judgment evidence, regardless of the fact that she had settled with HMRI and dismissed it from the case. She asserts that this evidence created a genuine issue of material fact as to who her true employer was.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">{\u00b6 23} In response, appellees argue that Dr. Amin never employed appellant in his personal capacity. In support of their contention, appellees rely on Dr. Amin\u2019s affidavit. Dr. Amin stated that he is a shareholder, officer, and employee of Steubenville Orthopedics. He further stated that he never personally employed appellant to work for him. And he stated that all issues relating to his right to practice medicine pass through Steubenville Orthopedics and not through him personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">{\u00b6 24} Appellant did not present any evidence to rebut these statements by Dr. Amin or to show that Dr. Amin employed her in his personal capacity. Thus, summary judgment was proper in favor of Dr. Amin.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">{\u00b6 25} But the issue as to Steubenville Orthopedics is not that simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">{\u00b6 26} In his deposition, DeLuca identified an employment application that HMRI had on file for appellant. He stated that when a medical practice informs HMRI that it is going to hire a new employee, HMRI requests that the new employee complete an application so that HMRI has a document on file to process the payroll. DeLuca also identified an HMRI confidentiality agreement signed by appellant. Finally, and most important, DeLuca testified regarding the April 27, 2005 letter that he sent to appellant. The letter is addressed to appellant and states:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cAs you are aware, you have been employed through Health Management Resources \u2018at will\u2019 to serve as the X-ray Technician for Steubenville Orthopedics and Sports Medicine. While your payroll management, any benefits, and other payroll-related services have been provided by Health Management Resources, your day-to-day work assignment has been with Dr. Amin and his medical practice. Accordingly, you are assigned \u2018at will\u2019 to that practice and your wage rate, benefit levels, vacation and sick benefits, and other aspects of your employment are determined by that practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>{\u00b6 28} \u201cAfter multiple discussions with Dr. Amin in recent days and weeks, it became apparent that in your absence, Dr. Amin needed to secure the services of someone to perform the technical duties relating to the X-ray service within his office. Upon securing such technical support on a part time basis similar to the schedule that you worked, Dr. Amin has advised Health Management Resources that at [the] time, these other arrangements are adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cHealth Management Resources, on the other hand, is an administrative support service organization and does not utilize the skills of an X-ray Technician within the administrative functions of our business. Accordingly, you are hereby notified that you are being re-classified to \u2018layoff status. You are <em>not </em>being terminated at this time and should a position open up either at Dr. Amin\u2019s office or other medical offices who work with Health Management Resources, you will be considered for those positions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b6 30} DeLuca stated that although he used the term \u201clayoff\u2019 in the letter, he knew that appellant was actually being terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">{\u00b6 31} In addition to these documents, appellees also presented a document from appellant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation hearing where HMRI was treated as her employer. And DeLuca testified that he attended appellant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">{\u00b6 32} Finally, Georgeanna Hasley, Dr. Amin\u2019s office manager, stated in her deposition that HMRI employed her and had employed appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">{\u00b6 33} While this evidence indicates that HMRI was appellant\u2019s employer, other evidence exists that seems to create a genuine issue of material fact on this question as it pertains to Steubenville Orthopedics.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">{\u00b6 34} In his deposition, DeLuca stated that HMRI was simply the payroll agent for appellees. He further stated that HMRI undertook no supervision of appellees\u2019 employees. DeLuca stated that HMRI took appellees\u2019 employees and put them on HMRI\u2019s payroll and then paid unemployment and workers\u2019 compensation insurance for those employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">{\u00b6 35} DeLuca also testified regarding a document entitled \u201cStaff Leasing Protocols,\u201d which HMRI provided to all physicians who had a relationship with HMRI. He stated that this document provided that HMRI would terminate an employee working at Steubenville Orthopedics only if Dr. Amin requested it. However, this document did not refer to any specific parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">{\u00b6 36} DeLuca further stated that he provided the termination notice to appellant at Dr. Amin\u2019s request. He stated that Dr. Amin had replaced appellant and did not want her back at his practice. DeLuca further stated that HMRI did not hire appellant, it did not manage appellant, it did not assign her, it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>direct her day-to-day activities, and it did not set her wage. For all these reasons, DeLuca stated that appellant was not HMRI\u2019s employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 37} Furthermore, as to appellant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, DeLuca stated that the only reason HMRI was considered appellant\u2019s employer was because she was under HMRI\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 38} DeLuca also reconfirmed the answers he gave to interrogatories. He stated that HMRI\u2019s sole function as it applied to appellees was to provide payroll and administrative functions for their employees. DeLuca stated that even though HMRI put appellees\u2019 employees on its payroll, appellant and others like her were still appellees\u2019 employees. And DeLuca stated that HMRI did not determine the terms and conditions of appellant\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">{\u00b6 39} Additionally, while Hasley stated that HMRI was hers and appellant\u2019s employer, she also stated that Dr. Amin interviewed appellant before she was hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">{\u00b6 40} And in her initial claim-information report for workers\u2019 compensation, appellant listed Steubenville Orthopedics as her employer. Thus, before an issue arose concerning who employed her, appellant believed that Steubenville Orthopedics was her employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">{\u00b6 41} Given the above evidence, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to who was appellant\u2019s true employer. We must construe the above evidence in the light most favorable to appellant. In doing so, there is a question whether HMRI or Steubenville Orthopedics was appellant\u2019s true employer. While HMRI issued appellant\u2019s paychecks and handled her workers\u2019 compensation issues, it did not direct her daily work activities, set her wage, or hire her. Most important, HMRI did not make the decision to terminate appellant\u2019s employment. It simply carried out appellees\u2019 wishes on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">{\u00b6 42} As stated above, however, appellant did not present any evidence to rebut Dr. Amin\u2019s statements in his affidavit that he did not employ appellant in his personal capacity. Thus, summary judgment in favor of Dr. Amin was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">{\u00b6 43} Thus, appellant\u2019s first issue has merit as it relates to Steubenville Orthopedics, but it does not have merit as it relates to Dr. Amin.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">{\u00b6 44} Appellant\u2019s second issue states:</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThe trial court committed error when it ruled that the appellees were entitled to summary judgment as to Counts I and III of the Complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">{\u00b6 46} Here, appellant argues that summary judgment was improper on her retaliatory-discharge claims. In support, appellant relies on <em>Coolidge v. River-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>dale Local School Dist., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 141, 2003-Ohio-5357, 797 N.E.2d 61, at \u00b6 46, where the Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cIn our opinion, the policy of protection embodied in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act can be effectuated only if an employer is not permitted to discharge an employee for being absent from work due to an allowed injury for which the employee is receiving TTD [temporary total disability] compensation. We hold, therefore, that an employee who is receiving TTD compensation pursuant to R.C. 4123.56 may not be discharged solely on the basis of absenteeism or inability to work, when the absence or inability to work is directly related to an allowed condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 48} Appellant points to Dr. Amin\u2019s statements that she was terminated due to her absenteeism. She also points out that her termination occurred while she was on medical leave and that she received TTD benefits for her absence from work during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">{\u00b6 49} Additionally, appellant argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether appellees had a nondiscriminatory reason for her termination. She states that the only reason appellees gave for her termination was her absenteeism. However, she claims that the evidence demonstrated that prior to her work accident, she missed only one day of work every five to six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">{\u00b6 50} A retaliatory-discharge claim can take one of two forms \u2014 a statutory claim or a common-law claim. Appellant raised both.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">{\u00b6 51} Appellant\u2019s argument surrounding the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Coolidge, </em>supra, is limited to the public-policy claim. However, the discussion regarding <em>Coolidge </em>has been rendered moot given a recent Ohio Supreme Court decision. On December 20, 2007, the Ohio Supreme Court determined that <em>Coolidge </em>is limited to the very specific facts of that case. <em>Bickers v. W. &amp; S. Life Ins. Co., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 351, 2007-Ohio-6751, 879 N.E.2d 201. The court stated that its holding in <em>Coolidge </em>was limited to \u201cconsiderations of \u2018good and just cause\u2019 for termination under R.C. 3319.16 [which deals with the termination of a teacher\u2019s contract] and does not create a claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy for an employee who is discharged while receiving workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">{\u00b6 52} The court went on to hold:</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cAn employee who is terminated from employment while receiving workers\u2019 compensation has no common-law cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of the public policy underlying R.C. 4123.90, which provides the exclusive remedy for employees claiming termination in violation of rights conferred by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>(Coolidge v. Riverdale Local </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>School Dist., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 141, 2003-Ohio-5357, 797 N.E.2d 61, limited.)\u201d Id. at the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">{\u00b6 54} Thus, based on the court\u2019s recent holding, appellant is now limited to asserting only a statutory retaliation claim. Her public-policy claim is no longer an option.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">{\u00b6 55} A statutory retaliatory-discharge claim is governed by R.C. 4123.90, which provides that no employer shall discharge or take any punitive action against an employee because the employee filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">{\u00b6 56} To prove a violation of R.C. 4123.90, the employee must set forth a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge demonstrating that (1) she was injured on the job, (2) she filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation, and (3) she was discharged by her employer in contravention of R.C. 4123.90. <em>Wilson v. Riverside Hosp. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 8, 18 OBR 6, 479 N.E.2d 275, at the syllabus. Once the employee demonstrates a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to set forth a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the discharge. <em>Kilbarger v. Anchor Hocking Glass Co. </em>(1997), 120 Ohio App.3d 332, 338, 697 N.E.2d 1080. If the employer can set forth a nonretaliatory reason for the discharge, the burden then shifts back to the employee to show that the employer\u2019s reason is a pretext and that the real reason for the discharge was the employee\u2019s protected activity under the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">{\u00b6 57} In this case, there is no dispute that appellant was injured on the job on August 20, 2004, and that she filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim both immediately following her injury and again in March 2005. However, a question of fact surrounds whether appellant was discharged because she filed her workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">{\u00b6 58} In his deposition, DeLuca stated that Dr. Amin had indicated to him that appellant had several absences due to her workplace injury. DeLuca stated that Dr. Amin expressed a concern to him regarding appellant\u2019s absenteeism resulting from her injury. DeLuca stated that Dr. Amin expressed a concern that appellant\u2019s absences would continue into the future. DeLuca further stated that Dr. Amin contacted him a few days before he wrote the termination letter to appellant. According to DeLuca, Dr. Amin indicated that he wanted to retain Deena Reilly, the person who had been filling in for appellant, and terminate appellant. DeLuca stated that the timing of appellant\u2019s discharge was due to the fact that she was to return to work on April 29, 2005, and Dr. Amin wanted to terminate appellant before her return-to-work date.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">{\u00b6 59} In his deposition, Dr. Amin stated that appellant had told him that she had hurt her back at home. He stated that this injury at home was part of the reason she was unable to work for five weeks. He stated that he did not know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>that appellant was going to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim for the five weeks she was off in 2005. And as mentioned above, the Industrial Commission decision granting appellant TTD benefits from March 29, 2005 to May 2, 2005 was not mailed until July 22, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">{\u00b6 60} Dr. Amin further stated that he kept personnel notes for appellant, although he did not keep such notes for any other employee. He stated that this was because appellant was the only employee who had asked him for an evaluation after six months. Dr. Amin stated that he made these notes as the events occurred. In these notes, Dr. Amin wrote that appellant was hired with a back injury that she had incurred while working for her previous employer. He stated that he felt that information was important. He also acknowledged that he noted that appellant had injured her back in a car accident in December 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">{\u00b6 61} Dr. Amin also discussed appellant\u2019s absenteeism and his reasons for replacing her. He stated that in appellant\u2019s first six months, she missed two days of work. Dr. Amin stated that his personnel notes did not list all of appellant\u2019s absences from work. He stated that this was because he forgot to record some of them. According to Dr. Amin\u2019s personnel notes, appellant did not miss any work in 2004. However, he stated that he thought she missed some days but he did not know how many. In total, Dr. Amin recorded six absences for appellant in over two and a half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">{\u00b6 62} Dr. Amin also acknowledged a time in January 2003 when appellant called and stated that she could not come to work the next day because her back hurt. However, when Steubenville Orthopedics could not find anyone to fill in for appellant and asked her to come to work, she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">{\u00b6 63} Dr. Amin stated that he was concerned that appellant\u2019s injury would prevent her from coming to work, and he needed someone who could come to work on a regular basis. However, he stated that appellant\u2019s replacement had missed five to ten days of work in the 18 months that she had been there, yet he had no concerns about her reliability for coming to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">{\u00b6 64} Dr. Amin further stated that he was bothered by appellant\u2019s discussion with other employees about her wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">{\u00b6 65} And Dr. Amin stated that appellant was not committed to her job. He stated that he had reached this opinion of appellant in her first year of employment, which was 2002. However, he had no explanation for why he kept her on for over two years after this, despite his displeasure with her. Furthermore, even though Dr. Amin claimed to have been displeased with appellant, he gave her a 50-cent-an-hour raise in January 2003 and another 50-cenNan-hour raise in July 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>{\u00b6 66} Georgeanna Hasley, the office manager, stated in her deposition that she first brought concerns to Dr. Amin about appellant\u2019s absence from work after appellant\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">{\u00b6 67} DeLuca also stated that both Dr. Amin and Hasley indicated to him that appellant had frequent absences due to her back injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">{\u00b6 68} Hasley further testified regarding the circumstances surrounding appellant\u2019s termination. She stated that appellant called her on April 26, 2005, to inform her that she would be back to work on May 2, 2005. This was also evidenced by an email Hasley sent to someone at HMRI. Hasley stated that at this time, she was unaware that appellant would not be returning to Steubenville Orthopedics. In the email, however, Hasley wrote, \u201cAs far as she is concerned\u2014 she thinks she is returning on Monday.\u201d Hasley stated that this was simply referring to the change in dates on which appellant expected to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">{\u00b6 69} Dr. Amin stated that he found out that appellant would be able to return to work sometime in the week prior to her return date. However, Dr. Amin stated that when appellant called and informed Hasley that she would be returning to work, he had already decided to keep Reilly. He stated that Hasley then came to talk to him about the situation. Dr. Amin stated that by April 26, 2005, Hasley had already told Reilly that she was going to be staying on. However, Hasley stated that she had no idea that appellant was not coming back until after appellant received the termination letter on April 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">{\u00b6 70} Dr. Amin also testified that he was aware that the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation determined that appellant\u2019s five-week absence from work during March and April 2005 was due to her workplace injury. However, he stated that he disagreed with this determination because he believed that appellant\u2019s injury was due to her hurting her back at home. And he stated that he did not find out that appellant was claiming that her five-week absence in 2005 was due to her work injury until \u201clater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">{\u00b6 71} Furthermore, DeLuca stated that Dr. Amin indicated to him that he should challenge appellant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim because appellant had reinjured herself at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cThe causal connection for a R.C. 4123.90 claim requires evidence of a retaliatory state of mind of the employer. But a plaintiff is not required to present a \u2018smoking gun\u2019 to carry his burden of offering evidence adequate to create an inference that the employment decision was retaliatory. The plaintiff may satisfy his burden with any persuasive evidence of a retaliatory intent and by a direct or an indirect method of proof. Thus, in the absence of sufficient direct proof, the trier of fact should consider a variety of factors in determining whether there is an inference of a retaliatory motive, including, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>not limited to, the temporal proximity of the discharge to the filing of the claim, whether there was punitive action directed towards the employee after the claim was filed, whether the employer evinced a hostile attitude, and whether a legitimate reason existed for the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cIn reviewing the length of time between the claim and the discharge, the trier of fact can consider the date the claim was filed as well as the date of significant actions involving the injured worker\u2019s pursuit of the benefits. While the timing of the termination can contribute to an inference of retaliation, temporal proximity alone is insufficient to support a finding of a causal connection.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Buehler v. AmPam Commercial Midwest, </em>1st Dist. No. C-060475, 2007-Ohio-4708, 2007 WL 2683520, at \u00b6 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">{\u00b6 74} The indirect evidence set out above is sufficient for appellant to assert a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge. In this case, on April 26, 2005, appellant informed Dr. Amin through Hasley that she would be returning to work on May 2. The very next day, April 27, appellant received the letter from DeLuca terminating her employment. And while Dr. Amin stated that he was unaware at this time that appellant was claiming that her five-week absence in March and April 2005 was related to her workplace injury, he was well aware that appellant had filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Additionally, although HMRI was determined to be appellant\u2019s employer for purposes of her workers\u2019 compensation claim, Dr. Amin found it necessary to inform DeLuca that appellant had injured her back at home just prior to going on leave in March 2005. Dr. Amin further stated that he disagreed with the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision that appellant was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation for the five weeks she was off in 2005 because he believed that appellant\u2019s injury was due to her hurting her back at home. He also urged DeLuca to challenge appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">{\u00b6 75} Since appellant asserted a prima facie case, the burden shifted to appellees to put forth a nonretaliatory reason for appellant\u2019s discharge. They did so by basing appellant\u2019s termination on her absenteeism.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">{\u00b6 76} The burden then shifted back to appellant to demonstrate that the reason put forth by appellees was merely a pretext. The evidence that appellant set forth created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether appellees\u2019 stated reason for her termination was a pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">{\u00b6 77} While Dr. Amin stated that the reason he kept personnel notes for appellant and not for any other employee was because she requested an evaluation after six months, this seems peculiar, especially in light of the fact that he recorded appellant\u2019s various back injuries. Dr. Amin found it important to record in appellant\u2019s personnel notes that she had injured her back while working with her previous employer and that she had injured her back in a car accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>{\u00b6 78} Furthermore, the main reason for appellant\u2019s termination, according to Dr. Amin, was her excessive absenteeism. However, according to Dr. Amin\u2019s own notes, prior to appellant\u2019s workplace injury, she had missed only six days of work in over two and a half years. And Dr. Amin stated that appellant\u2019s replacement, Reilly, had missed five to ten days of work in the 18 months that she had been there. Yet he had no concerns regarding Reilly\u2019s attendance as he had with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">{\u00b6 79} Additionally, Dr. Amin stated that appellant was not committed to her job and that he became displeased with her during her first year of employment. But Dr. Amin then gave appellant a 50-cent-an-hour raise in January 2003 and another 50-cenNan-hour raise in July. Had he been truly displeased with appellant, one would think that he would not have given her two raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">{\u00b6 80} In addition, appellees argue in part that appellant\u2019s claim must fail because when she was terminated on April 27, 2005, her workers\u2019 compensation claim had not yet been allowed. Appellant\u2019s claim was not allowed by the Industrial Commission until July 2005. However, appellees\u2019 reasoning must fail. The critical fact here was that appellant <em>filed </em>her workers\u2019 compensation claim before she was terminated. See <em>Rauhuff v. Am. Fan Co. </em>(June 21, 1999), 12th Dist. No. CA98-09-188, 1999 WL 527783. The fact that she did not receive notice of the allowance of her claim until after she was terminated does not affect the fact that appellees were aware that appellant had a workers\u2019 compensation claim pending. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">{\u00b6 81} Based on the foregoing, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Steubenville Orthopedics on appellant\u2019s statutory retaliatory-discharge claim. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second issue is meritorious as it applies to her statutory retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">{\u00b6 82} Appellant\u2019s third issue states:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cThe trial court committed error when it ruled that the appellees were entitled to summary judgment as to Counts II and IV of the Complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">{\u00b6 84} Here, appellant argues that summary judgment was improper on her disability-discrimination claims. She asserts that Dr. Amin perceived her as having a disability because he thought that her injury prevented her from coming to work in any position. In support, appellant relies on Dr. Amin\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">{\u00b6 85} Like the retaliatory discharge claims, appellant\u2019s disability-discrimination claim takes two forms \u2014 a statutory claim and a common law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">{\u00b6 86} R.C. 4112.02 governs statutory disability-discrimination claims. It provides that it is an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer to discharge without just cause an employee based on disability. R.C. 4112.02(A). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>A disability includes \u201ca physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, including the functions of caring for one\u2019s self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working; a record of a physical or mental impairment; or being regarded as having a physical or mental impairment.\u201d R.C. 4112.01(A)(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">{\u00b6 87} In order to prove disability discrimination under R.C. 4112.02, the plaintiff must show that: (1) she has a qualifying disability, (2) she was terminated at least in part because of her disability, and (3) her disability does not prevent her from safely and substantially performing the essential functions of the job in question. <em>Columbus Civ. Serv. Comm. v. McGlone </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 569, 571, 697 N.E.2d 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 88} Appellant did not assert that she is disabled. Instead, she asserted that appellees perceived her as being disabled. To succeed on this theory, appellant must show that appellees considered her failure to meet the physical requirements of the job as foreclosing her from a class of jobs. <em>Lanterman v. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc., </em>7th Dist. No. O1-CO-54, 2002-Ohio-5224, 2002 WL 31169030, at \u00b6 22. This court has stated that the employee\u2019s burden is to establish that the employer regarded her as substantially limited in her ability to perform such fundamental and routine tasks as are necessary to exist in everyday life, not merely to establish that the employer regarded the employee as limited in her abilities to perform the specific tasks associated with a specific job. <em>Kemo v. St. Clairsville </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 178, 186, 714 N.E.2d 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 89} In support of her position, appellant relies on Dr. Amin\u2019s deposition testimony. In his deposition, Dr. Amin stated that he had concerns when appellant left work in March 2005 that she would not be able to come back to work or that she would not be able to come back on a regular basis. He stated that he based this concern on appellant\u2019s back pain. However, he did not consider her back pain to be a \u201cphysical impairment.\u201d Dr. Amin stated that he was concerned that appellant had an injury that would prevent her from coming back to work. He stated that his concern was with appellant\u2019s attendance at work. During these questions, Dr. Amin took note that appellant\u2019s job was that of an x-ray technician. Dr. Amin further stated that he wanted to keep Reilly on because he needed someone who did not have an injury that prevented her from coming to work. When asked if he had any concerns when appellant took off work whether she had a physical impairment that would prevent her from handling the physical requirements of her job, Dr. Amin stated that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>{\u00b6 90} Additionally, DeLuca stated that when Dr. Amin told him that he wanted to retain Reilly and fire appellant, Dr. Amin asked him whether he knew of any other physicians who might need appellant\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 91} This evidence does not support appellant\u2019s claim that appellees perceived her as having a disability. Dr. Amin seemed to believe only that appellant might not be able to return to work as an x-ray technician. Appellant presented no evidence that Dr. Amin perceived her as being unable to return to work in any position, as is required. And if Dr. Amin had actually perceived appellant as being disabled and unable to work, he would not have asked DeLuca whether DeLuca knew of any other physicians who might hire appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 92} Furthermore, this court has held that the test that a plaintiff alleging disability discrimination based on a perceived disability must meet is to show that the \u201cimpairment upon which the decision is allegedly based would, if it in fact existed, substantially limit one or more major life activities.\u201d <em>Kemo, </em>128 Ohio App.3d at 185, 714 N.E.2d 412. Here, appellant presented no evidence that her perceived disability (lower back pain) would substantially limit the major life activity of working or any other major life activity. In fact, appellant stated at her deposition that she is now working and leading a normal life.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 93} Thus, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Steubenville Orthopedics on appellant\u2019s statutory disability-discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">{\u00b6 94} Appellant also raised a common-law public-policy claim alleging disability discrimination. To prevail on a wrongful-discharge claim in violation of a public policy, the plaintiff must meet four elements: (1) there must exist a clear public policy that is manifested in a state or federal constitution, statute or administrative regulation, or in the common law (the clarity element), (2) dismissal, under the alleged circumstances, must jeopardize the public policy (the jeopardy element), (3) plaintiffs dismissal must be motivated by conduct related to the public policy (the causation element), and (4) there must be no overriding legitimate business justification for the dismissal (the overriding justification). <em>Barnes v. Cadiz </em>(Mar. 19, 2002), 7th Dist. No. 01-531-CA, 2002 WL 925040, at \u00b6 14, citing <em>Kulch v. Structural Fibers, Inc. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 134, 151, 677 N.E.2d 308. The causation and overriding-justification elements are questions of fact for the jury, while the clarity and jeopardy elements are questions of law for the court. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">{\u00b6 95} For the same reasons that appellant\u2019s statutory disability-discrimination claim fails, this claim too must fail. Accordingly, summary judgment was proper on appellant\u2019s common-law disability-discrimination claim. Thus, appellant\u2019s third issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>{\u00b6 96} Based on our resolution of appellant\u2019s issues, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error has merit as it pertains to her statutory retaliatory-discharge claim only. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error does not have merit as it pertains to her common-law retaliatory-discharge claim and disability-discrimination claims. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error does not have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 97} For the reasons stated above, the trial court\u2019s judgment is hereby reversed and the cause is remanded only as it pertains to Steubenville Orthopedics on appellant\u2019s statutory retaliatory-discharge claim. It is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b682-7\">DeGenaro, P.J., and Vukovich, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
