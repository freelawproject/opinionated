The commission determined that Ohio University unlawfully denied Dr. Robert Lipset promotion and tenure due to his age. The commission and Dr. Lipset,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellants herein, raise the following assignments of error for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>First Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">The court of common pleas abused its discretion when it held that the final order of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission was unsupported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">Second Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">The court of common pleas abused its discretion when it re-weighed the evidence that was originally presented during the commission\u2019s administrative hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">Third Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">The court of common pleas abused its discretion when it labeled age-related comments as \u201cstray remarks,\u201d and then disregarded the comments as irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">Fourth Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">The court of common pleas abused its discretion when it imposed an additional requirement on the commission\u2019s ability to prove an age discrimination claim\u2014 that the underlying victim of discrimination recognize and complain of the age discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">Fifth Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">The court of common pleas abused its discretion when it attributed arguments to the commission that the commission did not present, and then materially faulted the commission for offering no evidence to support those arguments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b457-16\">{\u00b6 2} On January 1, 1995, Ohio University hired 45-year old Dr. Robert Lipset as an assistant professor in the Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering (\u201cIMSE\u201d) Department. In December 2000, Lipset submitted his case for promotion and tenure. By letter dated January 28, 2001, the promotion and tenure committee informed Lipset that it would not recommend promotion and tenure. The committee chair, Dr. David Koonce, explained the committee\u2019s reasons for declining to recommend Lipset for promotion and tenure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-17\">[I]n reviewing your dossier with respect to research and scholarship, the committee had significant reservations about your commitment to funded research and your progress towards an identifiable personal research track. They were most concerned with the fact that your dossier contains no current research proposals or funding. Historically, your proposals were sent to a very limited number of funding agencies. The committee felt that you should have pursued other funding sources from a wider variety of funding agencies. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>committee also felt that you needed some evidence of individual research, since your dossier shows that all your publications as a faculty member were coauthored with Dr. Van Til, your Ph.D. advisor, or Dr. Judd. In addition, the committee observed that, with one exception, your latter papers were all coauthored with graduate students under the direction of Dr. Judd, as opposed to graduate students under your direction. The committee saw this as a major weakness in your case. Lastly, the committee felt that you had too few articles published in professional journals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Koonce noted that the committee \u201cdeemed\u201d Lipset\u2019s teaching and service record \u201cexcellent,\u201d but the promotion and tenure guidelines state that \u201ca deficiency in one category cannot be outweighed by superior performance in one or both of the other categories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 3} Lipset appealed his promotion and tenure denial under university procedures, but his appeal proved unsuccessful. Lipset\u2019s last day of employment was June 8, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">{\u00b6 4} On July 3, 2002, Lipset filed an affidavit with the commission. The commission investigated the charge and found probable cause that Ohio University had engaged in unlawful employment practices in violation of R.C. 4112.02(A). On June 12, 2003, the commission issued a complaint and alleged that Ohio University failed and refused to promote Lipset, faded and refused to offer him tenure, and terminated him for reasons not applied equally to all persons without regard to age.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">{\u00b6 5} On January 22, 2004, a commission hearing officer conducted a public hearing to consider the complaint. At the hearing, Lipset testified regarding various age-related comments that he had heard during his employment at Ohio University. Lipset stated that on one occasion in 1999, Koonce referred to him and some of the retired faculty as \u201clegacies,\u201d a term Koonce had previously used to refer to old and outdated computer software. In 1997, Koonce informed Lipset that female graduate students chose Lipset as their advisor because they felt safe with him, as he was old enough to be their father. On another unspecified occasion, Koonce asked Lipset the age of his children. When Lipset told him his son\u2019s age, Koonce stated, \u201cOh, he\u2019s just about the same age as I am.\u201d Lipset testified that several times Koonce subsequently referred to him as \u201cdad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">{\u00b6 6} Lipset also testified that he felt \u201cthere was an attitude within the [IMSE department] that believed that there was some magical quality to youth in faculty and made them very, very important.\u201d He referred to an April 24, 1998 e-mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>from Dr. Charles Parks, the chair of the IMSE department, that had announced the hiring of two new faculty members: \u201c[W]e are fortunate to have two new bright and young faculty to start the fall quarter.\u201d Lipset also referred to a letter thanking him for a monetary gift to the IMSE department, in which Parks stated, \u201cWe also have an exciting group of young faculty interested in computer applications to manufacturing.\u201d This letter, apparently a form letter sent to donors, also stated: \u201cDr. Robert Lipset joined us in January 1995 from Oakland University. He has over fifteen years experience in automobile manufacturing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">{\u00b6 7} Lipset stated that he believed that the promotion and tenure committee\u2019s collaborative research excuse was \u201cbogus.\u201d He testified that no one told him that a condition of promotion and tenure was individual, as opposed to collaborative, research. He related his understanding .that \u201ccollaborative research was not only desirable, but it was expected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 8} Parks testified that in his annual evaluations, he advised Lipset to develop sponsored research programs. To refute Lipset\u2019s claim of age discrimination, Parks noted that Lipset\u2019s replacement was 47 when Ohio University hired him and that the IMSE department has since tenured two faculty members over the age of 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 9} Koonce testified that the committee had denied Lipset tenure because \u201chis research area was significantly weaker than our expectations would have been.\u201d He more specifically explained: \u201cThere was a significant lack of * * * external funding and the pursuit of external funding, which is one of the criteria is to have external sponsors sponsor your research and fund graduate students and * * * your time in conducting that research. We also found that there was a \u2014 limited independent research on his part and that he had conducted all of his research with other senior faculty.\u201d Koonce stated that \u201cwithout any independent research on [his] own [the committee wasn\u2019t] able to determine if [he] ha[d] abilities and skills to conduct research.\u201d Koonce additionally explained that Lipset\u2019s letters of recommendation were not overly positive. He stated that one was \u201ca very strong letter of support. But the rest were * * * either weak or would not comment.\u201d Koonce stated that Lipset\u2019s research paper award \u201cshowed that he definitely was able to write quality journal publications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 10} Koonce denied Lipset\u2019s claim that age was a factor in the committee\u2019s decision. Koonce recognized Lipset\u2019s claim that Koonce\u2019s case for promotion and tenure was arguably weaker than Lipset\u2019s case, but stated that his research record was stronger because he \u201chad several papers that were published with [his] graduate students only and not the students of other faculty or with other faculty.\u201d He also believed that his funded research record \u201cwas stronger in terms of even though numerically we both had one large grant and his was a single year grant, mine was a multi-year grant over three years, which was about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>$330,000 compared to his which I believe was a single year grant of about $50,000.\u201d Koonce further stated that in contrast to Lipset, at the time of his tenure process he had \u201csix individual research initiatives that [he] was applying to or working with external contacts on including one that was subsequently funded shortly after [his] tenure for about a million dollars.\u201d Koonce stated that he \u201cwas aggressively seeking research,\u201d and that when he looked at Lipset\u2019s dossier, he \u201csaw one small proposal and no real search for research beyond that.\u201d Koonce stated that Lipset\u2019s lack of proposals \u201cwas a significant weakness that [the committee] just could not overcome in [its] voting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 11} Koonce further testified that Lipset rejected an offer to work on one of the projects of Dr. Robert Judd (a professor of engineering). Koonce explained: \u201cDr. Judd had recently completed a sabbatical at G.E. Aircraft Engines and had subsequent to that secured a quite large research project * * *. Dr. Judd apparently contacted Dr. Lipset and asked if he would be interested. And [Dr. Lipset] apparently declined. * * * [Dr. Lipset] said, you know, Judd asked me to work on this project, but I just don\u2019t think I can work with him any more; it will probably cost me tenure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 12} Dr. Kendree Sampson, one of the promotion and tenure committee members, testified that Lipset\u2019s research did not meet the minimum standards. He explained that the research element comprises three main components: \u201c[T]he refereed publications that the candidate has authored, the record of proposal submission \u2014 grant proposal and funding, and the outside of the college recommendation letters that the candidate has received.\u201d Sampson stated that in the first area, Lipset had a \u201csubstantial number of refereed publication. However, there was considerable concern regarding the fact that none of them were apparently due to his and his graduate students\u2019 efforts. * * * [T]he other works were collaborative in nature and the other \u2014 at least one author appeared to be a senior member of that group.\u201d Sampson stated that Lipset did not have refereed publications with only Lipset and his graduate students as authors. Sampson testified that the committee could not determine whether Lipset \u201cever took * * * the leadership role in the work\u201d and that it \u201cwas a serious shortcoming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 13} Sampson additionally explained that Lipset had a \u201ctotally inadequate number of proposals submitted\u201d and that his lack of proposals was the most important factor in denying him promotion and tenure. He stated: \u201c[T]here is an expectation that candidates for tenure will establish a reputation among at least \u2014 in a national scene where other researchers in his area or her area are able to comment upon the quality of the research that the candidate has performed.\u201d Sampson testified that Lipset did not submit recommendation letters from tenured professors at other universities.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Dr. Lonnie Welch,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> also a member of the promotion and tenure committee, stated that he saw a downward trend in Lipset\u2019s research proposals, and it looked like he \u201cwas slacking off even before getting tenure and that it wasn\u2019t likely that there would be a sustained productivity if [the committee] were to give tenure to the individual.\u201d Welch stated that Lipset had only a small number of proposals per year. Welch further stated that in comparing Lipset\u2019s research projects and proposals to Koonce\u2019s and Gerth\u2019s, he found a \u201cbig difference.\u201d He explained that Koonee wrote many proposals, and four were funded, and Gerth had a sustained level of proposals, and five were funded. In contrast, Lipset had one proposal funded.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">{\u00b6 15} Dr. Dennis Irwin, Dean of the College of Engineering and Technology, stated that he felt the decision to deny Lipset promotion and tenure was \u201con the margin.\u201d Irwin believed that Lipset had a stronger case than Gerth for promotion and tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">{\u00b6 16} Dr. Judd, a professor of engineering, stated that he thought Lipset\u2019s research record met the \u201cminimum research criteria for the college,\u201d but admitted that others could conclude that his research \u201cwas not significant enough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">{\u00b6 17} In addition to the foregoing testimony, the parties submitted the following evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Awards/Merit Raise</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">{\u00b6 18} In the 1996-1997 academic year, Lipset received the \u201cRuss Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Award.\u201d Additionally, in the 1998-1999 academic year, he received the outstanding undergraduate research paper award, and in 1999, he received the IMSE department research award.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">{\u00b6 19} In 2000, the Annual Salary Raise Committee proposed giving Lipset the highest merit-based salary increase among the IMSE department. His raise was proposed to be 3.42%, while the lowest raise was proposed to be 3.06%. In proposing the raises, the committee stated: (1) \u201cThe annual raise would be based on merit in teaching, research, and service for each faculty\u201d; (2) \u201cThe committee considered only major components (due to limited time frame) of activities in those areas: number of courses taught, course evaluations, research projects amount, number of submitted proposals, journal papers, and committees\u201d; (3) \u201cThe committee decided that the range of salary increases would be between 3.0% and 3.5% due to very similar achievements of all faculty members.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>calculating the merit raises, \u201cthe committee ranked all faculty members for each of three areas, and computed averages from those as proposed raise levels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Annual Evaluations</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 20} Parks\u2019s annual evaluations between 1996 and 1998 were generally favorable and advised Lipset to \u201ccontinue to focus special attention and make a special effort to balance your efforts in teaching, proposal writing and publication of your research efforts in archival (refereed) journals.\u201d Parks\u2019s 1999 evaluation pointed out some specific areas for improvement: \u201cWhile your publication record shows much activity, the record is unbalanced toward conference proceedings. I suggest that you focus more effort on writing peer reviewed archival journal articles.\u201d Regarding Lipset\u2019s proposals, Parks stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">I commend your effort to develop and submit another NSF Careers proposal, an NSF unsolicited proposal and your participation with the Tinker AFB white paper effort. However, since you are not having much success with NSF, you should expand your proposal writing efforts to other funding sources. You can utilize the offices of sponsored research to identify other potential sponsoring agencies. Your consulting activity with Chrysler is commendable and indicates that you are able to perform successfully as an engineer in the \u201creal world.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">{\u00b6 21} Parks\u2019s 1999 evaluation also cautioned Lipset that his lack of sponsored research \u201cmight pose a serious problem\u201d for his promotion and tenure case. He stated: \u201cNotwithstanding your previously cited proposal writing efforts, my sense is that you are not being aggressive enough in seeking and obtaining sponsored research. Based upon recent P &amp; T decisions rendered here at the college, this sponsored research deficiency might pose a serious problem for your P &amp; T case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">{\u00b6 22} In Parks\u2019s 2000 evaluation, he again recommended that Lipset \u201cexpand [his] proposal writing efforts to other funding sources.\u201d Parks stated that Lipset\u2019s \u201cscholarly publication record is acceptable,\u201d but \u201ca modern engineering program requires that faculty develop an entrepreneurial vision for developing sponsored programs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">Promotion and Tenure Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">{\u00b6 23} The promotion and tenure guidelines contain three categories: teaching effectiveness, scholarly activities, and other services. Regarding scholarly activities, the guidelines state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>This department considers relevant and ongoing scholarly activity to be essential for the professional development of its faculty. Evidence of such scholarly performance is to be sought in areas of publications such as books; chapters in published books; published research reports; articles in refereed journals; efforts and works judged by the community of experts in the discipline to be appropriate and worthwhile; conference papers presented and/or published in conference proceedings; articles in representative technical and trade publications; presentation of invited papers; professional recognition or honors; research activities such as procurement and direction of research grants or contracts; development of research equipment, research software, and research laboratories; participation in interdepartmental research; supervision of non-thesis projects, master\u2019s theses, and Ph.D. dissertations; participation on non-thesis projects, master thesis, and Ph.D. dissertation committees; participation in faculty development efforts such as short courses and technical seminars; and consulting. The merits and nature of relevant scholarly activity will be assessed in the context of that which commands the respect of other faculty in the department, the faculty of similar departments of other institutions, and research leaders in the relevant fields of practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">An updated version of the guidelines states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">The principal functions of a faculty member * * * are: transmitting analysis and design skills through effective teaching and training, advancing engineering and technology through creative researeh/scholarly activities, and service to Ohio University and the faculty member\u2019s profession. Faculty members are expected to engage in all of these interrelated functions. However, the relative weighting of these functions in determining promotion and/or tenure is not necessarily the same for every faculty member or every department. The candidate\u2019s balance of development and total contribution to the Department and College is what is considered in the final decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The revised guidelines also discuss \u201cresearch and scholarly accomplishments\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVf\">Researeh/scholarly performance is an important factor in the consideration of promotion and the granting of tenure. Judgments of researeh/scholarly accomplishments are based upon recognition given to these works by appropriate experts outside the College. Researeh/scholarly accomplishments include publications of journal papers, refereed publications and books, success in the procurement and performance of,research grants and contracts, patents received, number and quality of theses and dissertations directed, peer reviews of research work and other work considered to be appropriate. Research/seholarly accomplishments also can result in changes in engineering practice and improved products. The Russ College of Engineering and Technology recognizes that engineering researeh/scholarly accomplishments are typically accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>plished through team efforts; consequently, collaboration with colleagues within and outside the University in accomplishing research is valued. For promotion to Professor, in instances where a majority of a candidate\u2019s research/scholarly activity is collaborative in nature, the candidate must demonstrate leadership in collaboration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Lipset\u2019s Dossier</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 24} Under the section titled \u201cSponsored Research Projects and Grants,\u201d Lipset listed one project during the 1999-2000 year. He also listed three grants: (1) one for the 1996-1997 year, (2) one for the 1997-1998 year, and (3) one for the 1998-1999 year. He listed a fourth grant with an unspecified year that was an equipment donation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 25} Under his proposals section, Lipset listed seven proposals that he requested from 1995 to 1999. All but one of the proposals were rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">5</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">Letters of Recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">{\u00b6 26} Dr. Thomas Lacksonen\u2019s letter of recommendation answered some specific questions regarding Lipset\u2019s research that Koonce apparently requested him to address. Lacksonen wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">To answer your specific questions, Dr. Lipset\u2019s research has significance and depth. His publications are in outstanding journals and he has a solid reputation of presenting sound research results at the conferences. Yes, he has a vision for the future. His industry contacts have guided him to useful topics such as deadlock detection and PLC emulation which have practical industrial applications. Yes, his career is based on an upward trajectory. His productivity in terms of papers, presentations, funding, and students started slowly but are clearly increasing in the last few years. Yes, he will be working in new areas in 10 years, as guided into interdisciplinary projects by his industrial contacts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">Lacksonen found Lipset\u2019s research performance to be \u201cacceptable\u201d and stated that \u201chis reputation and potential\u201d in the research category are \u201coutstanding.\u201d {\u00b6 27} Dr. Ruven Brooks also wrote a recommendation letter. His letter is more vague than Lacksonen\u2019s, but \u201cpredict[ed] that [Dr. Lipset] will have a successful, diverse, long term research career.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">{\u00b6 28} Dr. Philip Wolfe, an Arizona State University professor, stated that he had concern regarding Lipset\u2019s scholarly contributions because (1) he had only two publications in refereed journals, (2) his research funding level had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>significant, and (3) his research seemed focused on \u201cold\u201d manufacturing problems, meaning issues that have been studied for some time. Wolfe did not find Lipset\u2019s accomplishments \u201cpoor,\u201d but saw \u201csome avenues for him to significantly improve the results of his efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">6</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Comparisons to Other Faculty Awarded Promotion and Tenure</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 29} The commission presented evidence regarding Koonce\u2019s and Dr. Richard Gerth\u2019s promotion and tenure to show that they also had deficiencies in at least one of the three categories, yet were granted tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Dr. Gerth</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">{\u00b6 30} Dr. Helmut Zwahlen, the chair of Gerth\u2019s promotion and tenure committee, wrote the following regarding Gerth\u2019s promotion and tenure: \u201cThe committee has serious concerns about Dr. Gerth\u2019s history of teaching effectiveness.\u201d The committee ranked his teaching effectiveness \u201cat the most \u2018average to below average.\u2019 \u201d The committee ranked his scholarly activities as \u201caverage\u201d to \u201cbelow average.\u201d The committee explained that its rating was \u201cprimarily based upon the low number of actual publications (only four from 1992 to 1997) in archival journals, combined with questions about his ability to independently attract research sponsorship.\u201d The committee ranked his sponsored research activity as \u201cabove average\u201d to \u201caverage.\u201d The committee felt that Gerth\u2019s \u201carchival publications record\u201d presented \u201ca real promotion problem.\u201d The committee ranked Gerth\u2019s service record as \u201cabove average.\u201d Although the committee unanimously voted not to recommend Gerth for promotion to Associate Professor, the committee unanimously voted to recommend Gerth for tenure. Zwahlen explained: \u201cIn spite of the committee\u2019s concerns regarding teaching effectiveness, considering that Dr. Gerth is providing the IMSE department with valuable expertise in the areas of quality systems, quality control, experimental design methodology, tolerancing, and that the IMSE Department, the ENT College and the University has invested ..a considerable amount of resources in Dr. Gerth, the committee recommends tenure for Dr. Gerth. With appropriate improvements in the teaching area, the archival referred publications, and a higher research funding success rate, the committee feels that Dr. Gerth has the potential to become a highly successful faculty member in the IMSE Department in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>b</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Dr. Koonce</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 31} Gerth, the chair of Koonce\u2019s promotion and tenure committee, explained the committee\u2019s findings in a January 8, 1999 letter to Parks. Gerth stated that Koonce\u2019s \u201coverall teaching effectiveness is \u2018below average\u2019 to \u2018average.\u2019 \u201d Gerth explained that \u201c[t]he committee was divided on his scholarly activities rating him a \u2018below average\u2019 to \u2018above average.\u2019 \u201d He stated that the committee did not agree on the significance of \u201cseveral issues including: (1) Publications: With one exception, Dr. Koonce\u2019s archival journal publications are all in a single journal; (2) Proposals: fewer than 2 external proposals per year submitted almost exclusively to NSF, and no proposals pending since April of 1998; (3) Collaboration: nearly all publications and research is collaborative.\u201d Gerth wrote, \u201cA negative interpretation is that Dr. Koonce is incapable of establishing his own research focus independent of his major collaborators, and that his research is only published in one journal of low quality. Although a majority of the committee members did not ascribe to this interpretation, all committee members expressed some concern over one or more of the above issues.\u201d Gerth stated that the committee nonetheless believed that \u201cDr. Koonce will continue to attract external funding, publish in archival journals, and establish himself as a preeminent scholar.\u201d The committee also rated Koonce\u2019s service as \u201cbelow average\u201d to \u201caverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 32} The committee subsequently voted to award Koonce promotion and tenure. In closing, Gerth noted that \u201cthis was a difficult case\u201d and made the following observations: (1) \u201cThere were significant discrepancies as to the criteria for promotion and tenure. It was clear that different committee members had different] expectations. I think the tenure and promotion expectations of each senior faculty should be made clear in an annual letter to the junior faculty, if only to inform the junior faculty what they can expect\u201d; and (2) \u201c[Tjhere was unanimous agreement that the annual evaluation letters from the department chair were ineffective in helping the candidate improve his career prospects. They were virtually identical from year to year with little concrete suggestions for improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">{\u00b6 33} After hearing the evidence in the case sub judice, the committee\u2019s Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) recommended that the commission dismiss the complaint because the evidence did not show that Ohio University unlawfully discriminated against Lipset due to his age. The ALJ found that even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>commission proved a prima facie case of age discrimination, (1) Ohio University-presented a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Lipset\u2019s promotion and tenure denial and (2) the commission failed to prove that Ohio University\u2019s reason was merely a pretext for age discrimination. The ALJ noted that although the commission introduced evidence of a few ageist remarks that Lipset\u2019s peers and superiors made, those remarks constituted \u201cstray remarks\u201d because the commission presented no evidence that (1) the remarks occurred during the time frame of Lipset\u2019s promotion and tenure process or that (2) the remarks were in any way related to the decisional process. The ALJ found: \u201cAll of the comments introduced by the Commission were either an isolated use of an age-related comment, a stray remark, or remote in time and unrelated to the decisional process.\u201d The ALJ further found that the commission had failed to show that the promotion and tenure committee\u2019s rating of Lipset\u2019s research and tenure record was false or inaccurate. Thus, the ALJ recommended that the commission dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">THE COMMISSION\u2019S DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 34} The commission declined to accept the ALJ\u2019s recommendation. Instead, the commission determined that Ohio University denied Lipset promotion and tenure due to his age. The commission found \u201cthat the ALJ did not take notice of reliable, probative and substantial evidence in the record which establishes that unlawful discrimination occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 35} In particular, the commission found that the ALJ had failed to account for several facts. Although Lipset was deficient in research, the year before his tenure application, he was awarded the IMSE department Research Award. Before that, he was awarded the Engineering College\u2019s \u201cOutstanding Research Paper Award.\u201d Lipset published numerous research papers in some of the most highly respected journals in engineering and presented papers at numerous conferences. Lipset also received grants as a result of his research proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">{\u00b6 36} Parks, in his yearly evaluation during the same year that Lipset applied for tenure, informed Lipset that his \u201careas of special strength are clearly scholarship, teaching and service to the College and Department.\u201d Just before his promotion and tenure denial, Lipset was recommended for the largest merit raise in his department. The amount of increase was based upon merit in \u201cteaching, research, and service.\u201d The commission found that \u201c[t]hese three areas * * * are the exact same criteria\u201d used in evaluating a professor for promotion and tenure. \u201cIn other words, just prior to his denial of tenure and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>promotion, Dr. Lipset\u2019s performance was rated higher than every other professor in his department, including professors who had already been tenured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 37} The commission additionally found that the ALJ failed to account for the fact that substantially younger professors were treated better. \u201c[Substantially younger professors in the IMSE Department have been awarded promotion and tenure despite having markedly lower performance ratings than Dr. Lipset in the categories of teaching, service, and research. For example, Dr. Richard Gerth was recommended for tenure at the age of 38. Overall, Dr. Gerth\u2019s teaching was rated to be \u2018at the most\u2019 below average to average. Likewise, Dr. Parks\u2019 annual evaluations of Dr. Gerth repeatedly cited his poor teaching skills. Dr. Gerth\u2019s scholarly research was also ranked as \u2018below average\u2019 to \u2018average\u2019 due to his low number of actual publications, and his annual evaluation letters repeatedly pointed out his \u2018serious deficiency\u2019 in publications.\u201d He nevertheless was granted tenure in January of 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 38} The commission also found that Koonce had received tenure at the age of 32, even though he \u201chad severe performance deficiencies.\u201d The commission found that Koonce \u201cwas rated as \u2018below average\u2019 to \u2018average\u2019 with regard to his teaching. Dr. Koonce\u2019s research efforts were noted to have been \u2018only published in one journal of low quality,\u2019 with several other negative comments. Dr. Koonce was also rated \u2018below average\u2019 to \u2018average\u2019 in the service category. Dr. Koonce was rated, to some degree, as \u2018below average\u2019 in each category of \u2018teaching, service, and research,\u2019 and yet he was recommended for tenure on January 8, 1999.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">{\u00b6 39} The commission also found that \u201c[sjeveral persons involved in the ultimate decision to deny tenure and promotion to Dr. Lipset demonstrated a troubling animus against older persons. In fact, Dr. Gerth, who was involved in the decision to deny tenure and promotion to Dr. Lipset, documented his feelings regarding Dr. Lipset\u2019s age when he wrote that Dr. Lipset was \u2018too old\u2019 for the job. Although this comment was written by Dr. Gerth during the hiring process, the fact that the comment referenced Dr. Lipset\u2019s overall qualifications to be a professor, combined with the fact that the comment was made in writing, is reliable, probative, and substantial evidence demonstrating that Dr. Gerth denied Dr. Lipset tenure due to his age.\u201d The commission further stated: \u201cDr. Gerth also made it known to Dr. Lipset that he felt Dr. Lipset\u2019s years of industrial experience before he came to Ohio University would taint his ability to succeed as a professor. Dr. Gerth stated that Dr. Lipset had spent \u2018way too many years\u2019 working on industrial problems to succeed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">{\u00b6 40} The commission further found that Koonce also made \u201ccomments exhibiting a bias against age. Dr. Koonce referred to Dr. Lipset and other older (and already retired) faculty members as \u2018legacies,\u2019 a term that was used to refer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>to \u2018old and outdated\u2019 computer equipment. Dr. Koonce further told Dr. Lipset that several female Masters candidates picked Dr. Lipset as their advisor because they felt safe with him due to the fact that he is \u2018old enough to be their father.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">{\u00b6 41} The commission also found that Parks had \u201cdocumented his preference for younger workers. Dr. Parks sent several letters, including letters to Dr. Lipset, praising other professors in the department as an \u2018exciting group of young faculty\u2019 and stating that, with the addition of two new professors \u2018we are so fortunate to have two bright and young faculty to start the fall quarter.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">{\u00b6 42} The commission concluded that the foregoing events constituted rehable, probative, and substantial evidence that Ohio University denied Lipset promotion and tenure due to his age. The commission determined that Ohio University had articulated a nondiscriminatory reason (i.e., Lipset\u2019s inadequate research), but the commission discredited the reason and found it pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">{\u00b6 43} The commission cited evidence to support its conclusion that Ohio University\u2019s articulated reason was pretextual. First, Lipset received the highest merit raise within his department just prior to the denial of tenure and promotion. The commission stated: \u201cUsing the exact same \u2018teaching, service, and research\u2019 criteria that was allegedly utilized for the tenure and promotion decision, Dr. Lipset received the highest score in his department. Dr. Lipset\u2019s \u2018teaching, service, and research\u2019 score was even higher than those [of] substantially younger professors who had recently been granted promotion and tenure \u2014 Dr. Koonce and Dr. Gerth. The Commission finds this to be reliable, probative, and substantial evidence indicating that the reason given for the subsequent denial of promotion and tenure to Dr. Lipset was not based upon inadequate performance or, specifically, inadequate research.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">{\u00b6 44} Second, the commission further referred to Lipset\u2019s awards as evidence to support its pretext finding. The commission stated: \u201cIn the year just prior to his tenure application, Dr. Lipset was awarded the IMSE Department Research Award. Dr. Lipset was also awarded the Engineering College\u2019s \u2018Outstanding Research Paper Award.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">{\u00b6 45} Third, the commission also determined that Ohio University\u2019s articulated reason was pretextual because Lipset published \u201cnumerous research papers in highly respected journals in engineering, and presented at numerous conferences, and also received grants as a result of his research proposals.\u201d The commission noted that Ohio University\u2019s claim that it denied Lipset promotion and tenure due to inadequate research was not credible because other, younger professors, who exhibited weaker records, were granted tenure. The commission explained: \u201c[0]ther professors in Dr. Lipset\u2019s department were awarded promotion and tenure despite having markedly lower performance records in the categories of teaching, service, and research. Dr. Richard Gerth was recommended for tenure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>despite having ratings of \u2018at the most\u2019 below average to average, and having annual evaluations that repeatedly cited his poor teaching skills. Likewise, Dr. David Koonce was recommended for tenure despite being rated, to some degree, as \u2018below average\u2019 in each category. The Commission finds this to be reliable, probative, and substantial evidence indicating that the reason given for the denial of promotion and tenure to Dr. Lipset was not applied to other, substantially younger professors, and was pretextual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 46} The commission concluded that \u201cthe real reason for the denial of promotion and tenure [was] Dr. Lipset\u2019s age. To begin with, Dr. Koonce (age 32) and Dr. Gerth (age 38) are substantially younger than Dr. Lipset (age 51). The ratings which resulted in promotion and tenure for Dr. Koonce and Dr. Gerth are inferior to Dr. Lipset\u2019s rating, and yet they were granted tenure and promotion while he was denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 47} The commission also cited the various age-related comments as evidence of discrimination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">Chairman Parks, as well as Dr. Gerth and Dr. Koonce, all demonstrated a disturbing history of praising youthful faculty, while being critical of older faculty. Most disturbing of all is Dr. Gerth\u2019s assessment that Dr. Lipset was, in his own words, \u201ctoo old\u201d to be a successful professor. While this comment was made at the time of Dr. Lipset\u2019s hire, it was written, and lends credence to Dr. Lipset\u2019s other allegations of age-related comments. Further, the written comment provides remarkable insight into Dr. Gerth\u2019s view that age was a barricade to Dr. Lipset\u2019s career goal of becoming a professor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">This evidence, along with Dr. Gerth\u2019s further comments that Dr. Lipset\u2019s years of industrial experience would taint his ability to succeed as a professor, and that Dr. Lipset had spent \u201cway too many years\u201d working on industrial problems to succeed, coupled with Dr. Koonce\u2019s comments comparing Dr. Lipset to \u201cold and outdated\u201d computer equipment, and Chairman Parks repeated written preferences for \u201cyoung faculty\u201d in the IMSE Department, are all examples of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence that age was the reason for Dr. Lipset\u2019s denial of tenure and promotion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">TRIAL COURT PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">{\u00b6 48} On February 6, 2006, Ohio University appealed the commission\u2019s decision to the Athens County Common Pleas Court. The trial court reversed the commission\u2019s decision and determined that reliable, substantial, and probative evidence did not support the commission\u2019s finding that Ohio University\u2019s reason for denying Lipset promotion and tenure was false and a pretext for discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>tion. The trial court concluded that the evidence the commission cited to support its finding of pretext is not reliable, probative, and substantial evidence of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">{\u00b6 49} In particular, the trial court found no evidence to support the commission\u2019s statement that Lipset\u2019s teaching and research awards mirrored the promotion and tenure criteria. The trial court emphasized that the evidence revealed a reasonable, professional disagreement concerning Lipset\u2019s research record. Further, the trial court found no reliable, substantial, and probative evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding of intentional age discrimination. The trial court noted that none of the age-related comments related to the decisional process that resulted in Lipset\u2019s denial of promotion and tenure. The trial court explained: \u201cLipset was hired after the remark of \u2018too old\u2019 was written in the hiring interview form by Gerth. Parks\u2019 June 1, 1999, letter in which he refers to young faculty members interested in computers also complimented Lipset\u2019s expertise. The Court finds that Koonce\u2019s statement and Park\u2019s [sic] April 24, 1998, e-mail do not suggest malice or ill will towards Lipset. Gerth\u2019s statement may be accurate in the academic world. Koonce and Gerth did not make their statements while they were members of Lipset\u2019s promotions and tenure committee.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b6 50} The trial court also noted that Lipset first complained of age discrimination one and one-half years after the promotion and tenure process began. Lipset testified that he did not file a grievance based on age discrimination during his six years of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">{\u00b6 51} The commission and Lipset now appeal the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">{\u00b6 52} Appellants\u2019 first three assignments of error challenge the propriety of the trial court\u2019s decision to reverse the commission\u2019s decision. Therefore, we consider them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">{\u00b6 53} In their first assignment of error, appellants assert that the trial court independently and improperly reviewed the record, rather than determining whether some reliable, probative, and substantial evidence exists to support the commission\u2019s finding. Appellants claim that the trial court looked to other, contrary evidence in the record that the commission did not rely upon to reach its decision. Appellants appear to assert that a trial court, in reviewing a commission decision, is limited to reviewing only the evidence that the commission relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>upon to reach its finding of discrimination. Thus, appellants contend that the trial court was bound to affirm the commission\u2019s order if some reliable, probative, and substantial evidence supports it.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">{\u00b6 54} In their second assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court improperly weighed the evidence. Appellants assert that the trial court did not simply find a lack of evidence to support the commission\u2019s decision, but instead looked at the entire record to determine whether the evidence supported appellee\u2019s version of events. Within their first and second assignments of error, appellants additionally argue that the trial court abused its discretion by concluding that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence did not support the commission\u2019s finding of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 55} In their third assignment of error, appellants contend that the trial court failed to consider the ageist remarks as reliable, probative, and substantial evidence of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">TRIAL COURT STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">{\u00b6 56} We first address appellants\u2019 first and second assignments of error regarding the trial court\u2019s standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">{\u00b6 57} Under R.C. 4112.06(E), \u201ca trial court must affirm a finding of discrimination under R.C. Chapter 4112, if the finding is supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the entire record.\u201d <em>Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. v. Case W. Res. Univ. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 168, 177, 666 N.E.2d 1376; see also <em>Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Joint Apprenticeship Commt. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 192, 20 O.O.3d 200, 421 N.E.2d 128. \u201cReliable, probative, and substantial evidence\u201d means that quantum of evidence that would support a finding of discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 2000e et seq., Title 42, U.S.Code. <em>Plumbers, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 196, 20 O.O.3d 200, 421 N.E.2d 128. \u201c \u2018Reliable\u2019 evidence is dependable or trustworthy; \u2018probative\u2019 evidence tends to prove the issue in question and is relevant to the issue presented; and \u2018substantial\u2019 evidence carries some weight or value.\u201d <em>Case W. Res. Univ., 76 </em>Ohio St.3d at 178, 666 N.E.2d 1376, citing <em>Our Place, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 570, 571, 589 N.E.2d 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">{\u00b6 58} Under this standard, a trial court must necessarily engage in a limited weighing of the evidence. As <em>Plumbers </em>explained: \u201c[W]hen a court of common pleas reviews an administrative order, it serves a hybrid function. The court must determine as a matter of law whether the administrative decision is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. To make this determination, however, the court must necessarily consider the evidence. Specifically, \u2018where it appears that the administrative determination rests upon inferences improperly drawn from the evidence adduced, the court may reverse the administrative order.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. at 200, 20 O.O.3d 200, 421 N.E.2d 128, quoting <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 111-112, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265; see also <em>Voiers Ent., Inc. v.

Although this in essence is a legal question, inevitably it involves a consideration of the evidence, and to a limited extent would permit a substitution of judgment by the reviewing Common Pleas Court.\u201d Id. at 111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265. Furthermore, while \u201ca Court of Common Pleas \u2018must give due deference to the administrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts,\u2019 <em>[Conrad, </em>63 Ohio St.2d at 111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265], [d]ue deference * * * does not contemplate uncritical acquiescence to administrative findings.\u201d <em>Plumbers, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 200, 20 O.O.3d 200, 421 N.E.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 60} Thus, \u201c[a]s can be seen from the court\u2019s rulings in <em>Conrad </em>and <em>Plumbers, </em>the common pleas court is permitted to inquire and examine the weight and credibility of the evidence upon which the commission based its decision, and that if after its inquiry, the common pleas court determines that the commission\u2019s order is not supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence, it may reverse the commission\u2019s order.\u201d <em>Vinton Cty.

Rather, we believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>that the foregoing case authority establishes that a trial court may appropriately determine, after its review of the evidence in the record, whether the commission drew improper inferences from that evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, we disagree with appellants\u2019 argument that the trial court applied an incorrect standard of review when it reviewed the commission\u2019s finding of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">RELIABLE, PROBATIVE, AND SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 62} We next consider appellants\u2019 argument that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence does not support the commission\u2019s finding of discrimination constitutes an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">APPELLATE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">{\u00b6 63} In contrast to a trial court\u2019s standard of review of a commission decision, an appellate court\u2019s scope of review is more limited. <em>Case W.

There will always be a differentiating factor that permits an employer to choose between applicants whether it be where a particular applicant went to school, whom the applicant knows, or what the applicant is wearing.

Thus, when analyzing age-discrimination claims that rely primarily upon circumstantial evidence, Ohio courts employ the framework articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668. See <em>Williams v. Akron, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 203, 837 N.E.2d 1169, at \u00b6 9; <em>Barker v.

Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis, in the absence of direct evidence of age discrimination, proving an age discrimination claim involves three, evidentiary-shifting steps. See <em>McDonnell Douglas; Barker; Walter, </em>at \u00b6 14. First, a plaintiff must present a prima facie case of age discrimination. <em>Williams, </em>supra, at \u00b6 10. If the plaintiff sets forth a prima facie case, a presumption of discrimination arises. Id. at \u00b6 11, citing <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207. Second, if the plaintiff sets forth a prima facie case of age discrimination, the employer may overcome the presumption by producing evidence that it possessed a legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for the discharge. See <em>Williams </em>at \u00b6 12; <em>Kohmescher, </em>supra. \u201cIf the employer submits admissible evidence that \u2018taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiseriminatory reason for the adverse action,\u2019 then the employer has met its burden of production. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 502, 509, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407. At this point, the presumption created by the prima facie case drops from the case because the employer\u2019s evidence has rebutted the presumption of discrimination.\u201d <em>Williams </em>at \u00b6 12. Third, the employee may refute the employer\u2019s reason for discharge by proving that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was a mere pretext for unlawful discrimination. Id. at \u00b6 14. To show pretext, the employee must prove that the employer\u2019s reason was false and that discrimination was the real reason for the discharge. Id. \u201cThe ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">PRIMA FACIE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 68} To establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, \u201ca plaintiff-employee must demonstrate that he or she (1) was a member of the statutorily protected class, (2) was discharged, (3) was qualified for the position, and (4) was replaced by, or the discharge permitted the retention of, a person of substantially younger age.\u201d <em>Coryell v.

Koonce testified that the committee found Lipset\u2019s research deficiency to be a serious weakness that his excellent teaching and service record could not overcome. \u201cIt is beyond peradventure that deficient scholarship is a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for denying a faculty member tenure.\u201d <em>Langland v.

Thus, \u201c[t]he employee may not satisfy his burden in this final stage by merely showing the employer\u2019s reasons are unworthy of credence.

Thus, rejection of the defendant\u2019s proffered reasons will permit the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>[St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr., </em>509 U.S.] at 511, [113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407].</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Proof that the defendant\u2019s explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive. See id., at 517 [113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407] (\u201c[P]roving the employer\u2019s reason false becomes part of (and often considerably assists) the greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination\u201d). In appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose. Such an inference is consistent with the general principle of evidence law that the factfinder is entitled to consider a party\u2019s dishonesty about a material fact as \u201caffirmative evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Wright v. West, </em>505 U.S. 277, 296 [112 S.Ct. 2482, 120 L.Ed.2d 225] (1992); see also <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>162 U.S. 613, 620-621 [16 S.Ct. 895, 40 L.Ed. 1090] (1896); 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 278(2), p. 133 (J. Chadbourn rev.1979). Moreover, once the employer\u2019s justification has been eliminated, discrimination may well be the most likely alternative explanation, especially since the employer is in the best position to put forth the actual reason for its decision. Cf. <em>Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. 567, 577 [98 S.Ct. 2943, 57 L.Ed.2d 957] (1978) (\u201c[W]hen all legitimate reasons for rejecting an applicant have been eliminated as possible reasons for the employer\u2019s actions, it is more likely than not the employer, who we generally assume acts with some reason, based his decision on an impermissible consideration\u201d). Thus, a plaintiffs prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer\u2019s asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">This is not to say that such a showing by the plaintiff will always be adequate to sustain a jury\u2019s finding of liability. Certainly there will be instances where, although the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the defendant\u2019s explanation, no rational factfinder could conclude that the action was discriminatory. For instance, an employer would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer\u2019s decision, or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer\u2019s reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred. See <em>Aka v. Washington Hosp. Ctr., </em>156 F.3d [1284], at 1291-1292; see also <em>Fisher v. Vassar College, </em>114 F.3d [1332], 1338 (\u201c[I]f the circumstances show that the defendant gave the false explanation to conceal something other than discrimination, the inference of discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>nation will be weak or nonexistent\u201d).

With appropriate improvements in the teaching area, the archival referred publications, and a higher research funding success rate, the committee feels that Dr. Gerth has the potential to become a highly successful faculty member in the IMSE Department in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Koonce</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">{\u00b6 81} Koonce was 32 when he applied for promotion and tenure. Gerth, the chair of Koonce\u2019s promotion and tenure committee, explained the committee\u2019s findings in a January 8,1999 letter to Parks. Gerth stated that Koonce\u2019s \u201coverall teaching effectiveness is \u2018below average\u2019 to \u2018average.\u2019 \u201d Gerth explained, \u201cThe committee was divided on his scholarly activities rating him a \u2018below average\u2019 to \u2018above average.\u2019 \u201d He stated that the committee did not agree on the significance of \u201cseveral issues including: (1) Publications: With one exception, Dr. Koonce\u2019s archival journal publications are all in a single journal; (2) Proposals: fewer than 2 external proposals per year submitted almost exclusively to NSF, and no proposals pending since April of 1998; (3) Collaboration: nearly all publications and research is collaborative.\u201d Gerth wrote, \u201cA negative interpretation is that Dr. Koonce is incapable of establishing his own research focus independent of his major collaborators, and that his research is only published in one journal of low quality. Although a majority of the committee members did not ascribe to this interpretation, all committee members expressed some concern over one or more of the above issues.\u201d Gerth stated that the committee nonetheless believed that \u201cDr. Koonce will continue to attract external funding, publish in archival journals, and establish himself as a preeminent scholar.\u201d The committee rated Koonce\u2019s service as \u201cbelow average\u201d to \u201caverage.\u201d The committee voted two-to-three to award Koonce promotion and tenure.

However, we do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion by determining that the commission improperly inferred age discrimination from this fact. When each professor was evaluated for promotion and tenure, the promotion and tenure committee consisted of three different sets of individuals. The committee that considered Gerth\u2019s case was not the committee that considered Koonce\u2019s case, and neither committee considered Lipset\u2019s case. As the trial court noted, reasonable, professional minds disagreed over Lipset\u2019s qualifications for tenure, just as they apparently did in reviewing Koonce\u2019s qualifications. Again, Koonce\u2019s promotion and tenure committee did not unanimously recommend him for promotion and tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>{\u00b6 83} Thus, even if the respective promotion and tenure committees treated Lipset, Koonce, and Gerth differently, the committees did not do so on account of age, but, rather, on account of the precise nature of the professors\u2019 differing strengths and qualifications. Apparently, the committees placed great emphasis on the ability to succeed as a researcher and pursue external funding sources, and less emphasis on teaching effectiveness and service. Gerth and Koonce appear to have had better performances in these area than Lipset. Moreover, the promotion and tenure guidelines provide that the \u201crelative weighting of [the three areas] in determining promotion and/or tenure is not necessarily the same for every faculty member or every department. The candidate\u2019s balance of development and total contribution to the Department and College is what is considered in the final decision.\u201d Koonce\u2019s and Gerth\u2019s tenure committees found that they had strong potential to become leaders in their respective fields, despite weak teaching or research performance. In contrast, Lipset\u2019s tenure committee unanimously interpreted his dossier as indicating that his sponsored research activity was slowing and that he lacked an independent research focus. Furthermore, Koonce testified that his promotion and tenure application presented a stronger case than Lipset\u2019s because Lipset\u2019s papers mostly were published with other faculty and not with his own graduate students, whereas Koonce\u2019s papers were published with his own graduate students. Koonce also testified that his funded research record was stronger and that at the time of his promotion and tenure application, he had \u201csix individual research initiatives that [he] was applying to or working with external contacts on.\u201d Koonce noted that at the time Lipset applied for promotion and tenure, he had no current proposals. Welch testified that he observed a \u201cbig difference\u201d between Koonce\u2019s and Gerth\u2019s research projects and proposals and Lipset\u2019s projects and proposals. Welch stated that Koonce wrote several proposals and four were funded. Gerth had a sustained level of proposals and five were funded. Lipset, however, had one proposal funded.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">{\u00b6 84} Moreover, the lowest ratings that the respective promotion and tenure committees gave Koonce and Gerth were \u201cbelow average to average.\u201d Lipset\u2019s promotion and tenure committee did not specify whether his research rating was \u201cbelow average\u201d or \u201caverage,\u201d as the committee did not use any specific rating. Instead, the committee stated that it had \u201csignificant reservations\u201d about his \u201ccommitment to funded research and [his] progress towards an identifiable personal research track.\u201d The committee found this to be a \u201cmajor weakness.\u201d There is no evidence in the record, however, that a \u201cbelow average to average\u201d rating is similar to \u201cmajor weakness.\u201d The commission apparently speculated that the committee would have ranked Lipset as \u201cbelow average to average\u201d in the research category, but speculation does not constitute reliable, probative, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>substantial evidence. Thus, we believe that the commission drew improper inferences based upon evidence that is not in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">{\u00b6 85} Furthermore, Parks\u2019s 1999 evaluation stated that while Lipset\u2019s publication record was acceptable, he lacked \u201can entrepreneurial vision for developing sponsored programs.\u201d Moreover, in the year before his promotion and tenure application, Parks warned Lipset that his lack of sponsored research activity \u201cmight pose a serious problem\u201d for his promotion and tenure. Parks stated that he felt Lipset was not \u201caggressive enough in seeking and obtaining sponsored research.\u201d Even Lipset apparently recognized that he needed more sponsored research activity. Lipset told Koonce about a project that Judd proposed that he work on, but Lipset declined and stated that his decision would \u201cprobably cost [him] tenure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">{\u00b6 86} When comparing the particulars of Gerth\u2019s and Koonce\u2019s promotion and tenure applications, rather than simply examining, as the commission did, the general overview of the candidates\u2019 strengths and qualifications, we agree with the trial court that reasonable minds could, and obviously did, disagree about Lipset\u2019s qualifications for promotion and tenure. Thus, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by concluding that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence fails to support the commission\u2019s finding that appellee\u2019s proffered reason to deny tenure was false in light of the comparison of Gerth\u2019s, Koonce\u2019s, and Lipset\u2019s promotion and tenure committee decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Lipset\u2019s Merit Raise</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">{\u00b6 87} The commission also cited Lipset\u2019s merit raise as evidence of pretext. The commission apparently concluded that the basis for Lipset\u2019s merit raise was the same as the basis for granting tenure. The commission determined that because Lipset was awarded the highest merit raise, he must have had the highest rating within his department for teaching, research, and service \u2014 even among tenured faculty. The commission thus, inferred that if this is true, a denial of promotion and tenure based upon inadequate research could only be a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">{\u00b6 88} After our review of the record, however, we find no evidence to demonstrate that the Annual Salary Raise Committee used the same standards to evaluate merit raises as the promotion and tenure committee used to evaluate Lipset\u2019s teaching, research, and service. In fact, our review of the record belies such a conclusion. In proposing the raises, the committee stated: (1) \u201cThe annual raise would be based on merit in teaching, research, and service for each faculty\u201d; (2) <em>\u201cThe committee considered only major components </em>(due to limited time frame) <em>of activities in those areas: </em>number of courses taught, course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>evaluations, research projects amount, number of submitted proposals, journal papers, and committees * * (Emphasis added.) In calculating the merit raises, \u201cthe committee ranked all faculty members for each of three areas, and computed averages from those as proposed raise levels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">{\u00b6 89} We cannot know how the committed ranked Lipset in the three areas. We only know that when the applicable criteria were averaged, those three areas resulted in Lipset\u2019s having the highest score. It is possible that Lipset had the highest teaching and service scores, but the lowest research score, yet still had a high average score. Additionally, unlike the commission, we do not agree that the highest average score meriting an annual salary increase correlates to automatic entitlement to promotion and tenure and that any other result demonstrates age discrimination. As the promotion and tenure guidelines make clear, a promotion and tenure candidate must satisfy many components within each of the three areas before promotion and tenure will be granted. The Annual Merit Raise Committee did not rely upon each of those same components within the three areas of teaching, research, and service. Instead, as it explicitly noted, the committee relied upon a short list of components within the three categories. In other words, the commission compared separate, dissimilar, and unrelated standards to draw an improper inference in order to arrive at its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">{\u00b6 90} Thus, we do not believe that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence fails to support the commission\u2019s finding that Lipset\u2019s merit raise proves that the promotion and tenure committee\u2019s reference to his inadequate research was false constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Lipset\u2019s Awards</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">{\u00b6 91} The commission additionally found that appellee\u2019s proffered reason of inadequate research was false because Lipset\u2019s awards demonstrated that his research was adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">{\u00b6 92} Similar to Lipset\u2019s merit raise issue, as we discussed infra, we also find no evidence in the record to demonstrate that the two awards Lipset received were based upon the same criteria that qualify a faculty member for promotion and tenure. The most that can be gleaned from the record is that (1) in 1998, Lipset received the \u201cOutstanding Undergraduate Research Paper Award\u201d and (2) in 1999, Lipset received the IMSE department outstanding undergraduate research award. We find nothing in the record to show that the criteria for either award is similar to the promotion and tenure criteria. Thus, we do not believe that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence fails to support the commission\u2019s finding that Lipset\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>research awards proved the falsity of appellee\u2019s proffered reason constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Lipset\u2019s Research</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">{\u00b6 93} The commission next cited the research outlined in Lipset\u2019s dossier as support for its finding of falsity. While we cannot dispute the commission\u2019s recitation of that evidence, we note that the commission appears to have independently evaluated Lipset\u2019s dossier and reached its own decision regarding the quality of his publications and his qualification for promotion and tenure. The commission, however, is not an Ohio University promotion and tenure committee. Lipset\u2019s dossier speaks for itself, and the promotion and tenure committee obviously found that his research component did not meet the department\u2019s expectations. To allow the commission\u2019s finding on this issue to stand would, in effect, allow the commission to sit as a tenure committee and decide the fates of individuals who seek university promotion and tenure. We, however, are keenly aware that \u201ccourts are to tread lightly when reviewing faculty employment decisions, especially in the area of academia.\u201d <em>Kent State Univ., </em>129 Ohio App.3d at 252, 717 N.E.2d 745. Moreover, even if Lipset\u2019s publication record is strong, the committee found his research component lacking due to his failure to have consistent and current sponsored research activity. At the time of his promotion and tenure application, Lipset had no current proposals. Moreover, on average Lipset had proposed only one project per year of employment, and only one proposal was ultimately funded.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">{\u00b6 94} Consequently, we do not believe that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence fails to support the commission\u2019s finding that appellee\u2019s proffered reason is unworthy of belief and, thus, demonstrated pretext, constitutes an abuse of discretion. To the contrary, appellee cited legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons to deny Lipset promotion and tenure. Thus, reliable, probative, and substantial evidence does not support the commission\u2019s finding that appellee\u2019s reason to deny promotion and tenure are unworthy of belief. As noted above, we believe that the commission drew improper inferences based upon its selective review of selective portions of the evidence. Therefore, because the commission failed to present reliable, probative, and substantial evidence that appellee\u2019s proffered reason to deny promotion and tenure was false, it is unable to establish pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">{\u00b6 95} Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that in the case sub judice, appellants did not establish an age-discrimination claim. See <em>Williams, </em>supra (to prove pretext, the plaintiff must show both that the proffered reason is false and that the real reason for the adverse employment action was discrimination). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Much of appellants\u2019 remaining argument is therefore moot. Nonetheless, we will address the additional evidence that the commission cited as circumstantial evidence of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Evidence That Appellee\u2019s Real Reason for Denying Lipset Promotion and Tenure Was Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">{\u00b6 96} In addition to concluding that appellee\u2019s proffered reason was false, the commission found evidence to demonstrate, in its view, that the actual reason to deny Lipset promotion and tenure was his age. The commission referred to the following evidence: (1) Koonce and Gerth, who are both younger than Lipset, received tenure, but had ratings \u201cinferior\u201d to Lipset and, thus, the tenure guidelines were not applied equally to all persons regardless of age and (2) the age-related remarks made by Parks, Gerth, and Koonce \u201cdemonstrated a disturbing history of praising youthful faculty, while being critical of older faculty\u201d and was circumstantial evidence of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Comparison to Koonce and Gerth</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">{\u00b6 97} Earlier in this opinion, we discounted the commission\u2019s reliance on its misguided comparison of Lipset, Koonce, and Gerth, and we do not repeat it here. For those same reasons, we do not believe that the trial court\u2019s determination that the commission\u2019s reliance upon this comparison is not reliable, probative, and substantial evidence that discrimination is the real reason for appellee\u2019s denial of promotion and tenure constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">\u201cStray Remarks\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">{\u00b6 98} The commission also relied upon various age-related remarks that Parks, Koonce, and Gerth made during Lipset\u2019s employ as a faculty member. Although the ALJ and the trial court classified those comments as \u201cstray remarks,\u201d the commission concluded that the remarks constitute circumstantial evidence of age discrimination. The trial court\u2019s discounting of the comments as \u201cstray remarks\u201d forms the basis for appellants\u2019 third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">{\u00b6 99} In order for age-related remarks to constitute circumstantial evidence of age discrimination, a nexus must exist between the remarks and the adverse employment action. <em>Byrnes v. LCI Communication Holdings </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 125, 130, 672 N.E.2d 145 (\u201cThere must be a link or nexus between the discriminatory statement or conduct and the prohibited act of discrimination to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>establish a violation of [Chapter 4112].\u201d); see also <em>Geier v. Medtronic, Inc. </em>(C.A.7, 1996), 99 F.3d 238, 242 (\u201cTo be probative of discrimination, isolated comments must be contemporaneous with the discharge or causally related to the discharge decision making process\u201d). \u201cAbsent some causal connection or link between an employer\u2019s discriminatory statements or conduct and a plaintiff-employee, there is no permissible inference that the employer was motivated by discriminatory animus to act against the plaintiff-employee.\u201d <em>Byrnes, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 130, 672 N.E.2d 145. Courts have classified such comments as \u201cstray remarks,\u201d which are insufficient to prove discrimination. See, e.g., <em>Wohler v. Toledo Stamping &amp; Mfg. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1997), 125 F.3d 856. Thus, statements unrelated to the decisional process or \u201c \u2018statements by nondecisionmakers * * * [can not] suffice to satisfy the plaintiffs burden * * * \u2019 of demonstrating animus.\u201d <em>Bush v. Dictaphone Corp. </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 161 F.3d 363, 369 (quoting <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 228, 277, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)); see also <em>Rowan v. Lockheed Martin Energy Sys., Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 2004), 360 F.3d 544, 550 (\u201cstatements by non-decision makers, or statements by decision makers unrelated to the decisional process itself [cannot] suffice to satisfy the plaintiffs burden in demonstrating animus\u201d); <em>Merrick v. Farmers Ins. Group </em>(C.A.9, 1990), 892 F.2d 1434, 1438 (a remark unrelated to the decisional process is insufficient to show discrimination based on age); <em>Smith v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(C.A.7,1989), 875 F.2d 1325, 1330 (a stray remark made in the workplace unrelated to the decisional process is insufficient to show discrimination based on race). Furthermore, age-related comments that do not occur near the time of the adverse employment action are \u201cstray remarks\u201d that are insufficient to show discrimination. See <em>Phelps v. Yale Sec. </em>(C.A.6, 1993), 986 F.2d 1020, 1026 (comment made one year before discharge is too far removed in time to be indicative of discriminatory intent in the adverse action decision); see also <em>Smith v. Leggett Wire Co. </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 220 F.3d 752, 759-760 (comments \u201cnot relevant\u201d when they were made \u201clong before\u201d the employee\u2019s termination); <em>Russell v. Acme-Evans Co. </em>(C.A.7, 1995), 51 F.3d 64, 68 (a derogatory comment about an employee\u2019s race made 15 years prior to the termination decision is \u201ctoo tenuously related to the alleged discriminatory action by supervisors many years later\u201d to create an inference of discrimination); <em>Boyle v. Mannesmann Demag Corp. </em>(C.A.6, 1993), 991 F.2d 794 (statement by person who took part in termination decision four years prior to the decision was a stray remark, thus not indicative of illegal employment discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">{\u00b6 100} In the case at bar, we do not believe that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the various age-related comments fail to constitute reliable, probative, and substantial evidence that discrimination is the actual reason to deny Lipset promotion and tenure constitutes an abuse of discretion. We again note that none of the comments occurred at the time of Lipset\u2019s 2000 promotion and tenure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>application. Rather, the comments occurred in 1997, 1998, and 1999. Additionally, none of the comments related to the decisional process. Koonce\u2019s reference to some faculty members as \u201clegacies\u201d had nothing to do with Lipset\u2019s promotion and tenure decision. The comment regarding female graduate students choosing Lipset as their advisor likewise had nothing to do with Lipset\u2019s promotion and tenure decision. Parks\u2019s e-mail and other references to \u201cyoung\u201d faculty also had no relation to Lipset\u2019s promotion and tenure process. Therefore, none of the aforementioned comments constitute reliable, probative, and substantial circumstantial evidence that discrimination was the real reason to deny Lipset promotion and tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">{\u00b6 101} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we hereby overrule appellants\u2019 first, second, and third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">{\u00b6 102} In their fourth assignment of error, appellants assert that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing an additional requirement that a victim must recognize and complain of the age discrimination to prove an age-discrimination claim. We disagree with appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">{\u00b6 103} In the case sub judice, we do not believe that the trial court imposed a requirement that Lipset must have actually complained of age discrimination during his association with Ohio University. Rather, we believe that the trial court simply commented upon Lipset\u2019s failure to complain of age discrimination as additional circumstantial evidence that appellee did not discriminate against him. Moreover, even if we accept the view that the trial court improperly relied upon this evidence, we believe that any such error constitutes harmless error. As we outlined in our discussion of appellants\u2019 first, second, and third assignments of error, even without considering this evidence, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence fails to support the commission\u2019s finding of discrimination does not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">{\u00b6 104} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we hereby overrule appellants\u2019 fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">{\u00b6 105} In their fifth assignment of error, appellants assert that the trial court abused its discretion by attributing particular arguments to the commission that it did not present, and then faulting the commission for failing to offer evidence to support those arguments. Appellants contend that they did not make the following arguments: (1) that the research awards were based upon the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>criteria; and (2) that Lipset\u2019s high ratings in the teaching and service categories should \u201ccompensate\u201d for his alleged deficiency in the research category.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 106} Even assuming for purposes of argument that the trial court improperly attributed such arguments to the commission, we find any such error to constitute harmless error. Even in the absence of these arguments, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence fails to support the commission\u2019s finding of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 107} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we hereby overrule appellants\u2019 fifth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">{\u00b6 108} In summary, we first emphasize that the sole issue in this matter is whether Ohio University denied Lipset promotion and tenure on account of his age. No other factor should be considered in this inquiry. In our view, the trial court, after it engaged in a thorough review of the record and a limited weighing of the evidence, properly concluded that Lipset\u2019s age was not a factor in the promotion and tenure decision. Thus, we agree with the trial court that the commission\u2019s administrative determination is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">{\u00b6 109} We further agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence the commission cites to support its determination is actually based upon inferences improperly drawn from that evidence and, thus, is unreasonable. For example, the commission\u2019s (1) attempt to make identical comparisons of various attributes of different candidates for promotion and tenure, when the committees that evaluated the different candidates varied in their composition, is unreasonable, (2) decision to impose its views and beliefs concerning the relative value of various qualities that the commission apparently thinks a promotion and tenure committee should prefer is unreasonable, and (3) conclusion that stray workplace remarks support the view that Lipset was denied tenure due to his age, when, however, the remarks had no causal connection to the promotion and tenure decision, is unreasonable. The fact remains, as the trial court aptly notes, that reasonable, professional minds disagreed over Lipset\u2019s qualifications for promotion and tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">{\u00b6 110} We also emphasize that we fully recognize and appreciate the fact that Lipset, by all accounts, possessed an excellent teaching, scholarship, and service record during his association with Ohio University. It is apparent, however, that the promotion and tenure committee placed great emphasis on Lipset\u2019s inability to obtain external research funding, and less emphasis on Lipset\u2019s ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>teach. In this regard, the record is replete with references to Lipset\u2019s inability, or lack of desire, to obtain external funding for research projects (e.g., references in the record include the discussion of Lipset\u2019s failure to aggressively seek and obtain \u201csponsored research\u201d or \u201cfunded research\u201d; that Lipset authored inadequate and too few \u201cresearch proposals and projects\u201d; that Lipset \u201clacked entrepreneurial vision for developing sponsored programs\u201d; and that various references used throughout the promotion and tenure process include the terms (1) \u201cgrant proposals,\u201d (2) \u201cfunded proposals,\u201d (3) \u201cexternal contracts,\u201d (4) \u201clack of external funding,\u201d (5) \u201clack of sponsored research,\u201d (6) \u201clack of independent research,\u201d (7) \u201climited number of proposals sent to funding agencies,\u201d and (8) \u201cresearch funding success rate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">{\u00b6 111} Although many may argue that the promotion and tenure committee\u2019s focus was misguided and that Ohio University should have been primarily concerned about a candidate\u2019s teaching ability, neither this appellate court, nor the common pleas court or the commission is vested with the authority to make this policy determination. Admittedly, we, if sitting as Lipset\u2019s promotion and tenure committee, may not have valued educational considerations over financial and research considerations. It is unfortunate that the ability to teach students may not be as highly valued as the ability to procure research funds. On the other hand, we recognize the vast array of important benefits and discoveries that have flowed from vigorous institutional research.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 112} Again, however, we emphasize that we sit as a court with the duty to resolve legal disputes. We do not sit as a promotion and tenure committee with the duty to resolve promotion and tenure issues. A court\u2019s role (and the commission\u2019s role) in this arena must be limited to a determination whether discrimination occurred during the promotion and tenure process, not whether a candidate, in the court\u2019s view, may deserve tenure. Courts and commissions are ill-suited to evaluate various academic criteria used for promotion and tenure decisions, and courts should not generally invade the faculty employment decision process. Rather, educational and academic professionals are charged with that important duty, and their guidepost should be the best interests of the students and the institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 113} Therefore, although the members of this court admire Lipset\u2019s record and his demonstrated ability as an effective educator, we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Ohio University did not deny Lipset promotion and tenure due to his age, but, rather, due to other considerations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>{\u00b6 114} Accordingly, in the case sub judice, we believe that the trial court properly concluded that (1) the evidence in the record does not contain reliable, probative, and substantive evidence to support the commission\u2019s determination that Ohio University denied Lipset promotion and tenure due to his age and (2) Ohio University demonstrated legitimate, nondiscriminatory and nonpretextual reasons to deny Lipset promotion and tenure, and Lipset\u2019s age did not motivate that decision. Thus, because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this matter, we must uphold its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 115} Therefore, based upon the foregoing reasons, we hereby overrule appellants\u2019 assignments of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b492-7\">Harsha and McFarland, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-16\">.

Rather, the letter merely mentions Lipset and his 15 years of manufacturing experience.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b474-11\">. {\u00b6 a} Despite the holdings of <em>Case W., Conrad, </em>and <em>Plumbers, </em>appellants argue that the trial court was required to uphold the commission\u2019s findings as long as \"some reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\u201d supported it. See <em>T. Marzetti v. Doyle </em>(1987), 37 Ohio App.3d 25, 523 N.E.2d 347, which states: \"If the findings of the commission are supported by some reliable, probative, and substantial evidence (albeit disputed evidence), the courts are not free to set them aside even though the courts could have drawn different inferences.\u201d We note, however, that at least three Ohio Supreme Court decisions set forth the standard of review and do not include the word \"some\u201d before \"reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.\u201d See <em>Monahan v. Liquor Control Comm. </em>(Mar. 6, 1990), Franklin App. No. 89AP-591, 1990 WL 20081 (rejecting the appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court must affirm the commission's finding if supported by \"some\" evidence in an R.C. 119.12 appeal). Furthermore, both <em>Conrad </em>and <em>Plumbers </em>explain that a trial court may, to a limited extent, weigh the evidence. Therefore, we disagree with the very restrictive standard of review that appellants advocate. Instead, we apply the standard as explained above, as applied in our previous decisions, and as applied in prior Ohio Supreme Court cases, none of which has been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">{\u00b6 b} Appellants appear to rely upon <em>Ohio State Univ. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 615, 567 N.E.2d 260, to support its standard-of-review argument. Appellants claim that <em>Ohio State Univ. </em>held: \"On the evidence in the record, the commission could, and did, reasonably conclude that OSU discriminated against Dr. Zaharlick because of her handicap. The evidence could also support other, competing inferences, some of which my colleague Justice Wright identifies in his dissent. As a reviewing court, however, we would be bound to uphold the commission\u2019s finding and order because it is 'supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 616, 567 N.E.2d 260 (Brown, J., concurring). Contrary to appellants\u2019 argument, the Ohio Supreme Court did not reach any holding in this case. Instead, the court dismissed the appeal as improvidently allowed. Justice Brown wrote the quote to which appellants refer in a concurring opinion that agreed with the decision to dismiss the appeal. Thus, we find nothing persuasive about appellants\u2019 reliance on this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b477-10\">. Interestingly, the evidence revealed that Ohio University hired a 47-year-old replacement for Lipset. Additionally, the IMSE department apparently tenured two faculty members over the age of 40 since the Lipset decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b491-8\">. {\u00b6 a} The members of this court acknowledge and appreciate the fact that a university may value certain factors and considerations over other factors when making promotion and tenure decisions. In the case sub judice, it appears that the applicant\u2019s ability to procure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>external funding or revenue was a very important factor, if not the most important factor. We note that a January 1, 2008 letter to the <em>Columbus Dispatch </em>from Dr. Albert A. Gabel may both shed some light on this topic and show that other institutions have also grappled with this issue. That letter provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">{\u00b6 b} This is in response to a brief on the Insight front of Nov. 25, \"Fewer professors have tenure.\u201d It stated, \"The shift results from financial pressures, administrators\u2019 desire for more flexibility in hiring, firing and changing courses and the growth of community colleges and regional public universities focused on teaching basics and preparing students for jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">{\u00b6 c} The shift also is occurring in universities nationwide, including Ohio State University. It makes the universities become more purely research institutions, with good teachers having little influence in guiding the departments and colleges. One of the major ways the administrators and boards of trustees balance the budgets is by deducting 40 percent from \"traditional\u201d research grants for overhead.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">{\u00b6 d} Those who get big grants, irrespective of the quality of their research, get promoted, get raises and bonuses, and control the institutions. New hires are not allowed to go on tenure track unless they show outstanding ability to procure research grants. Others must become contract professors.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">{\u00b6 e} A few decades ago, the unwritten rule was \"publish or perish\u201d; now, it is \"get grants or perish.\u201d The former was easy, because some of the most valuable publications are produced from shoestring funding or small \"nontraditional\u201d grants which will not permit overhead to be charged. Professors get little credit for good teaching. Because real teachers no longer have much control, the quality of teaching decreases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b492-8\">Harsha, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AAZ\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">{\u00b6 116} I concur with the principal opinion but also believe Professor Lipset failed to present a prima facie case of age discrimination. The only evidence in the record concerning the age of Lipset\u2019s replacement came from Professor Park, who stated that the new hire was 47 years old. Because Lipset was 51 when he was denied tenure, he cannot satisfy the element of \u201creplacement by a substantially younger person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>{\u00b6 117} And while it seems unfair that being the best teacher really doesn\u2019t carry the day, I would hope reviewing courts will apply the same level of scrutiny that is evident here to cases involving other forms of discrimination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
