First, he contends that his convictions should be overturned because R.C. 2905.05(A) is facially overbroad in violation of the Ohio and United States Constitutions. Second, he contends that R.C. 2905.05(A) is overbroad as applied in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">{\u00b6 3} The charges against Chappie stemmed from incidents that occurred on two consecutive days in June 2006. The first day, 12-year-old A.W. was walking on a sidewalk near her home around noon. She testified at trial that she noticed Chappie drive past her twice before stopping the third time and asking whether she wanted a ride. A.W. responded negatively and continued walking. Chappie then drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">{\u00b6 4} The following day, A.W. was sitting on the porch at the apartment where she lived. Chappie pulled his van into a parking spot alongside the building. A.W. testified that he then motioned for her to approach the van. She responded by going inside and getting her older brother. When A.W. came back outside with her brother, Chappie pulled away. As he did so, A.W.\u2019s mother, F.W., arrived home in her car. A.W. and F.W. proceeded to follow Chappie\u2019s van until it stopped near another apartment building. F.W. testified that she then confronted Chappie about trying to get her daughter into his van. Chappie denied having done so. When F.W. accused Chappie of having tried to do the same thing the previous day, he replied that the neighborhood was bad and he thought A.W. might have needed a ride.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">{\u00b6 5} For his part, Chappie testified and admitted asking A.W. whether she wanted a ride the first day. He also acknowledged that he may have circled around twice before stopping. Chappie explained that he is a realtor who buys and sells property in the area where A.W. was walking. When he offered A.W. a ride, he was driving around looking for homes. He stated that he offered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>ride because she was alone in a dangerous neighborhood. Chappie also admitted parking outside of A.W.\u2019s apartment the following day. He testified that he was unaware that she lived there. He denied seeing her or motioning her toward his vehicle. Chappie stated that he merely stopped to find a street on his map.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 6} After hearing testimony from A.W., F.W., and Chappie, the trial court found him guilty on two charges of criminal child enticement in violation of R.C. 2905.05(A). The trial court sentenced him to 180 days in jail, imposed a $1,000 f\u00edne, and classified him as a child-victim offender. The trial court also ordered his sentence held in abeyance pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 7} At the time of Chappie\u2019s June 2006 encounters with A.W., R.C. 2905.05 provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(A) No person, by any means and without privilege to do so, shall knowingly solicit, coax, entice, or lure any child under fourteen years of age to accompany the person in any manner, including entering into any vehicle or onto any vessel, whether or not the offender knows the age of the child, if both of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(1) The actor does not have the express or implied permission of the parent, guardian, or other legal custodian of the child in undertaking the activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(2) The actor is not a law enforcement officer, medic, firefighter, or other person who regularly provides emergency services, and is not an employee or agent of, or a volunteer acting under the direction of, any board of education, or the actor is any of such persons, but, at the time the actor undertakes the activity, the actor is not acting within the scope of the actor\u2019s lawful duties in that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(B) It is an affirmative defense to a charge under division (A) of this section that the actor undertook the activity in response to a bona fide emergency situation or that the actor undertook the activity in a reasonable belief that it was necessary to preserve the health, safety, or welfare of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(C) Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal child enticement, a misdemeanor of the first degree. * * 150 Ohio Laws, Part V, 8038.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">{\u00b6 13} In his first assignment of error, Chappie contends that R.C. 2905.05(A) is unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. In support, he argues that the statute sweeps within its reach a substantial amount of speech and activity protected by the First Amendment. Indeed, Chappie notes that the statute essentially forbids <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>anyone from asking a child under the age of 14 to accompany that person anywhere for any purpose absent the existence of a privilege, a perceived emergency, or parental consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">{\u00b6 14} Chappie concedes, however, that he did not raise his overbreadth argument in the trial court. The \u201c[f]ailure to raise at the trial court level the issue of the constitutionality of a statute or its application, which is apparent at the time of trial, constitutes a waiver of such issue and a deviation from this state\u2019s orderly procedure, and therefore need not be heard for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E.2d 277, syllabus. We retain the discretion, of course, to consider a waived constitutional argument under a plain-error analysis. <em>In re M.D. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 149, 151, 527 N.E.2d 286. An error qualifies as \u201cplain error\u201d only if it is obvious and but for the error, the outcome of the proceeding clearly would have been otherwise. <em>State v. Macias, </em>Darke App. No. 1562, 2003-Ohio-1565, 2003 WL 1596472, citing <em>State v. Yarbrough, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 227, 245, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216. Having reviewed R.C. 2905.05(A), we believe that Chappie has demonstrated plain error. The overbreadth of the statute is plain on its face.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cIt has long been recognized that the First Amendment needs breathing space and that statutes attempting to restrict or burden the exercise of First Amendment rights must be narrowly drawn and represent a considered legislative judgment that a particular mode of expression has to give way to other compelling needs of society.\u201d <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 601, 611\u2014 612, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830. \u201c \u2018A clear and precise enactment may * * * be \u201coverbroad\u201d if in its reach it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Akron v. Rowland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 374, 387, 618 N.E.2d 138, quoting <em>Grayned v. Rockford </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 104, 114, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222. \u201cIn considering an overbreadth challenge, the court must decide \u2018whether the ordinance sweeps within its prohibitions what may not be punished under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Grayned </em>at 115, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222. \u201c \u2018Only a statute that is substantially overbroad may be invalidated on its face.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Houston v. Hill </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 451, 458, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398. \u201cIn order to demonstrate facial overbreadth, the party challenging the enactment must show that its potential application reaches a significant amount of protected activity. Nevertheless, criminal statutes \u2018that make unlawful a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>held facially invalid even if they also have legitimate application.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Houston </em>at 459, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398. A defendant may challenge a statute as being facially overbroad in violation of the First Amendment \u201c \u2018with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with the requisite narrow specificity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 612, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830, quoting <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 479, 486, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22; see also <em>Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment </em>(1980), 444 U.S. 620, 634, 100 S.Ct. 826, 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (\u201cGiven a case or controversy, a litigant whose own activities are unprotected may nevertheless challenge a statute by showing that it substantially abridges the First Amendment rights of other parties not before the court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">{\u00b6 16} Regardless of whether a more narrowly drawn statute legitimately could have prohibited Chappie\u2019s conduct in this case, R.C. 2905.05(A) criminalizes a substantial amount of activity protected by the First Amendment. The statute prohibits a person without privilege or permission from knowingly soliciting a child under the age of 14 to accompany the person in any manner for any purpose. As the Eleventh District recently observed when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction under R.C. 2905.05(A), \u201c[t]he common, ordinary meaning of the word \u2018solicit\u2019 encompasses \u2018merely asking.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Carle, </em>Ashtabula App. No. 2007-A-0008, 2007-Ohio-5376, 2007 WL 2909750. The motive for the solicitation is irrelevant, and there is no requirement that the offender be aggressive toward the victim. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">{\u00b6 17} The child-enticement statute presumably is intended to prevent child abductions or the commission of lewd acts with children. But R.C. 2905.05(A) fails to require that the prohibited solicitation occur with the intent to commit any unlawful act. Instead, the statute appears to infer a criminal intent from countless innocent acts. As Chappie points out, the statute very well might criminalize a senior citizen asking a neighborhood boy to help carry her groceries, to help her across the street, or to rake leaves in her back yard for money. Moreover, because the statute applies to any \u201cperson,\u201d and not just to adults, it very well might criminalize a 13-year-old boy asking his 13-year-old friend to accompany him on an afternoon bike ride or a trip to the ball field. In each of the foregoing examples, the only potential defense to a criminal charge under R.C. 2905.05(A) would be the existence of permission, which may or may not have been obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">{\u00b6 18} Chappie also points out that the statute criminalizes many innocent scenarios where permission plainly would not exist. For instance, the statute would criminalize a 13-year-old girl accompanying a classmate to a school dance or accompanying her aunt to a movie against her parents\u2019 wishes. The potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>applications of R.C. 2905.05(A) to entirely innocent solicitations are endless, largely because the statute fails to require the solicitor to have any illicit intent and fails to distinguish between solicitations made by other children and adults. As a result, we conclude that R.C. 2905.05(A) is substantially overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">{\u00b6 19} In opposition to the foregoing conclusion, the state stresses that the First District on at least three occasions has found R.C. 2905.05(A) not unconstitutionally overbroad. See <em>State v. Kroner </em>(1988), 49 Ohio App.3d 133, 551 N.E.2d 212; <em>State v. Long </em>(1989), 49 Ohio App.3d 1, 550 N.E.2d 522; <em>State v. Clark, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-040329, 2005-Ohio-1324, 2005 WL 678565. We note, however, that the version of the statute at issue in <em>Kroner </em>and <em>Long </em>was much narrower than the version at issue in Chappie\u2019s case. When <em>Kroner </em>and <em>Long </em>were decided, R.C. 2905.05(A) prohibited knowingly soliciting, coaxing, enticing, or luring any child under the age of 14 \u201cto enter into any vehicle.\u201d See <em>Kroner, </em>49 Ohio App.3d at 134, 551 N.E.2d 212, fn. 1. The statute was amended effective April 9, 2001, however, and this prohibition was broadened. The version of R.C. 2905.05(A) applicable to Chappie prohibits knowingly soliciting, coaxing, enticing, or luring any child under 14 years of age to accompany the person \u201cin any manner, including entering into any vehicle or onto any vessel.\u201d While the former version of the statute was narrowly drawn to prohibit only solicitations to enter vehicles, the version applicable to Chappie prohibits solicitations in any manner. For present purposes, we need not decide whether the version of the statute at issue in <em>Kroner </em>and <em>Long </em>would survive an overbreadth challenge. Because R.C. 2905.05(A) no longer is limited to solicitations to enter vehicles, <em>Kroner </em>and <em>Long </em>have little persuasive value. The state\u2019s reliance on the First District\u2019s more recent decision in <em>Clark </em>is equally unpersuasive. In <em>Clark, </em>the court summarily cited <em>Kroner </em>and <em>Long </em>for the proposition that R.C. 2905.05(A) is not unconstitutionally overbroad, without addressing the substantial broadening that occurred in 2001 when the statute was amended to prohibit soliciting a child \u201cin any manner.\u201d Because <em>Kroner </em>and <em>Long </em>involved a narrower version of the statute, we believe that the First District\u2019s citation of those cases in the context of overbreadth was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Finally, we note that the recent amendment of R.C. 2905.05 effective January 1, 2008, may help eliminate the overbreadth problem we have found herein. The new division (B) in the statute provides that \u201c[n]o person, with a sexual motivation, shall violate division (A) of this section.\u201d By adding this new division (B), the legislature has added the illicit-intent requirement that is missing under division (A), thereby substantially narrowing the reach of the statute. In any event, the new division (B) was not in effect at the time of Chappie\u2019s conduct. He was charged only with a violation of division (A), which we have found to be unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. Accordingly, we sustain Chappie\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">{\u00b6 21} Chappie\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled as moot. The judgment of the Dayton Municipal Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b701-6\">Donovan and Valen, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b701-7\">Anthony Valen, J., retired, of the Twelfth District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-13\">. Effective January 1, 2008, the legislature amended R.C. 2905.05 by adding a new division (B) and redesignating former divisions (B), (C), and (D) as new divisions (C), (D), and (E). The new division (B) provides that \"[n]o person, with a sexual motivation, shall violate division (A) of this section.\u201d 2007 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">. Parenthetically, we note that Chappie's failure to give the Ohio Attorney General notice of his constitutional challenge to R.C. 2905.05(A) is not an issue in this case. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that the notification requirement found in R.C. 2721.12 applies only to declaratory judgment actions. <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Picklo, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 195, 2002-Ohio-3995, 772 N.E.2d 1187, \u00b6 6-7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\">. In holding R.C. 2905.05(A) to be substantially overbroad, we have considered the possibility of giving the statute a narrower construction to avoid invalidation. See, e.g., <em>Osborne v. Ohio </em>(1990), 495 U.S. 103, 112-114, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (interpreting an Ohio statute\u2019s prohibition against possessing \"nude\u201d pictures of minors to mean only nude pictures involving a lewd exhibition of the genitals, thereby avoiding a potential overbreadth problem). In the present case, however, we find a limiting construction to be unavailable. The child-enticement statute prohibits a person from knowingly soliciting a child to accompany the person \"in any manner\u201d without regard to motive. Short of rewriting the statute, which we cannot do, its overbroad language is not susceptible of a narrowing construction. <em>Erznoznik v. Jacksonville </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 205, 216, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125, fn. 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
