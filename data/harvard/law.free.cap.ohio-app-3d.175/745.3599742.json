Sowers Living Trust, appeals the judgment of the Van Wert Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee, Melanie Luginbill, n.k.a. Melanie Myers. For reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">{\u00b6 2} On August 22, 2005, Luginbill and Gordon Sowers (\u201cGordon\u201d) were involved in a motor-vehicle accident. Luginbill\u2019s vehicle collided with Gordon\u2019s vehicle at the intersection of U.S. Route 224 and C.R. 418<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Van Wert County, Ohio. Gordon was cited for failure to yield the right of way and was, without much contention, the cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">{\u00b6 3} Luginbill suffered physical injuries, underwent several surgeries, and missed several months of work because of the accident. On April 26, 2006, Luginbill filed a complaint in the Van Wert Court of Common Pleas against Gordon, alleging damages and injuries she sustained as a result of his negligent driving in ease No. CV06-04-164.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-14\">{\u00b6 4} Unexpectedly on January 11, 2007, however, Gordon died testate. Gordon\u2019s last will was filed in the Van Wert County Probate Court on March 2, 2007, and John Sowers, Gordon\u2019s brother, was appointed executor of the estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Thereafter, Luginbill filed a motion to substitute executor and death trustee John Sowers as a party defendant in case No. CV06-04-164, which the trial court granted on March 19, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">{\u00b6 5} On March 16, 2007, John Sowers filed an action for declaratory judgment, case No. CV07-03-107, arguing that the trust assets could not be used to satisfy Luginbill\u2019s personal-injury claims. John Sowers then filed a motion for summary judgment in case No. CV06-04-164.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">{\u00b6 6} On August 15, 2007, Luginbill filed a motion for summary judgment in case Nos. CV06-04-164 and CV07-03-107, alleging that she was entitled to trust assets to satisfy her personal injuries arising from Gordon\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">{\u00b6 7} On October 12, 2007, the trial court granted Lugmbill\u2019s motion for summary judgment in both cases and denied John Sowers\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On November 1, 2007, the trial court ordered that its October 12th entry in case No. CV07-03-107 was a final, appealable order and ordered that case No. CV06-04-164 be stayed pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">{\u00b6 8} John Sowers now appeals the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in case No. CV07-03-107 and asserts six assignments of error for review. Since several assignments of error raise related issues, we combine them where appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">{\u00b6 9} We review a decision to grant summary judgment de novo. <em>Doe v. Shaffer </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 388, 390, 738 N.E.2d 1243, citing <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Summary judgment is proper where (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) reasonable minds can reach but one conclusion when viewing the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, and the conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.

Whether a genuine issue exists is answered by the following inquiry: Does the evidence present a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or is it so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law[?] Id., citing <em>Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. at 251-252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Summary judgment should be granted with caution, resolving all doubts in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Perez v.

Cleveland Trust Co. </em>does not apply to this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">{\u00b6 12} In his first assignment of error, John Sowers argues that the trial court erred in determining that Luginbill was not a subsequent creditor. John Sowers further argues that because Luginbill is a subsequent creditor, the trust property is not subject to her claim. In his second assignment of error, John Sowers alleges that the trial court erred as to assignment of error one because it failed to apply <em>Schofield v. Cleveland Trust Co. </em>(1939), 135 Ohio St. 328, 14 O.O. 224, 21 N.E.2d 119. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">A. <em>Relevant Definitions and Question Presented</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">{\u00b6 13} A \u201csubsequent creditor\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] creditor whose claim comes into existence <em>after a given fact or transaction, </em>such as the recording of a deed or the execution of a voluntary conveyance.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.Rev. 1999) 376. (Emphasis added.) The relevant question becomes this: what is the \u201cgiven fact or transaction\u201d upon which to determine whether Luginbill is a subsequent creditor?</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">{\u00b6 14} John Sowers argues that the pertinent transaction was the 1997 transfer of assets into the trust, which occurred at the trust\u2019s creation, or at the latest, the 2001 transfer of assets when the trust was reinstated. Thus, John Sowers maintains that because Luginbill filed her tort claim subsequent to these transfers, Luginbill is a subsequent creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">{\u00b6 15} Luginbill, on the other hand, argues that the pertinent fact was Gordon\u2019s death, which caused the pertinent transaction \u2014 the transfer of all estate assets into the trust via the pour-over provision of Gordon\u2019s last will. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Luginbill maintains that because she filed her tort claim prior to Gordon\u2019s death and the transfer of assets via the will, she is not a subsequent creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">{\u00b6 16} The trial court agreed with Luginbill. In its judgment entry, the trial court stated: \u201cPlaintiff filed a claim against the deceased prior to his death and before any transfer to the trust by operation of his will. Therefore, the Plaintiff is not a subsequent creditor of the deceased.\u201d We conclude that the trial court\u2019s analysis of the applicable case law was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">B. <em>Case Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">{\u00b6 17} In concluding that Luginbill was not a subsequent creditor, the trial court relied upon <em>Schofield, </em>135 Ohio St. 328, 14 O.O. 224, 21 N.E.2d 119. The facts are these. The settlor, Dr. G.A. Ehret, entered into a trust agreement with the Cleveland Trust Co. in 1925 and transferred a parcel of land to the trust company. Id. at 328, 14 O.O. 224, 21 N.E.2d 119. In 1932, Dr. Ehret and the trust company drafted a second trust agreement cancelling the original trust. Id. In this second agreement, Dr. Ehret reserved the right to receive income from and occupy the transferred real estate. Id. The trustee was required to obtain written approval for sales and purchases of property for the trust. Id. The agreement also provided that Dr. Ehret could revoke all or part of the trust during his lifetime. Id. At his death, the trustee was to distribute the trust property to Dr. Ehret\u2019s wife and daughter equally. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">{\u00b6 18} In 1936, Dr. Ehret died intestate, survived by his wife and daughter. Id. At his death, the 1932 trust agreement was in full effect, and the trust\u2019s only asset was the real estate originally transferred in 1925. Id. Subsequent to Dr. Ehret\u2019s death, plaintiff Douglas F. Schofield, trustee, filed an action to revoke the trust, sell the property, and apply the proceeds to Dr. Ehret\u2019s debts, which included plaintiffs claim for $628.25, with interest, for the rental of office space in the plaintiffs building. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">{\u00b6 19} The trial court ordered that the trust be revoked, the property be sold, and the proceeds be applied first, to taxes and court costs; second, to payments of claims given priority by law; third, to the payment of the widow\u2019s allowance for the year; and fourth, to the payment of general claims. Id. The court of appeals, however, reversed, dismissing the plaintiffs action and sustaining the trust in all aspects. Id. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">{\u00b620} Based upon these facts, the Ohio Supreme Court set forth the legal issue for consideration as follows: \u2018We come now to the question of the validity of the trust as against subsequent creditors of the settlor.\u201d Id. at 332, 14 O.O. 224, 21 N.E.2d 119. The court then interpreted Section 8617 of the General Code, effective since 1921, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>All deeds of gifts and conveyance of real or personal property made in trust for the exclusive use of the person or persons making the same shall be void and of no effect, but the creator of a trust may reserve to himself any use or power, beneficial or in trust, which he might lawfully grant to another, including the power to alter, amend or revoke such trust, and such trust shall be valid as to all persons, <em>except that any beneficial interest reserved to such creator shall be subject to be reached by the creditors of such creator, and except that where the creator of such trust reserves to himself for his own benefit a power of revocation, a court of equity, at the suit of any creditor or creditors of the creator, may compel the exercise of such power of revocation so reserved, to the same extent and under the same conditions that such creator could have exercised the same.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">(Emphasis added.) Id. at 333, 14 O.O. 224, 21 N.E.2d 119. Interpreting this statute, the court held that the pertinent language, emphasized above, meant the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-6\">[T]hat the rights of creditors to reach the beneficial interest of the settler \u2014 the interest he has retained for his own benefit including any returns or earnings from the trust property \u2014 and to force a revocation of the trust and subject the trust corpus to the payment of their claims, exists only during the lifetime of the settlor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Id. Furthermore, the court held that the statute is \u201cinapplicable to creditors who do not act while the settlor is still alive.\u201d Id. at 334, 14 O.O. 224, 21 N.E.2d 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">{\u00b6 21} Although the court in <em>Schofield </em>did not state why Schofield was a subsequent creditor, we conclude that the Ohio Supreme Court determined that Schofield was a subsequent creditor because he had filed his claim after the settlor\u2019s death. We reach this conclusion for several reasons. From the outset of its opinion, the court in <em>Schofield </em>identified the plaintiff as a subsequent creditor based upon the facts of the case. Id. at 332, 14 O.O. 224, 21 N.E.2d 119. The court placed special emphasis on the fact that the plaintiff had filed his claim after the settlor\u2019s death even though the claim arose during the settlor\u2019s lifetime. Id. at 328, 331, 333-335, 14 O.O. 224, 21 N.E.2d 119. Finally, the court concluded that because Schofield had filed his claim after the settlor\u2019s death, he did not have a right to access the trust property under Section 8617 of the General Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">{\u00b6 22} According to <em>Schofield, </em>then, the determinative \u201cfact or transaction\u201d upon which to determine whether Luginbill is a subsequent creditor is the settlor\u2019s death. Since Luginbill filed her claim prior to the settlor\u2019s death, she is not a subsequent creditor. We therefore find no error in the trial court\u2019s application of <em>Schofield </em>and its conclusion that Luginbill is not a subsequent creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>C. <em>Policy Considerations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">{\u00b6 23} In addition to the fact that <em>Schofield </em>supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Luginbill is not a subsequent creditor, several policy reasons exist for finding that the settlor\u2019s death is the event that determines a creditor\u2019s status for purposes of accessing trust property.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">{\u00b6 24} First, the date of the settlor\u2019s death is a time certain. A time certain provides those seeking to create trusts with an expectation as to their rights and obligations under the trust and also provides counsel with the ability to give clear advice on the issue of creditor rights. Certainty is especially important in estate planning and should be encouraged by the courts. See <em>Oliver v. Bank One, Dayton, NA </em>(Jan. 31, 1990), 2d Dist. No. 11817, 1990 WL 7942, at *4, overruled on other grounds by <em>Oliver v. Bank One, Dayton, NA </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 32, 573 N.E.2d 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">{\u00b6 25} Second, the date of the settlor\u2019s death is expedient. It promotes the vesting of property rights following the settlor\u2019s death absent any claim filed prior thereto and the prompt filing of creditor claims. See <em>Winston v. James </em>(Sept. 14, 1937), 2d Dist. No. 1450, 1937 WL 2345, at *4; <em>Slifer Packing Co. v. Elcook </em>(1917), 10 Ohio App. 45, 1917 WL 1459, at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">{\u00b6 26} Third, the date of the settlor\u2019s death promotes judicial economy. The settlor\u2019s death provides a definitive point in time upon which the court can render a determination. Appellant\u2019s date, the date of transfer of assets into the trust, is problematic and needlessly complicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">{\u00b6 27} Appellant suggested that the creditor\u2019s status should be determined by the date of the trust\u2019s creation when the initial transfer of funds to the trust occurred; however, this argument is both underinclusive and overinclusive. The argument is underinclusive because it looks only at the initial transfer of assets into trust. If the pertinent date is the date of the transfer of assets, why not consider when <em>each </em>asset was legally transferred? In this case, a total of 14 different assets where transferred into the trust at various times. As a result of this underinclusivity, it makes the determination overly complicated by requiring the court to examine each transferred asset individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">{\u00b6 28} The argument is overinclusive because it would defeat valid creditor claims. R.C. 5805.06(A)(1) provides that the property of a revocable trust is subject to the claims of settlor\u2019s creditors. Appellant\u2019s argument, however, would require the creditor to show that his/her claim was filed prior to any transfers to the trust. Practically speaking, this makes little sense. At the time the creditor files his/her claim, any of the existing trust assets could not be accessed; rather, the creditor could only access those assets placed in the trust following the filing of the claim. If that is true, then the settlor can simply decline to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>transfers to the trust following the filing of the claim. As a result, the creditor would have no assets to satisfy his/her claim. This scenario defeats the purpose of R.C. 5805.06, which was drafted, in part, to protect creditors from the use of trusts to protect assets from legitimate claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">{\u00b6 29} For all these further reasons, we hold that the death of the settlor is the relevant date for determining a creditor\u2019s status when he/she is attempting to subject revocable trust assets to his/her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">D. <em>Fraudulent Transfer Act, Black\u2019s Law Definitions, &amp; Creditor Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">{\u00b6 30} As an alternative to his argument that Luginbill is a subsequent creditor, John Sowers also argues that Luginbill is not a creditor at all because she did not obtain a lump-sum judgment. This argument is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">{\u00b6 31} The Ohio Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (\u201cFTA\u201d) provides several pertinent definitions that are applicable to transfers of property into trust. See, e.g., <em>Blood v. Nofzinger, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 545, 2005-Ohio-3859, 834 N.E.2d 358; <em>Comer v. Calim </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 599, 716 N.E.2d 245. The FTA provides, \u201c \u2018Creditor\u2019 means a person who has a claim.\u201d R.C. 1336.01(D). \u201c \u2018Claim\u2019 means a right to payment, whether or not the right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured.\u201d R.C. 1336.01(C). \u201c[A] tort claimant becomes a creditor within the meaning of R.C. 1336.01(C) at the moment in which the cause of action accrues.\u201d <em>Stein v. Brown </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 305, 308, 18 OBR 352, 480 N.E.2d 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">{\u00b6 32} Black\u2019s Law Dictionary provides similar definitions for the terms \u201ccreditor\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d as well. \u201cCreditor\u201d includes \u201c[a] person or entity with a definite claim against another,\u201d and a \u201cclaim\u201d is \u201c[t]he aggregate of operative facts giving rise to a right enforceable by a court\u201d or a \u201ccause of action.\u201d (7th Ed.Rev.1999) 240, 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">{\u00b6 33} The cause of action here accrued on the date of the accident, August 22, 2005. As of that date, Luginbill had a \u201cclaim\u201d and was a \u201ccreditor\u201d under both the FTA and Black\u2019s Law definitions. R.C. 1336.01(C) and (D); <em>Brown, </em>18 Ohio St.3d at 308, 18 OBR 352, 480 N.E.2d 1121; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.Rev.1999) 240, 375. Appellant\u2019s argument is, therefore, without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">{\u00b6 34} For all these reasons, the trial court did not err in finding that Luginbill was not a subsequent creditor according to the applicable case law and definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">{\u00b6 35} John Sowers\u2019s first and second assignments of error are, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Assignment of Error No. Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The trial court erred in ruling that the trust assets of decedent, Gordon E. Sowers, were subject to claims of the plaintiff/ appellee, as a matter of law, should she prevail in this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Assignment of Error No. IV</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The trial court erred when it, essentially, revoked the Gordon E. Sowers living trust, which became irrevocable at the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Assignment of Error No. V</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">The trial court erred in granting the plaintiff/appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">Assignment of Error No. VI</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">The trial court erred in overruling the defendant/appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-12\">{\u00b6 36} In his third assignment of error, John Sowers argues that as a result of the two prior errors, the trial court erred in finding that Luginbill can access the trust assets to satisfy her tort claim. In his fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error, John Sowers argues that the trial court erred by effectively revoking the trust, which became irrevocable at Gordon\u2019s death. John Sowers also argues that as a result of all these prior errors, the trial court erred in granting Luginbill\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in overruling his same motion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-13\">{\u00b6 37} When rendering its determination that the trust property was subject to Luginbill\u2019s tort claim, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-14\">Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 5805.06 provides that during the lifetime of a settlor the property of a revocable trust is subject to claims of the settlor\u2019s creditor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-15\">The trust in the present case was a revocable trust. Plaintiffs claim attached to the decedent\u2019s assets and the trust assets during the lifetime of the deceased. Therefore, the property in the trust is subject to claims of the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-16\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-17\">{\u00b6 38} In order to determine whether the trial court applied the correct statute, we must verify what type of trust Gordon created. Gordon\u2019s trust provides the following language: \u201cOn my death, my Trustee is authorized, but not directed, to pay the following: * * * The payments authorized under this Section are discretionary * * *.\u201d The trust contains several other sections giving the trustee discretion as well. The language of the trust thus indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Gordon\u2019s intent to create a discretionary trust. 91 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (2008) Trusts, Section 192. Gordon\u2019s trust also provides the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">Section 3. Protective Clause</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-6\">To the fullest extent permitted by law, the interests of all the beneficiaries in the various trusts and trust property subject to this agreement, except for my interest therein while I am living, shall not be alienated, pledged, anticipated, assigned, or encumbered unless specifically authorized by the terms of this agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-7\">Such interests, while they remain in trust property, shall not be subject to legal process or to the claims of any creditors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">This language indicates Gordon\u2019s intent to create a spendthrift trust. 91 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (2008) Trusts, Section 8, citing <em>Sherrow v. Brookover </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 310, 312, 22 O.O.2d 373, 189 N.E.2d 90, overruled on other grounds by <em>Scott v. Bank One Trust Co. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 39, 577 N.E.2d 1077. Spendthrift and discretionary trusts are governed by Ohio Revised Code Chapter 5805. Thus, the trial court applied the correct statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">{\u00b6 39} R.C. 5805.06(A)(1) provides: \u201cDuring the lifetime of the settlor, the property of a revocable trust is subject to the claims of the settlor\u2019s creditors.\u201d The statute\u2019s plain language provides that the property of a revocable trust is subject to claims of the settlor\u2019s creditor. There is no dispute that at the time Luginbill filed her tort claim, the settlor was alive and had a revocable trust. Because Luginbill\u2019s claim was filed within the settlor\u2019s lifetime, the express language of R.C. 5805.06(A)(1) applies. The fact that the settlor died following the filing of the claim does not defeat Luginbill\u2019s ability to access the trust property. We therefore hold that the trial court correctly applied the statute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">{\u00b6 40} Furthermore, allowing Luginbill to access the trust property is not only consistent with the statutory language, but also consistent with R.C. 5805.06\u2019s overall purpose \u2014 to protect the settlor\u2019s creditors. This is evident from the statutory structure and the Official Comments. When read together, R.C. 5805.06(A)(1) and (A)(2) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-11\">(A) Whether or not the terms of a trust contain a spendthrift provision, all of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-12\">(1) During the lifetime of the settlor, the property of a revocable trust is subject to claims of the settlor\u2019s creditors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-13\">(2) With respect to an irrevocable trust, a creditor or assignee of the settlor may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the settlor\u2019s benefit. If a trust has more than one settlor, the amount the creditor or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>assignee of a particular settlor may reach may not exceed the settlor\u2019s interest in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor\u2019s contribution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">These provisions, combined, provide creditor protection when the settlor creates either a revocable trust \u2014 which, by definition, allows the settlor access to the trust property \u2014 or an irrevocable trust when the settlor retains an interest in the trust property. By providing protection for creditors in <em>either </em>circumstance, it is evident that the legislature sought to provide comprehensive creditor protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">{\u00b6 41} The legislature\u2019s intent to protect the settlor\u2019s creditors is also evident from the Official Comments. R.C. 5805.06(A)(l)\u2019s Official Comment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-IN\">Subsection (a)(1) states what is now a well accepted conclusion, that a revocable trust is subject to the claims of the settlor\u2019s creditors while the settlor is living. <em>See </em>Restatement (Third) of Trusts Section 25 cmt. e (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996). Such claims were not allowed at common law, however. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts Section 330 cmt. o (1959). Because a settlor usually also retains a beneficial interest that a creditor may reach under subsection (a)(2), the common law rule, were it retained in this Code, would be of little significance. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts Section 156(2) (1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Restatement of the Law 3d, Trusts (2003), Section 25, Comment <em>e, </em>cited above, provides a further explanation on the rights of the settlor\u2019s creditors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\"><em>e. Rights of creditors and other matters. </em>Although a revocable trust is nontestamentary and is therefore not subject to the Wills Act or to the usual procedures of estate administration, property held in the trust is subject to the claims of creditors of the settlor or of the deceased settlor\u2019s estate if the same property belonging to the settlor or the estate would be subject to the claims of the creditors, taking account of homestead rights and other exemptions. This result is not dependent on the trust being \u201cillusory\u201d or \u201ctestamentary,\u201d or on the transfer being a fraudulent conveyance, but is based on the sound public policy of basing the rights of creditors on the substance rather than the form of the debtor\u2019s property rights. Nor is the result affected by the presence of a spendthrift provision in the terms of the trust (see \u00a7 58(2)) or by whether a creditor\u2019s claim arose before or after the transfer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">{\u00b6 42} R.C. 5805.06(A)(2)\u2019s Official Comment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-10\">Subsection (a)(2), which is based on Restatement (Third) of Trusts Section 58(2) and cmt. e (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999), and Restatement (Second) of Trusts Section 156 (1959), follows traditional doctrine in providing that a settlor who is also a beneficiary may not use the trust as a shield against the settlor\u2019s creditors. The drafters of the Uniform Trust Code concluded that traditional doctrine reflects sound policy. Consequently, the drafters rejected the approach taken in States like Alaska and Delaware, both of which allow a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>settlor to retain a beneficial interest immune from creditor claims. <em>See </em>Henry J. Lischer, Jr., <em>Domestic Asset Protection Trusts: Pallbearers to Liability, </em>35 Real Prop. Prob. Tr. J. 479 (2000); John E. Sullivan, III, <em>Gutting the Rule Against Self-Settled Trusts: How the Delaware Trust Law Competes with Offshore Trusts, </em>23 Del. J. Corp. L. 423 (1998). Under the Code, whether the trust contains a spendthrift provision or not, a creditor of the settlor may reach the maximum amount that the trustee could have paid to the settlor-beneficiary. If the trustee has discretion to distribute the entire income and principal to the settlor, the effect of this subsection is to place the settlor\u2019s creditors in the same position as if the trust had not been created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">{\u00b6 43} Reviewing the statutory language in conjunction with the Official Comments, we hold that the overall intent of the legislature to protect the settlor\u2019s creditors becomes clear. Therefore, we conclude that allowing Luginbill to access the trust property in satisfaction of her tort claim \u2014 filed during the settlor\u2019s lifetime \u2014 is consistent with R.C. 5805.06\u2019s plain language and legislative purpose. We cannot, therefore, hold that the trial court erred in concluding that the trust property is subject to Luginbill\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">{\u00b6 44} For these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err in concluding that Luginbill could access the trust funds in satisfaction of her tort claim. We further hold that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in her favor and denying appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">{\u00b6 45} John Sowers\u2019s assignments of error three, four, five, and six, are, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">{\u00b6 46} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b793-11\">Shaw, P.J., and Rogers, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-15\">.
