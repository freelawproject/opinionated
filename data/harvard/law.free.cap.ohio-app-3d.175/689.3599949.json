Gall, is the owner of a condominium in Mariemont Windsor Square Condominiums. He filed a declaratory-judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>action against defendant-appellee Mariemont Windsor Square Condominium Association and several other condominium owners who were on the association\u2019s board of trustees (collectively \u201cthe association\u201d). In his complaint, he alleged that (1) the owners of unit ten were not paying the full amount of their assessment; (2) the association planned to amend the condominium declaration in violation of R.C. Chapter 5311 to change the par values and percentage interest in the common areas of unit ten and other units; (3) an individual who did not own a condominium was on the board in violation of the condominium\u2019s declaration and bylaws; and (4) he came in third in elections for the board of trustees, and that but for the presence of a nonowner on the board, he would have been elected to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">{\u00b6 2} Gall asked the court to order the association to assess and collect the correct amount from unit ten, to remove the nonowner from the board, and to recognize his election to the board. He also sought an injunction prohibiting the association from amending the declaration to change the par value and percentage interest in the common areas without a unanimous vote of the unit owners. Finally, he sought damages and attorney fees for the association\u2019s alleged breaches of its fiduciary and statutory duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">{\u00b6 3} The association filed a motion for summary judgment. At the hearing on the motion, Gall acknowledged that some of the issues he had raised in his complaint were moot. The trial court noted that the nonowner was no longer a member of the board. Gall\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cThat is a moot count. We will address that issue as far as how that came back as we ask for attorney fees for that matter.\u201d Gall\u2019s counsel also acknowledged that the court was without jurisdiction to appoint Gall to the board of trustees. Then the court asked if the only issue left was \u201cwhether the amendment of the par values for certain units * * * was not done pursuant to the Revised Code * * *.\u201d Gall\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cThat is correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court held that Gall did not have standing to challenge the assessments of the other units because his par value and percentage interest in the common areas had not changed. The court granted summary judgment for the association on all the claims in Gall\u2019s complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">{\u00b6 5} Gall presents two assignments of error for review. In his first assignment of error, he contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the association. He argues that as a unit owner, he was affected by the association\u2019s failure to collect the proper assessment from unit ten and by the amendment of the par values in the declaration. Therefore, he had standing to bring the action. This assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>{\u00b6 6} R.C. 5311.19(A) requires a condominium association and all unit owners to comply with all restrictions in the condominium declaration and bylaws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It goes on to state that violations of those restrictions \u201cshall be grounds for the unit owners association or any unit owner to commence a civil action for damages, injunctive relief, or both, and an award of court costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in both types of actions.\u201d Similarly, R.C. 5311.23(A) allows a unit owner to commence, in his own name, a declaratory-judgment action to determine legal obligations under the condominium instruments and to seek injunctive relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">{\u00b6 7} In this case, the condominium declaration listed the par value and percentage of interest in the common areas, which were the same. The association used the par value to determine the unit owner\u2019s assessment for the common areas. Unit ten\u2019s par value was listed as 4.05%, which was actually higher than that of other three-bedroom units. Defendant-appellee, Laura Cruickshank, the president of the board of trustees, testified that the board considered it unfair that unit ten\u2019s par value was so much higher than that of similar units. Therefore, most of the unit owners voted to allow unit ten\u2019s owner to pay at the lower value of 3.3%.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">{\u00b6 8} At that time, the board also proposed an amendment of the declaration amending the par value of unit ten and some others, but the amendment did not get enough votes to pass. The board later passed the amendment, claiming that it was merely correcting a clerical error in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">{\u00b6 9} This case involves two separate issues: (1) the decision to allow unit ten to pay a lesser percentage regardless of the declaration and (2) the actual amendment of the declaration. Generally, R.C. 5311.04(E) states that \u201cthe undivided interest in the common elements of each unit as expressed in the original declaration shall not be altered except by an amendment to the declaration unanimously approved by all unit owners affected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">{\u00b6 10} But R.C. 5311.05(E)(1) provides that the board of directors may amend the declaration \u201cto correct clerical or typographical errors or obvious factual errors in the declaration\u201d without a vote of the unit owners. We agree with Gall\u2019s assertion that the board could not have amended the declaration under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>{\u00b6 11} A clerical error has been defined in other contexts as a mistake or omission, mechanical in nature, that does not involve a legal decision or judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the trial court, the association argued that the par value was directly related to square feet in the unit and that its determination involved a simple mathematical calculation. The record shows otherwise. Cruickshank testified that she did not understand how par value was determined in the declaration and that the par values did not always make sense. She stated that she did not know why unit ten\u2019s par value was so much higher than that of other three-bedroom units. This case does not involve a clerical or factual error. The board could not have used the clerical-error provision to circumvent the statute that required a unanimous vote of the unit owners to amend the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">{\u00b6 12} The question becomes, then, whether Gall had standing to challenge the amendment. R.C. 5311.05(E)(3) states that \u201c[a]ny unit owner who is aggrieved by an amendment to the declaration that the board of directors makes pursuant to division (E)(1) of this section may commence a declaratory judgment action to have the amendment declared invalid as violative of division (E)(1) of this section.\u201d The trial court found that Gall was not aggrieved by the amendment because his par value did not change. We find no case law interpreting the phrase \u201caggrieved by an amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">{\u00b6 13} Similarly, as we have previously stated, R.C. 5311.04(E) requires a unanimous vote of \u201call unit owners affected\u201d to amend a declaration to alter the percentage of interest in the common areas. Again, the trial court found that Gall was not affected by the lowering of unit ten\u2019s par value without an amendment to the declaration because his par value did not change.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">{\u00b6 14} We find a few cases interpreting this statute. They are not directly analogous to this case because they involve physical encroachments on common areas, such as fences, decks, and parking spaces. In some of these cases, the courts held that former R.C. 5311.04(D), which was identical to current R.C. 5311.04(E), completely prevented the construction of an encroachment without a unanimous vote of all the condominium owners.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">{\u00b6 15} But other courts have rejected arguments by unit owners that former R.C. 5311.04(D) prohibited the construction of an encroachment. They held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>encroachments did not alter the other unit owners\u2019 percentage of interest in the common areas. They only changed the appearance of the common areas.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">{\u00b6 16} In one of those cases, unit owners built a fireplace that required installation of a pipe through the roof. The court stated that the unit owners\u2019 actions \u201csimply had no effect upon the percentage of interest each owner had in the common areas. While their actions changed the appearance of one part of the common area in which each owner had an interest, <em>it did not diminish the amount of that interest in relation to the other unit oumers.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; emphasis in original omitted.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We also note that these courts have also held that former R.C. 5311.04(D) did not apply, not that the parties did not have standing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">{\u00b6 17} In this case, the failure to collect unit ten\u2019s full assessment and the amendment\u2019s lowering of the par value of some units affected the par value of all the unit owners in relation to each other. Even though Gall\u2019s par value did not change, the overall amount assessed from all the unit owners was less, thus lessening the total amount of money to maintain the common areas. In other words, \u201cthe pot\u201d for maintaining the common areas was less than if the board had collected the full assessment from all the owners.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">{\u00b6 18} Thus, we conclude that Gall was an owner affected by the association\u2019s alteration of unit ten\u2019s par value and that he was aggrieved by the amendment of the declaration. We believe that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the statutes, although reasonable, would effectively neutralize those statutes and prevent unit owners from obtaining relief in many situations. Further, our interpretation of these specific statutes harmonizes them with the general provisions in R.C. 5311.19 and 5311.23, which allow any unit owner to bring an action. We hold, therefore, that Gall had standing to bring the action, and we sustain his first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">{\u00b6 19} In his second assignment of error, Gall contends that the trial court erred in \u201cissuing a final appealable order\u201d granting judgment in favor of the association on all of the claims in his complaint. He argues that the court failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>to decide his claims for an injunction prohibiting the board from amending the declaration and for damages and attorney fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">{\u00b6 20} The court specifically found that Gall did not have standing to contest the amendment. If he did not have standing, he was not entitled to damages or attorney fees. Further, the court did specifically state, \u201cI\u2019m not inclined to be awarding attorney fees.\u201d We do not agree with the association\u2019s assertion that Gall waived all issues but the amendment of the declaration. The record shows that he reserved his claims for damages and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">{\u00b6 21} While we do not agree with the trial court\u2019s decision, the court clearly decided all the issues. Therefore, it appropriately entered final judgment. Otherwise, we would not have jurisdiction to hear Gall\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, we overrule his second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">{\u00b6 22} In sum, we reverse the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for the association on all the claims in Gall\u2019s complaint. We remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings on the claims that were not moot consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b731-8\">Painter, P.J., and Hendon, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\">. <em>Northwoods Condominium Owners\u2019 Assn. v.
