Foster appeal the trial court\u2019s judgment entry denying their motion for summary judgment on the constitutionality and validity of City of Wickliffe Ordinance 2000-26 and on related claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">{\u00b6 2} The instant matter is the latest culmination in a series of disputes between the Fosters and the city of Wickliffe, appellee, relating to the city\u2019s attempt to prohibit parking or storage of recreational vehicles (\u201cRVs\u201d) in the front yards of its residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">{\u00b6 3} In December 1986, the city passed Ordinance 1986-58, which amended Section 351.16 of its traffic code to bar parking of motor homes or house vehicles in front yards between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. In October 1991, the city passed Ordinance 1991-60, which amended Section 351.16 by defining the phase \u201cfront yard\u201d and added \u201cboats\u201d and \u201cboat trailers\u201d to the prohibition. In May 1993, the city passed Ordinance 1993-2, which amended Section 351.16 by further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>defining the term \u201cfront yard\u201d and making violations of the section minor misdemeanors.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 4} After being cited multiple times for violations of Section 351.16, the Fosters filed their original complaint in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas under case No. 94 CV 000103 in January 1994. The Fosters sought, inter alia, a declaratory judgment finding Section 351.16 invalid and unconstitutional. The case was consolidated with a separate case, case No. 94 CV 000102, i.e., <em>Domante v. Wickliffe, </em>in which the plaintiff sought the same relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 5} Upon criminal prosecution on the various citations in the Willoughby Municipal Court, the Fosters moved to have the citations dismissed. In May 1994, the municipal court held Section 351.16, as amended, invalid and granted the Fosters\u2019 motion. The court held that off-street parking was subject to regulation within the city\u2019s zoning code in accordance with Section 1321 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Wickliffe. Thus, because the amendments were not submitted to the Planning Commission prior to enactment in accordance with the city\u2019s charter, the ordinance was invalid. The city did not appeal this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 6} On December 19, 1994, the Wickliffe City Council enacted Ordinance 1994-34, which amended Section 1321.50 of the city\u2019s planning and zoning code to prohibit parking of recreational vehicles on certain portions of residential lots and repealed Section 351.16. In doing so, the regulations were transferred from the traffic code to the planning and zoning code.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 7} In February 1995, the Fosters filed their first supplemental complaint to invalidate Wickliffe Ordinance 1994-34. Following a bench trial, the trial court found that the ordinance had been improperly enacted because the city had not advertised and held a public hearing. The court determined that Section 1321.50, as amended, was invalid and unenforceable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">{\u00b6 8} In 1996, the city enacted Ordinance 1996-2, an ordinance essentially identical to Ordinance 1994-34. In June 1996, the Fosters filed their second supplemental complaint, challenging this latest enactment. The parties agreed that the testimony, exhibits, and other evidence admitted at the earlier bench trial relating to Ordinance 1994-34 were to be considered in determining the validity and constitutionality of Ordinance 1996-2. On February 12, 1998, the trial court denied the Fosters\u2019 claims and held that Section 1321.50, as amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>by Ordinance 1996-2, was valid and enforceable. This judgment disposed of all of appellants\u2019 claims and was therefore a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 9} Appellants appealed to this court, and on October 29,1999, in <em>Donsante v. Wickliffe </em>(Oct. 29, 1999), 11th Dist. Nos. 98-L-046 and 98-L-047, 1999 WL 1074115, this court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and held Ordinance 1996-2 invalid due to fatal procedural flaws in its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b6 10} First, this court held that the notice pertaining to the public hearing on the ordinance was inadequate. The notice merely informed the public that Ordinance 1996-2 was intended to regulate the parking of recreational vehicles on residential property. <em>Domante </em>at *1-2. This court reasoned that the definition of \u201crecreational vehicle\u201d set forth at R.C. 4501.01(Q), read in conjunction with the published notice, sufficiently informed the public of the general nature of vehicles comprehended by the notice. <em>Domante </em>at *2. However, Ordinance 1996-2 also purported to regulate the parking of boats, boat trailers, trucks, and vehicles exceeding a three-quarter-ton rating. Id. at *2. This court held that nothing in the statutory definition of recreational vehicle could put owners of these on notice concerning the true extent of the ordinance and, consequently, that the published notice of the hearing on Ordinance 1996-2 was inadequate. Id. at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 11} Second, this court determined the city had failed to submit the legislation amending the planning and zoning code to a referendum of the voters as required by Section 3, Article XI of the Charter of the City of Wickliffe. <em>Domante </em>at *3-4. This court mooted out various other assignments of error concerning the constitutionality of Ordinance 1996-2 and entered judgment for the plaintiffs. Id. at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">{\u00b6 12} The city appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio. On February 2, 2000, that court dismissed the matter, finding \u201cno substantial constitutional question.\u201d <em>Donsante v. Wickliffe </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 1412, 723 N.E.2d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">{\u00b6 13} After the Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal, the city drafted Ordinance 2000-26, which was substantively identical to Ordinance 1996-2. The ordinance was referred to the planning commission, and a notice of a public hearing was published twice in a local newspaper. The public notice stated that the hearing would concern an ordinance titled \u201cResidential Off Street Parking\u201d to \u201cregulate the parking of recreational vehicles on residential property.\u201d The notice further provided that if the ordinance was adopted and approved by the electorate, it would amend the city\u2019s zoning code concerning the \u201cparking of recreational vehicles, trucks and other vehicles on residential property.\u201d The hearing occurred on August 7, 2000. On August 14, 2000, the Wickliffe City Council adopted the ordinance unanimously and placed it on the ballot for the upcoming election. On November 7, 2000, the voters of Wickliffe passed the ordinance 3,667 to 2,378.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>{\u00b6 14} On October 10, 2001, the Fosters filed a \u201cThird Supplemental Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, Temporary and Permanent Injunctions,\u201d under the same trial court number as the matter adjudicated by this court in 1999 and dismissed by the Supreme Court in 2000. The complaint specifically alleged that Ordinance 2000-26 should be declared invalid because, inter alia, it violated the Fosters\u2019 due process rights, rights under 42 U.S.C. 1983, and equal protection rights and involved taking of their property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fosters also asserted that they had a valid pre-existing, nonconforming use of their property prior to the passage of this ordinance and accordingly moved to permanently enjoin enforcement of Ordinance 2000-26 as it pertained to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 15} On February 10, 2003, the city moved for summary judgment. On June 3, 2003, the Fosters filed their response motion and moved the trial court for summary judgment in their favor. On March 13, 2006, the trial court granted the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to 10 of 11 issues raised by the Fosters. It held that (1) the city could use police to enforce the ordinance, (2) the city did not negligently enact the ordinance so as to cause the Fosters to continuously defend themselves against citations at great cost and expense, (3) the city did not intentionally enact the ordinance so as to cause the Fosters to continuously defend themselves against citations at great cost and expense, (4) the city provided sufficient notice to publicly inform citizens of the nature and character of the ordinance, (5) the ordinance was not arbitrary, capricious, confiscatory, and discriminatory, (6) the ordinance did not deprive the Fosters of the lawful use of their property, (7) the ordinance did not violate the Fosters\u2019 equal protection rights, (8) the ordinance did not undermine a constitutionally protected property interest in violation of due process, (9) the ordinance did not amount to an unconstitutional taking, and (10) the ordinance did not violate the Fosters\u2019 rights under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 by depriving them of a property interest in their land.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 16} However, the trial court denied the city\u2019s motion as it related to the Fosters\u2019 assertion that they had a valid pre-existing, nonconforming use of their property prior to the passage of the ordinance. On this issue, the trial court granted the Fosters\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In so ruling, the trial court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact that the Fosters\u2019 parking of an RV in front of their house poses no immediate and direct threat to public health, safety or morals. It has not presented any traffic or fire hazards, has not significantly degraded property values and has not been the source of a significant amount of neighborhood complaints. It is well maintained and is not unsightly other than its bulk. The court finds that there is no genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>issue of material fact that the Fosters prior non-conforming use is not a nuisance and that as a matter of law, they are entitled to continue their non-conforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c * * * The City of Wickliffe is permanently enjoined from enforcing Ordinance 2000-26 against Martha and Gilbert Foster for parking a recreation vehicle on a concrete pad at the left front side of their house adjacent to the property line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 19} In sum, the city was awarded summary judgment on all claims with the exception of the Fosters\u2019 assertion of a valid pre-existing use. As a result, the Fosters retained the right to permanently park their RV beside their house without the threat of citation. Despite obtaining the foregoing relief, the Fosters filed this appeal April 6, 2006, asserting that the trial court erred by failing to award them summary judgment on the remainder of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 20} The Fosters assign ten errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[1.] The trial court erred to the appellants\u2019 prejudice in denying appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment with the exception to holding of non-conforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c[2.] The trial court erred to the appellants\u2019 prejudice in considering and determining the issues of liability and damages contrary to the orders of the trial court establishing the \u2018law of the case\u2019 contrary to the bifurcation orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c[3.] The trial court erred by not following the \u2018law of the case\u2019 doctrine, to the prejudice of the appellants, as set forth in the <em>Domante </em>case, supra, mandating that \u2018boats and boat trailers\u2019 must be included in the notice of hearing publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c[4.] The trial court erred to the appellants\u2019 prejudice in finding that the summary published by the appellee, when enacting Ordinance No. 2000-26, complied with codified Ordinance No. 1341.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c[5.] The trial court erred to the appellants\u2019 prejudice in granting summary judgment to appellee to the effect that the building commissioner is not the sole enforcer of its zoning code, and ruling that the use of the police department was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[6.] The trial court erred to the appellants!\u201d] prejudice in finding that the appellee did not negligently or intentionally enacted [sic] ordinances that were not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c[7.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellants in granting summary judgment to the appellee that Ord. No. 2000-26 is not capricious, arbitrary, confiscatory, discriminatory and unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>{\u00b6 28} \u201c[8.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellants in granting summary judgment to appellee\u2019s with respect to appellants!\u2019] complaint as to C-13, C-14, C-15 and C-18 and additional causes of action C-l, C-2, C-3 and C-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c[9.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellants\u2019 [sic] in granting summary judgment to appellee with respect to appellants\u2019 claim that Ordinance No. 2000-26 does not have a reasonable relationship between the health, safety and general welfare of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c[10.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellants when it concluded that the prohibitions of Ordinance No. 2000-26 were not capricious, arbitrary, confiscatory and discriminatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 31} Preliminarily, we deal with a jurisdictional problem raised by this appeal. The Fosters, the city, and the trial court treated the case as a continuation of case No. 94 CV 000103. This seems incorrect. That case dealt with the validity of former Ordinance 1996-2. In <em>Domante, </em>we found that ordinance invalid and remanded, having entered judgment for plaintiffs. The city\u2019s appeal to the Supreme Court was declined. Consequently, that case was complete, substantively and procedurally. This case deals with something different: the validity of Ordinance 2000-26. While substantially the same as former Ordinance 1996-2, the validity of the new ordinance is a separate issue. This matter should have been filed as a new case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 32} Nevertheless, we do not believe this procedural flaw deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to entertain this matter. Civ.R. 3(A) provides: \u201cA civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court, if service is obtained within one year from such filing upon a named defendant * * In this case, the Fosters filed their \u201cThird Supplemental Complaint\u201d on October 10, 2001, and served it personally on the city\u2019s law director that same day. The city answered and has never raised any question of jurisdiction. The Lake County Court of Common Pleas certainly has subject-matter jurisdiction of the issues involved, and it has the power to consolidate the records in the former, related cases with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">{\u00b6 33} Consequently, we turn to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c \u2018Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 <em>Holik v. Richards, </em>11th Dist. No. 2005-A-0006, 2006-Ohio-2644 [2006 WL 1459677], \u00b6 12, citing <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293 [662 N.E.2d 264]. \u2018In addition, it must appear from the evidence and stipulations that reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion, which is adverse to the nonmoving party.\u2019 Id. citing Civ.R. 56(C). Further, the standard in which we review the granting of a motion for summary judgment is de novo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Id. citing <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105 [671 N.E.2d 241],</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cAccordingly, \u2018[s]ummary judgment may not be granted until the moving party sufficiently demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. The moving party bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion and identifying those portions of the record which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact on a material element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim.\u2019 <em>Brunstetter v. Keating, </em>11th Dist. No. 2002-T-0057, 2003-Ohio-3270 [2003 WL 21437016], \u00b6 12, citing <em>Dresher[, </em>75 Ohio St.3d] at 292 [662 N.E.2d 264]. \u2018Once the moving party meets the initial burden, the nonmoving party must then set forth specific facts demonstrating that a genuine issue of material fact does exist that must be preserved for trial, and if the nonmoving party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the nonmoving party.\u2019 Id., citing <em>Dresher[, </em>75 Ohio St.3d] at 293 [662 N.E.2d 264],</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cSince summary judgment denies the party his or her \u2018day in court\u2019 it is not to be viewed lightly as docket control or as a \u2018little trial.\u2019 The jurisprudence of summary judgment standards has placed burdens on both the moving and nonmoving party. In <em>Dresher v. Burt, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio held that the moving party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion and identifying those portions of the record before the trial court that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact on a material element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim. The evidence must be in the record or the motion cannot succeed. The moving party cannot discharge its initial burden under Civ.R. 56 simply by making a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case but must be able to specifically point to some evidence of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) that affirmatively demonstrates that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. If the moving party fails to satisfy its initial burden, the motion for summary judgment must be denied. If the moving party has satisfied its initial burden, the nonmoving party has a reciprocal burden outlined in the last sentence of Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. If the nonmoving party fails to do so, summary judgment, if appropriate shall be entered against the nonmoving party based on the principles that have been firmly established in Ohio for quite some time in <em>Misteff[Mitseff</em>] <em>v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112 [526 N.E.2d 798],</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe court in <em>Dresher </em>went on to say that paragraph three of the syllabus in <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108 [570 N.E.2d 1095], * * * is too broad and fails to account for the burden Civ.R. 56 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>places upon a <em>moving </em>party. The court, therefore, limited paragraph three of the syllabus in <em>Wing </em>to bring it into conformity with <em>Misteff [Mitseff </em>]. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe Supreme Court in <em>Dresher </em>went on to hold that when <em>neither </em>the moving nor nonmoving party provides evidentiary materials demonstrating there are no material facts in dispute, the moving party is not entitled [to] judgment as a matter of law as the moving party bears the initial responsibility of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, \u2018and identifying those portions of the record which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact on a material element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim.\u2019 Id. at 276. (Emphasis added.)\u201d <em>Welch v. Ziccarelli, </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-L-229, 2007-Ohio-4374, 2007 WL 2410102, at \u00b6 36-37, 40-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 40} As the Fosters\u2019 first and eighth assignments of error mount omnibus attacks on the trial court\u2019s judgment, we consider the other assignments of error first, to winnow the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 41} By their second assignment of error, the Fosters allege that the trial court violated the law-of-the-case doctrine, by granting the city summary judgment on their claims for damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Fosters argue that the trial court, in the actions relating to the prior ordinances, bifurcated the issues of the validity of the ordinances and the Fosters\u2019 entitlement to damages, reserving the latter for future proceedings. They further claim that the trial court and parties agreed, during pretrial, to bifurcate these issues in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cUnder the doctrine of the law of the case, the decision of an appellate court in a case establishes the law of that case for all subsequent proceedings therein, not only in the trial court but also in subsequent proceedings in the same reviewing court. <em>Robinson v. Pennsylvania Rd. Co. </em>(1927), 117 Ohio St. 43, 158 N.E. 83. The purpose of the rule is to ensure that upon remand, the mandate of an appellate court is followed by the trial court. <em>Stemen v. Shibley </em>(1982), 11 Ohio App.3d 263, 265, 11 OBR 441, 465 N.E.2d 460.\u201d <em>Local No. 74, Am. Fedn. of State, Cty. &amp; Mun. Emps. v. Warren, </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-T-0125, 174 Ohio App.3d 66, 2007-Ohio-6253, 880 N.E.2d 954, at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">{\u00b6 43} As we cautioned above, the instant case is <em>not </em>the same as that concerning ordinances prior to Ordinance 2000-26 and culminating in the Supreme Court\u2019s declination of jurisdiction in <em>Donsante, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 1412, 723 N.E.2d 118. Consequently, the law-of-the-case doctrine has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">{\u00b6 44} Further, the Fosters do not point to any order of the trial court in the record mandating that the issues of validity of the ordinance and damages be bifurcated. Even if they did so, we do not believe that any error would attend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>the trial court\u2019s decision to consider these issues together. Civ.R. 56 directs trial courts to grant summary judgment as a matter of law if no genuine issues of material fact exist to support a claim. Consequently, the trial court was within its purview in granting the city summary judgment on the Fosters\u2019 claims relating to damages if it determined that the Fosters had not supported them.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 45} The second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 46} By their third assignment of error, the Fosters assert that the law-of-the-case doctrine required the notice concerning the public hearing on Ordinance 2000-26 to contain the words \u201cboats and boat trailers\u201d and that the trial court erred in concluding the contrary. The Fosters premise their argument on our decision in <em>Donsante, </em>1999 WL 1074115, at *2-8, wherein we concluded that the notice of public meeting concerning former Ordinance 1996-2 was insufficient to alert owners of various vehicles \u2014 including boats and boat trailers \u2014 that the proposed ordinance would affect their parking privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 47} First, we note again that the law-of-the-case doctrine has no application herein. More significantly, we respectfully suggest that the Fosters misread our decision in <em>Donsante. </em>The notice of public hearing therein merely stated that the proposed ordinance would affect the parking of \u201crecreational vehicles\u201d in the city. Id. at *2. We turned to the definition of \u201crecreational vehicle\u201d set forth at R.C. 4501.01(Q) and determined that it was insufficiently broad to imply to owners of other vehicles specifically covered by the proposed ordinance that their parking privileges were at issue. <em>Donsante </em>at *2-3. In the instant case, the notice of public hearing concerning Ordinance 2006-26 stated that it would affect not merely \u201crecreational vehicles\u201d but \u201ctrucks and other vehicles\u201d as well. The learned trial court correctly turned to the definitions of \u201ctruck\u201d and of \u201cvehicle\u201d set forth at R.C. 4501.01 (J) and (A), respectively, in determining that the notice was sufficiently broad to alert the owner of any vehicle to be affected by the proposed ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 48} The third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">{\u00b6 49} By their fourth assignment of error, the Fosters assert that the notice of public hearing regarding Ordinance 2000-26 was insufficient under Section 1341.40 of the planning and zoning code of the city, entitled \u201cAction by Council.\u201d Section 1341.40 requires that the published notice of public hearing \u201cset forth * * * a summary of the proposed amendment [to the City\u2019s zoning].\u201d The Fosters argue that the notice of public hearing concerning Ordinance 2000-26, as interpreted by the trial court applying the appropriate definitions from the Revised Code, is too vague to alert residents as to exactly what vehicles might be affected. They point to an admission by the city that the parking of various enumerated vehicles is not affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>{\u00b6 50} We agree with the learned trial court\u2019s conclusion the notice given was sufficient as a matter of law to alert the city\u2019s residents that the parking of many types of vehicles would be affected by the proposed ordinance and that potentially affected residents needed to view the complete copy of the proposed ordinance. We note that Section 1341.40 requires only a summary of any proposed change to the zoning code to be included in the notice of public hearing. A summary is just that: it should not repeat everything contained in the item summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 51} The fourth assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 52} By their fifth assignment of error, the Fosters attack the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the city properly relied on its police department to issue them tickets for their alleged violations of Ordinance 2000-26. They characterize this use of the city\u2019s police as intimidation. They cite various sections of the city\u2019s zoning code for the proposition that the building commissioner is tasked with the duty of enforcing the zoning code. They argue that the section of the zoning code relied on by the trial court in concluding that the budding commissioner could delegate this authority was added by amendment following the incidents that are the subject of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 53} Accepting the Fosters\u2019 contention that the specific zoning code provision relied on by the trial court is inapplicable would not lead us to find error in that court\u2019s conclusion. Ordinance 2000-26, at Section I. (j), itself provides that infractions are minor misdemeanors. As the trial court noted in its judgment entry, no provision of the city\u2019s zoning code prevents the budding commissioner from using agents \u2014 including the police \u2014 in enforcing the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 54} The fifth assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">{\u00b6 55} By their sixth assignment of error, the Fosters allege that the trial court incorrectly denied their claim that the city enacted invalid ordinances regarding the parking of recreational vehicles negligently or intentionally, with the purpose of preventing them from litigating the issue of whether they had a valid, pre-existing, nonconforming use. Their evidence for this assignment of error is the fact that former Section 351.16 of the city\u2019s traffic code was found invalid by the Wdloughby Municipal Court, that the trial court found former Ordinance 1994-34 invalid, and that this court held former Ordinance 1996-2 invalid. Fundamentally, the Fosters seem to allege that only negligence, or intentional conduct, could result in so many failures by the city to enact a valid regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">{\u00b6 56} We respectfully disagree. The invalidity of the former regulations found by the courts was premised on flaws in their enactment. The Fosters present no competent Civ.R. 56 evidence that the city, whether negligently or intentionally, enacted procedurally flawed zoning regulations for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>denying the Fosters a day in court, and we decline their invitation to make such an inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">{\u00b6 57} The sixth assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 58} By their seventh assignment of error, the Fosters assert that the trial court incorrectly found that Ordinance 2000-26 is not capricious, arbitrary, confiscatory, discriminatory, and unconstitutional. By their tenth assignment of error, they allege that the trial court incorrectly found that Ordinance 2000-26 is not capricious, arbitrary, confiscatory, and discriminatory. By their ninth assignment of error, they allege that the trial court incorrectly found that Ordinance 2000-26 bears a reasonable relationship to the health, safety, and general welfare of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 59} The assignments of error being interrelated, so is our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cA municipality or other zoning body is justified by its police powers to enact zoning for the public welfare and safety. The powers, not unlimited, need only bear a rational relation to the health, safety, morals or general welfare.\u201d <em>Goldberg Cos., Inc. v. Richmond Hts. City Council </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 207, 213-214, 690 N.E.2d 510, citing <em>Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co. </em>(1926), 272 U.S. 365, 47 S.Ct. 114, 71 L.Ed. 303. \u201cThe burden of proof remains with the party challenging an ordinance\u2019s constitutionality, and the standard of proof remains \u2018beyond fair debate.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 214, 690 N.E.2d 510, quoting <em>Cent. Motors Corp. v. Pepper Pike </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 581, at 584, 653 N.E.2d 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 61} We agree with the learned trial court that application of the foregoing principles to this dispute establishes that Ordinance 2000-26 bears a rational relation to the city\u2019s health, safety, morals, or general welfare and is not capricious, arbitrary, confiscatory, or discriminatory. The Fosters\u2019 principal argument in support of these claims is that the ordinance singles out recreational vehicles, boats and boat trailers, and smaller trucks for regulation, while not regulating many equally large or (possibly) unsightly vehicles. The argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">{\u00b6 62} The city might well choose to regulate the parking of large vehicles for the purpose of safety, in that such vehicles may obstruct sight lines along streets and block access to houses. This bears a rational relation to public safety. Cf. <em>Goldberg Cos., </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 213-214, 690 N.E.2d 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">{\u00b6 63} The city may include in its zoning regulations provisions to improve or maintain aesthetics. <em>Hudson v. Albrecht, Inc. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 69, 9 OBR 273, 458 N.E.2d 852, at paragraph one of the syllabus. Some people may consider recreational vehicles, boats, and boat trailers unsightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>{\u00b6 64} There is no constitutional requirement that the city zone the parking of all large or unsightly vehicles, and the list of vehicles not subject to Ordinance 2000-26 presented by the Fosters seems to include mostly vehicles and trailers used for business purposes or services. The city might rationally distinguish between pleasure vehicles \u2014 like RVs and boats \u2014 and trucks or vans used for commercial purposes, for instance. This seems particularly true because recreational vehicles are, given the nature of Ohio\u2019s weather, likely to be stationary for large periods of the year, whereas commercial and service vehicles, being necessary for residents\u2019 livelihoods, move.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 65} It may be that the Fosters, under assignments of error seven and ten, are alleging discriminatory enforcement of Ordinance 2000-26 against them. They do not favor us with information as to where, in the voluminous record, evidence of such discriminatory enforcement might be found. However, even if this is part of their contentions under these assignments of error, the issue is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cMere selective enforcement of a statute, including a zoning law, is not unconstitutional. <em>Machnics v. Sloe, </em>11th Dist. No. 2004-G-2554, 2005-Ohio-935 [2005 WL 516520], at \u00b6 63. To carry the heavy burden of showing discriminatory enforcement, a claimant cannot rely on the fact that others similarly situated have not been prosecuted. Id. The claimant must show that the selective enforcement was intentional. Id. This requires a prima facie showing of two elements: (1) that others similarly situated have not been prosecuted; and that the prosecution is invidious, being based on such considerations as race, religion or an attempt to prevent the exercise of constitutional rights. Id. at \u00b6 63-64.\u201d <em>Bd. of Trustees of Chester Twp. v. Baumgardner, </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-G-2721, 2007-Ohio-1783, 2007 WL 1113967, at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 67} The Fosters do not point to any evidence of selective enforcement of Ordinance 2000-26 against them; they make no prima facie showing that any enforcement of the ordinance against them was invidious.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 68} In sum, the seventh, ninth, and tenth assignments of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 69} In their first assignment of error, the Fosters assert that genuine issues of material fact exist in relation to issues raised in the city\u2019s memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment and refer us to parts III.A., III.B., and III.C. (a), (b), and (c) of that document as proof. We deal with these issues in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">{\u00b6 70} Part III.A. of the city\u2019s memorandum in support of its summary judgment motion concerns the standards for application of Civ.R. 56. We do not see what bearing this has on the appeal. The issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>{\u00b6 71} Part III.B. of the city\u2019s memorandum in support sets forth the law applicable to determining whether a zoning regulation is constitutional. We find nothing objectionable in it. The issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 72} Part III.C. of the city\u2019s memorandum in support concerns the alleged preclusive effect of the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the constitutionality of former Ordinance 1996-2 and the Fosters\u2019 right to a pre-existing use thereunder. These findings were made in 1998 but were not reached by this court in rendering our decision in <em>Domante, </em>as we found that ordinance invalid due to improper enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 73} We are dealing with Ordinance 2000-26, not former Ordinance 1996-2. The ordinances are substantially similar in content but are entirely different enactments. We do not consider that the trial court\u2019s 1998 judgment entry regarding former Ordinance 1996-2 has any effect, preclusive or otherwise, on these proceedings, and arguments relating to it are irrelevant. These issues are without merit, as is the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 74} By their eighth assignment of error, the Fosters assert that the trial court erred in granting the city summary judgment on issues set forth at four paragraphs of the first cause of action in their Third Supplemental Complaint, as well as on four additional causes of action. They further set forth as issues (1) alleged error by the trial court in failing to bifurcate the consideration of the validity of Ordinance 2000-26 and damages under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, and (2) whether the trial court erred due to failure to consider genuine issues of material fact raised by the Fosters.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 75} We deal with the stated issues raised by the Fosters first. Then we will proceed to consider, as separate issues, any allegations contained in the various paragraphs and counts of the Third Supplemental Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">{\u00b6 76} We respectfully believe that the stated issues set forth by the Fosters in support of the eighth assignment of error have been disposed of in our discussion of their second assignment of error. Regarding bifurcation, the trial court was entitled to deal with their Section 1983 claim as a matter of law, in these summary judgment proceedings, if it found no Civ.R. 56 evidence supporting the claim in the record. It found no such evidence. Further, the simple fact that the Fosters presented evidence does not create a genuine issue of material fact under Civ.R. 56. The evidence must be relevant to the claims asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">{\u00b6 77} These issues are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">{\u00b6 78} Under paragraph C-13 of their Third Supplemental Complaint, the Fosters alleged that the city improperly relied on its police to cite them for infractions of Ordinance 2000-26. This issue has been considered in our discussion of the fifth assignment of error and is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>{\u00b6 79} Under paragraph C-14 of their Third supplemental Complaint, the Fosters alleged that Ordinance 2000-26 was negligently enacted. This issue has been considered in our discussion of the sixth assignment of error and is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 80} Under paragraph C-15 of their Third Supplemental Complaint, the Fosters alleged that the enactment of Ordinance 2000-26 was intentionally invalid. This issue has been considered in our discussion of the sixth assignment of error and is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 81} Under paragraph C-18(A.) of their Third Supplemental Complaint, the Fosters alleged that the notice of public hearing regarding Ordinance 2000-26 was defective. This issue has been considered in our discussion of the third and fourth assignments of error and is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 82} Under paragraph C-18(B.) of their Third Supplemental Complaint, the Fosters alleged that Ordinance 2000-26 is \u201carbitrary, discriminatory, vague and capricious in that it fails to cover vehicles of a similar nature and has no relation to the public peace, safety, health, or welfare of the city and serves no public purpose.\u201d These issues have been considered in our discussion of the seventh, ninth, and tenth assignments of error and are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">{\u00b6 83} Under paragraph C-18(D.) of their Third Supplemental Complaint, the Fosters alleged that Ordinance 2000-26 was enacted due to a conspiracy by various members of the city\u2019s administration and council to deprive them of the lawful use of their property. The Fosters point to absolutely no evidence of such a conspiracy in the record. The issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">{\u00b6 84} Under paragraph C-18(E.) of their Third Supplemental Complaint, the Fosters again alleged that the notice of public hearing regarding Ordinance 2000-26 was defective. We again find that this issue without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">{\u00b6 85} By \u201cAdditional Cause of Action C-l\u201d of their Third Supplemental Complaint, the Fosters alleged that they were deprived of their due process rights under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, due to the city\u2019s attempt to deprive them of their use of their property and cause them financial hardship. By \u201cAdditional Cause of Action C-2,\u201d they alleged that the city\u2019s actions violated 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.' That section \u201cprovides a remedy to persons whose federal rights have been violated by governmental officials.\u201d <em>1946 St. Clair Corp. v. Cleveland </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 33, 34, 550 N.E.2d 456. Since each of these claims demands an inquiry into due process, we analyze them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">{\u00b6 86} The Fosters appear to claim a violation of the \u201csubstantive due process rights.\u201d However, \u201csubstantive due process\u201d normally pertains to liberty interests secured by the United States Constitution. <em>1946 St. Clair Corp. </em>at 35, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>550 N.E.2d 456. \u201cProperty is an individual entitlement grounded in state law * * *.\u201d <em>Asher Investments, Inc. v. Cincinnati </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 126, 136, 701 N.E.2d 400. Consequently, property rights are generally only protected by \u201cprocedural due process.\u201d Cf. <em>1946 St. Clair Corp. </em>at 34-35, 550 N.E.2d 456. Only the Fosters\u2019 property rights were potentially affected by the zoning ordinance in question. Federal due process rights usually being applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, we consider these issues under the rubric of the Fosters\u2019 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">{\u00b6 87} \u201cWhen the interest [of which a party is being deprived] is purely economic, the Constitution demands only that the [party] be given a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>1946 St. Clair Corp. </em>at 36, 550 N.E.2d 456, citing <em>Parratt v. Taylor </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 527, 543-544, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420. In this case, the Fosters received a more than adequate opportunity to be heard before the trial court. Further, \u201c[t]o assert a claim under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code * * * for deprivation without due process of a purely economic interest, a plaintiff must allege and prove inadequacy of state remedies.\u201d <em>1916 St. Clair Corp., </em>at the syllabus. In this case, as the trial court noted, the Fosters cannot show any inadequacy in state remedies. They have successfully obtained a permanent injunction against the enforcement of Ordinance 2000-26 against them. Further, there is no evidence before us that they ever paid any citation or f\u00edne levied against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 88} These issues are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 89} By \u201cAdditional Cause of Action C-3\u201d of their Third Supplemental Complaint, the Fosters alleged violation of their right to equal protection, under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, due to the actions of the city as described in each of the complaints filed by the Fosters throughout all of the various cases previously mentioned. We construe this as an allegation of discriminatory enforcement of Ordinance 2000-26 against them and find the issue without merit, for the reasons set forth in our discussion of the seventh, ninth, and tenth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 90} Under paragraph C-18(C) of their Third Supplemental Complaint, the Fosters alleged that Ordinance 2000-26 was designed to deprive them of the lawful use of their property. By \u201cAdditional Cause of Action C-4,\u201d they alleged that the ordinance constituted a taking of their property under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article I, Section 19 of the Ohio Constitution. We consider these issues together.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">{\u00b6 91} First, the United States Supreme Court has recently overruled its holding in <em>Agins v. Tiburon </em>(1980), 447 U.S. 255, 100 S.Ct. 2138, 65 L.Ed.2d 106, which had established a two-part test for determining whether a taking in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>violation of the United States Constitution had occurred. See, e.g., <em>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>(2005), 544 U.S. 528, 531-532, 540, 545, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876. The <em>Agins </em>test had been current in Ohio. Cf. <em>Haisley v. Mercer Cty. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>3d Dist. No. 10-07-05, 2007-Ohio-6021, 2007 WL 3342768, at \u00b6 12. \u201cUnder the test articulated in <em>Agins, </em>a party could establish a zoning related takings claim on one of two grounds: (1) the zoning provision did not substantially advance a legitimate municipal health, safety or welfare interest, or (2) the zoning restriction deprived an owner of all economically viable use of the property.\u201d Id. The <em>Agins </em>test was utilized by the trial court in analyzing the takings issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 92} In <em>Lingle, </em>the United States Supreme Court determined that the \u201csubstantially advances\u201d portion of the <em>Agins </em>test was inappropriate for takings jurisprudence, being an inquiry into due process. Cf. <em>Lingle, </em>544 U.S. at 540-542, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876. Currently, therefore, courts must identify the nature of the alleged taking, in order to apply the correct test. Courts should look to <em>Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp. </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 419, 102 S.Ct. 3164, 73 L.Ed.2d 868, when a permanent physical invasion of property by the government occurs. Cf. <em>Lingle </em>at 538-539, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876. <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 1003, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798, provides guidance when a government regulation allegedly deprives a property owner of all economically viable use of his or her property. Cf. <em>Lingle </em>at 538-539, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876. Finally, <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. New York City </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631, applies in cases such as the instant case, where a government regulation allegedly affects property without emptying it of all value. Cf. <em>Lingle </em>at 538-539, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 93} Regarding <em>Penn Cent., </em>the <em>Lingle </em>court stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 94} \u201cThe Court in <em>Penn Central </em>acknowledged that it had hitherto been \u2018unable to develop any \u201cset formula\u201d \u2019 for evaluating regulatory takings claims, but identified \u2018several factors that have particular significance.\u2019 Id., 43 [438] U.S., at 124 [, 57 L.Ed.2d 63198 S.Ct. 2646], * * *. Primary among those factors are \u2018the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and, particularly, the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations.\u2019 Ibid. In addition, the \u2018character of the governmental action\u2019 \u2014 for instance whether it amounts to a physical invasion or instead merely affects property interests through \u2018some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good\u2019 \u2014 may be relevant in discerning whether a taking has occurred. Ibid.\u201d <em>Lingle, </em>544 U.S. at 538-539, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>{\u00b6 95} Application of the <em>Penn Cent, </em>factors to this case shows that the Fosters have not suffered any taking. They have not suffered any economic impact due to Ordinance 2000-26, since they may continue to park their recreational vehicle on the concrete pad in front of their house, due to the permanent injunction granted by the trial court. The character of the governmental intrusion indicates that no taking has occurred. The city has not invaded then-property; the ordinance is merely designed to adjust the burdens of economic life by requiring owners of certain vehicles to park them in certain places on then-properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 96} These issues are without merit, as is the eighth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 97} We gratefully acknowledge the painstaking and thoughtful judgment entry of the trial court, which has been a lantern lighting our way through the labyrinth of this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 98} The judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">{\u00b6 99} It is the further order of this court that appellants are assessed costs taxed herein.

This judgment was not a final, appealable order, because the court did not dispose of all of appellants\u2019 claims and did not affix the necessary Civ.R. 54(B) language to the judgment entry. The entry suggests, however, that this was intentional, as the court explicitly reserved judgment on appellants\u2019 additional claims for a later date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b583-12\">Cynthia Westcott Rice, P.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ArP\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">{\u00b6 100} Although the Fosters assert a myriad of different arguments in support of their appeal, I believe that the issues surrounding their second and third assignments of error are dispositive of the instant matter. In their second and third assignments of error, the Fosters claim, inter alia, that the trial court erred by failing to follow the law of the case established by this court\u2019s 1999 holding in <em>Donsante v. Wickliffe </em>(Oct. 29,1999), 11th Dist. Nos. 98-L-046 and 98-L-047, 1999 WL 1074115. Appellant\u2019s argument presupposes that our holding in <em>Donsante, </em>a case in which appellants appealed the trial court\u2019s validation of former Ordinance No. 1996-2, controls the validity of Ordinance No. 2000-26. This assumption exhibits various flaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">{\u00b6 101} First, <em>Donsante, </em>an appeal taken from a final judgment in trial court case No. 94 CV 000103, declared Ordinance No. 1996-2 invalid due to certain fatal procedural flaws that compromised its enactment. Following this decision, the city appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Donsante v. Wickliffe </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 1412, 723 N.E.2d 118; however, the Supreme Court dismissed the matter for a lack of jurisdiction. This operated as a final adjudication on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>merits. See, e.g., <em>Dobbins v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 533, 664 N.E.2d 908. As there was nothing remaining to be litigated regarding Ordinance 1996-2, that case was over and final upon the Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 102} \u201cThe law of the case is a longstanding doctrine in Ohio jurisprudence. \u2018[T]he doctrine provides that the decision of a reviewing court in a case remains the law of that case on the legal questions involved for all subsequent proceedings in the case at both the trial and reviewing levels.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hopkins v. Dyer, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 461, 463, 820 N.E.2d 329, 2004-Ohio-6769, quoting <em>Nolan v. Nolan </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 462 N.E.2d 410. Thus, the law-of-the-case doctrine requires an inferior court to follow a superior court\u2019s ruling on an issue already decided by the appellate court in the context of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 103} The case brought under the Fosters\u2019 so-called third supplemental complaint, while sharing the same trial court number, was separate and distinct from the matters resolved in <em>Donsante. </em>The matter in controversy resolved by <em>Donsante </em>was the validity of former Ordinance 1996-2. Once the Supreme Court dismissed the city\u2019s appeal of this court\u2019s holding in <em>Donsante, </em>that case was over and final. Thus, I agree with the majority that the law-of-the-case doctrine would have no application to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 104} However, the foregoing analysis anticipates a more significant problem than a misunderstanding of the application of the law-of-the-case doctrine. Upon the Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal of the city\u2019s appeal, Case No. 94 CV 000103 was both procedurally and substantively closed. The Fosters\u2019 \u201cthird supplemental complaint\u201d was filed to address a newly enacted ordinance and therefore alleged a new case in controversy. Because Case No. 94 CV 000103 was over upon the Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal of the city\u2019s appeal, the trial court had no jurisdiction to entertain the Fosters\u2019 \u201cthird supplemental complaint.\u201d To invoke the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to litigate the issues in the \u201cthird supplemental complaint,\u201d the Fosters were required to commence a new action in accordance with Civ.R. 3(A). Absent the filing of a new action, the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to act on the issues animating the Fosters\u2019 \u201cthird supplemental complaint\u201d and any subsequent motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 105} Although the majority acknowledges that \u201cthe matter should have been filed as a new case,\u201d it nevertheless concludes that the lower court \u201ccertainly has subject-matter jurisdiction of the issues involved.\u201d This holding is internally inconsistent. The majority\u2019s holding that the matter should have been filed as a new case means that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the \u201cthird supplemental complaint.\u201d I fail to see how the lower court could retain subject-matter jurisdiction over a case that has been unconditionally and finally adjudicated on the merits. Once the Supreme Court dismissed the city\u2019s appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>in <em>Donsante, </em>case No. 94 CV 000103 was over and the trial court lost all jurisdiction over that case. That is, once case No. 94 CV 000103 was adjudicated with finality, neither the Fosters nor the trial court possessed the power to resurrect it to litigate additional matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">{\u00b6 106} Regardless of procedural deficiencies, the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived. <em>H.R. Options, Inc. v. Zaino, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 373, 374, 2004-Ohio-1, 800 N.E.2d 740; see also <em>Mid-States Terminal, Inc. v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 79, 82, 666 N.E.2d 1077. Where, as here, the parties fail to raise a jurisdictional issue on appeal, an appellate court must raise it sua sponte. <em>Davison v. Rini </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 688, 692, 686 N.E.2d 278, citing <em>Whitaker-Merrell v. Geupel Co. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 184, 186, 58 O.O.2d 399, 280 N.E.2d 922. Because this case was commenced under a defunct case number, I would hold that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to rule on any issues pertaining to Ordinance 2000-26. This matter should be reversed and remanded with specific instructions to the trial court to vacate its March 13, 2006 judgment entry for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">{\u00b6 107} I accordingly dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
