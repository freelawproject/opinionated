Wile was sentenced to two consecutive sentences of 12 months, for a total sentence of 24 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">{\u00b62} Wile advances four assignments of error. Assignments 1 and 2 are related and will be discussed together, but in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c2. The trial court abused its discretion in failing to act upon innacuracies [sic] in the pre-sentence investigation report.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c1. Appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the United States and Ohio Consttution [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">{\u00b6 5} Before the trial court imposed sentence, counsel for Wile disputed an assertion in the presentence-investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) that Wile had \u201cfailed to comply with treatment recommendations\u201d made after an assessment by TCN Behavioral Health Services. Counsel contended that TCN had made no recommendations. The trial court, after counsel\u2019s remarks and dialogue with Wile, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>sentenced Wile without looking into the alleged misstatement pointed out by Wile\u2019s counsel. Wile contends that the trial court erred to his prejudice because the state had recommended community-control sanctions, and the court imposed a maximum sentence instead. Wile urges us to impose a fact-finding procedure upon trial judges where such misstatements are asserted, as he contends is required by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Because the trial judge was operating under the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure, which do not require such an inquiry, we believe that the appropriate standard of review is whether, under the particular circumstances of this case, the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">{\u00b6 6} Based on the following dialogue between the trial court and Wiles, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Wile, you have an opportunity at this time to address the Court. Is there anything that you would like to tell me, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cA. Yes, sir, I would.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m sorry?</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">{\u00b6 10} Wes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cTHE COURT: Go ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cA. That I know that I messed up and that I made the wrong choice, and now that I have thought about it and grown-up that I think that I need to get my life back on track. And I think that maybe an inpatient program for drug and alcohol assessment would be the thing for me. At least there I could get something out of that instead of going through this outpatient, because outpatient is I go there and come home, you know, and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m getting anything out of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cSo I just, you know, want the Court to know that I\u2019m trying to do my best to get my life back together.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cTHE COURT: Anything else?</p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cA. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cTHE COURT: Well, the attitude you\u2019re expressing to me here this afternoon is somewhat the attitude you should have had when we were going through this presentence investigation. You have a prior felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA. Yes, sir, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cTHE COURT: So this isn\u2019t your first time sitting in a Courtroom. <em>And there may be some dispute based upon what your counsel says as to what the program representative may have said or what you may have understood.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>{\u00b6 19} \u201cBut the report indicates that you met with the representative of the Monday Program on December the 14th and you declined to participate in the program stating you did not need treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cWell, anybody who doesn\u2019t feel they need treatment is not going to do any good in treatment. It is not going to do me much good to send you to treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cTHE COURT: Then when you were asked whether or not you \u2014 if having you evaluated for the GreeneLeaf Program was going to be a waste of time, you more-or-less said well you didn\u2019t care, just go ahead and do Greene-Leaf, give you the form and you would sign up for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cWell, that is not quite the attitude that we need. We\u2019re looking for somebody who wants to help themselves and overcome problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cI don\u2019t know that I \u2014 I agree with you that you need some type of treatment, but before you get the treatment, you need some type of an attitude change. And that attitude change has to be to understand that you need the treatment and you want the treatment and you will follow and voluntarily participate in the treatment and not come up with the type of an attitude that you had with the Probation Department and these people who are trying to help you getting you into these programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThat is the problem that presents itself to me here is I don\u2019t see where your attitude is ready for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cAnd on top of that, like I said, you\u2019ve been down this road before.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cA. All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cTHE COURT: You have a prior felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cDo you have something else you want to say?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cA. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cTHE COURT: Go ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-17\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cA. When I was at Monday Program, I didn\u2019t comprehend what the lady was explaining to me. I got frustrated at the time. I didn\u2019t listen and I got up and walked out. You know. I signed the thing and got up and left. I didn\u2019t sit there and comprehend like I should have. Now I wish I would have.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-18\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cTHE COURT: Well, I wish you would have too. Anything else?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-19\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cA. No, sir.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-20\">{\u00b6 35} We think it is abundantly clear from this dialogue that the trial court recognized the alleged misstatement in the PSI alluded to by Wile\u2019s counsel, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>accorded it little, if any, significance in determining to sentence Wile to prison. Rather, the court was concerned with Wile\u2019s indifferent \u2014 if not hostile \u2014 attitude toward the Monday and GreeneLeaf programs, which offered alternatives to imprisonment, and with Wile\u2019s criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">{\u00b6 36} Given the particular circumstances of this case, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s proceeding to sentence Wile without further inquiry into the alleged misstatement in the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">{\u00b6 37} Wile\u2019s complaint with his trial counsel is with her not requesting a continuance to facilitate clearing up the alleged discrepancy between the representation in the PSI and what Wile claimed to be the real situation: that TCN had made no recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">{\u00b6 38} The two-prong test for ineffective assistance of counsel is set out in paragraphs two and three of the syllabus of <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">{\u00b6 39} <em>\u201c2. </em>Counsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance. <em>(State v. Lytle </em>[1976], 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 2 O.O.3d 495, 358 N.E.2d 623; <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>[1984], 466 U.S. 668 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674], followed.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c3. To show that a defendant has been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the defendant must prove that there exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">{\u00b6 41} Assuming arguendo that trial counsel should have asked for a continuance, there is no reasonable probability that her failure to do so is the reason Wile was sentenced to prison rather than placed on community control. The PSI has been made part of the record on appeal. Despite the alleged misstatement that Wile had failed to follow treatment recommendations by TCN, the PSI nevertheless recommended community-control sanctions rather than imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">{\u00b6 42} The alleged misstatement in the PSI did not result in a recommendation in the PSI that was contrary to the state\u2019s recommendation of community control. As we observed above, the trial court appears to have accorded little, if any, importance to the alleged misstatement in determining to sentence Wile. Ineffective assistance of counsel is not demonstrated, and the first two assignments are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c3. Appellant did not enter a knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">{\u00b6 44} Wile contends that his guilty pleas were not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made because he did not foresee a 24-month sentence, given the state\u2019s recommendation of community-control sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">{\u00b6 45} This contention is belied by the record. Before pleading guilty, the following dialogue occurred between the court and Wile:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand that [the] agreement is between you and the State of Ohio. It does not in any way bind the Court to go along with that agreement. The Court can go along with it but is not required to go along with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cA: Yes, Your Honor, I understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand once you enter a plea of guilty to an offense, the only remaining requirement left for the Court [sic] to impose sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cA: Yes, sir, I understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c[The Court requests the State to enter a brief recitation of facts into the record.]</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Wile, did you hear and understand the facts that the assistant prosecutor read into the record?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cA: Yes, sir, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cTHE COURT: You\u2019re entering this plea of guilty because that is what you did, you are guilty?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cA: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand what the maximum possible punishment is the Court could impose for these offenses?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-17\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cA: Yes, sir. I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-18\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cTHE COURT: What is that, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-19\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cA. Two years and a $5,000.00 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-20\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cTHE COURT: That is correct. Now, understanding that the maximum possible punishment is 24 months in prison and a $5,000.00 f\u00edne, do you still wish to go forward with your plea?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-21\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cA: Yes, sir, I do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-22\">{\u00b6 61} On virtually identical facts, we rejected the same contention asserted here by Wile in <em>State v. Lane </em>(Apr. 19, 2002), Greene App. No. 2001-CA-91, 2002 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>WL 626164, noting the clear statement of the trial court that it was not bound by the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation and the defendants\u2019 acknowledgment of their understanding of the court\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">{\u00b6 62} The third assignment is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">{\u00b6 63} \u201c4. The trial court erred in the imposition of sentence on appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">{\u00b6 64} Wile cites <em>State v. Friend, </em>165 Ohio App.3d 43, 2005-Ohio-7069, 844 N.E.2d 889, in support of his contention that the trial court erred in failing to make the statutorily mandated findings required for the imposition of maximum, consecutive sentences. <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, dispensed with the need for such findings by holding the statutes requiring them unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">{\u00b6 65} The fourth assignment is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">{\u00b6 66} The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b226-12\">Brogan, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b226-13\">Grady, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b226-14\">Grady, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AAF\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">{\u00b6 67} I agree that ineffective assistance of counsel is not demonstrated. The claim requires a showing that, as a result of his attorney\u2019s ineffectiveness, a defendant was deprived of a substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him. <em>Lockhart v. Fretwell </em>(1993), 506 U.S. 364, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180. That occurred in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, because counsel failed to offer certain mitigating evidence in the sentencing phase of a capital-murder case, which state law permitted the defendant to offer. However, <em>Strickland </em>went on to state:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cWe need not consider the role of counsel in an ordinary sentencing, which may involve informal proceedings and standardless discretion in the sentencer, and hence may require a different approach to the definition of constitutionally effective assistance. A capital sentencing proceeding like the one involved in this case, however, is sufficiently like a trial in its adversarial format and in the existence of standards for decision, that counsel\u2019s role in the proceeding is comparable to counsel\u2019s role at trial \u2014 to ensure that the adversarial testing process works to produce a just result under the standards governing decision.\u201d 466 U.S. at 686-687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>{\u00b6 69} Applying the rules of <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Lockhart, </em>the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may apply to the sentencing phase of capital-murder cases. <em>Williams v. Taylor </em>(2000), 529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389; <em>Wiggins v. Smith </em>(2003), 539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471; <em>Rompilla v. Beard </em>(2005), 545 U.S. 374, 125 S.Ct. 2456, 162 L.Ed.2d 360; <em>Florida v. Nixon </em>(2004), 543 U.S. 175, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">{\u00b6 70} In the present case, defendant-appellant Wile was convicted on his negotiated pleas to one count of possession of cocaine and one count of possession of criminal tools, both fifth-degree felonies. The trial court sentenced Wile to the maximum terms of incarceration available for that degree of felony, 12 months, R.C. 2929.14(A)(5), to be served consecutively. The court had full discretion to do that. <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470. The only standards it was required to apply were the purposes and principles of sentencing in R.C. 2929.11 and the seriousness and recidivism factors in R.C. 2929.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 71} Measured in relation to all relevant criteria, the proceeding in which counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness allegedly occurred was an \u201cordinary sentencing\u201d in which <em>Strickland </em>instructs that \u201ca different approach\u201d is appropriate. Counsel\u2019s failure to ask for a continuance in order to purge the presentence-investigation report of an alleged error did not deprive defendant-appellant of a substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him. <em>Lockhart. </em>Indeed, counsel brought the error to the court\u2019s attention. The court\u2019s somewhat equivocal response did not prejudice defendant-appellant, when the record amply demonstrates that the court relied on other facts and circumstances in relation to the discretion reposed on the court by R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 to arrive at the sentence it imposed. Ineffective assistance of counsel is therefore not demonstrated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
