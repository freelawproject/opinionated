The magistrate has recommended that this court issue the requested writ of mandamus. The employer has filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, and the matter is now before this court for independent review.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">{\u00b6 3} Initially, we note that the employer\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision represent the employer\u2019s first pleading filed in this court, as the employer did not file a brief before the magistrate. Consequently, the case is in a novel posture before the court. Perhaps because the employer did not file a companion brief to that filed by the commission before the magistrate, the employer now duplicates most of the arguments already set forth before the magistrate by the commission. These generally raise issues regarding relator\u2019s alleged abandonment of his employment with Super Lube due to alleged violations of Super Lube\u2019s written employee guidelines regarding ethical conduct, specifically handling of customer paperwork, employee time sheets, and use of company facilities to work on relator\u2019s personal vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">{\u00b6 4} The employer now re-presents its position that the conduct at issue constituted a voluntary abandonment of relator\u2019s position \"with Super Lube. We find that the magistrate has completely and definitively addressed these arguments, concluding that in most instances, the employer has mischaracterized inefficiency as dishonesty and has failed to substantiate allegations of theft against relator. There is nothing in the stipulated record or the employer\u2019s argument in support of objections that establishes error in the magistrate\u2019s analysis of the facts or application of the pertinent law.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">{\u00b6 5} We therefore find, following our independent review pursuant to Civ.R. 53, that the magistrate has properly determined the pertinent facts and applied the relevant law thereto. The employer\u2019s objections are overruled, and this court adopts the magistrate\u2019s decision as its own, including the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained therein. The requested writ of mandamus is granted, ordering the commission to vacate its staff hearing officer\u2019s order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>April 4, 2006, which grants Super Lube\u2019s December 13, 2005 motion to terminate TTD compensation, and to enter an order denying Super Lube\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-6\">Tyack, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b98-7\">Sadler, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b98-8\">Deshler, J., retired, of the Tenth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b98-9\">Sadler, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A8c\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">{\u00b6 6} I agree that Super Lube has waived the arguments contained in its objections because it failed to raise them before the magistrate. <em>State ex rel. Hackenburg v. Indus. Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 06AP-938, 2007-Ohio-4181, 2007 WL 2327105, \u00b6 4. Thus, I, too, would overrule them. However, because I perceive error on the face of the magistrate\u2019s decision, I would reject its legal conclusions, pursuant to Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(c). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">{\u00b6 7} The September 13, 2005 termination letter advised relator that a work order \u201chad [his] signature and a date as having received monies from a customer. The work order was never converted into an invoice and the monies were not reported as shop revenue.\u201d Later, the letter states that relator admitted he had collected cash from that customer during relator\u2019s September 1-2, 2005 meetings with Tavakoli. The letter further states that this is a ground for dismissal. The letter constitutes some evidence supporting the SHO\u2019s conclusion that relator was fired for violation of a written work rule, given that Super Lube\u2019s employee handbook lists \u201ctheft of company property\u201d as a dischargeable offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">{\u00b6 8} The magistrate quarrels with the fact that the letter did not use the specific word \u201ctheft\u201d and concludes that \u201cit is difficult to see how the letter supports a finding that relator was fired for theft or that he committed theft.\u201d However, in my view, collecting a cash payment owed to Super Lube from a customer and never turning it over to Super Lube, absent an explanation therefor, constitutes theft.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relator claimed he was unaware of the provisions of the employee handbook, but the staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) specifically found this to be not credible in light of the fact that relator was a store manager. The commission is the sole evaluator of the weight and credibility of evidence. <em>State ex rel. Strimbu v. Indus. Comm., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 173, 2005-Ohio-4386, 833 N.E.2d 286, \u00b6 10. The record supports the SHO\u2019s conclusion that appellant violated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>work rule prohibiting theft, and does not support any characterization of relator\u2019s conduct with respect to the missing cash as mere incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">{\u00b6 9} The magistrate cites <em>State ex rel. Commercial Metal Shearing v. Gustafson, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-1025, 2006-Ohio-5570, 2006 WL 3031185, in support of his conclusion that there is no evidence in the record to support the SHO\u2019s finding that relator committed theft. However, in that case, the injured worker called to indicate that he would be in to pick up his paycheck, and after waiting several minutes in the payroll officer\u2019s office, he opened her cabinet, which contained other sensitive business documents, and took his paycheck himself, instead of continuing to wait for her. We held that the commission did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the employer\u2019s contention that the injured worker had violated a work rule prohibiting theft and unauthorized use of company property because the termination letter revealed that the employer had fired the worker not because he took possession of his paycheck, but because of the manner in which he did so (i.e., reaching into a cabinet containing sensitive company documents). Therefore, <em>Gustafson </em>is inapposite to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">{\u00b6 10} In contrast, here, there is evidence in the record that relator was fired because he collected cash from a customer in exchange for repair work, but never turned the money over to his employer and never provided an explanation as to the missing money. In my view, then, the record contains some evidence supporting the commission\u2019s order, and the commission did not abuse its discretion in concluding that relator voluntarily abandoned his employment. For these reasons, I would reject the magistrate\u2019s conclusions of law and deny the requested writ of mandamus. Because the majority does not share this view, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">IN MANDAMUS</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">{\u00b6 11} In this original action, relator, Joseph Goff, requests a writ of mandamus ordering respondent Industrial Commission of Ohio to vacate its order granting the employer\u2019s December 13, 2005 motion to terminate temporary total disability (\u201cTTD\u201d) compensation on grounds that relator voluntarily abandoned his employment, and to enter an order denying the employer\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">Findings of Fact:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">{\u00b6 12} 1. Relator has an industrial claim that is allowed for \u201ccervical strain; thoracic strain and a concussion\u201d and is assigned claim number 05-341551. The recognized date of injury is May 4, 2005. On that date, relator was employed by respondent Super Lube Inc., a state-fund employer. Relator was employed as the manager of a Super Lube automobile repair shop located in Westlake, Ohio. That Super Lube shop was owned and operated by Fred Tavakoli.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>{\u00b6 13} 2. Relator filed his industrial claim against Super Lube on May 10, 2005. Super Lube contested the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">{\u00b6 14} 3. Initially, the claim was disallowed by the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation and relator administratively appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">{\u00b6 15} 4. Following a July 1, 2005 hearing, a district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) issued an order allowing the claim and awarding TTD compensation from May 5, 2005, through the date of hearing and to continue upon submission of appropriate medical evidence. The DHO\u2019s order states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">The District Hearing Officer watched a DVD surveillance taken by the employer of the injured worker on 05/18/2005. That surveillance shows the injured worker using a motorized weed wacker around his yard. That tape does not show the injured worker lifting anything heavy, bending awkwardly or in anyway working at activity inconsistent with the receipt of temporary total disability compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">{\u00b6 16} 5. Following a September 14, 2005 hearing, a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) issued an order affirming the DHO\u2019s order of July 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">{\u00b6 17} 6. Earlier, on September 1, 2005, relator went to a Super Lube store where he recorded conversations between himself and Tavakoli. The next day, relator returned to the Super Lube store and again recorded conversations between himself and Tavakoli.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">{\u00b6 18} 7. By letter dated September 13, 2005, Tavakoli informed relator that he was terminated from his employment at Super Lube. The body of the September 13, 2005 letter states in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">To recap our meeting of Friday, September 2, 2005, you were asked to explain the discrepancies involving two invoices and one work order. In the case of the invoices, both showed the customer had been charged for new parts to be installed on their cars. Both customers told me they returned to your shop several times with complaints that they were experiencing the same problem as before having the work done. In both cases, they informed me you inspected these cars and told them there was nothing wrong with the work done and the symptoms were unrelated to the original work. The work order shown to you had your signature and a date as having received monies from a customer. The work order was never converted into an invoice and the monies were not reported as shop revenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-12\">Regarding the two invoices with new parts charges, you agreed that the parts that were retrieved from the customers [sic] cars were not the new parts for which the customers were invoiced. Your explanation was that you gave the technicians the new parts and you couldn\u2019t help it if they did not install them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>on the car as instructed. When questioned about your failure to discover the error when the customers returned with complaints, you had no explanation. Regarding the work order that had not been converted to an invoice and the monies never reported as shop revenue, you verified that the signature on the work order was yours and that you had collected the money. Your explanation was that the customer\u2019s check did not clear with Certegy so you held the check until the customer returned with cash. However, an invoice was never created to report the transaction and neither the check nor the cash were deposited as shop revenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">These are not isolated incidents as your personnel file contains other incidents of this nature about which you were notified. This pattern of discrepancies indicates you are grossly incompetent to perform your duties as a manager because you have consistently failed to properly oversee the work of the technicians reporting directly to you and you failed to diagnose the problems when the customers returned with complaints. Additionally, there have been financial discrepancies in your dealings with our customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">Either of these scenarios is grounds for dismissal and, as such, your employment with Super-Lube &amp; Brake has been terminated, effective September 2, 2005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">{\u00b6 19} 8. On December 13, 2005, Super Lube moved to terminate TTD compensation on grounds that the termination constituted a voluntary abandonment of employment under <em>State ex rel. Louisiana-Pacific Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 401, 650 N.E.2d 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">{\u00b6 20} In support of its motion, the employer submitted nine exhibits identified as follows: (1) September 13, 2005 termination letter, (2) invoice dated November 20, 2004, (3) invoice dated April 6, 2005, (4) invoice dated September 28, 2004, (5) timesheet, (6) invoice dated December 23, 2005, (7) invoice dated August 11, 2005, (8) invoice dated July 27, 2004, and (9) invoice dated February 5, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">{\u00b6 21} 9. Super Lube\u2019s motion was heard by a DHO on February 15, 2006. At the hearing, Super Lube submitted pages two and 15 taken from Super Lube\u2019s employee handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">{\u00b6 22} Page two of the handbook lists 17 items under \u201cA. General Code of Ethic.\u201d Items numbered six and nine state: \u201cBe honest\u201d and \u201cDo not use company resources for your own gain under any circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Page 15 of the handbook states in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">B. Dismissals</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Employees must be dismissed immediately under following circumstances}:]</p>\n<p id=\"Aa5\">[One] \u2014 Theft of company property.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>* <em>* </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">[Six]' \u2014 Not following Super-Lube Brake &amp; Mufflers general code of ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">{\u00b6 23} Hand-drawn arrows are drawn towards items numbered one and six, but not towards the remaining five items listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">{\u00b6 24} 10. Following the February 15, 2006 hearing, the DHO issued an order granting Super Lube\u2019s motion. The DHO\u2019s order explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">It is the order of the District Hearing Officer that the C-86 Motion filed by Employer on 12/13/2005 is granted to the extent of this order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">Temporary total disability compensation is terminated as of the date of notice to claimant of his termination for cause, 09/14/2005. Claimant\u2019s firing for financial discrepancies and failure to oversee work of technicians under him are unrelated to the injures in this claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">The weight of the evidence documented in the motion\u2019s exhibits leads the District Hearing Officer to rule that the termination for cause was more than a retaliatory firing; claimant\u2019s conduct and work rule violations lead [sic] to employment termination. A voluntary departure from employment under State ex rel. Louisiana-Pacific Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio (1995) 72 Ohio St3d is found to have occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">{\u00b6 25} 11. Relator administratively appealed the DHO\u2019s order of February 15, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">{\u00b6 26} 12. Relator\u2019s appeal was heard by an SHO on April 4, 2006. At the hearing, relator submitted a transcript of his conversations with Tavakoli on September 1 and 2, 2005. The transcript is contained in the stipulated record before this court. The magistrate notes that the transcriber frequently indicates that the recording is inaudible.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">{\u00b6 27} 13. The April 4, 2006 hearing before the SHO was recorded and transcribed for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">{\u00b6 28} 14. Following the April 4, 2006 hearing, the SHO issued an order vacating the DHO\u2019s order of February 15, 2006, but nevertheless granting Super Lube\u2019s motion to terminate TTD compensation. The SHO\u2019s order of April 4, 2006 explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-15\">The Staff Hearing Officer finds that, as of 09/15/2005, the Injured Worker is ineligible to receive Temporary Total Disability Compensation due to a voluntary abandonment of his employment with the named Employer. The Staff Hearing Officer finds that on 09/13/2005, the Employer wrote a letter to the Injured Worker in which he was terminated. The basis of this termination was the Injured Worker\u2019s failure to explain various inconsistencies in invoices for work done at the Employer\u2019s automobile repair shop. The Injured Worker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>was the manager of this particular shop. The Staff Hearing Officer also finds that the transcript of conversations between Mr. Tavakoli and the Injured Worker on 09/01/2005 and 09/02/0005 helps to prove the Employer\u2019s allegation that the Injured Worker was terminated due to the invoice irregularities and other employment related items as opposed to this being a retaliatory firing relating to the filing of the instant Workers\u2019 Compensation claim. The Staff Hearing Officer finds that the firing was due to a violation of the Employer\u2019s written work rules which set forth termination as a consequence for theft from the Employer and failure to follow the Employer\u2019s general ethical code. This ethical code required all employees to be honest in their dealings with regard to the Employer\u2019s business. The Staff Hearing Officer finds that the Employer has proved that the Injured Worker\u2019s termination was due to a violation of these written work rules and that the Injured Worker should have been on notice that termination was a possible consequence of violation of these rules. The Injured Worker indicated that he was not aware of the Employee\u2019s Handbook. The Staff Hearing Officer does not find this to be credible in light of the fact that the Injured Worker was the manager of one of the Employer\u2019s automobile repair locations. The Staff Hearing Officer finds that the Injured Worker should have been on notice of the contents of the Employee\u2019s Handbook.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">The Staff Hearing Officer, therefore, finds that the Injured Worker is ineligible to receive Temporary Total Disability Compensation as of 09/15/2005, the date after the last Staff Hearing Officer\u2019s hearing on the issue of the payment of Temporary Total Disability Compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">{\u00b6 29} 15. On April 29, 2006, another SHO mailed an order refusing relator\u2019s administrative appeal from the SHO\u2019s order of April 4, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">{\u00b6 30} 16. On October 16, 2006, relator, Joseph Goff, filed this mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Conclusions of Law:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">{\u00b6 31} It is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court issue a writ of mandamus, as more fully explained below.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">{\u00b6 32} In <em>Louisiana-Pacific, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 403, 650 N.E.2d 469, the claimant was fired for violating the employer\u2019s policy prohibiting three consecutive unexcused absences. The court held that the claimant\u2019s discharge was voluntary, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">[W]e find it difficult to characterize as \u201cinvoluntary\u201d a termination generated by the claimant\u2019s violation of a written work rule or policy that (1) clearly defined the prohibited conduct, (2) had been previously identified by the employer as a dischargeable offense, and (3) was known or should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>known to the employee. Defining such an employment separation as voluntary comports with <em>[State ex rel. Ashcraft v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 42, 517 N.E.2d 533] and <em>[State ex rel. Watts v. Schottenstein Stores Corp. </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 118, 623 N.E.2d <em>1202] </em>\u2014 i.e., that an employee must be presumed to intend the consequences of his or her voluntary acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">{\u00b6 33} In <em>State ex rel. McKnabb v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 559, 561, 752 N.E.2d 254, the court held that the rule or policy supporting an employer\u2019s voluntary abandonment claim must be written. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahp\">Now at issue is <em>Louisianar-Pacific\u2019s </em>reference to a <em>written </em>rule or policy. Claimant considers a written policy to be an absolute prerequisite to precluding [Temporary Total Disability Compensation] TTC. The commission disagrees, characterizing Louisiana-Pacific\u2019s language as merely illustrative of a TTCpreclusive firing. We favor claimant\u2019s position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">The commission believes that there are common-sense infractions that need not be reduced to writing in order to foreclose TTC if violation triggers termination. This argument, however, contemplates only some of the considerations. Written rules do more than just define prohibited conduct. They set forth a standard of enforcement as well. Verbal rules can be selectively enforced. Written policies help prevent arbitrary sanctions and are particularly important when dealing with employment terminations that may block eligibility for certain benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">{\u00b6 34} Here, the SHO\u2019s order of April 4, 2006, finds that relator was fired from Super Lube for theft in violation of a written work rule providing that \u201c[t]heft of company property\u201d is a dischargeable offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">{\u00b6 35} Earlier in the order, the SHO states reliance upon a \u201ctranscript of conversations between Mr. Tavakoli and the Injured Worker on 09/01/2005 and 09/02/0005\u201d to support the SHO\u2019s finding that the termination was not retaliatory for the filing of a workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">{\u00b6 36} Earlier in the order, the SHO states that the September 13, 2005 termination letter indicates that \u201c[t]he basis of this termination was the Injured Worker\u2019s failure to explain various inconsistencies in invoices for work done at the Employer\u2019s automobile repair shop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">{\u00b6 37} However, the SHO never explains how a \u201cfailure to explain various inconsistencies in invoices\u201d constitutes or proves theft. Moreover, the SHO\u2019s stated reliance upon the transcript fails to explain how it can be found that relator committed theft of company property.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">{\u00b6 38} The termination letter of September 13, 2005, does not mention the word theft. In the second to last paragraph of the letter, Tavakoli concludes that relator is \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d to perform his duties as a manager and \u201c[a]ddi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>tionally, there have been financial discrepancies.\u201d The last paragraph of the letter concludes that \u201c[ejither of these scenarios is grounds for dismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">{\u00b6 39} Thus, the termination letter, by its own terms, presents two reasons for dismissal \u2014 gross incompetence and the financial discrepancies. Nowhere in the termination letter is relator directly accused of theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">{\u00b6 40} Yet the SHO\u2019s order of April 4, 2006 finds that relator was terminated for theft. The SHO\u2019s order fails to explain how the termination letter shows that relator was terminated for theft or that relator committed theft. Moreover, it is difficult to see how the letter supports a finding that relator was fired for theft or that he committed theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">{\u00b6 41} During Tavakoli\u2019s direct examination, his counsel questioned him as to the relevance of each of the nine exhibits that Super Lube had submitted with its motion filed December 13, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">{\u00b6 42} Exhibit number two is identified as \u201cinvoice dated 11/20/04.\u201d The customer on the invoice is Georgetta Williams. During Tavakoli\u2019s direct examination, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">Q. * * * Can you tell me what Exhibit 2 refers to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">A. Yes. This is a tune-up that was done on this car. This is a very difficult car to work on because the rear spark plugs are hard to get to, and they had completely missed half of this tune-up. What they had [billed] was not really what went on this car. I do have the parts from this car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">Q. Did you confront Mr. Goff with regard to that problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-11\">A. We had called him on this. We had called him. This customer actually called us when he was still employed by us, but we didn\u2019t see this car until after he had left, but they had done work over again on this car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-12\">Q. Do you recall if he explained who he felt was at fault for failing to complete that job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-13\">A. He didn\u2019t say. He did not say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-14\">Q. Could you tell in the invoice if Mr. Vito was the mechanic on that job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-15\">A. It looks like Mike, and I don\u2019t know which Mike because we had several Mikes, but this is by \u2014 it\u2019s supposed to be the technician in the right-hand corner. It\u2019s quite possible that it was him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-16\">Q. As the manager of the Super Lube, was Mr. Goffs responsibility to make sure that job was performed correctly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-17\">A. Any job should be done correctly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-18\">{\u00b6 43} Exhibit number three is identified as \u201cinvoice dated 04/06/05.\u201d The customer is Ulysses Pearson. During Tavakoli\u2019s direct examination, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Q. Could you tell us about Exhibit 3, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">A. Exhibit 3 is the brake job that was done, front and the rear of this vehicle, both front and back. This customer called me and he said \u2014 well, he didn\u2019t call. He went to American Express and wanted the refund. He wrote a letter to American Express, I believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">Q. And was a refund provided?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">A. Well, yeah. Well, we told him we\u2019re not going to give him a refund until we have the old parts back and sure enough, we got the old parts back, which I have. And he also said that he had taken it back to our shop several times asking Joe to check it to make sure everything was okay because it was still making the noises. So apparently the rear brake pads were never installed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">{\u00b6 44} Exhibit number four is identified as \u201cinvoice dated 9/28/04.\u201d The customer is Juliette Collins. During Tavakoli\u2019s direct examination, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">Q. There is also \u2014 at end of that paragraph it states that the work order was never converted into an invoice, and the monies were not reported as shop revenue. What are you referring to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">A. There is a ticket. This here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">Q. That\u2019s Exhibit 4?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-12\">A. The page here, and this is a work order, and there is no invoice for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-13\">Q. Do you know if this money was ever paid to Super Lube?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-14\">A. I\u2019m not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-15\">Q. Do you know what happened to that money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-17\">Q. Did it show as being contained in the receipts for that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-18\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-19\">{\u00b6 45} Exhibit number six is identified as \u201cinvoice dated 12-23-05.\u201d The customer is Donald Schettine. During Tavakoli\u2019s direct examination, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-20\">Q. Let\u2019s move on to Exhibit 6. There was a gentleman named Donald Shelling [sic]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-21\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-22\">Q. Do you recall what occurred with this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-23\">A. This car, they put a timing belt and a water pump on it, and I guess they butchered this car so badly that we had to pay several hundred dollars. I think we had to pay $1800. We had to refund the customer. It was just a job not done right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Q. And is the manager responsible to check on what those technicians are going?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">A. Absolutely. Test driving, get it done, test drive it. All of that. Incidentally, I didn\u2019t realize it until now, but this says this job was done by Joe himself, or maybe Jose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">{\u00b6 46} Exhibit number seven is identified as \u201cinvoice dated 8-11-05.\u201d The customer is Pierre Richards. During Tavakoli\u2019s direct examination, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">Q. All right. Let\u2019s go to Exhibit 7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">A. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">Q. Incident involving Ms. Richard [sic]? Can you tell us what happened in this situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">A. This one here she brought her \u2014 oh, this one here came back that we had to completely redo all of her brakes for her, and the technician who was in charge of redoing this job claims that this was never done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">Q. The original services were never performed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-12\">A. That\u2019s what he claimed. He claimed that the original ones were never done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-13\">Q. And who would be responsible to oversee that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-14\">A. That\u2019s Joe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">{\u00b6 47} Exhibit number eight is identified as \u201cinvoice dated 7-27-04.\u201d The customer is Cathy Gigueroa. During Tavakoli\u2019s direct examination, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-16\">Q. Exhibit 8, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-17\">A. Exhibit 8, I was involved with because she was kind of a mutual customer in a way, but she came in and brought her own struts and they had installed the struts. She had a tremendous knocking noise in front of her car. She called me and said, I\u2019ve been back to Joe three times and he tells me that there is nothing wrong with it, but this car is clunking so badly in the front, and I said, Okay and I called Joe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-18\">Joe said, Oh, yeah Fred, I test drove it. This is beautiful. No problem. There is not a problem with this car. So I told the customer, Well, bring it in. Let\u2019s get a second opinion. Let\u2019s look at it. So she brought it in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-19\">I didn\u2019t even have to move this car ten feet. There is something like almost like falling out of the front of the car. So when we pull it in, the strut we found were installed incorrectly. The brake hose was scratched so badly that it was about to break any time. We\u2019re talking about safety issues and all he had to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>do was put it on the lift and take a look at this thing before it would come to a head. That\u2019s all he had to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">Q. I take it you had to make the proper repairs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">A. Well, we had to give her a strut. We had to change one of the struts out, yes. At no charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">{\u00b6 48} During the April 4, 2006 hearing, Tavakoli did not discuss or testify about exhibit nine which is identified as \u201cinvoice dated 2-05-05.\u201d The customer on that invoice is Dion Jackson. Tavakoli stated that \u201cMary\u201d would explain exhibit nine, but Mary never testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">{\u00b6 49} However, during relator\u2019s direct examination, the following exchange occurred regarding exhibit nine between relator\u2019s counsel and relator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">Q. Number 9?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">A. Number 9. This was a typical dealing with a customer in this area. An old worn car. The customer came in. We did an inspection. We talked to the customer, gave him an estimate. Said it would be so much dollars. He said okay, left the car, do the work. He went and got a sandwich, or whatever. Came back to pick the car up, and when I put his invoice on the screen and asked him for payment, he got all his money and didn\u2019t have enough money. So the only thing I could do is he had no money, no other means. Just like Fred told me before, take the matter, make it work do something. We were making a lot of money on the gentleman with our work. I had to discount him down a little bit to make the money he had fit because I can\u2019t let him owe or nothing. There is no payment plan or nothing. So I discount his bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">In the process of doing that, I printed a copy of the original work order then when I did the discount on my screen and went to the next screen and printed it as an invoice, it had a different amount. I turned in both invoices at the end of the night accidentally, and when I added up my totals for the end of the night, naturally they were off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-12\">I put money out of my pocket into the deposit mistakenly in a hurry, because I thought I either lost money, misplaced it, paid out money and then tried to miscount it or something. I thought I made a mistake. So I put money out of my pocket into the deposit. When Mary caught the discrepancy, she called me up and said, There is too much money, or What happened here? You have two invoices and I go, Oh, that\u2019s what happened to my money. And she took it as I stole it. I didn\u2019t steal the money. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">{\u00b6 50} The magistrate has carefully reviewed the transcript of the April 4, 2006 hearing and the exhibits submitted. The magistrate finds no evidence in the record to support the SHO\u2019s finding that relator committed theft of company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>property. See <em>State ex rel. Commercial Metal Shearing v. Gustafson, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-1025, 2006-Ohio-5570, 2006 WL 3031185.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">{\u00b6 51} The SHO also found that relator had violated Super Lube\u2019s general code of ethic, which requires that the employee \u201c[b]e honest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">{\u00b6 52} While it can be said that a person who commits theft is also dishonest, this finding of dishonesty does not appear to be based on facts separate from the SHO\u2019s theft finding. Moreover, the term is not defined by the employee\u2019s handbook and suffers from such vagueness that it cannot support a ground, under these circumstances, for a voluntary abandonment. And again, the termination letter itself never accuses relator of dishonesty or of violating the written work rule commanding that the employee \u201c[b]e honest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">{\u00b6 53} Given the above analysis, the magistrate finds that the commission has abused its discretion in finding that relator voluntarily abandoned his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">{\u00b6 54} Accordingly, it is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court issue a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate its SHO\u2019s order of April 4, 2006, that grants Super Lube\u2019s December 13, 2005 motion to terminate TTD compensation and to enter an order denying Super Lube\u2019s motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-13\">. Relator was given an opportunity to explain why the monies he collected on behalf of the employer were not turned in to Super Lube, but no explanation was given.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
