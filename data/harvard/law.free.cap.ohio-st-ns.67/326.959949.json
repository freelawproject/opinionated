The allegations of the petition in substance are: The proper petition for the establishment of said district was filed, and due notice was given to the members of the boards of education of a joint meeting to take action thereon. Pursuant to said notice, and at the time designated, there assembled at the joint meeting eleven of the twenty members of the Greenville township board, and seven of tbe nine members of the Van Bur\u00e9n township board. The meeting was organized as an independent body by the election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>of a president- and clerk. Upon tlie proposition to establish the snbdistrict in accordance with the prayer of the petition, ten who were members of the Greenville board, and two who were members of the Van Bur\u00e9n board, voted in favor of the proposition, thereupon the chairman declared that the proposition carried, and proceedings were undertaken upon the assumption that the action was valid to create the sub-district. The petition also alleges that the school facilities previously provided in the two townships were adequate to meet the wants of the children of school age. In the common pleas a demurrer to the petition was overruled, and a peremptory injunction was granted. On a petition in error the circuit court reversed the judgment, sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the petition, rendering judgment against the plaintiff for costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-6\"><em>Mr. A.

Chapter 5 is devoted wholly to the establishment, maintenance, alteration and dissolution of joint subdistricts. The proceedings had in this instance were supposed to be, and, we think, clearly were, authorized by this, and the succeeding sections of the chapter. These sections contemplate that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>agreement failing, the members of the several boards, interested shall constitute a special body for the consideration of the subject. Since the statute makes, no different requirement, a majority of the body is a quorum, and a majority of the quorum may act. This view of the statute need not be rejected from fear of abuse by the preponderating vote of the membelrs from a larger township. What the legislature has evidently regarded as a safe precaution against such possible abuse is found in a timely remonstrance to be filed with the probate judge. The action of the joint board provisionally established the joint subdistrict, and the statute pointed out a mode of procedure to be pursued by any who are dissatisfied therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">It may be that the case would, upon consideration of the question, be found to be within the familiar rule that there can be no resort to equity when legal remedies are adequate, and further that the plaintiff\u2019 is without capacity to maintain the present action, but the point decided justifies the judgment of the circuit court and it will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\n<em>eJudgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b381-8\">Btjrket, C.
