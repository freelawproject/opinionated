For our present purpose the other allegations contained in the petition may be disregarded. A demurrer on the ground that the petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendants, was sustained by the court of common pleas, and the plaintiff not desiring to plead further, judgment was rendered for the defendants. The circuit court, on a petition in error, affirmed the judgment of the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">It is contended here by the defendants in error, and it was so held by the courts below, that although the county roads established in 1817 and 1893, respectively, may constitute one continuous road in fact, yet they are separate and distinct roads in law; and that the road established in 1893 is \u201cunconnected\u201d with the proposed free turnpike, and therefore is within the exception in Section 4786, Revised Statutes, which reads as follows: \u201cExtra taxes, when levied as hereinbefore provided, shall be on real and personal property within one mile on each side of the free turnpike road, except where any road improvement of free turnpike road, or any toll road, or unimproved state or county road, being unconnected with the same, runs upon either side of such proposed road, within less than two miles, then the extra taxes shall only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>levied upon such lands and personal property as lie within one-half the distance of such roads.\u201d It is also urged that the judgment below is sustained by <em>Lear </em>v. <em>Halstead, </em>41 Ohio St., 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The exception in section 4786 does not apply in case of a county road which is only unconnected with the proposed road, but to a county road, Avhich, \u201cbeing-unconnected AA'ith the same, <em>runs upon either side </em>of such proposed road.\u201d By the expression \u201cruns upon either side,\u201d the legislature clearly meant to designate roads which run along, and not across, the proposed road. It Avas intended to specify roads Avhich, in a general sense, run parallel with the proposed road. With such, and with such only, it is practicable that the \u201cextra taxes shall only be levied upon such lands and personal property as lie Avithin one-half the distance of such roads,\u201d that is, one-half the distance <em>between </em>such roads. The statute does not contemplate the division of territory betAveen the point of termination of one road and the line of the proposed road; nor between the line of the proposed road and the line of a road crossing it. The opposite construction would be putting something into the language of the statute which is not there. So that the meaning of the statute, as well as the meaning of this court, Avhen it uses the words of the statute in <em>Lear </em>v. <em>Halstead, </em>is that a road which runs in the same general direction as, or approximately parallel with, the proposed road, is a road which \u201cruns upon the side of the proposed road,\u201d and that a road located on either side of the proposed road, which runs perpendicularly, or practically so, to the proposed turnpike, is not a road which \u201cruns upon the side\u201d of the latter. If anything more is needed to make this construction clear, a reference to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the original section (72 O. L., 93, section 8, and 73 O. L., 96, section 8), and a study of its provisions will be suggestive. It was there provided that when any free turnpike in process of construction shall cross a free turnpike road either completed or in process of construction, then the lands and property on either side of where such free turnpike cross each other shall be assessed and taxed in proportion to benefits, etc.; but there was not then, nor has there ever been, any exception as to any unimproved state or county road crossing the proposed turnpike, and there is none now in regard to any road of any kind crossing the proposed road. The commissioners were, therefore, in error when they limited the taxing district as they did in this case, whether the county roads be regarded as a continuous road crossing the proposed turnpike, or whether the county road established in 1893 be regarded as a distinct road, running in a direction approximately perpendicular to the line of the turnpike. The plaintiff does not show in his petition for injunction that a majority of the landholders, residing in the county, who own lands within the bounds of the turnpike, petitioned for it; but it does appear that taxable property which should have been within the taxing district was excluded, and the plaintiff was thereby proportionately injured. \u201cTo any extent that one man is compelled to pay in order to relieve others of a public burden properly resting upon them, his property is taken for private purposes, as plainly and as palpably as it would be if appropriated to tire payment of the debts or the discharge of obligations which the persons thus relieved by his payments might owe to private parties.\u201d Cooley on Taxation. 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The judgments of the circuit court and of the court of common pleas are therefore reversed, and the cause remanded to the court of common pleas for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-6\">Burket, C.
