The incident was more specifically described this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-9\">Place of violation was the inmate dining hall, service line. The plaintiff(s) were proceeding thru the line and requested not to handle the meat of the meal, pork, yet a direct order by defendant, Lt. Foster Andrews, was given to \u201cplace the meat, pork on your tray.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">The Magistrate recommended dismissal of the suit on the ground that there were no allegations that the absence of a special dietary menu had resulted in malnutrition, and that plaintiffs were not entitled to special diets if adequate nourishment could be obtained by them from other foods not objectionable to them on religious grounds. The court adopted the findings and conclusions of the Magistrate and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">The complaint relates not to dietary issues but to the manner in which the food was served to the inmates, requiring them to be in contact with pork. Other courts have dealt with Muslims\u2019 objections to contact with pork. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Pickett, </em>586 F.2d 22, 26 (CA7, 1978); <em>Finney v. Hutto, </em>410 F.Supp. 251, 270 (E.D.Ark., 1976) aff\u2019d on other grounds, 548 F.2d 740 (CA8, 1977), aff\u2019d 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">Petitioners did not fail to state a claim on which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
