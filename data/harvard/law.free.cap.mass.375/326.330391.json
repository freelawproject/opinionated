L. c. 64H on the rental of certain rubbish containers. The taxpayer\u2019s business was rubbish removal. Three methods were used to collect rubbish from customers: (1) the manual emptying into the taxpayer\u2019s trucks of conventional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>barrels and the like; (2) the pick-up of rubbish with hydraulic front-end and rear-end loaders; and (3) the \u201croll-off\u201d method which gave rise to this controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Roll-off customers were provided by the taxpayer with special containers for the deposit of their trash. These weighed 4,000 pounds empty, were five feet high, eight feet wide, and twenty-two feet long, and held twenty-five cubic yards of matter. Trucks appropriately equipped would come to carry away full containers and replace them with empties. Sometimes a container would be emptied and then returned to the same customer, but the containers did not have any individually identifying characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Customers using the roll-off method received monthly invoices listing two charges. One charge, termed \u201cslips,\u201d was a variable figure representing the sum of charges for the month\u2019s pick-ups and disposals. The other monthly charge was deemed a \u201cservice\u201d charge by the taxpayer (and was specified as \u201ccontainer service charge\u201d on an invoice to be found among the exhibits). The latter charge was held by the State Tax Commission to be one for rental of the roll-off containers on which the taxpayer should have collected and remitted sales tax under the following provisions of law: G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 2, imposing an excise \u201cupon sales at retail of tangible personal property\u201d; and \u00a7 1 (12) <em>(a) </em>defining \u201csale\u201d to include \u201c[a]ny transfer of title or possession, or both, exchange, barter, lease, rental, conditional or otherwise, of tangible personal property for a consideration, in any manner or by any means whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The taxing authorities\u2019 view of the question was first stated in 1967 in response to a request by the Massachusetts Rubbish Haulers Association for a ruling. The then Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation assumed the facts of the roll-off method just described, and responded that a separate charge \u201cfor the use of the container ... is taxable under the sales and use tax law and the haulers are required to collect the tax thereon. If, however, there is only one charge for the container, transportation and dumping with no separation thereof, the charge would not be subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>tax. The container charge incorporated therein would be exempt under [G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1 (13)] as an inconsequential [sales] element [of an essentially personal service transaction] for which no separate charge is made.\u201d The precise statutory text referred to was that part of \u00a7 1 (13) which states that \u201c[s]ale at retail\u201d shall not include <em>\u201c(c) </em>. . . personal service transactions which involve . . . sales as inconsequential elements for which no separate charges are made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Accordingly, when the present taxpayer elected not to make a single comprehensive charge and failed from April, 1966, through September, 1973, to collect and pay over sales taxes on the separate so called \u201cservice\u201d charge to its customers, the State Tax Commission (commission) sent notice of intention to assess $16,227.36 of taxes, interest, and penalties. The taxpayer paid the assessment and duly filed applications for abatement. Abatement was denied by the commission on November 8, 1974, and, on appeal, by the Appellate Tax Board (board) in October, 1976. The case, including the board\u2019s findings, report, and opinion of August 1, 1977, comes to this court by direct appeal under G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. Here the taxpayer renews three arguments against imposition of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">1. The board found that the \u201cservice\u201d charge was a separately stated charge for the rental of containers put into the customers\u2019 possession, and thus was subject to the tax. According to the taxpayer, there was no rental within the statute; it argues that the customer was interested only in enjoying a rubbish removal service, and the tangible property was supplied to him solely for the convenience of the service provider.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But even if that description of the customer\u2019s attitude is accurate, there was nothing to obviate the incidence of the tax where a discrete charge was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>for the tangible personal property. We then have a sale conforming to the terms of \u00a7 1 (12) <em>(a) </em>quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The three cases on which the taxpayer relies, cited in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> only point up that problems of characterization under a sales tax on tangible goods can arise only where a single charge is made integrating taxable (tangible goods) and nontaxable (service) elements. Where the seller has decided to charge separately for taxable goods, no considerations of fairness or administrative simplicity exist to relieve him of the consequences of his choice. Compare <em>Houghton Mifflin Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>373 Mass. 772, 774 (1977), where a single charge was made and \u201cthe services and the property [were] inseparable\u201d because the services created the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Similar to our case was <em>Chayet </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>367 Mass. 908 (1975), where the sales tax was held properly levied on charges for telephone equipment left with the taxpayer for which there was a billing separate from that for the telephone service which was tax free. Illustrative also is <em>In re S. Santini Storage Corp. </em>v. <em>Gerosa, </em>13 App. Div. 2d 762 (N.Y. 1961), where customers of a storage company, in addition to charges for the storage service, paid a separate charge for each wardrobe they used. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Because the wardrobes were subject to an invariable $1.50 apiece charge, whether or not delivered to the customer, sales tax was imposed in the absence of a \u201cshowing of any extra service in connection with\u201d these items. <em>Id. </em>at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The taxpayer also argues that its customers did not have \u201cpossession\u201d of the containers within the meaning of \u00a7 1 (12) <em>(a) </em>and the commission\u2019s regulation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and points to the fungibility of the containers and their fitness for use only in connection with the roll-off service. But the board\u2019s finding was otherwise as to possession, and it cannot be said that that was unwarranted as matter of law. See <em>Houghton Mifflin Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 774-775. There was control in the customer while the container was on his premises sufficient to make out a \u201cpossession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">2. Even if one does regard the \u201cservice\u201d charge as separate from the \u201cslips,\u201d still, argues the taxpayer, considering the former charge in and of itself, it was not made primarily for the rental of tangible property, and should fall within the exclusion of \u00a7 1 (13) (c) for personal service in which the sale element is inconsequential. The board adopted the taxpayer\u2019s requested finding that the \u201cservice\u201d charge was incurred for \u201cthe use of a container in good repair and maintenance and with a stand-by capability for the emptying of rubbish collected therein.\u201d We take it that the taxpayer would have us find as matter of law that the \u201cstand-by capability\u201d for rubbish disposal provided by the taxpayer was a personal service, compared with which the provision of the actual containers was inconsequential. On the contrary, the board had before it ample evidence on which to conclude that the container rental element of the separate charge was consequential, if not overwhelming. The 1967 ruling described the industry practice as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\u201cseparate charge for the use of the container.\u201d Three letters from the taxpayer\u2019s customers characterized the charge as \u201cfor rental of container.\u201d There was no evidence that customers who did not use the roll-off method paid any charge for a \u201cstand-by capability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">3. The taxpayer, which is a carrier under the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Utilities, says that the separate charge is to be brought within an exclusion from sales tax not yet quoted, that in \u00a7 1 (13) <em>(b) </em>for \u201csales of transportation or communication services.\u201d It argues in its brief that \u201call that a carrier does or provides\u201d is a transportation service, including \u201cthe provision of equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">It is enough to observe that no transportation was involved in the charge on which tax was imposed; all pick-up and removal elements fell under \u201cslips.\u201d See <em>Chayet </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, supra </em>at 909 (\u201c [t]he relevant statutes exempt telephone service . . . but not the sale of telephone equipment\u201d). See also the rejection of sweeping interpretations of sales tax exemptions for transportation services in <em>Schemmer </em>v. <em>Iowa State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>254 Iowa 315 (1962), and <em>Hooks </em>v. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>265 Md. 380 (1972). There is scant reason for thinking the Legislature meant to allow common carriers the unusual privilege of selling tangible personal property free of sales tax.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A definition of \u201cservices\u201d and \u201ctransportation\u201d contained in G. L. c. 159B (carriers of property by motor vehicle) is pressed on us. We doubt very much it encompasses the rental of rubbish containers to customers, but, even if it did, we would not easily transpose a definition mapping out a regulatory agency\u2019s jurisdiction to a controversy about a sales tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Tax Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\"> There is nothing in the record indicating why customers would opt for one removal method rather than another. Conceivably some customers found the roll-off containers cheaper and more convenient for themselves than other receptacles, and therefore chose roll-off service \u2014 in which case it would be inaccurate to state that the particular containers were used only for the convenience of the rubbish company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> See the following cited cases: <em>Undercofler </em>v. <em>Macon Linen Serv., Inc., </em>114 Ga.

Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>264 N.C. 12, 17 (1965) (tanks holding gas customers purchased were not rented by them because \u201ccustomers on whose premises [retailer] installed tanks make no . . . periodic payments\u201d for them); <em>San-A-Pure Dairy Co. </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>173 Ohio St. 469, 471 (1962) (\u201c[i]t is to be emphasized that [ice-cream sellers] were not billed and charged for the use of appellant\u2019s [freezer] equipment, and that they paid only the prevailing wholesale price for the ice cream they received\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">See also <em>Atlanta Americana Motor Hotel Corp. </em>v. <em>Undercofler, </em>222 Ga. 295, 300-301 (1966); <em>Machinery Moving, Inc. </em>v. <em>Porterfield, </em>26 Ohio St. 2d 99 (1971) (exempting roll-off rubbish containers because no separate charge was made for them); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benjamin Franklin Hotel Co., </em>28 Pa.
