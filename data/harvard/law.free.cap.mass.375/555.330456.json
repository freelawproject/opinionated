At the heart of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims is the argument that this court should abandon the so called \u201cimpact\u201d rule of <em>Spade </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston R.R., </em>168 Mass. 285, 290 (1897), which denies recovery for physical injuries arising solely from negligently caused mental distress. We agree that the rule of the <em>Spade </em>case should be abandoned. Our inquiry does not cease at that point, however, because we must determine what new limits of liability are appropriate and how those limits affect the plaintiffs\u2019 decedents, parents of a child alleged to have been injured by the defendants\u2019 negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">These appeals, transferred here on our own motion, come to us following the allowance of the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss for failure to state claims on which relief can be granted. Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). For the purpose of considering the propriety of the allowance of these motions, we summarize the allegations of each complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">On October 24, 1973, Norma Dziokonski, a minor, alighted from a motor vehicle, used as a school bus, on Route 117 in Lancaster.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That motor vehicle was owned by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the defendant Pelletier and operated by the defendant Kroll. A motor vehicle owned and operated by the defendant Babineau struck Norma as she was crossing the road. The complaints allege the negligence of each defendant on various grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The complaint filed by the administratrix of the estate of Lorraine Dziokonski (Mrs. Dziokonski) alleges that Mrs. Dziokonski was the mother of Norma and that she \u201clived in the immediate vicinity of the accident, went to the scene of the accident and witnessed her daughter lying injured on the ground.\u201d Mrs. Dziokonski \u201csuffered physical and emotional shock, distress and anguish as a result of the injury to her daughter and died while she was a passenger in the ambulance that was driving her daughter to the hospital.\u201d This complaint alleges one count for wrongful death and one count for conscious suffering against each of the three defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The complaint filed by the administratrix of the estate of Anthony Dziokonski (Mr. Dziokonski) alleged the facts previously set forth and added that he was the father of Norma and the husband of Mrs. Dziokonski. Mr. Dziokonski \u201csuffered an aggravated gastric ulcer, a coronary occlusion, physical and emotional shock, distress and anguish as a result of the injury to his daughter and the death of his wife and his death was caused thereby.\u201d This complaint similarly alleged a count for wrongful death and one count for conscious suffering against each of the three defendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>The Spade Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We start with an analysis of <em>Spade </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston R.R., </em>168 Mass. 285 (1897), which announced a principle of tort law that has been limited and refined by our subsequent decisions but not heretofore abandoned. Margaret Spade had been a passenger on a crowded car of the Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad Company late one Saturday night in February, 1895. She was so frightened by the negligent conduct of an employee of the defendant in removing an unruly passenger from the car that she sustained emotional shock and consequent physical injury. The trial judge instructed the jury that, when physical injury results from fear or nervous shock, \u201cthere may be a recovery for that bodily injury, and for all the pain, mental or otherwise, which may arise out of that bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287. The jury returned a verdict for Mrs. Spade, but this court held that the judge\u2019s charge misstated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">We acknowledged that fright might cause physical injury and that \u201cit is hard on principle\u201d to say why there should not be recovery even for the mental suffering caused by a defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 288. The court concluded, however, that \u201cin practice it is impossible satisfactorily to administer any other rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We noted that recovery for fright or distress of mind alone is barred and, that being so, there can be no recovery for physical injuries caused solely by mental disturbance. <em>Id. </em>at 290. It was said to be unreasonable to hold persons bound to anticipate and guard against fright and its consequences and thought that a contrary rule would \u201copen a wide door for unjust claims.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Subsequent Treatment of the Spade Rule in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Postal Tel. Cable Co., </em>174 Mass. 576, 577-578 (1899), which applied the Spade rule to a case involving a claim of gross negligence, Chief Justice Holmes, speaking for the court, said that the point decided in the <em>Spade </em>case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>\u201cis not put as a logical deduction from the general principles of liability in tort, but as a limitation of those principles upon purely practical grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Later, he described the Spade rule as \u201can arbitrary exception, based upon a notion of what is practicable.\u201d <em>Homans </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>180 Mass. 456, 457 (1902).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Consistently and from its inception, the Spade rule has not been applied to deny recovery where immediate physical injuries result from negligently induced fright or emotional shock. Thus, recovery has been allowed \u201c[wjhen the fright reasonably induces action which results in external injury.\u201d <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>182 Mass. 310, 312 (1902) (defendant\u2019s negligent blasting caused the plaintiff to faint and sustain physical harm). <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry., </em>299 Mass. 246, 250 (1938) (plaintiff\u2019s shoulder injured when she jumped to escape impending danger). <em>Gannon </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. </em>&amp; <em>H.R.R., </em>173 Mass. 40 (1899) (physical injuries sustained when plaintiff moved in fright to avoid injury). See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, </em>341 Mass. 216, 219-222 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Moreover, recovery for emotionally based physical injuries, sometimes described as \u201cparasitic claims,\u201d has been allowed in tort cases founded on traditional negligent impact. <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Gaffey, </em>207 Mass. 102, 105, 107 (1910). Thus, where the plaintiff sustained direct physical injuries as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence and the plaintiff also sustained paralysis, perhaps resulting solely from nervous shock, we did not require the plaintiff to prove that the nervous shock or paralysis was a consequence of the direct physical injuries. <em>Homans </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>180 Mass. 456, 458 (1902). We note that allowing recovery for emotionally based physical injuries unrelated to the physical consequences of the negligently caused impact also presents the threat of \u201cunjust claims\u201d <em>(Spade </em>v. <em>Lynn </em>&amp; <em>Boston R.R., supra </em>at 290), or, perhaps more exactly, the threat of exaggerated claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">We have declined to apply the Spade rule to workmen\u2019s compensation claims. See <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>633, 637 (1978), and cases cited. \u201cThe special reasons assigned in the <em>Spade </em>case for denying recovery have no application to workmen\u2019s compensation cases.\u201d <em>Charon\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 694, 697 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">We have never applied the Spade rule to bar recovery for intentionally caused emotional distress. The <em>Spade </em>opinion itself recognized that the result might be different if the defendant\u2019s conduct had been intentional and not negligent. <em>Spade </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston R.R., supra </em>at 290. <em>White </em>v. <em>Sander, </em>168 Mass. 296, 297 (1897). We left that question open in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Postal Tel. Cable Co., </em>174 Mass. 576, 578 (1899), and it so remained until 1971, when we decided <em>George </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co., </em>359 Mass. 244 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The <em>George </em>case involved allegations that, in their debt collection practices, the defendants intentionally caused emotional distress to the plaintiff and, as a result, her health deteriorated and she suffered two heart attacks. We held that \u201cone who, without a privilege to do so, by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally causes severe emotional distress to another, with bodily harm resulting from such distress, is subject to liability for such emotional distress and bodily harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255. We expressly left open the question now before us, whether there could be liability for negligent conduct causing emotional distress resulting in bodily injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The question of liability for intentionally or recklessly caused severe emotional distress in the absence of bodily harm came before us in Agis v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140 (1976). There, we held that a complaint alleging extreme, outrageous, and unprivileged conduct by the defendant stated a cause of action in favor of both the female plaintiff who sustained emotional distress but no bodily harm and her husband for loss of consortium. We rejected arguments that we should deny recovery for emotion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>al distress where there is no physical injury because of the insurmountable difficulties of proof and the danger of fraudulent or frivolous claims. Although we recognized these problems, we rejected them as an absolute bar in all such cases and concluded that these were proper matters for consideration by the trier of fact in the adversary, trial process. <em>Id. </em>at 143-144.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Although many industrial States initially required some impact as a basis for liability for physical harm resulting from fright, that rule has been abandoned in more recent times to the point where it has been said that \u201cthe courts which deny all remedy in such cases are fighting a rearguard action.\u201d W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 54, at 333 (4th ed. 1971). As we have already indicated, we think the Spade rule should be abandoned. The threat of fraudulent claims cannot alone justify the denial of recovery in all cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Whether a plaintiff\u2019s injuries were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligence and whether the defendant caused those injuries are best left to determination in the normal manner before the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Recovery for Injuries Arising from Concern over Harm to Another.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The abandonment of the Spade rule is only the beginning in the process of determining whether the complaints in these cases state valid claims for relief. The typical case involving physical harm resulting from emotional distress concerns a person who was put in fear for his own safety as a result of alleged negligence of the defendant. Here, neither Mr. nor Mrs. Dziokonsld was threatened with direct, contemporaneous injury as a result of the negligence of any defendant. Thus, we must consider the extent to which any defendant in this case may be held liable to the father or the mother, each of whom sustained physical injuries as a result of emotional distress over injuries incurred by their child.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The weight of authority in this country would deny recovery in these cases. W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 54, at 333 (4th ed. 1971). Annot., 29 A.L.R.3d 1337 (1970). Thus, as we fall back from the Spade rule, we could find comfort in numbers in denying recovery in these cases. We conclude, however, that we should not adopt a rule which absolutely denies recovery to every parent for whatever negligently caused, emotionally based physical injuries result from his concern over the safety of or injury to his injured child.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The arguments against imposing liability for a parent\u2019s injuries from shock and fear for his child have been stated clearly and forcefully in numerous opinions. See, e.g., <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Grossman, </em>24 N.Y.2d 609, 615-619 (1969); <em>Amaya </em>v. <em>Home Ice, Fuel &amp; Supply Co., </em>59 Cal. 2d 295 (1963); <em>Jelley </em>v. <em>LaFlame, </em>108 N.H. 471 (1968); <em>Waube </em>v. <em>War</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>rington, </em>216 Wis. 603 (1935). The reasons advanced for not permitting recovery are principally that (1) there is still a difficulty of proof of causation which has not been mitigated by any change in technology or medical science, (2) no logical justification exists for limiting recovery solely to parents who are affected physically by fear for the safety of an injured child, and (3) the extension of liability will impose an inordinate burden on defendants. In short, under this view, liability should be denied for injuries from shock and fear for another\u2019s safety regardless of (a) the relationship of the plaintiff to the accident victim, (b) the plaintiff\u2019s proximity to the accident, or (c) whether the plaintiff observed either the accident or its immediate consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Until 1968, the nearly unanimous weight of authority in this country denied recovery for emotionally based physical injuries resulting from concern for the safety of another where the plaintiff was not himself threatened with contemporaneous injury. W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 54, at 334 (4th ed. 1971). There was support for recovery where the plaintiff was himself threatened with direct bodily harm because of the defendant\u2019s conduct. This rule, known as the zone of danger test, is expressed in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 313 (2) (1965). It denies recovery for bodily harm \u201ccaused by emotional distress arising solely from harm or peril to a third person, unless the negligence of the actor has otherwise created an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to the . . . [plaintiff].\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Restatement rule was recommended with reluctance by the Reporter (Dean Prosser) and the advisers (Restatement [Second] of Torts 9-11 [Tent. Draft No. 5, I960]), but the recommendation was thought to be compelled by the absence of then recent authority in support of a contrary view. <em>Id. </em>As a result of adding \u00a7 313 (2), a caveat appearing in the first Restatement of Torts was deleted. That caveat had left open the question whether a person might be liable \u201cto the parent or spouse who witnesses the peril or harm of the child or spouse and thereby suffers anxiety or shock\u201d causing bodily harm to the parent or spouse. Restatement of Torts \u00a7 313, at 851 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>The \u201czone of danger\u201d rule has something to commend it as a measure of the limits of liability. It permits a relatively easy determination of the persons who might recover for emotionally caused bodily injury by including only those to whom contemporaneous bodily harm of some sort might reasonably have been foreseen. It is arguably reasonable to impose liability for the physical consequences of emotional distress where the defendant\u2019s negligent conduct might have caused physical injury by direct impact but did not. The problem with the zone of danger rule, however, is that it is an inadequate measure of the reasonable foreseeability of the possibility of physical injury resulting from a parent\u2019s anxiety arising from h\u00e1rm to his child. The reasonable foreseeability of such a physical injury to a parent does not turn on whether that parent was or was not a reasonable prospect for a contemporaneous injury because of the defendant\u2019s negligent conduct. Although the zone of danger rule tends to produce more reasonable results than the Spade rule and provides a means of limiting the scope of a defendant\u2019s liability, it lacks strong logical support.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In 1968, the Supreme Court of California, by a divided court (four to three), broke the solid ranks, overruled its decision in <em>Amaya </em>v. <em>Home Ice, Fuel &amp; Supply Co., </em>59 Cal. 2d 295 (1963), and held that a cause of action was properly stated on behalf of a mother, in no danger herself, who witnessed her minor daughter\u2019s death in a motor vehicle accident allegedly caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence, and who sustained emotional disturbance and shock to her nervous system which caused her physical and mental pain and suffering. <em>Dillon </em>v. Legg, 68 Cal. 2d 728 (1968). An intermediate appellate court in California has since applied the reasoning of <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg </em>to permit recovery by a mother who came on the scene of the accident but did not witness it. <em>Archibald </em>v. <em>Braverman, </em>275 Cal. App. 2d 253 (1969). That court said, \u201cManifestly, the shock of seeing a child severely injured immediately after the tortious event may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>just as profound as that experienced in witnessing the accident itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Some tendency toward allowing recovery seems to be developing. The Supreme Court of Rhode Island has reached the same conclusion as the California Supreme Court in <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg, </em>on substantially similar facts. <em>D\u2019Ambra </em>v. <em>United States, </em>114 R.I. 643 (1975). The results in these cases have the general support of commentators. See W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 54, at 334-335 (4th ed. 1971); 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Torts \u00a7 18.4, at 1035-1039 (1956). In <em>Leong </em>v. <em>Takasaki, </em>55 Haw. 398, 399 (1974), the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that a complaint stated a cause of action \u201cfor nervous shock and psychic injuries suffered without accompanying physical impact or resulting physical consequences\u201d when the plaintiff, a ten-year old boy, witnessed from a distance of several feet the death of his stepfather\u2019s mother who was struck by a motor vehicle driven by the defendant. In <em>Toms </em>v. <em>McConnell, </em>45 Mich. App. 647 (1973), the Michigan Court of Appeals held that a mother alleged a cause of action where, from outside the zone of danger, she saw her daughter struck by the defendant\u2019s vehicle after her daughter alighted from a school bus and, as a result, the mother sustained significant depression. The Supreme Court of Washington has construed a statute as authorizing recovery by a parent for mental anguish in cases involving the wrongful death of or injury to a child. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Lund, </em>80 Wash. 2d 91 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">It is not argued seriously here, nor has it been regularly a basis for decisions denying liability, that the threat of fraudulent claims requires the adoption of a rule denying recovery to a parent who sustains physical harm from distress over peril to his child. See, e.g., <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Grossman, </em>24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>N.Y.2d 609, 615-616 (1969). The facts of cases of this character involve tortious injury to the child and substantial physical consequences to the parent. The tortfeasor is not confronted with the results of a fleeting instance of fear or excitement of which he might be unaware and against which he would be unable to present a defense. The fact that some claims might be manufactured or improperly expanded cannot justify the wholesale rejection of all claims. Of course, there is no suggestion that the physical injuries to Mr. and Mrs. Dziokonski were contrived. We have rejected the idea that tort liability in particular classes of cases must be denied because of the threat of fraud. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>370 Mass. 619, 622-623 (1976) (interspousal immunity in motor vehicle torts abrogated). <em>Sorensen </em>v. <em>Sorensen, </em>369 Mass. 350, 363-365 (1975) (parental immunity in motor vehicle torts abrogated). We have chosen to leave the detection of fraud and collusion to the adversary process. See <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140, 143-144 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The fact that the causal connection between a parent\u2019s emotional response to peril to his child and the parent\u2019s resulting physical injuries is difficult to prove or disprove cannot justify denying all recovery. No one asserts, and we have never claimed, that physical reactions to emotional responses do not occur. See <em>Spade </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston R.R., </em>168 Mass. 285, 288 (1897). We have recognized liability for exclusively emotional reactions to tortious conduct in particular circumstances (see, <em>e.g., Agis v. Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140 [1976]), and, in other instances, we have recognized liability for bodily harm resulting from emotional distress <em>(George </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co., </em>359 Mass. 244 [1971]). We have upheld claims of the character involved here, as so called \u201cparasitic\u201d claims, where they are accompanied by a traditional form of tortious injury. See <em>Homans </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>180 Mass. 456, 457-458 (1902). Indeed, certain elements of pain and suffering, recoverable in almost all personal injury actions, may be as tenuous causally as the harm for which recovery is sought in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The scope of duty in tort is often defined in terms of the reasonable foreseeability of the harm to the plaintiff resulting from the defendant\u2019s negligent conduct. Sometimes, liability is predicated on a judicial characterization that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff, or that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, or that the defendant is liable for the natural and probable consequences of his conduct. Each of these characterizations is actually a conclusion and is not a helpful guide to arriving at the proper answer in a given set of circumstances. We think reasonable foreseeability is a proper starting point in determining whether an actor is to be liable for the consequences of his negligence. Measured by this standard, it is clear that it is reasonably foreseeable that, if one negligently operates a motor vehicle so as to injure a person, there will be one or more persons sufficiently attached emotionally to the injured person that he or they will be affected. See <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Grossman, </em>24 N.Y.2d 609, 615 (1969), where the New York Court of Appeals acknowledged this fact but denied recovery for other reasons. The problem, however, is that the class of persons vicariously affected by the tortfeasor\u2019s conduct may be large. This concern has prompted many courts to deny all liability. See, e.g., <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Grossmann, supra </em>at 615, 617, 619. They perceive no logical place at which to impose reasonable limits on the scope of a defendant\u2019s liability without going to the full extent of reasonable foreseeability, which would produce, as they see it, a risk of liability disproportionate to the defendant\u2019s culpability. The result has been that, as a matter of policy, courts have decided not to give full effect to reasonable foreseeability and have adopted limitations on liability, such as the impact rule or the zone of danger rule.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Every effort must be made to avoid arbitrary lines which \u201cunnecessarily produce incongruous and indefensible results.\u201d <em>Mone </em>v. <em>Greyhound Lines, Inc., </em>368 Mass. 354, 365 (1975) (Braucher, J., dissenting). The focus should be on underlying principles. <em>Id. </em>In cases of this character, there must be both a substantial physical injury and proof that the injury was caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence. Beyond this, the determination whether there should be liability for the injury sustained depends on a number of factors, such as where, when, and how the injury, to the third person entered into the consciousness of the claimant, and what degree there was of familial or other relationship between the claimant and the third person. See <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg, </em>68 Cal. 2d 728, 740-741 (1968). It does not matter in practice whether these factors are regarded as policy considerations imposing limitations on the scope of reasonable foreseeability (see R.E. Keeton, Legal Cause in the Law of Torts 66 [1963]), or as factors bearing on the determination of reasonable foreseeability itself. The fact is that, in cases of this character, such factors are relevant in measuring the limits of liability for emotionally based injuries resulting from a defendant\u2019s negligence. In some instances, it will be clear that the question is properly one for the trier of fact, while in others the claim will fall outside the range of circumstances within which there may be liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">With these considerations in mind, we conclude that the allegations concerning a parent who sustains substantial physical harm as a result of severe mental distress over some peril or harm to his minor child caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence state a claim for which relief might be granted, where the parent either witnesses the accident or soon comes on the scene while the child is still there. This conclusion is not inconsistent with opinions of the highest courts in California <em>(Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg, </em>68 Cal. 2d 728 [1968]), Hawaii <em>(Leong </em>v. <em>Takasaki, </em>55 Haw. 398 [1974]),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Rhode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Island <em>(D\u2019Ambra </em>v. <em>United States, </em>114 R.I. 643 [1975]),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and of informed commentators on the subject. W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 54, at 334-335 (4th ed. 1971). 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Torts \u00a7 18.4, at 1035-1038 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">On this premise, we think it clear that the complaint concerning Mrs. Dziokonski states a claim which withstands a motion to dismiss. The allegations of the complaint concerning Mr. Dziokonski, however, are far more indefinite. We do not know where, when, or how Mr. Dziokonski came to know of the injury to his daughter and the death of his wife. We do not have a clear indication of the relationship of his discovery of this information to any mental distress and physical injury he sustained. We cannot say, as matter of law, that, within the scope of the allegations of the complaint concerning Mr. Dziokonski, there are no circumstances which could conceivably justify recovery. Consequently, we conclude that neither of the complaints should be dismissed for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b570-13\"> The counts against Pelletier and Kroll allege that Norma was a minor at the time of the accident (October 24, 1973), although her age is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>alleged. No similar allegation is made in the counts against Babineau, although Norma\u2019s minority may be inferable from the allegation that she had alighted from a school bus.

We do not know whether an action has been brought by or on behalf of Norma, nor whether the circumstances are such that under the no-fault law (St. 1970, c. 670), she has no enforceable claim against any defendant. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6D. See <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 8-9 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\"> We also reserved the question, which we need not answer here, whether there could be liability for negligently caused distress without resulting bodily injury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b575-6\"> We left open the question of liability for mental anguish or emotional distress without physical injuries in <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Whalen, </em>365 Mass. 506, 516-518 (1974), where the plaintiff\u2019s claim was based on negligent conduct (in construction of a septic system) and not, as in the <em>George </em>and Ag\u00eds cases, on intentional or reckless conduct. We concluded that, even if there were liability for negligent conduct causing emotional distress without physical injuries, evidence that the plaintiff suffered gagging sensations and \u201cgot a little nervous and uptight . . .\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 517), was insufficient evidence of emotional distress to justify recovery. <em>Id. </em>at 517-518. Because the appeals before us involve emotionally based physical injuries, again, we need not decide the question left open in the <em>McDonough </em>and <em>George </em>cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\"> Many injuries caused by negligence are the result of the operation of motor vehicles. General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6D, inserted as part of our \u201cno-fault\u201d law (St. 1970, c. 670, \u00a7 5), permits recovery of \u201cdamages for pain and suffering, including mental suffering associated with . . . [bodily] injury\u201d arising out of the operation or use of a motor vehicle within the Commonwealth only if certain physical injuries (including death) are involved or if certain reasonable and necessary medical and other expenses exceed $500. It may be that by its terms G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6D, imposes its own restraints on fraudulent, frivolous, or minor motor vehicle tort claims where there is no impact. Even if it should not be read as imposing a limitation on recovery for emotionally based physical injuries, it may provide a reasonable guide in determining whether a physical injury is sufficiently substantial so as to justify recovery for negligently caused, emotionally based physical harm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b576-9\"> Mr. Dziokonski\u2019s injuries are alleged to be the product of his distress over learning of his daughter\u2019s injuries and of the death of his wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In <em>Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>19 Cal. 3d 59, 76 (1977), the California Supreme Court accepted the view of the <em>Archibald </em>case, saying \u201cWe confirm the propriety of the expression in <em>Archibald, supra, </em>that the <em>Dillon </em>requirement of \u2018sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident\u2019 does not require a <em>visual </em>perception of the impact causing the death or injury\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Keating, J., dissenting alone in <em>Tobin </em>v.

However, that court has denied recovery to one who was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>located a reasonable distance from the scene of the accident. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Kokua Sales &amp; Supply, </em>Ltd., 56 Haw. 204 (1975).

Although I am in full agreement with the court in its conclusion that <em>Spade </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston </em>R.R., 168 Mass. 285 (1897), should be overruled, I do not believe that liability should be extended to the degree described by the court in its opinion here. Therefore, I dissent from the reversal of the dismissal of the complaints of the two plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">It is my view that liability for negligently causing emotional distress that results in physical injury should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>extended as far as would be allowed by the rule of the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 313 (1965). That section, while allowing recovery under some circumstances, provides that no recovery may be had for \u201cillness or bodily harm of another which is caused by emotional distress arising solely from harm or peril to a third person, unless the negligence of the actor has otherwise created an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to the other.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would agree also that if, contrary to the facts in the present cases, a parent<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had been present at the time of the alleged negligent conduct which caused the injury, and such parent had suffered emotional distress and resulting physical injury, then he or she should recover regardless of whether they were within the zone of risk of bodily harm created by the negligent act. See, e.g., <em>Dillon </em>v. Legg, 68 Cal. 2d 728, 730-731 (1968); <em>D\u2019Ambra </em>v. <em>United States, </em>114 R.I. 643, 657-658 (1975); W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 54, at 334-335 (4th ed. 1971).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I do not believe, however, that liability should be extended further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>to allow recovery by a parent who comes on the scene of an accident after an injury has occurred to the child but before the child is removed. It is my opinion that we should not prescribe rules that allow or deny recovery by the parent on the basis of the speed and efficiency of an ambulance team in responding to an accident call, or on the haste with which a parent can be notified and rushed to the accident scene.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-5\"> The Restatement of Torts \u00a7 313 (1934) specifically proposed no rule regarding recovery for emotional distress and resulting physical injury by a parent or spouse who witnessed the injury-causing negligent act. That section provided in part: \u201c Caveat: The Institute expresses no opinion as to whether an actor whose conduct is negligent as involving an unreasonable risk of causing bodily harm to a child or spouse is liable for an illness or other bodily harm caused to the parent or spouse who witnesses the peril or harm of the child or spouse and thereby suffers anxiety or shock which is the legal cause of the parent\u2019s or spouse\u2019s illness or other bodily harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 851.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\"> Although a parent was involved in the present cases, I believe the rule should apply similarly if a spouse or other close relative witnessed negligent conduct and injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\"> This was also apparently the view of a significant number of members of the American Law Institute who participated in the drafting of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965), since the Reporter\u2019s notes to \u00a7 313 state that \u201cthe feeling of a number of those present at the Institute meeting, [was] that the situation of a mother who sees her child negligently killed before her eyes is one in which recovery would be justified.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts Appendix \u00a7 313, Reporter\u2019s notes at 11 (1966). The narrower position actually taken by the Institute in \u00a7 313 was in accordance with what it believed to be the \u201cheavy weight of authority\u201d at the time. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
