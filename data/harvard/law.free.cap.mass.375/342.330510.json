On November 6, 1973, the plaintiff Rosemary Mailhot, a resident of Boston, employed as a clerk at the United States Postal Service station located in the Roslindale district of Boston, went out to buy early morning coffee for herself and her fellow employees. On her return from a nearby restaurant, as she was crossing Washington Street, she was struck and injured by a car owned by and registered in Massachusetts to Richard G. Swartz and operated at the time by Randy S. Swartz. The car was covered by a policy of motor vehicle liability insurance, with \u201cno-fault,\u201d i.e., personal injury protection (PIP) benefits, issued by the defendant The Travelers Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">In February, 1975, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant company in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston claiming the PIP benefits. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M. The company defended under a clause of its policy excepting or excluding PIP benefits for \u201cbodily injury to any person who is entitled to payments or benefits under the provisions of any workmen\u2019s compensation laws.\u201d In fact the plaintiff, as an employee of the Postal Service, was entitled to compensation pursuant to the United States workmen\u2019s compensation law (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101 et seq. [1970 &amp; Supp. IV 1974]), and through February 2, 1974, had received compensation of $6,789.15 thereunder. (Medical and hospital bills exceeded $500.) However, the plaintiff pointed to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, which excepts from the PIP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>benefits \u201ca person entitled to payments or benefits under the provisions of chapter one hundred and fifty-two\u201d of the General Laws<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 a reference to the Massachusetts Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The policy clause, according to the plaintiff, exceeded in scope the statutory exception or exclusion, and to the extent of that excess was illegal and nugatory, leaving the plaintiff with a valid claim. The company stood on the validity of the clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In the Municipal Court, judgment went for the company, but, on report, the Appellate Division, holding for the plaintiff by a 2-1 vote, vacated the judgment and remanded the case for the ascertainment of the amount of the PIP benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The case is here on appeal under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 109. We disagree with the Appellate Division, and reinstate the judgment first entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">If the policy clause attempted improperly to enlarge the exception permitted by law, then, despite any approval of the form of policy by the Commissioner of Insurance under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113A, the clause would crash, and would be taken to have been replaced implicitly by a clause conforming to the law. Compare <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>359 Mass. 525, 528 (1971), with <em>Royal Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>372 Mass. 86, 90 (1977). But we do not believe the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, referring to the Massachusetts workmens compensation statute, should be taken as fully expressive of the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">When we examined the \u201cno-fault\u201d legislation of 1970 (St. 1970, c. 670) and held it to be constitutional in its general purport, we said it was the \u201cfirst legislative attempt at a fundamental alteration and modernization of an important segment of the common law of torts.\u201d <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 3 (1971). In so large a legislative enterprise, there are likely to be casual overstatements and understatements, half-answers, and gaps in the statutory provisions. As practice develops and the difficulties are revealed, the courts are called on to interweave the statute with decisions answering the difficulties and composing, as far as feasible and reasonable, an harmonious structure faithful to the basic designs and purposes of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Such a process has been taking place with the no-fault law. We cite examples. In <em>Chipman </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>366 Mass. 253 (1974), a bus passenger sued the Authority for personal injuries on a conventional negligence basis, demanding damages for pain and suffering among other things. The Authority sought' to confine the claim to PIP limits and referred to \u00a7 6D of G. L. c. 231, inserted by St. 1970, c. 670, \u00a7 5, an integral part of the no-fault legislation, which starts with the words, \u201cIn any action of tort brought as a result of bodily injury . . . arising out of the . . . operation . . . of a motor vehicle within this commonwealth by the defendant\u201d [recovery for pain and suffering is disallowed unless certain conditions are met]. The seeming inclusiveness of these words tended to support the Authority\u2019s defense, but the court held that the defense failed. The plaintiff had no PIP coverage because neither she nor any member of her household owned a car, and the Authority as a \u201cpolitical subdivision,\u201d was exempted from the requirement of procuring motor vehicle liability insurance (see G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1A), and had not procured such insurance. Thus it could be said fairly that both parties stood outside the no-fault scheme, and it appeared incongruous to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>allow a resort to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6D. (The <em>Chipman </em>case may be read in relation to <em>Cyr </em>v. <em>Farias, </em>367 Mass. 720 [1975], where the plaintiffs, who as nonresidents were not entitled to PIP benefits in their own right, were nevertheless excluded by \u00a7 6D from recovery for pain and suffering: the distinguishing fact, according to the court, was that the defendant tortfeasor was within the scheme as a resident car owner with the required insurance.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Just as the <em>Chipman </em>case was an instance of a reasoned confinement of the application of the legislation in deference to its purposes,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so <em>Scandura </em>v. <em>Trombly Motor Coach Serv., Inc., </em>370 Mass. 612 (1976), is an instance of the laying down of a rule adjacent to the statute (again \u00a7 6D) which in a sense enlarged it. In <em>Scandura </em>the injured plaintiff sued the bus company on a theory of contract for breach of its obligation as a common carrier to act with due care. The carrier had secured motor vehicle liability insurance on a no-fault basis. The plaintiff argued that \u00a7 6D did not apply to eliminate a recovery for pain and suffering because that section spoke of \u201cany action of tort.\u201d But the court, assuming that the action was properly characterized as one in contract, held that it should be governed by a rule analogous to that prescribed by \u00a7 6D. In the light of the whole legislative pattern, it ought to make no difference that the particular action did not follow the usual tort theory; indeed it would be destructive of the pattern to allow the difference of theory to command the difference of substantive result for which the plaintiff was contending.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">To return to the present case: If those entitled to compensation under the Massachusetts workmen\u2019s compensation law are excluded from PIP benefits, as the legislation states at c. 90, \u00a7 34A, and as the plaintiff concedes, then there is no ground that appeals to reason why those entitled to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>pensation under the workmen\u2019s compensation law of another State or the Federal government should not be governed by an analogous rule to be declared by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We do not accept the speculation that there may have been a purpose to treat the beneficiaries of foreign workmen\u2019s compensation laws on a different footing than beneficiaries of the domestic law because the compensation under a foreign law might be markedly less than under the domestic (though this is not predicated of the United States compensation law) ,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor are we impressed by the thought that, as complete evenhandedness is not achieved under the no-fault legislation (see <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, supra, </em>360 Mass. at 30; <em>Flaherty </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins, Co., </em>369 Mass. 482, 487 [1976]), a lack of it may be tolerated in allowing this plaintiff to recover PIP benefits merely because her workmen\u2019s compensation happens to come from a law other than that of Massachusetts. The no-fault legislation certainly aims in general at evenhandedness, and a court should strive toward that goal where feasible. The same can be said about avoiding duplicating recoveries, an objective not fully attained by the legislation (see <em>Pinnick, supra </em>at 7), but to be furthered by a court unless somehow forbidden.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>We observe that our decision does not rest on an interpretation of the very language of the quoted exception of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A. Rather we fashion an adjunct to \u00a7 34A called for by the sense of that section in its relation to the legislation as a whole. Another way of putting the matter is to say that the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alter\u00e1is, which is at most only a fallible aid to decision,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is seen here to lead to an awkward and even intolerable result, and is therefore abandoned for a more liberal or more encompassing approach.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In the view we have taken, it becomes unnecessary to consider whether our decision could be rested, at least as to the medical expenses, on the proposition that those expenses were not \u201cincurred\u201d by the plaintiff within the meaning of \u00a7 34A<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> because they were covered by the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>workmen\u2019s compensation law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Lincoln St. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>374 Mass. 630 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The order of the Appellate Division on report is reversed, the judgment of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston entered in pursuance of that order is vacated (see note 2 <em>supra), </em>and judgment will enter for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-7\">^he central provision of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, as amended through St. 1973, c. 806, \u00a7 4, is in part as follows: \u201c\u2018Personal injury protection,\u2019 provisions of a motor vehicle liability policy or motor vehicle liability bond which provide for payment to the named insured in any such motor vehicle liability policy, the obligor of any motor vehicle liability bond, members of the insured\u2019s or obligor\u2019s household, any authorized operator or passenger of the insured\u2019s or obligor\u2019s motor vehicle including a guest occupant, and any pedestrian struck by the insured\u2019s or obligor\u2019s motor vehicle, unless any of the aforesaid is a person entitled to payments or benefits under the provisions of chapter one hundred and fifty-two, of all reasonable expenses incurred within two years from the date of accident for necessary medical, surgical, x-ray, and dental services, including prosthetic devices and necessary ambulance, hospital, professional nursing and funeral services, and . . . [further enumeration of benefits].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\"> The record shows that on the remand there was a recovery up to the usual statutory limit of $2,000 with costs and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee (as to the fee, see G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\"> <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hiatt, </em>329 Mass. 488 (1952), is a much criticised case where this court refused to confine general language so as to carry out the design of the statute; see H.M. Hart, Jr. &amp; A.M. Sacks, The Legal Process 1226-1228 (Temp. ed. 1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b361-6\"> With at least equal plausibility it might be suggested that the draftsmen were concentrating on Massachusetts residents as plaintiffs, and fell into the unconsidered assumption that if such plaintiffs became entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation it would invariably be under the Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">As to the point that another jurisdiction\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation scales may be lower than our own, compare <em>Flaherty </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>369 Mass. 482 (1976). An injured resident plaintiff receiving compensation for lost wages under the Massachusetts workmen\u2019s compensation law sought to recover PIP benefits for the same item <em>less </em>the compensation received. The court held against the plaintiff: one entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation was wholly excluded from PIP benefits even where these would exceed the compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> A plaintiffs judgment in the present case would result in a kind of double recovery. (Note the possibility that the United States might lay claim to part of the avails of the plaintiffs judgment under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8132 [1970 &amp; Supp. IV 1974]; cf. \u00a7 8131.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\"> See Llewellyn, Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and the Rules or Canons About How Statutes Are to Be Construed, 3 Vand.
