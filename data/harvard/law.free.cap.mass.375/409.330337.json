J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alv\">This is an appeal from an order of a single justice, which order dismissed a petition for extraordinary relief brought by the Commonwealth pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this petition, the Commonwealth asserted that, in granting a motion for a new trial to one George E. McCarthy, a defendant who had been convicted of murder in the second degree, the trial judge based his decision not on a conclusion that there were errors at trial, but on the belief that the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment was inappropriate for this case. The Commonwealth thus argued that the judge either abused his discretion or, alternatively, exceeded his jurisdiction under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29, by usurping the power reserved to the legislative and executive departments under art. 30 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth (the power to fix punishment for crimes; the power to put an end to criminal prosecutions). The Commonwealth urged the single justice (1) to vacate the order granting a new trial, and (2) to reinstate the jury verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree. Alternatively, the Commonwealth asked the single justice either to retain jurisdiction of the case and remand to the Superior Court for further findings, or to reserve and report the questions of law to the full bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>We agree with the single justice\u2019s conclusion that this is not an appropriate case in which to exercise our extraordinary powers under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the Commonwealth\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">At the defendant\u2019s trial, there was testimony as to the following facts. On April 16, 1976, after spending a social evening together, Richard Doherty (the victim), his younger brother Joseph, and a few friends drove to the Doherty residence at 8 Carter Terrace, Somerville. The group listened to records for a short time and then Richard and his friends returned to the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">While the driver backed out of the street, Richard observed his parents\u2019 neighbors, Edward J. McCarthy (McCarthy) and his son George (the defendant) in a car heading toward the McCarthy residence at 10 Carter Terrace. Richard immediately told the driver to let him out of the car. He then ran down the street in the direction of the McCarthy residence. Moments later, at approximately 10:50p.m., four shots were heard in the vicinity of the McCarthy driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">An officer called to the scene testified that, shortly after he arrived at 10 Carter Terrace, he observed the body of Richard Doherty lying on its side near the McCarthys\u2019 car. The victim\u2019s left hand was clutched in a fist and held a chain six to eight inches in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The defendant immediately volunteered to the officer that he had shot the victim, but insisted that he had had no choice. It was the defendant\u2019s testimony that, after the defendant\u2019s father backed the car into the driveway, Richard Doherty appeared suddenly, and, with a chain in his fist, began to punch the elder McCarthy. The defendant warned the victim to leave his father alone, and fired two warning shots. When the victim advanced toward him, the defendant fired directly at Doherty.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">There was testimony that after the defendant admitted the shooting, the officer placed him under arrest. A pat-down search revealed that the defendant wore a shoulder holster carrying a .380 semi-automatic pistol. The weapon still contained two live rounds of ammunition marked \u201c.380 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>automatic,\u201d the same variety as was later found in the victim\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant filed a motion for a directed verdict, which motion was taken under advisement pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 17, 1977, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree. The following day, after a hearing, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, but suggested that the defendant file a motion for a new trial. The defendant did so on March 21, 1977, and on March 25, 1977, the judge ruled: \u201cAfter hearing, in the exercise of that discretionary power granted pursuant to General Laws, Chapter 278, Section 29, wherein it appears that justice may not have been done, the within motion is allowed, and a new trial granted.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">During the course of the hearing on the motion for a new trial, the judge made the following comments: \u201cYou could say the day after tomorrow that if there was a plea [of guilty to manslaughter], that was obvious coercion, because he was under the gun. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u201c I think the motion for a new trial is the only thing to do. I don\u2019t like to be substituting my judgment for somebody else. But you and I both know that there are guys up in Walpole that are there for second-degree murder, and if you put them in a line and put McCarthy with them and put the quantum \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m just looking at them as a group \u2014 and you would be kind of surprised. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u201cI am inclined to [allow the motion], because it seems to be disproportionate, when you take those people who are up there ... \u2014 I haven\u2019t had that many, but, say, enough \u2014 and you must have, too \u2014 plenty of cases of first degree murder and all of a sudden they come in on second degree, including some that you and I would both consider first-degree murder, and some manslaughter; had them in armed robbery, manslaughter \u2014 that it just seems to be disproportionate. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u201cI\u2019m extremely reluctant to ever interfere, because when you tell . . . [the jury] it\u2019s theirs, it\u2019s theirs. I am, as is quite apparent, I am tempted in this case, because I know something they don\u2019t know \u2014 the jury; I know the quantum of punishment. ... I know that the penalty is life, mandatory. I know that he actually serves 15 years. I know if it\u2019s manslaughter, it can be a big spread.\u201d On the basis of these comments, the Commonwealth sought appellate review under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">1. We first observe that the order of the Superior Court judge which forms the basis of the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal is interlocutory in nature. See <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>312 Mass. 252, 256 (1942). Further, it is not the type of interlocutory ruling from which the Commonwealth may appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, as amended by St. 1972, c. 740, \u00a7 16.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, as the petitioner concedes, the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>means of review open to the Commonwealth is by way of invoking this court\u2019s general superintendence power under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">It is well settled that we will review interlocutory rulings in criminal cases under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, \u201c[o]nly in the most exceptional circumstances,\u201d <em>Gilday </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>360 Mass. 170, 171 (1971), and only when \u201cit becomes necessary to protect substantive rights.\u201d <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>372 Mass. 753, 755 (1977), quoting from <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass 236, 239 (1967). See generally <em>A Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante </em>104 (1978); <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 373 </em>Mass. 157, 158-159 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frado, </em>372 Mass. 866 (1977); <em>Lataille </em>v. <em>District Court of E. Hampden, </em>366 Mass. 525, 526 (1974); <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>364 Mass. 137, 138 (1973); <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 844 (1973); <em>Barber v. Commonwealth, supra. As </em>to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the trial judge exceeded his jurisdiction in vacating a judgment of guilty, we assume without deciding that, under some circumstances, this may be the type of interlocutory ruling which results in \u201cirremediable\u201d prejudice, and which therefore may be reviewable under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. See <em>Gilday </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>We further assume without deciding that under some circumstances, the Commonwealth may assert substantive rights under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frado, supra. </em>In the instant case, however, we are not persuaded that there has been any infringement of the Commonwealth\u2019s substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">First, we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that, under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29, it was necessary for the judge to base his decision to order a new trial on the ground that a particular legal error occurred at trial. A motion for a new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>367 Mass. 519, 526 (1975). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>363 Mass. 311, 322 (1973) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slaney, </em>345 Mass. 135, 142 (1962). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>323 Mass. 205, 220 (1948). While the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>proper exercise of this discretion under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29, of course does not include actions which are arbitrary, frivolous, or contrary to law, see <em>Bartley </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>317 Mass. 35, 42 (1944), it necessarily includes the flexibility to consider the case as a whole, to assess the weight of the evidence, and to bring the interest of justice to bear.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stout, </em>356 Mass. 237, 242 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Second, we disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s analysis that the judge\u2019s remarks during the hearing on the motion for a new trial show either an abuse of discretion or an intention to grant the motion in order to circumvent the legislative mandate of a life sentence. A careful reading of the judge\u2019s comments leads us to conclude that the judge did not exercise his discretion in an arbitrary or frivolous manner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the contrary, he expressed a general reluctance to interfere with the jury\u2019s verdict, and ordered a new trial only after what appears to be a thoughtful assessment of the case as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Further, the substance of the judge\u2019s remarks did not go beyond permissible limits. According to our understanding of the judge\u2019s remarks, it was the jury\u2019s verdict, and not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>statutory sentence, that seemed \u201cdisproportionate\u201d in the experience of the judge. Indeed, on the subject of sentencing, the judge clearly pointed out that, whatever the ultimate conviction would be, the defendant most likely would be in prison \u201cfor a [long] period of time.\u201d We thus construe the remarks in question as part of the process of weighing the evidence to determine whether, in the experience of the judge, the verdict was a just one. At most, the comments indicate the judge\u2019s conclusion that, while a verdict of murder in the second degree may have been warranted by the evidence, a verdict of manslaughter not only may have been possible, but also may have comported more closely with the weight of the evidence, and thus may have been more consonant with justice. As we indicated above, this conclusion is consistent with the proper exercise of the judge\u2019s discretion under G. L. c, 278, \u00a7 29. Thus, the Commonwealth has presented us with no occasion for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">2. We decline to exercise our rulemaking power under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and to order the judge to make findings in support of his ruling on the motion for a new trial. First, as we indicated <em>supra, </em>we think that the judge\u2019s reasons for granting the defendant\u2019s motion were clear. Second, we note that the rule which the Commonwealth urges us to adopt is substantially similar to Rule 30 (b) of the Proposed Rules of Criminal Procedure for the District and Superior Courts (Supp. April 15, 1977), which rule would require judges to \u201cmake such findings of fact as are necessary to resolve [the] defendant\u2019s allegations of errors of law.\u201d On July 30, 1976, the Proposed Rules of Criminal Procedure were submitted to this court in their entirety for \u201creview and promulgation.\u201d We think it more appropriate to consider adopting such a requirement in the context of the Proposed Rules of Criminal Procedure rather than to entertain similar individual proposals on a piecemeal, case by case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\n<em>Order of the single justice affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\"> General Laws c. 211, \u00a7 3, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 44, provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe supreme judicial court shall have general superintendence of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to correct and prevent errors and abuses therein if no other remedy is expressly provided; and it may issue all writs and processes to such courts . . . which may be necessary to the furtherance of justice and to the regular execution of the laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AY6\">General Laws c. 211, \u00a7 4A, as amended through St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 46, provides in pertinent part; \u201cThe supreme judicial court or a justice thereof may transfer for partial or final disposition in any appropriate lower court any cause or matter which might otherwise be disposed of by a single justice ....

On application for an appeal in a felony case by and on behalf of the commonwealth by the attorney general or a district attorney, or by the defendant, a single justice or the chief justice of the supreme judicial court may, upon determining that the administration of justice would be facilitated thereby, grant an interlocutory appeal from a decision, order or judgment of the superior court determining a motion to suppress evidence prior to trial and a single justice shall hear the same or shall report the same to the full court or to the appeals court for hearing . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\"> Indeed, long before the Legislature explicitly authorized the trial judge to consider the interests of justice, this court recognized that, even when a judge is satisfied that the trial before him was fair and impartial, he must, on a motion for a new trial, \u201clook into the evidence, upon which the verdict was founded, in order that [he] may ascertain whether the cause ... is such as would or ought to produce a different result in the minds of another intelligent jury. . . .

Cf. <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>312 Mass. 252, 257 (1942) (\u201ceven if there was no mistake and the final conclusion of the judge was reached simply through more mature reflection and more careful consideration, there was no error in law\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\"> We state, <em>supra, </em>that we \u201cassume without deciding\u201d that the Commonwealth may assert substantive rights under some circumstances in appealing a criminal case under G.

Perhaps the Commonwealth would be entitled to relief under the statute in a case which, unlike the instant case, showed that the judge acted arbitrarily, frivolously, with abuse of discretion, or contrary to law, in granting a new trial after a guilty verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
