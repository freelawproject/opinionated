L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47, seeking forfeiture of two automobiles, a 1977 Pontiac and a 1974 Buick. Both automobiles had been seized by the police following the arrest of their owners on charges of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The owners received notice of the forfeiture proceedings, but neither owner appeared at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">The cases came on for trial on September 8, 1977, before a judge of the Superior Court, Suffolk County, sitting without a jury. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>(d). </em>The judge allowed a motion by the district attorney to consolidate the two cases, and allowed a motion by General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) to intervene. GMAC, which had a security interest in both vehicles, the nature of which is discussed more fully below (see note 5 <em>infra), </em>assumed the burden of defense in both cases. In each case, the judge found that the automobile \u201cwas being used in the illegal transportation of a controlled substance\u201d and ordered and adjudged that the automobile be confiscated by the Commonwealth. GMAC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>took appeals to the Appeals Court, and we allowed an application for direct appellate review. G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 10 (A). We affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The following facts appear in a stipulation filed in the Superior Court by the district attorney and GMAC. On or about July 22, 1977, GMAC brought an action for declaratory judgment and equitable relief in the Superior Court, naming as defendant the district attorney for Suffolk County. GMAC sought a declaration that certain provisions of G. L. c. 94C were unconstitutional, and sought to gain possession of the two automobiles. One of the instant forfeiture proceedings had been initiated by the district attorney prior to GMAC\u2019s suit (action against the Pontiac was begun on May 17, 1977), and the other forfeiture proceeding was initiated subsequent to GMAC\u2019s suit (action against the Buick was begun on August 15, 1977). The district attorney and GMAC agreed that motions would be made seeking dismissal of GMAC\u2019s suit and seeking allowance of GMAC\u2019s intervention in both forfeiture proceedings \u201con behalf of\u201d the defendant automobiles. At the consolidated forfeiture hearing on September 8, 1977, the judge allowed the motion to dismiss the GMAC suit and, as already has been noted, allowed the motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">1. In light of these facts, we find it difficult to comprehend the contention of GMAC on appeal that it \u201chas been substantially deprived of its constitutional guarantee of procedural due process in that it received no notice of seizure and forfeiture, and hence had no opportunity to set forth any defense to the Commonwealth\u2019s action pursuant to G. L. c. 94c, \u00a7 47 (c) (3).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We need not discuss whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>GMAC, as the holder of security interests in the two automobiles, had a constitutional right to notice of the forfeiture proceedings. It is apparent from the facts that GMAC had actual notice of the proceedings, had opportunity to participate in them, and took full advantage of the opportunity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">GMAC appears also to suggest that it should have received notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the actual seizure, as distinguished from forfeiture, of the automobiles. GMAC cites two Supreme Court cases, <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 80-81 (1972), and <em>Sniadach </em>v. <em>Family Fin. Corp., </em>395 U.S. 337 (1969), as well as one of our own cases, <em>Haverhill Manor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>368 Mass. 15, 24, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 929 (1975), for the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the State to provide some kind of hearing before a significant property interest is taken. We need not discuss in detail the many considerations and qualifications that define the constitutional dimensions of these cases, all of which GMAC has seen fit to ignore. See, e.g., <em>Calero-Toledo </em>v. <em>Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., </em>416 U.S. 663, 676-680 (1974); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>W.T. Grant Co., </em>416 U.S. 600, 603-620 (1974). It suffices to note that \u201cseizure for purposes of forfeiture is one of those \u2018\u201cextraordinary situations\u201d that justify postponing notice and opportunity for hearing.\u2019 <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin, </em>407 U.S., at 90; see <em>Sniadach </em>v. <em>Family Finance Corp., </em>395 U.S. 337, 339 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>(1969); <em>Boddie </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 378-379 (1971).\u201d <em>Calero-Toledo, supra </em>at 677. See <em>Haverhill Manor, Inc., supra </em>at 24-25. All the considerations that were present in <em>Calero-Toledo </em>to support seizure without a prior hearing are present in the instant cases. Seizure serves the important governmental purpose of allowing the Commonwealth to \u201cassert <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over the property in order to conduct forfeiture proceedings, thereby fostering the public interest in preventing continued illicit use of the property and in enforcing criminal sanctions\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 679. Lack of prior notice of the seizure protects against the removal, destruction, or concealment of the property. <em>Id. </em>Finally, seizure is initiated by government officials as a first step in the forfeiture proceeding detailed in c. 94C, \u00a7 47; seizure is not initiated by self-interested private parties, as was the case in <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Having concluded that notice and hearing are not required prior to a proper seizure for the purpose of forfeiture, we need not pursue a possible alternative ground for rejecting GMAC\u2019s procedural due process argument \u2014 that GMAC did not possess a significant property interest in the automobiles at the time of seizure or thereafter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">2. GMAC does not contest the validity or propriety of the judge\u2019s findings that the automobiles were being used in the illegal transportation of a controlled substance or that the automobiles were subject to forfeiture pursuant to G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>(a) </em>(3). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1969 Mer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number><em>cedes-Benz Automobile, ante </em>663 (1978). GMAC does maintain, however, that forfeiture in these cases deprives it of contingent property rights without due compensation. GMAC also argues that \u00a7 47 (c) (3), the statutory \u201cexception\u201d to the forfeiture provision of \u00a7 47 <em>(a) </em>(3), see notes 2 and 3, <em>supra, </em>violates the Fourteenth Amendment in that it \u201c (1) adversely affects innocent parties, (2) only provides for owners\u2019 rights, and (3) fails to meet the Fourteenth Amendment constitutional guarantee which demands that the law shall not be unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious in its application.\u201d The gist of these arguments, as we understand them, is that the statute does not go far enough in that it only protects from forfeiture \u201cinnocent\u201d <em>owners </em>\u2014 those who can show that they did not know and should not have known that the conveyance was used in and for the business of unlawfully manufacturing, dispensing, or distributing controlled substances. See \u00a7 47 (c) (3), <em>(d). </em>GMAC argues that the statute is unconstitutional for the reason that it does not offer similar protection to innocent parties in GMAC\u2019s position \u2014 first lienholders or those who hold a \u201ccontingent property right\u201d in the property subject to forfeiture.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> GMAC adds that its \u201cunique interest in this property stems from the important fact that such a considerable balance remains due and owing on these vehicles ($11,508.83 in all) [$8,792.52 for the Pontiac; $2,716.31 for the Buick].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">GMAC\u2019s arguments are based partly on social policy grounds (the loss absorbed by GMAC will ultimately be borne by society, presumably through higher interest rates, and will result in an impediment to commerce), and partly on substantive due process grounds. As for the social policy arguments, the short answer is that these are legislative, not judicial, concerns. See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Hous. Fin. Agency </em>v. <em>New England Merchants Nat'l Bank, </em>356 Mass. 202, 212 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">As for the constitutional arguments, we cannot say that the Legislature has acted arbitrarily or irrationally in failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>to make special provision for the protection of innocent parties in GMAC\u2019s position. It would serve no purpose to repeat the historical development of forfeiture proceedings recently outlined by the Supreme Court in <em>Calero-Toledo </em>v. <em>Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., </em>416 U.S. 663, 680-690 (1974). We highlight the underlying philosophy: \u201cForfeiture of conveyances that have been used \u2014 and may be used again \u2014 in violation of the narcotics laws fosters the purposes served by the underlying criminal statutes, both by preventing further illicit use of the conveyance and by imposing an economic penalty, thereby rendering illegal behavior unprofitable. ... To the extent that such forfeiture provisions are applied to lessors, bailors, or secured creditors who are innocent of any wrongdoing, confiscation may have the desirable effect of inducing them to exercise greater care in transferring possession of their property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686-688.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our case law is in accord. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Certain Motor Vehicle, </em>261 Mass. 504, 508-510 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">3. We conclude that GMAC has failed to demonstrate that its procedural or substantive due process rights were violated by the operation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47, in the instant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-11\">General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>(a), </em>inserted by St. 1971, c. 1071, \u00a7 1, provides in part: <em>\u201c(a) </em>The following property shall be subject to forfeiture to the commonwealth and all property rights therein shall be in the commonwealth: ...

The Court went on to note that \u201cthe same might be said of an owner who proved not only that he was uninvolved in and unaware of the wrongful activity, but also that he had done all that reasonably could be expected to prevent the proscribed use of his property; for, in that circumstance, it would be difficult to conclude that forfeiture served legitimate purposes and was not unduly oppressive\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 689-690.
