The complaint alleged that the defendant proposed to enforce against the plaintiffs and others a statute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34, which prohibits under penalty the knowing possession of marihuana; the relief sought was a declaration that the statute is unconstitutional at least as applied to the personal possession of a small amount of the substance. The defendant having attacked the complaint by motion to dismiss, the single justice held that it described a controversy suitable for a declaration,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>and he entered judgment in appropriate form upholding the constitutionality of the statute. He noted that a broad attack on the laws regulating the possession of (as well as the traffic in) marihuana had been repelled by this court in the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leis, </em>355 Mass. 189 (1969).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the <em>Leis </em>case was to be overruled, he thought it should be done by the full bench. We are not prepared to overrule that 1969 decision, and accordingly we affirm the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">In the <em>Leis </em>case we disagreed with the contention that the use of marihuana involved a liberty of high constitutional rank. <em>Id. </em>at 195. Therefore the validity of the legislation was to be tested in the first place by inquiring whether it bore a reasonable relation to any permissible object of legislation such as the protection of public health or safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">We may observe that in the hands of this court, at least, such an inquiry has not been merely pro forma with a preordained conclusion favorable to the legislation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>368 Mass. 92, 96 (1975); <em>Coffee-Rich, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>348 Mass. 414 (1965); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>322 Mass. 755 (1948). In <em>Leis </em>the record at trial level comprised an inquiry through expert testimony into the medical and related aspects of the marihuana problem. See Marihuana and the Law: A Judicial Opinion, 3 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 23 (1968) (excerpts from trial judge\u2019s opinion). On review, we took note of the scientific evidence and concluded, as had the trial judge, that the Legislature could believe with reason that the use of marihuana created dangers both to users and to others justifying public control. Marihuana is a psychoactive drug whose immediate effects may include inducement of a state of euphoria or anxiety or panic, reduction in motor control, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>alterations of time perceptions and memory. Although the causal links could be disputed, there was ground to suspect that use of the drug was a factor in psychotic incidents experienced by some smokers, in the descent of users to harder and more dangerous drugs, and in the occurrence of highway accidents. As to the last danger, the difficulty or impossibility of testing drivers for marihuana intoxication could be thought to justify a ban on the substance rather than a qualified regulation of it. See <em>Leis, </em>355 Mass, at 195; 1972 Mass. House Doc. No. 5896, Ninth Interim Report of the Special Commission on Drug Abuse 85-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">A showing that, since <em>Leis, </em>doubts about the drug had been resolved in its favor beyond reasonable scientific dispute, would portend a different legal result. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>355 A.2d 79 (Conn. Supp. 1976). But the plaintiffs conceded at oral argument and in their brief that a fresh inquiry would yield no different result on application of a \u201crational relation\u201d test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the single justice said, the complaint admitted implicitly that marihuana can be harmful in some circumstances. And the most recent judicial opinions (not excluding <em>Ravin </em>v. <em>State, </em>537 P.2d 494 [Alas. 1975], which within certain limits held unconstitutional a prohibition of possession for private use) have found the apprehension of dangers to health and safety to be rationally based; they mention such risks as psychotic reactions and automobile accidents. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, supra; Blincoe </em>v. <em>State, </em>231 Ga. 886 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>56 Haw. 271 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kells, </em>199 Neb. 374 (1977).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The plaintiffs contend, however, that legislation which goes to the extreme of forbidding the possession in one\u2019s own home of a substance meant for personal use, invades a \u201czone of privacy\u201d <em>(Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 484 [1965]) and cannot be justified constitutionally by a slim demonstration of potential harm; better or more substantial reason would have to be shown. That contention, made in somewhat different form, was likewise rejected in <em>Leis </em>(355 Mass, at 195).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">It is true that \u201cprivacy\u201d has grown in constitutional estimation as related to certain matters in which individual autonomy is thought to be especially important and desirable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus it is held that individual choice as to procreation and other core concerns of human existence may be circumscribed by the State only in deference to highly significant public goals. See, e.g., <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 152 (1973); <em>Framingham Clinic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Southborough, 373 </em>Mass. 279, 285 (1977). And so, in our own decision of <em>Superintendent of Relchertown State School </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, 373 </em>Mass. 728, 738-742 (1977), we recognized a constitutional right of independent election, which may as well be called a right of privacy, as to the continuation of life itself: here the individual\u2019s choice whether to accept or decline medical treatment is normally beyond veto by the State. See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Privitera, </em>74 Cal. App. 3d 936 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The right to possess or use marihuana cannot be readily assimilated in character or importance to the kinds of rights just mentioned (cf. <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>429 U.S. 589, 600 n.26 [1977]), but the plaintiffs contend that <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>394 U.S. 557 (1969) (decided after <em>Leis), </em>is close to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>case. Stanley was prosecuted for the possession in his home of material claimed to be obscene. The Court wrote that \u201c[i]f the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch.\u201d 394 U.S. at 565. The difficulties of proving that possession of obscene matter in a particular case was with intent to distribute (a state of facts assumed to be subject to criminal punishment) would not \u201cjustify infringement of the individual\u2019s right to read or observe what he pleases. Because that right is so fundamental to our scheme of individual liberty, its restriction may not be justified by the need to ease the administration of otherwise valid criminal laws. . . . We hold that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit making mere private possession of obscene material a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568. The plaintiffs think the <em>Stanley </em>case suggests that possession of marihuana in the home merits like immunity from governmental intervention, even though no cognizable First Amendment interest is involved. In this connection they cite dicta from the later opinions in <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton, </em>413 U.S. 49 (1973), and <em>United States </em>v. Onto, 413 U.S. 139 (1973) (and might have added <em>United States </em>v. <em>12 200-Ft. Reels of Super 8 MM. Film, </em>413 U.S. 123, 126 [1973]). These cases, upholding prosecutions for public exhibition and transportation of obscene films against constitutional challenge, sought to distinguish <em>Stanley </em>as having been decided \u201con the narrow basis of the \u2018privacy of the home,\u2019 which was hardly more than a reaffirmation that \u2018a man\u2019s home is his castle.\u2019 \u201d 413 U.S. at 66. The Court said the \u201cprivacy right encompasses and protects the personal intimacies of the home\u201d <em>(Paris Adult Theatre </em>at 65), and the \u201cConstitution extends special safeguards to the privacy of the home, just as it protects other special privacy rights such as those of marriage, procreation, motherhood, child rearing, and education.\u201d Orito at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">This language does not announce a privacy doctrine universally demanding peculiar justification for enforcing the criminal law against conduct within private homes. Never<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>theless such justification may be required when the effects of the behavior are limited more or less to the hearth. Thus the <em>Paris Adult Theatre </em>and <em>Orito </em>cases were stressing the point that in <em>Stanley </em>the place of the possession, the confinement of the viewing of the material, reduced to a null force, or nearly so, any claim of deleterious public effects which could possibly legitimate the State\u2019s intrusion. See also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 291, 307 (1977). The <em>Stanley </em>Court had indeed said, replying to the argument that the private reading of obscene matter would cause antisocial conduct, that there was \u201clittle empirical basis\u201d for that assertion (394 U.S. at 566) and in all events the \u201cleast restrictive alternative\u201d analysis familiar in First Amendment discussions would require that the State legislate against the antisocial behavior rather than the ideas that caused it. In contrast, in the case of marihuana, we are bound to assume for constitutional purposes that the private use does have public results, does spill over into the public domain and touch matters of legitimate State interest, while the freedom impaired by the penal statute, taken at its highest evaluation, does not reach the level of that freedom conceived by the Court to be implicated in <em>Stanley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">We find direct confirmation for these views in <em>Stanley </em>where the Court speaks to possession of drugs among other contraband: \u201cWhat we have said in no way infringes upon the power of the State or Federal Government to make possession of other items, such as narcotics, firearms, or stolen goods, a crime. Our holding in the present case turns upon the Georgia statute\u2019s infringement of fundamental liberties protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. No First Amendment rights are involved in most statutes making mere possession criminal.\u201d 394 U.S. at 568 n.11.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>With near unanimity, courts have in fact rejected arguments like the plaintiffs\u2019, including that based on \u201cprivacy,\u201d for a constitutionally-protected right to have and use marihuana in the home. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Drotar, </em>416 F.2d 914 (5th Cir. 1969), vacated on other grounds, 402 U.S. 939 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>117 Ariz. 57 (1977); <em>Laird </em>v. <em>State, </em>342 So. 2d 962 (Fla. 1977); <em>Blincoe v. State, </em>231 Ga. 886 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Renfro, </em>56 Haw. 501 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kells, </em>199 Neb. 374 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>16 Wash. App. 553 (1976). The only contrary decision by an appellate court is that already mentioned, <em>Ravin </em>v. <em>State, </em>537 P.2d 494 (Alas. 1975),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which, it seems, may rest largely on the explicit privacy right found in art. 1, \u00a7 22, of the Alaska Constitution, adopted in 1972.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>It may indeed be that our discussion has taken too wide a range. If marihuana is supposed with some reason to be harmful to users, the Legislature may claim a power to act against it even without identifying effects on others. Whereas in the First Amendment\u2019s realm of information and belief a State \u201ccannot constitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of controlling a person\u2019s private thoughts\u201d <em>(Stanley, supra, </em>394 U.S. at 566), in matters of health and safety the State has long imposed varying constraints which seem directed to protecting individuals from themselves. This notion of governmental power is pervasive even though there is some idea also at work that in the end unhealthy individuals burden the community. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howie, </em>354 Mass. 769, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 999 (1968), where we upheld the constitutionality of legislation requiring motorcyclists to wear safety helmets.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Much health and safety legislation aims not at battling communicable diseases but at saving people from their own folly. Many of the laws controlling impure and unsafe foods and drugs aim not so much at educating the consumer as at keeping the suspect items wholly beyond his reach. Just how far the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>State may go in these directions before it encounters a firm right to individual choice, we need not now try to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The individual interests which are urged here against the conventional police-power reasons for the ban on marihuana are in essence merely recreational. These interests surely have their place in the assortment of liberties protected by due process guaranties (cf. <em>Selectmen of Framingham </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>366 Mass. 547 [1974]), but as they are relatively weak they do not overcome those conventional reasons or justifications. The total situation finds a place on the continuum of constitutional vulnerability (see note 4 supra) where judicial nullification of the proscriptive legislation appears unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">According to the present pattern of the criminal codes of the States of the Union, the possession of marihuana is illegal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See Soler, Of Cannabis and the Courts: A Critical Examination of Constitutional Challenges to Statutory Marijuana Prohibitions, 6 Conn. L. Rev. 601, 716-723 (1974); also vol. 3 of Marijuana: A Study of State Policies and Penalties (National Governors\u2019 Conference, Center for Policy Research and Analysis) 98-104 (1977). Nevertheless the wisdom of such legislation (and of correlative laws as to distribution) remains under active and even vehement debate. The menace to health and safety is clearly not as grave as was once supposed and, some would say, is minor compared to the dangers of a number of substances not controlled or banned. See J. Kaplan, Marijuana \u2014 The New Prohibition (1970). The enforcement problems and evils encountered under current law need not be dwelt on. Some countervailing benefits have been intimated above. These all sum up as matters for legislative deliberation and disposition, and it is worth noting that our Legislature has not been insensitive to the movement of public debate. Since the decision in <em>Leis, </em>the penalty for simple possession of mari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>huana has been reduced from up to three and a half years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine to six months\u2019 imprisonment and fine; for first convictions, probation is to be the normal sentence, with records sealed on completion of the term. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34, as amended through St. 1975, c. 369. The medical, social, and law enforcement aspects of marihuana have been and can be studied by the General Court with an intensity and a breadth no court can readily approximate. See 1972 Mass. House Doc. No. 5896, cited above. It is for that branch of government to decide, perhaps at the plaintiffs\u2019 urging, whether the present statute attains to the best solution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-15\">See <em>First Nat'l Bank </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>371 Mass. 773, 781, appeal pending in the Supreme Court of the United States, with question of jurisdiction reserved to hearing on the merits, 430 U.S. 964 (1977); <em>Sturgis </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>358 Mass. 37, 38 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b78-7\"> The defendants in <em>Leis, </em>prosecuted for possession of marihuana, possession with intent to sell, and conspiracy to violate the narcotic drug laws, moved in Superior Court to dismiss on constitutional grounds.
