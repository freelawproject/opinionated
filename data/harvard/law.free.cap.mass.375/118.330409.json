App. Ct. 506, 509-510 (1977). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. We agree that the judge\u2019s charge on the question of intent was inadequate and we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">We also agree with the Appeals Court that the crime of attempt involves an intent to commit a substantive crime. <em>Id. </em>at 507. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hebert, </em>373 Mass. 535, 537 (1977). The judge never so instructed the jury, although the defendant adequately raised the point by a request for such an instruction. No clear and fair implication that such an intent was required can be found from reading the charge as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">The Commonwealth argues that a crime can be made out under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26, without proving any criminal intent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It well may be that the first clause of \u00a7 26 \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>\u201c[w]hoever, without lawful authority, forcibly or secretly confines or imprisons another person within this commonwealth against his will . . . shall be punished\u201d \u2014 states a crime which does not require a specific criminal intent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>5 Allen 518, 528 (1863), which dealt with Gen. Sts. c. 160, \u00a7 30, a statute substantially the same as \u00a7 26. However, an attempt to commit that crime, as with any other attempt, does require a specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We note that the indictment appears to be derived from the third clause of \u00a7 26, and we agree with the Appeals Court that the third clause does require an intent to commit the crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ware, supra </em>at 507. That clause reads \u201c[whoever] forcibly <em>seizes </em>and confines or inveigles or kidnaps another person, with <em>intent </em>either to cause him to be secretly confined or imprisoned in this commonwealth against his will ... or in any way held to service against his will, shall be punished\u201d (emphasis supplied). Even if we were to ignore the allegations of the indictment incorporating language from the third clause of \u00a7 26 as surplusage <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>365 Mass. 421, 440 [1974], <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farren, </em>9 Allen 489, 491 [1864], and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Squire, </em>1 Met. 258, 261 [1840]), leaving only those words which parallel the language of the first clause of \u00a7 26, the failure to instruct on intent to attempt that crime requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">We see no need to discuss the other issues raised by the defendant\u2019s appeal. The judgment of the Superior Court on indictment No. 93195 is reversed, and the verdict on that indictment is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-12\">'The first sentence of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26, as appearing in St. 1971, c. 900, reads as follows: \u201cWhoever, without lawful authority, [1] forcibly or secretly confines or imprisons another person within this commonwealth against his will, or [2] forcibly carries or sends such person out of this commonwealth, or [3] forcibly seizes and confines or inveigles or kidnaps another person, with intent either to cause him to be secretly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>fined or imprisoned in this commonwealth against his will, or to cause him to be sent out of this commonwealth against his will or in any way held to service against his will, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than ten years or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars and in for not more than two</p>\n<p id=\"Aoa\">The clauses referred to in this opinion as the first, second, and third are preceded in the above quotation by [1], [2], and [3], respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
