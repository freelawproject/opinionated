L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>and of having the shotgun in his possession, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (h). He appealed to the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case here on our own motion. The only question argued is whether there was a fatal variance between the complaints and the proof. We hold that there was not, and affirm the convictions. Although the violation of \u00a7 10 <em>(h) </em>was in the circumstances included in the violation of \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>the sentences were concurrent. Hence, we hold, the duplication did not prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">1. <em>Variance. </em>The \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>complaint described the weapon as \u201ca firearm, to wit a .12 gouge [sic] Harrington and Richardson shotgun.\u201d The \u00a7 10 <em>(h) </em>complaint was similar. The shotgun had a barrel more than eighteen inches long and was therefore not a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the definition in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. Under \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>the carrying of a shotgun in a vehicle is forbidden, whatever the length of barrel. An ordinary shotgun may be carried by a holder of a \u201cfirearm identification card\u201d issued under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B; subject to exceptions a license to carry firearms issued under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, is required to carry a \u201cfirearm.\u201d Under \u00a7 10 <em>(h) </em>possession of either a \u201cfirearm\u201d or a shotgun is forbidden unless there is compliance with the requirements relating to a firearm identification card in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In general, a crime must be proved as charged and must be charged as proved. But a defendant is not to be acquitted on the ground of variance between the allegations and proof if the essential elements of the crime are correctly stated, unless he is thereby prejudiced in his defense. G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 35. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 673, 677-678 (1977). Here the complaints correctly stated the essential elements of carrying a shotgun in a vehicle and possessing a shotgun, and any allegation as to the length of the barrel was surplusage. Before the defendant was arrested he said he did not have a license for the gun, and there is no contention that he had either a license to carry it or a firearm identification card. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number><em>Jones, </em>372 Mass. 403, 406 (1977). There is no claim that he was prejudiced in his defense by the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We do not condone the confusing use of the word \u201cfirearm\u201d in the complaints. They should have been amended as soon as the defect came to light. But the defendant is not entitled to an acquittal in the absence of prejudice. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moscatiello, </em>257 Mass. 260, 261-262 (1926) (carrying versus carrying under control in a vehicle), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ohanian, </em>373 Mass. 839, 843-844 (1977) (likelihood of prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">2. <em>Duplication. </em>In the circumstances of this case it is clear that the charge of carrying under the defendant\u2019s control in a vehicle included all the elements of possession, and that there was duplication in the charges. Hence only the sentence imposed on the more serious crime, violation of \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>is valid. <em>Kuklis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>361 Mass. 302, 305-309 (1972). The defendant has not argued the point, but we would take notice of it on our own motion if the defendant had been prejudiced. Since the sentences imposed were concurrent, however, we do not disturb them. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiley, </em>373 Mass. 454, 461-462 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
