L. c. 166, \u00a7 42B), possession of marihuana, a controlled substance (c. 94C, \u00a7 34)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and possession of a firearm without obtaining a firearm identification card (c. 140, <em>\u00a7 </em>129C), the defendant took his appeals to the Superior Court for trial de nova. The defendant had also been indicted for possessing unlawfully intercepting devices (c. 272, \u00a7 99 C 5), and possessing burglarious implements (c. 266, \u00a7 49). Trial of these indictments was joined with the appeals. The judge, trying jury waived, found the defendant guilty of all five offenses. He fined the defendant a total of $1,562.50 on the three complaints, and on the indictments imposed concurrent sentences of one year\u2019s imprisonment in a house of correction suspended for three years, with probation for an equivalent period.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">On the present review in this court of the judgments of conviction, the defendant centers his attack on the trial judge\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress materials seized by the Commonwealth. He contends that there was irregularity in the issuance of the warrant initiating the search by which the Commonwealth obtained these articles. But if the warrant was properly issued, the defendant urges that the seizure exceeded the authority of the warrant, and that the judge in all events erroneously cast the burden of proving illegality on the defendant. Besides raising these issues about the search, the defendant says with regard to the firearm conviction that he was exempted from the requirement of an identification card because the possession was necessary for his operation as a federally licensed firearms \u201cdealer.\u201d These are the only contentions made.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The witnesses heard on the motion to suppress were the person on whose affidavit a search warrant issued, officers who participated in the search, and the defendant. Interrogation was full and rather less formal than would normal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ly occur before a jury. The judge made written findings responsive to the proof and this we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">On August 28, 1974, J. Walter Kiley, accompanied by an assistant attorney general, appeared before a judge of the Superior Court and swore an affidavit as follows. Kiley was a \u201csecurity representative\u201d of the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company in Boston, qualified in electrical engineering with particular reference to telephone transmissions. Commencing in May, 1974, information reached him that an unusually large number of calls, most of them of uncommonly long duration, had been made to toll-free numbers from a telephone listed to the defendant at 173 Willow Street, Waltham. This suggested that the caller might be obtaining telephone service fraudulently. Kiley arranged for the surveillance of the suspected telephone source through a mechanical monitor (a checking procedure permitted by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 25ll[2][a][i] [1970], and G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 D la). The monitoring established that on eleven occasions the caller, after dialing a toll-free number, had caused a \u201c2600 Hertz tone\u201d to be emitted which enabled the caller to reach a long distance commercial number other than the toll-free number and to evade billing for it. Kiley averred that in all likelihood the emissions were actuated by an electronic instrument called a \u201cblue box\u201d placed on the telephone line or close to the telephone transmitter. Kiley concluded that there was probable cause to believe that a blue box or boxes and other described paraphernalia would be found concealed in the defendant\u2019s apartment on the first floor of 173 Willow Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">On the submission made, the judge on August 28 signed a search warrant which, following the affidavit, directed search at the premises mentioned for blue boxes and any other equipment or material by which the 2600 Hertz tone could be generated, including plans or publications relating to the operation of a blue box. The wording of the warrant is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>State troopers connected with the organized crime section of the Attorney General\u2019s office executed the warrant the same afternoon. One or more of the officers were knowledgeable in electronic devices; and one or more were acquainted with the defendant, a former private detective who had been refused a renewal of his license to practice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the officers demanded entrance under the warrant, there was no response, and the door was therefore forced. The place was in considerable disarray. The defendant was in bed, and two other persons were also present. Search was undertaken throughout the apartment. Very shortly a blue box was found (measuring on two sides 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 inches) . The search continued for another hour or more and resulted in further seizures: an attache case with electronic intercepting equipment, a musette bag with burglarious tools and some electronic equipment, a quantity of marihuana and a pipe with marihuana residue, and two automatic handguns with a considerable amount of ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">1. The search is attacked as illegal from the start because the application for the warrant, presumably following the form set out at G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 2 B,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was signed by Kiley who was also the affiant of the affidavit supplying the basic facts. The defendant contends, as we understand him, that the applicant must be an officer, not a private individual. The language of the statute is not altogether clear,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>are not called on to attempt a definitive interpretation because the assistant attorney general was present in person and thus gave clear official sponsorship to the application, which satisfies the essence of the claimed requirement. The warrant itself, following the form at \u00a7 2A, was properly addressed \u201c[t]o the Sheriffs of our several counties, or their deputies, any State Police Officer, or any Constable or Police Officer of any city or town, within our said Commonwealth,\u201d and was executed conformably.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">We add, first, that having officers rather than private individuals make the formal applications to magistrates for search warrants is not only the customary practice but the desirable one. It may be noted that Rule 41(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure was recently so amended as to ensure that private applications are excluded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, we stress that using the affidavit by Kiley, in support of the application, to supply the basic information establishing probable cause, was both proper and commendable because he had direct knowledge of the facts. Frequently the magistrate acts on an affidavit which consists only of a hearsay summary of information provided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the affiant by others. Where feasible \u2014 and we are quite aware that it is not always so \u2014 it is the better practice to produce the more direct evidence. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>374 Mass. 142, 144 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">2. Except for the argument just disposed of, it is not questioned that the Kiley affidavit justified the issuance of a search warrant with the breadth shown at n.2. Thus the warrant legalized a search throughout the apartment in pursuit of the materials described. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>361 Mass. 384, 387 (1972). The officers were not required to stop with the blue box which was validly seized at the center of the search and would indeed have been less than fully obedient to the command of the warrant if they had done so. If further search should turn up additional materials designated in the warrant, those of course could be taken. Moreover, in the process of a continuing search directed to finding the designated materials \u2014 not a merely general exploratory search or a search pointed to things known or suspected to be present but not mentioned in the warrant (cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rand, </em>363 Mass. 554, 558 n.2 [1973]) \u2014 the officers could seize articles \u201cin plain view.\u201d By that somewhat misleading expression is meant articles which are come by \u201cinadvertently\u201d \u2014 without particular design \u2014 and which, on being discovered, are reasonably believed by the officers to be connected with criminal activity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wojcik, </em>358 Mass. 623, 626-630 (1971); <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 465-467 (1971). It is not required that the police, having already lawfully disturbed privacy, shall delay an otherwise valid seizure to abide their procuring another warrant. <em>Anglin </em>v. <em>Director, Patuxent Inst., </em>439 F.2d 1342, 1347 (4th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">A distinction should be taken here. \u201cMere evidence\u201d inadvertently found, see <em>Coolidge, supra </em>at 464, may be seized only if the officers recognize it to be plausibly related as proof to criminal activity of which they were already aware. The \u201cnexus\u201d problem was examined in <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294 (1967), and that and other cases were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>recently applied in <em>Andresen </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>427 U.S. 463 (1976), to a situation of unnamed documentary items turning up during search under a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">There is other material that may be taken not only in the circumstances just described, but also when it bespeaks the likelihood of some criminal conduct of which the officers may have had no prior awareness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This material comprises, to quote the Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, \u201ccontraband, the fruits of crime, or things otherwise unlawfully possessed\u201d and \u201cweapons or other things used or likely to be used as means of committing crime\u201d (often called instrumentalities of crime). <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 SS 210-3(1)(b) and (c); see \u00a7\u00a7 SS 220.3(5), 260.6. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMasi, </em>362 Mass. 53, 58-59 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>279 Md. 189, 194-198 (1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Golay, </em>502 F.2d 182, 185 (8th Cir. 1974); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Honore, </em>450 F.2d 31, 33 (9th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1048 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">There is no difficulty in holding valid the seizure in the present case of the substance recognized as marihuana, although, be it noted, scientific proof that it was such, as well as proof of the knowing possession needed ultimately to establish the crime, were not available at the moment of taking. The marihuana was nevertheless \u201ccontraband,\u201d and seizable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wojcik, supra </em>at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">In the category of \u201cinstrumentalities\u201d were the electronic devices for interception, and chief among these was the attache case with self-contained equipment, including concealed microphone and tape recorder, for receiving oral communications. It appeared likely that this rig and the electronic items in the musette bag were designed and kept for clandestine and thus for illegal use. For possession of intercepting devices is illegal \u201cunder circumstances evincing an intent to commit an interception\u201d not allowed by the statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 C 5, as appearing in St. 1968, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>c. 738, \u00a7 1; and \u00a7 99 outlaws generally clandestine recordings of oral communications. The tools seized \u2014 including wire strippers, a complete lock-picking kit, an inertial hammer, a \u201cshove knife,\u201d and tinfoil (capable of circumventing alarm systems) \u2014 were adapted for accomplishing various kinds of break-ins and, it seemed, for little else (full-blown violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 49, requires a keeping of the implements in order to commit a crime, which need not be burglary or larceny). The guns and ammunition<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> could be readily linked in purpose to the burglar\u2019s tools; on occasion, indeed, when associated with equipment for break-ins, guns have been considered \u201cburglarious\u201d within the meaning of the familiar statutes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">To the inferences invited by the very appearance and nature of the instrumentalities (see <em>Harp </em>v. <em>State, </em>136 Ga. App. 897 [1975]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>143 N.J. Super. 314 [1976]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>87 S.D. 61 [1972]), further persuasive factors are added. Through the discovery of the blue box, the officers had knowledge that the defendant very probably was involved in the commission of crime (see <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 170 [1949]; <em>Anglin </em>v. <em>Director, Patuxent Inst., </em>439 F.2d 1342, 1348 [4th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>1971]), and crime of a type not distant from that suggested by the other electronic materials found. Cf. <em>Aron </em>v. <em>United States, </em>382 F.2d 965, 973 (8th Cir. 1967). And, as the judge reasoned, the discovery at the site both of the burglar\u2019s tools and the electronic equipment (to some extent in physical association in the musette bag) reinforced the case for the seizure of each category, as illegal interception could be expected often to require illegal entry. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>355 Mass. 170, 176 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">With respect to \u201cinstrumentalities\u201d as with \u201cfruits\u201d and other things taken on a basis of \u201cplain view,\u201d there is always a question how tendentious the material must be, how close a bearing to crime it must appear to have, in order to legalize seizure. To the degree that the connection is allowed to be lax, the evils of unconstitutional general warrants may be introduced. On the other hand, it is acknowledged that the relevant judgments made by the officers need not be proved correct in hindsight; they need only have been sensible when made. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>527 F.2d 984, 985 (4th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 945 (1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Golay, </em>502 F.2d 182, 185 (8th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Considering what was known and observed by the officers, we think they were justified in their immediate reaction of taking the intercepting and other devices and articles into custody to abide further investigation and decision whether to prosecute. Their response seems no less proper as a police measure than those permitted as to evidence or \u201cfruits\u201d in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haefeli, </em>361 Mass. 271, 281 (1972), habeas corpus granted sub nom. <em>Haefeli </em>v. <em>Chernoff, </em>394 F. Supp. 1079 (D. Mass.), rev\u2019d, 526 F.2d 1314 (1st Cir. 1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMasi, </em>362 Mass. 53, 58-59 (1972). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>361 Mass. 384, 386 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wojcik, </em>358 Mass. 623, 631 (1971). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dauphinee, </em>538 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>Aron </em>v. <em>United States, </em>382 F.2d 965 (8th Cir. 1967); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Eisner, </em>297 F.2d 595 (6th Cir. 1962); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>143 N.J. Super. 314 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>As to burden of proof: When the defendant was challenging the search warrant, valid on its face, on the ground that Kiley was not a proper applicant, the burden was on the defendant to demonstrate the illegality. It is not altogether clear on the record that the judge had in mind a similar allocation of the burden when the proceedings turned to the seizure in plain view which, as it relied on an exception from the usual requirement of a search warrant describing the things to be seized, might well call for a demonstration of legality on the part of the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Antobenedetto, </em>366 Mass. 51 (1974).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In any event we think the judge\u2019s mistake, if there was one, would be harmless, as the result should be the same if the burden were considered to be shifted. What had to be shown was more than a suspicion of criminal involvement, something definite and substantial, but not a prima facie case of the commission of a crime, let alone a case beyond a reasonable doubt. See Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 120.1(2)(3), Commentary at 292 ff.; \u00a7 SS 210.1(7) (a)(b), Commentary at 499-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">3. The defendant was convicted of possession, without identification card, of a firearm, a .25 caliber Bauer automatic handgun, one of the two guns seized. He claims exemption because he held a Federal firearms dealer\u2019s license (due to expire two days after the search and his simultaneous arrest), but we cannot fault the judge\u2019s finding that this weapon, bolstered, loaded with a clip of \u201csilver\u201d bullets, and accompanied by a clip of copper-jacketed bullets, all found in a night table next to the defendant\u2019s bed, did not, in the circumstances and setting, fit the language or purpose of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C <em>(b).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The complaint was for possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\"> The relevant language was: \u201ca device or devices known as a \u2018blue box\u2019, or a tape recording or tape recordings containing a 2600 Hz tone and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>which is designed to be used in connection with or instead of a \u2018blue box,\u2019 and any other material which is designed or used for switching or generating a 2600 Hz signal for use with telephone facilities and plans, instructions and publications relating to the operation of a \u2018blue-box\u2019, which are being used to further a scheme to defraud by means of a wire communication in violation M.G.L.

L. c. 276, \u00a7 1, regarding issuance of a search warrant may possibly be read as intimating that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>private person may apply, whereas \u00a7 2B setting out the form of the application (which is itself an affidavit) invites the applicant to \u201cdescribe position, assignment, office, etc.,\u201d which indicates that he or she is an officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The pertinent language of rule 41(a), as amended in 1972, is: \u201cA search warrant authorized by this rule may be issued . . . upon request of a federal law enforcement officer or an attorney for the government.\u201d See Preliminary Draft of Proposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts 72-73 (Judicial Conference of the United States, Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, 1970). See also Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure 508-509 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The search warrant question is distinct from that of applications by private persons for criminal complaints, discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haddad, </em>364 Mass. 795, 798-800 (1974). Cf. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Roxbury Dist., </em>372 Mass. 315 (1977). It was noted in <em>Haddad </em>that the danger of harassment by private complaints was mitigated by G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, which allows a person complained of to oppose issuance of the complaint against him. A search warrant issues ex parte and results in an immediate intrusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\"> The line drawn here between \u201cmere evidence\u201d and other material in plain view is of course not always an obvious one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b222-6\"> The argument for suppression concentrated here on the .25 caliber handgun which was the subject of the prosecution under the firearms law.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">We need not consider whether the handgun in the present situation, but without the association mentioned which put it into the \u201cinstrumentality\u201d category, could qualify as \u201ccontraband\u201d when the lack of an identification card was not known to the officers and a direct question seems not to have been put to the supposed owner. In prior cases a handgun was taken as \u201ccontraband\u201d when found with a defaced serial number <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pellier, </em>362 Mass. 621, 624 [1972]), or was seizable as \u201cevidence\u201d of a committed crime <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>364 Mass. 767, 771 [1974]). Weapons found in moving vehicles, and shotguns and like weapons are easier cases for warrantless seizure (assuming, of course, that the officer comes upon them in some lawful manner).
