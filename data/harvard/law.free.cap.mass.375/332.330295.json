It was brought by the First Church in Somerville (Unitarian) \u2014 hereafter First Church \u2014 and the Unitarian Universalist Association (Association). The plaintiffs named as defendants the Attorney General of the Commonwealth, the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), the President <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>and Fellows of Harvard College (Harvard), and the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company, successor trustee under Tyler\u2019s will. The case was heard by a single justice of this court on the pleadings and on a statement of agreed facts. The single justice concluded that the dissolution of the First Church in 1975 was an occurrence that prompted a gift over to MGH and Harvard equally, in trust for charitable purposes specified in the will.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Only the Association and the Attorney General have appealed. The Attorney General\u2019s position is that judgment should have been entered for the Association by the single justice. In a previous case, the real estate of the dissolved corporation and seven restricted funds held by it had been transferred to the Association by order of a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court. The Association now prays that the Tyler Fund similarly be transferred to it, the income to be paid to the First Universalist Church of Somerville so long as it continues to offer Unitarian Universalist services, then to the Association itself. The Association argues that this may be accomplished either by recognizing the Association as a \u201csuccessor\u201d or \u201cassign\u201d of the First Church, within the meaning of the will and then permitting deviation from the testator\u2019s stated intent, or else by applying the fund cy pres.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">As will be seen <em>infra, </em>we conclude that the details of Tyler\u2019s will can no longer be carried out, but that this is not an appropriate case for deviation or cy pres. Construing the gift-over provision liberally to prevent the charitable trust from failing and the fund from passing by intestate succession, we conclude that the dissolution of the First Church prompted a gift over to MGH and Harvard.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Columbus Tyler died testate in 1881. A founding member of the First Congregational Society of Somerville, Massa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>chusetts (Society), Tyler devised his home, subject to certain life interests to the Society, and he also left the residue of his estate in trust to the \u201cSociety its successors and assigns forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Article Sixteenth of the will detailed the purposes of the residuary trust. Tyler directed that the trust be used; (a) to encourage attendance at Sabbath School by providing an annual deposit into a savings bank for each boy or girl who regularly attended Sabbath sessions; (b) to establish a \u201cFlower Mission\u201d which might spend up to $250 a year to distribute flowers to the sick and to decorate the church; (c) to apply a maximum of $100 annually to discharge the debts of the Society or to repair the church buildings; and (d) to apply such remainder of income, after the above expenditures, as is necessary \u201cto lessen the taxes upon the Pews of those persons who cannot afford to pay them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">No part of the principal was to be spent. Moreover, should there be an \u201caccumulation of income greater than the expenditure by [the] will required,\u201d then Article Sixteenth provides for the payment of such excess equally to Harvard \u201cfor the benefit of indigent students in the Theological department of that Institution,\u201d and to MGH as \u201ca part of the Appleton Fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Tyler also provided in Article Sixteenth that \u201c[i]f the . . . [Society] decline[s] to accept this trust with the obligations imposed, or if at any subsequent time in the future shall change its religious tenets and cease to inculcate a Liberal Religion then I declare these bequests annulled in [sic] inoperative and this estate hereby bequeathed with its accumulations both real and personal shall accrue\u201d equally to Harvard and MGH, for the purposes quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">The Attorney General argues that Tyler could not have meant his gift to the Society to fail on dissolution of the corporation and transfer of its assets to the Association, because he devised his residuary estate to the \u201c Society its successors and assigns forever.\u201d The language of the will, however, indicates that Tyler used the phrase in question as a term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>art in creating a continuing fiduciary relationship.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The phrase in question reflects an acceptable manner of conveying a fee to a corporation. See 3 American Law of Property \u00a7 12.76, at 344 (A.J. Gasner ed. 1952). In such transactions, it is customary, although not necessary, to use words of succession, paralleling the use of words of inheritance in private deeds. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, a law stating that technical terms such as \u201cassigns\u201d are not necessary to convey an estate in fee simple was not enacted in Massachusetts until 1912. G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 13, inserted by St. 1912, c. 502, \u00a7 19. We do not find the quoted phrase to be probative of Tyler\u2019s intent concerning disposition of the trust property on dissolution of the First Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">We also find no merit in the Attorney General\u2019s argument that this court should permit deviation from Tyler\u2019s specific mandates, which are now incapable of fulfilment. This is not a case where the trustee could continue to carry out the settlor\u2019s stated intent if permitted to deviate from administrative provisions of the gift which have become burdensome or impossible to carry out. See <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Quincy </em>357 Mass. 521, 533 (1970). See also <em>Millikin </em>v. <em>Littleton, </em>361 Mass. 576, 581 n.7 (1972). The limited purposes for which the Society, while in existence, was obliged to use the trust income indicate that the restrictions imposed by Tyler were not merely subordinate details. See <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Quincy, supra. </em>Rather, these limitations \u2014 together with the provision that excess income should go to Harvard and MGH equally \u2014 indicate that the restrictions were of controlling importance in the testator\u2019s over-all plan. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The Association and the Attorney General further argue that this is a proper case for modification of the trust under the doctrine of cy pres. It is not enough, however, that, due to changed circumstances, it has become impracticable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>administer the trust in the precise manner provided by the testator. E.g., <em>Teele </em>v. <em>Bishop of Derry, </em>168 Mass. 341, 343 (1897). Despite impracticability, cy pres will not apply if there is a lack of general charitable intent on the testator\u2019s part. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Wesley United Methodist Church </em>v. <em>Harvard College, </em>366 Mass. 247, 250 (1974). In order to determine the character of the testator\u2019s charitable intent, we look to the language of the will as a whole, and also to the circumstances relevant to the property involved in the testamentary trust. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>347 Mass. 126, 132 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Tyler was a founding member of the Society. Throughout thirty-five or so years of his life, Tyler devoted himself to strengthening the congregation he had helped to establish by serving as an officer of the Society, as chairman of the \u201cStanding Committee,\u201d and as a member of various temporary committees. When the church building was destroyed by fire in 1852 and had to be rebuilt, Tyler was instrumental in seeing that the Society\u2019s debts were paid. Tyler clearly knew of the existence of the Association\u2019s predecessor, the American Unitarian Association, a loose confederation of discrete Unitarian churches; he was a delegate at the 1874 convention of the organization, representing the independent views of the Society.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The conditional gift over to Harvard was consistent with Tyler\u2019s religious beliefs, since the Harvard Divinity School was a center of Unitarian learning throughout the mid-Nineteenth Century, all its professors being Unitarian until 1880. <em>Trustees of Andover Theological Seminary </em>v. <em>Visitors of the Theological Inst. in Phillips Academy, </em>253 Mass. 256, 289 (1925). Moreover, Tyler\u2019s ties with MGH are well documented. The Appleton Fund named in Tyler\u2019s will existed to help poor, curable patients of McLean Asylum (McLean), a part of MGH. Tyler had worked at McLean for thirty-six years, first as an attendant, later as steward; Tyler\u2019s wife was matron of the asylum. When the Tylers left the service of McLean in 1863, the board of trustees of the MGH offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>cially recognized their efforts. N.I. Bowditch, A History of the Massachusetts General Hospital 597-598 (2d ed. 1872).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We do not find any general intent to benefit religion which would authorize us to apply the doctrine of cy pres. On the contrary, we conclude that the intent of the testator in this case was to support the particular Unitarian church which he had helped establish and, in the alternative, to support Unitarian education at Harvard and the poor of McLean Asylum, who received the benefits of MGH\u2019s Appleton Fund. The Association\u2019s reliance on similar cases in which we have reached a different result is misplaced. See <em>First Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>371 Mass. 796 (1977); <em>Union Congregational Soc'y </em>v. <em>South Shore Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>342 Mass. 41 (1961); <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>248 Mass. 336 (1924). \u201cTo attempt to formulate a general rule which would solve all such cases would be an attempt to achieve the impossible.\u201d <em>First Universalist Soc'y </em>v. <em>Swett, </em>148 Me. 142, 150 (1952). Each case turns on the intent of the particular testator. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Easterbrooks </em>v. <em>Tillinghast, </em>5 Gray 17 (1855).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The Association and the Attorney General argue that the conditional gift-over provision found in Article Sixteenth has not been triggered, but we give this provision a liberal construction, as we must, in order to effectuate Tyler\u2019s stated charitable intent and to prevent the Tyler Fund from failing altogether and passing by intestate succession. See, e.g., <em>First Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 799. The will provides that if the Society \u201cat any subsequent time in the future shall change its religious tenets and cease to inculcate a Liberal Religion,\u201d then the interest of the Society shall pass to Harvard and MGH equally, for the purposes specified in the will. The Attorney General would read this provision as anticipating only a change in religious teaching from Unitarianism to trinitarian Congregationalism, but, of the several constructions that have been argued in this case, this is the most restrictive. We read the provision in question disjunctively and conclude that Tyler\u2019s language yields a gift over either if the Society changes its religious tenets or if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>it ceases to inculcate a \u201c Liberal Religion.\u201d By dissolving, the Society has ceased to inculcate any religion, and we hold that the gift over contemplated by the testator has taken effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\"> First Church in Somerville (Unitarian) is the same corporation referred to by Tyler in his will as the First Congregational Unitarian Society of Somerville.
