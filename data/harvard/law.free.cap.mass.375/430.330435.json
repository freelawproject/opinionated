Employees of the company inspected the properties, collated relevant data, and recommended valuations. The details, physical and financial, together with the inferences drawn from them, were posted by the company employees on standardized \u201cfield assessment cards.\u201d These were turned over to the board as part of the work contracted for, to be used by the board in preparing the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>tax valuations placed on the properties. Although, as indicated, the <em>Sudbury </em>case called for reassessment on the 100% basis, there was no legal requirement that the board go about the task by engaging a private company or by using field cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">On May 19, 1977, one John DiFranza, a resident of the city, wrote to the chairman of the board asking for a copy of the field card covering his home. He referred to the public records law (G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth). On the same day the chairman replied, denying the request under the claimed authority of <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Assessors of Sterling, </em>361 Mass. 692 (1972). Thereupon, DiFranza, initiating the prescribed statutory procedures (G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10), applied to the supervisor of public records (see G. L. c. 9, \u00a7 4) for a determination that the cards were public records under the law and thus subject to inspection and copying. The supervisor on June 22, 1977, made a favorable determination, setting forth his reasons in some detail, and ordered the board to make disclosure accordingly. As the board failed to comply, the supervisor requested the Attorney General, plaintiff herein, to commence an appropriate enforcement action. The Attorney General did so in this court for Suffolk County. A single justice ordered the action transferred to the Superior Court. There the parties entered into \u201cstipulations of fact\u201d describing the situation as set out above. A judge of the Superior Court held for the plaintiff and entered judgment declaring that the field cards were public records and requiring the defendant board to make them available to the public. After the defendant lodged its appeal in the Appeals Court, the plaintiff (appellee) applied to this court for direct appellate review, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1050, \u00a7 1, public records \u201cshall mean all . . . papers ... or other documentary materials or data, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by any . . . board ... of any political subdivision,\u201d with nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>stated exemptions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> General Laws c. 66, \u00a7 10, as amended through St. 1976, c. 438, \u00a7 2, in effect lays a duty on persons having custody of \u201cpublic records,\u201d as defined, to disclose them on request of \u201cany person\u201d (\u00a7 10 [a]), describes procedures for enforcing the duty, which comprehend the procedure followed here (\u00a7 10 [6]), and adds that \u201c[i]n any court proceeding pursuant to paragraph <em>(b) </em>there shall be a presumption that the record sought is public, and the burden shall be upon the custodian to prove with specificity the exemption which applies\u201d (\u00a7 10 [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The cards in question appear to fall patly within the current statutory definition (unless one or more of the exemptions applies), but the defendant board points to our decision in the <em>Dunn </em>case, <em>supra. </em>There the board of assessors of Sterling was upheld in its refusal to disclose field cards produced under contract with a private firm which had been engaged to assist it in making tax assessments. The facts correspond with the present case, but the difference is that the part of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, considered pertinent by the <em>Dunn </em>court, as it then stood \u2014 i.e., as amended through St. 1969, c. 831, \u00a7 2, before amendment by the 1973 statute \u2014 made the right to disclosure turn on whether the record \u201chas been made or is required to be made by law.\u201d This could not be predicated of the cards, which were a means of assisting the board in making assessments, but not a means required by law. See also <em>Town </em>Crier, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Weston, </em>361 Mass. 682 (1972); <em>Hardman </em>v. <em>Collector of Taxes of N. Adams, </em>317 Mass. 439 (1945).

(/) of cl. Twenty-sixth for \u201cinvestigatory materials\u201d may attach; but the irrelevance of par. (/) appears clearly from its text<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and from the case of <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. 59 (1976), where the exemption was explained and applied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Of the other statutory exemptions, par. (c), referring to disclosures that involve unwarranted invasions of privacy, and par. <em>(d), </em>dealing with certain intra-agency memoranda, conceivably might be thought pertinent, but on consideration they also are seen to be irrelevant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Our conclusion is not put in question, rather it is strengthened, by the several decisions in other jurisdictions about the disclosure of field cards.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, it is possible to foresee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>administrative burdens that will result from the classification of such cards as public records, but those difficulties may be eased by the language of c. 66, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(disclosure \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d), and in any event could not be allowed to compromise the plain terms of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u2018The full text of cl.
