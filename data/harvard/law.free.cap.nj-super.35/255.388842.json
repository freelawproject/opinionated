The facts are set forth in the opinion of Judge Conford before whom the case was tried, <em>Welch v. Welch, </em>34 <em>N. J. Super. </em>197 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1955). The State has an interest in actions for divorce and in the trial of such cases, particularly when they are <em>ex parte, </em>the utmost care should be taken in order to determine the <em>Iona fides </em>of the action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>Duerner v. </em>Duerner, 142 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>759, 761 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948). The trial judge had the advantage of observing the demeanor of the appellant and her witnesses and consequently had a better opportunity than this court to pass upon their credibility. After examining the record and considering the reasons given by the trial judge for not accepting the truthfulness of some of petitioner\u2019s testimony, we are not disposed to disturb his finding that the appellant failed to establish a cause of action. See <em>Rains v. Rains, </em>127 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>328, 332 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">' Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
