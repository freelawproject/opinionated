A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AXf\">On September <em>12, </em>1953 plaintiff and the defendant Thomas Gumina were driving their respective automobiles in Few Brunswick and there ensued a close escape from a collision between them. There was a running altercation between the two and the utterance of profanities by plaintiff against the defendant. Later that day Thomas and his brother, the defendant Carmen Gumina, went to the plaintiff\u2019s home, encountered him on the sidewalk and a scuffle took place. There were conflicting proofs as to who was the aggressor. Plaintiff sustained a fracture of the left wrist. There was treatment by immobilization in a cast for eight weeks and thereafter an operation involving a graft of bone from the leg. The wrist continued in a cast for three months. At the trial, a year after the injur}', the wrist was described medically as having a limitation of motion in both directions of about half-range but as being \u201ca useful wrist\u201d and \u201ccomparatively painless,\u201d except for occasional traumatic arthritis. The attending physician said the limitation in motion might improve with time. Plaintiff returned to his job after recovering and was working without reduction in earnings. He had actual damages of about $2,000 in lost earnings and medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Plaintiff brought this action for assault and battery. After submission of the evidence the trial judge in the Law Division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>instructed the jury concerning the showing required for recovery of compensatory and punitive damages and directed that if their determination was for the plaintiff the verdict should be in a lump sum for all elements of damages awarded. The verdict was for the plaintiff in the sum of $20,000. On motion by defendant the court granted a new trial unless the plaintiff accepted a reduction of the judgment to $9,000. This amount was stated as arrived at by the allowance of $2,000 for out-of-pocket disbursements and loss of wages; $1,000 for pain and suffering; $5,000 \u201cfor permanency\u201d; and $1,000 for punitive and exemplary damages. In a memorandum explaining his action the trial judge stated that the action of the jury \u201cvery definitely shocked the conscience of the court and indicated * * * that the size of the verdict rendered was the result of mistake on the part of the jury.\u201d Plaintiff declined to accept a reduction, and, on motion, was granted leave to appeal the award of a new trial by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Before considering the merits we notice the contention by defendants that the order under review was not appealable, within the 1953 amendatory addition to <em>B. B. 2:2-3 </em>(&amp;) : \u201cThis court may also in its discretion permit an appeal from an order granting a new trial solely for the review of legal errors.\u201d It is urged that alleged error in granting a new trial for excessiveness of damages is not \u201clegal error\u201d within the intent of the rule. In view of our conclusion on the merits we express no opinion in respect to this interesting problem. The subject may be more appropriately dealt with on a motion for leave to appeal in some other matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s contentions on the merits are: (1) the verdict of the jury was not clearly and convincingly the result of mistake, and (2) a jury verdict which includes punitive damages may not be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\"> Essentially, the determination of a proper case for setting aside a jury verdict reposes in the sound judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>discretion of the trial judge. <em>Hager v. Weber, </em>7 <em>N. </em>J. 201, 212 (1951). By amendment of <em>Rule </em>3:59-1 (now <em>R. R. </em>4:61-1) in 1951, the Supreme Court evidenced an intent that jury verdicts should be disturbed only with great caution by directing that \u201cthe trial judge shall not set aside the verdict of the jury as against the weight of the evidence unless, having given due regard to the opportunity of the jury to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses, it clearly and convincingly appears that the verdict was the result of mistake, partiality, prejudice or passion.\u201d Experience has proven that there cannot but be continuous difficulty and wide contrariety of result in the application of a test so loaded with subjective criteria as this. Yet the language of the rule substantially measured the court\u2019s discretion under the old practice as well. <em>Sokol v. Liebslein, </em>9 <em>N. J. </em>93, 97, 98 (1952). It appears, moreover, that the rule for the guidance of the trial judge in this kind of situation is, by its very nature, susceptible of only a limited sanction through \u25a0the appellate process. Although, in theory, the same conception as to verdicts so far contrary to the weight of the evidence as to give rise to the \u201cinescapable conclusion\u201d of mistake, passion, etc., governs both appellate and trial courts, <em>Hager v. Weber, supra </em>(7 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>210), it has been most emphatically called to our attention that \u201ca trial judge is in a better position than an appellate court to decide whether justice has been done under the particular circumstances and the weight of the credible evidence.\u201d <em>Hartpence v. Grouleff, </em>15 <em>N. J. </em>545, 549 (1954). In the <em>Hartpence </em>case the Appellate Division reversed an order granting a new trial, saying, \u201cManifestly and beyond all question the verdict here should not have been set aside,\u201d 28 <em>N. J. Super. </em>125, 129 (1953). The court conceived that it was applying the principle of appellate superintendence where the action of the trial judge in granting a new trial appears to constitute \u201ca manifest denial of justice.\u201d Compare the view under the former practice that the grant or refusal by the trial judge of a new trial for exeessiveness of a jury verdict will not be upset on appeal unless the judicial act is such an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>discretion \u201cas to shock reason and justice.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>46, 58 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1942). But the Supreme Court on appeal in the <em>Hartpence </em>case, <em>supra, </em>reversed, laying down the rule which must govern us, <em>viz., </em>that the action of the trial judge \u201cshould not be disturbed unless it <em>clearly and unequivocally </em>appears there was a manifest denial of justice under the law.\u201d (15 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>549) This Division, said our highest court, is not to substitute its judgment for that of the trial judge merely because we may evaluate the evidence in a light which would justify the jury verdict. Before we may set aside the action of the trial court we must be in a position to \u201cdemonstrate how the granting of the new trial would cause a denial of justice under the evidence and law of the case.\u201d (15 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>549)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"> It will therefore be clear that in the present posture of this cause we are not to accord a presumption of correctness to the verdict of the jury, but, rather, to the action of the trial judge. In other words, we do not look to see whether our appraisal of the proofs leads us to believe the verdict was clearly the result of mistake or of any of the other factors mentioned in <em>R. R. </em>4:61-1, but only inquire as to whether the trial judge\u2019s conclusion to that effect is supportable on any rational view of the case in the light of his having seen and heard the witnesses. A careful examination of the record does not lead us to the conclusion that the direction for a reduction in the instant case is insupportable, so viewed. We may entertain a different opinion in respect to his conclusion that the willful bodily assault which the jury found the defendants inflicted upon the plaintiff did not warrant more than $1,000 in punitive damages, or more than $1,000 for pain and suffering. But it is our view that our function is limited to the inquiry as to whether the reduction of the award to $9,000 in gross for all elements of damages is clearly a manifest denial of justice, whatever may be thought of the trial court\u2019s breakdown thereof among the component elements. In this regard we must consider that the function of the judge on the application was \u201cto enter into the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>of the cause, the evidence and facts, the circumstances and situations of the parties in the same manner as the jury.\u201d <em>Salvato v. N. J. Asphalt &amp; Paving Co., </em>135 <em>N. J. L. </em>185, 189 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">In determining whether the award was excessive it was thus appropriate for the court to consider the matter of provocation by plaintiff and the testimony that the defendant Thomas Gumina visited plaintiff after the fight, expressed contrition and took plaintiff to a doctor for treatment; also the comparatively moderate financial circumstances of the defendants, particularly Carmen, a college student. As to the pain and suffering and the degree of injury to the wrist, the judge had the plaintiff before him and could evaluate the medical testimony in the light of visual appraisal of the appearance and mobility of the wrist a year after the accident. We cannot conclude that, on the whole, there \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d was a manifest denial of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention that an award for punitive damages may not be reduced by a trial judge is not supported by the authorities, either here or elsewhere. It is the general rule that the jury may be permitted to combine in one verdict, as was done here, all items of damage growing out of the same cause of action, compensatory and punitive. 6 <em>C. J. S., Assault and Battery, </em>\u00a7 50, <em>p. </em>894; 25 <em>C. J. S., Damages, </em>\u00a7 188, <em>p. </em>903; see <em>Boniewsky v. Polish Home of Lodi, </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>241, 244 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1926), affirmed 103 <em>N. J. L. </em>323 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1927); <em>Dreimuller v. Rogow, </em>93 <em>N. J. L. </em>1, 3 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1919); <em>Dombroski v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>18 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>240, 243, 244 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1940), affirmed 126 <em>N. J. L. </em>545 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1941). The court may, however, require separate awards, <em>Hoffman v. Trenton Times, </em>17 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>339, 342 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939), affirmed 125 <em>N. J. L. </em>450 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940), and this is the wiser practice as it may save a new trial, at least in part, where there is error going only to one element of damage. See <em>Lamb v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>Woodry, </em>154 <em>Ore. </em>30, 58 P. <em>2d </em>1257, 1265 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1936). It might conceivably have done so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In <em>Haines v. Schultz, </em>50 <em>N. J. L. </em>481, 484 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1888), Justice Garrison characterized the doctrine of punitive damages as \u201ca sort of hybrid between a display of ethical indignation and the imposition of a criminal fine.\u201d It was written over a century ago that actions \u201cfor assault and battery are in their nature vindictive, and when a jury gives exemplary damages the court has no graduated scale by which to measure them, and its general and safest rule, is not to interfere, unless they are manifestly outrageous * * *.\u201d <em>Allen v. Craig, </em>13 <em>N. J. L. </em>294, 301 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1833). The implicit indication therein that an exemplary award may be reduced in an appropriate case has found occasional recognition since. See <em>Livesey v. Helbig, </em>87 <em>N. J. L. </em>303, 305 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1915); <em>Klein v. Millside </em>Farms, <em>Inc., </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>240 (1951); <em>Wax v. Altshuler, </em>22 <em>N. J. Super. </em>229 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952). We do not read <em>Leonard v. Hoboken Printing Co., </em>69 <em>N. J. L. </em>238 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1903), relied on by plaintiff, as being to the contrary. The power has not been doubted in other jurisdictions. <em>State v. Ellison, </em>268 <em>Mo. </em>225, 186 <em>S. W. </em>1075, 1077 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1916); <em>Booth v. People\u2019s Finance &amp; Thrift Co., </em>124 <em>Cal. App. </em>131, 12 P. <em>2d </em>50 <em>(D. Ct. App. </em>1932); <em>Flanary v. Wood, </em>32 <em>Tex. Civ. App. </em>250, 73 <em>S. W. </em>1072 <em>(Tex. Civ. App. </em>1903); <em>Taylor v. Williamson, </em>197 <em>Ia. </em>88, 196 <em>N. W. </em>713 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1924). There is no reason in policy why the general power of the trial court to superintend the jury in respect to damages should not be held to extend to punitive damages, notwithstanding the common law view that the function ought to be very sparingly exercised in such cases. See <em>Hanna v. Sweeney, </em>78 <em>Conn. </em>492, 62 <em>A. </em>785 <em>(Sup. Ct. Err. </em>1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
