BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Derrick Oden Brown, appellant, confessed to and was subsequently convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County of the March 26, 1988 murder of Renee Thomas. The jury\u2019s verdict was for second degree murder. Appellant was sentenced to a term of 30 years imprisonment, with all but 20 years suspended, in favor of 5 years probation upon his release. On appeal, he presents the following issues for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">1. Did the trial court improperly curtail defense counsel\u2019s argument respecting suppression of Appellant\u2019s statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">2. Did the trial court err in admitting hearsay evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-12\">3. Must Appellant\u2019s sentence be limited to a term of 20 years?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">The first issue has merit; we answer it in the affirmative. Consequently, we will reverse the conviction and remand the case to the circuit court for a new trial. We address the third issue for the guidance of the court on remand. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-604(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>SUPPRESSION HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"AON\">The victim, Renee Thomas, was found dead on March 26, 1988, in a wooded area to the rear of the John Eager Howard Elementary School, Capitol Heights, Maryland. She had been severely beaten about the face and head. The cause of death was determined to be homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">On August 2, 1988, appellant telephoned the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, homicide section, and confessed to the murder. Indicating a desire to turn himself in, he directed Detective Yeeder, to whom he confessed, to meet him at a Homoco gas station. Officers Shimp and Johnson went to the Homoco station, picked appellant up, and brought him back to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">At the police station, appellant was interrogated. As a result, he confessed, initially in a writing and subsequently by responding to questions the officers asked him. He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">I, Mr. Derrick, did have a problem with Renee Thomas, and I got her on the corner, and took here [sic] in the woods, and took her off the map.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Responding to the officers\u2019s questions, he said that Thomas was a friend; that he picked her up on Nova Avenue, and they had sex in the rear of his car; that he then took Thomas to the John Eager Howard School, where they again engaged in sex, this time on the school grounds; and that, as they were having sex, he grabbed several tree limbs with which he beat Thomas about the head. The only reason appellant gave for killing Thomas was that she had stolen twenty dollars from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Appellant moved to suppress his confession, contending that it was neither voluntarily nor knowingly made. <em>See Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 150-54, 406 A.2d 415 (1979). Specifically, he cited, in support of the motion, his intoxication and alleged suggestive comments by the police, both contested issues. Following an evidentiary hearing, defense counsel, by proceeding to present argument on the motion, prompted the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>MR. NILAND: Your Honor, the law in this area I think is, so far as I know, is fairly set out in several cases, ... with respect to the consideration of intoxication and/or the effect of intoxication upon a person in having given a statement and whether the statement\u2019s knowing and voluntary. I concede the law in those areas is not very definitive or clear cut in telling us what kind of cases intoxication has reached a level where a statement would not be knowing or voluntary and, in fact, cases indicate the simple fact that a person is intoxicated or under the influence of drugs does not per se make a statement involuntary or unknowingly given and, therefore, does not per se exclude a statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">Now, however, I think that in this case you have several factual considerations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">THE COURT: <em>Let me stop you right here. </em>I am aware of everything that you\u2019ve just told me and so forth and I really would give a lot more consideration to what you\u2019re saying except for one factor in this case, and <em>I\u2019m going to cut you short because I have to be someplace else. </em>But the problem I have in this case in regards to anything you\u2019re going to tell me about intoxication, drugs, whether it\u2019s free or voluntary, this is not the usual case that I see where there is an arrest made by the police or \u2014 your client initiated this whole procedure. It wasn\u2019t as a result of anything that the police did in this case that he was in Forestville.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">MR. NILAND: I agree with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">THE COURT: It was as a result of what he did and his actions in getting to Forestville were free and voluntary on his part. The police had nothing to do with getting him there. It was his idea. It was at his insistence. It was at his phone calls that he was in Forestville being questioned by the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">MR. NILAND: I don\u2019t disagree that he initiated the contact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">THE COURT: That\u2019s what takes this case out of the ordinary\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>MR. NILAND: To an extent it does, but it also reflects upon his lack of judgment as a result of having been engaged in the use, heavy use of alcohol and drugs before he contacted the police. Most sensible people, I would think most sensible people wouldn\u2019t call the police and say come and get me and talk about homicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApP\">THE COURT: <em>I\u2019m going to cut this real short. </em>That\u2019s a problem for the jury, as far as I\u2019m concerned. At this time I\u2019m convinced by a preponderance of the evidence that what he \u2014 whatever statements he made orally or written were freely and voluntarily given and as a consequence your motion to suppress any and all statements in this case are denied. Always a pleasure to see you gentlemen. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Analogizing argument on a motion to suppress to closing argument in a criminal case, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in cutting off argument, and without allowing the completion of argument, rendering a decision on the motion. He argues that he was entitled to a full and fair opportunity to present argument prior to the court\u2019s announcement of a decision. He relies on <em>Spence v. State, </em>296 Md. 416, 419-420, 463 A.2d 808 (1983) and <em>Martinez v. State, </em>309 Md. 124, 522 A.2d 950 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\"><em>Spence </em>makes clear \u201cthat the opportunity for summation by defense counsel prior to a verdict in a non-jury trial as well as in a jury trial is a basic constitutional right guaranteed by Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution as applied to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>296 Md. at 419, 463 A.2d 808. <em>See also Cherry v. State, </em>305 Md. 631, 635, 506 A.2d 228 (1986), where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae\">The constitutional right of a defendant to be heard through counsel necessarily includes his right to have counsel make a proper argument on the evidence and the applicable law in his favor, however simple, clear, unimpeached, and conclusive the evidence may seem, unless he has waived his right to such argument, or unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>argument is not within the issues in the case, and the trial court has no discretion to deny accused such right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACu\">Neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has rendered a similar holding as to the right of a defendant, through counsel, to argue a suppression motion. The issue was before the court in <em>Martinez, supra; </em>it was one of the issues as to which the Court of Appeals granted certiorari. The case was decided on other grounds, however, and that issue was not reached. <em>See </em>309 Md. at 130, 522 A.2d 950. Nevertheless, the court\u2019s comments on the nature and importance of a suppression hearing are instructive. Addressing the question whether an accused\u2019s right to force disclosure of grand jury testimony for purposes of cross-examining a State\u2019s witness who has testified on direct examination, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">A suppression hearing is a critical part of the criminal adjudicatory process. The Supreme Court has noted, with good reason, that \u201csuppression hearings often are as important as the trial itself.\u201d <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 46-7, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 2215, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984) (citations omitted). For example, the State\u2019s case may turn upon the defendant\u2019s confession or other evidence he seeks to suppress, and the trial court\u2019s ruling on such matters may be dispositive of the outcome of the case. Thus, if the defendant prevails at the hearing, the State\u2019s case could be seriously crippled, possibly prompting a dismissal of charges or some other disposition favorable to the defendant. On the other hand, if the State is successful, the suppression hearing may be the <em>only </em>proceeding, because the defendant thereafter pleads guilty pursuant to a plea bargain. <em>See id. </em>at 47, 104 S.Ct. at 2215.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">Moreover, a suppression hearing resembles a full trial in many respects. Witnesses are sworn and provide testimony, and opposing counsel present arguments. Significantly, the outcome of the hearing will frequently turn on the trier of fact\u2019s evaluation of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. <em>See id. </em>(citation omitted) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>(\u201cThe outcome frequently depends on a resolution of factual matters.\u201d). As such, access to grand jury testimony for use during cross-examination to impeach a witness, to refresh his memory, or to test his credibility, will significantly aid the defense at a crucial stage in the case. Beyond the benefit to the defendant, the availability of such testimony will enhance the accuracy of the factual determinations made at the suppression hearing____ (Emphasis in original, citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">309 Md. at 143-44, 522 A.2d 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">These comments are particularly apposite to the case <em>sub judice. </em>Without appellant\u2019s confession, the State\u2019s case would have been crippled and,- more likely, irretrievably lost. Thus, we hold that, in this case, it was crucial that appellant be afforded a full and fair opportunity to present closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The State suggests, as it did in <em>Martinez, </em>that the importance of the suppression hearing is undermined by virtue of the fact that the issue raised by the motion to suppress can be, and more likely than not will be, relitigated at trial. The Court in <em>Martinez </em>had little difficulty rejecting that argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">We reject this contention. It is well settled that a defendant in a criminal case has a constitutional right to \"have a \u201cfair hearing and a reliable determination\u201d that his confession was given voluntarily, a determination uninfluenced by the truth or falsity of the confession____ This is essential because the defendant in a criminal case \u201cis deprived of due process of law if his conviction is founded, in whole or in part, upon an involuntary confession, without regard for the truth or falsity of the confession\u2014 \u201d ... In this'State, two steps are involved in the voluntariness determination. As we explained in <em>State v. Kidd, </em>281 Md. 32, 37, 375 A.2d 1105, 1109, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1002, 98 S.Ct. 646, 54 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977) (citations omitted) \u201c[t]he trier of fact passes on traditional voluntariness only after the judge, upon a hearing, out of the presence of the jury, has fully and independently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>resolved the issues against the accused.\u201d The trial judge\u2019s initial determination, which is wholly separate from the ultimate presentation of the issue to the jury, addresses the confession\u2019s initial admissibility. If the trial judge determines that the confession is not voluntary, the confession is not admitted into evidence and the trier of fact never considers it____ However, if the trial judge concludes that the confession is voluntary, it is received in evidence and its admission becomes prima facie proof that the statement is freely and voluntarily given____ Thus, the defendant has a constitutionally protected interest in having a trial judge\u2019s admissibility determination done correctly in the first instance, and that interest is not protected by the possibility that the trier of fact at some later point may have an opportunity to determine the voluntariness of the confession. (Citations and footnotes omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">309 Md. at 144-45, 522 A.2d 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">We now proceed to determine whether, under the circumstances here presented, the court committed reversible error by rendering a decision on the motion prior to appellant\u2019s completion of his argument. We think <em>Ivey v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 435, 564 A.2d 105 (1989) is instructive. There, at the end of all the evidence,, defense counsel began to make his closing argument. Before he had finished, however, the court interrupted and rendered its verdict on the merits. We reversed Ivey\u2019s conviction. 80 Md.App. at 442, 564 A.2d 105. We noted that the Court of Appeals in <em>Cherry </em>found \"[o]f particular significance ... <em>Covington\u2019s</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>teaching</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-11\">that the failure to afford defense counsel the opportunity to argue the sufficiency of the evidence and the applicable law before the verdict is rendered</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3I\">(1) is not reviewable on direct appeal in the absence of timely protest or objection when the record is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>sufficient to show that the failure to protest or object was not knowing and purposeful; but</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\">(2) is reviewable under post conviction procedures in which the reasons for the absence of protest or objection at trial may be established through a plenary hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">80 Md.App. at 441-42, 564 A.2d 105, quoting <em>Cherry, </em>305 Md. at 640, 506 A.2d 228. We then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoU\">Notwithstanding the fact that counsel did not request an opportunity to make closing argument before the verdict was rendered and did not object to the premature verdict once it was rendered, it is patent that the appellant\u2019s conviction must be reversed____ Here, counsel began to make the argument. He did not complete it, however, because, as the record reflects, the court interrupted to render its verdict. It is of no consequence that no objection was lodged to the premature verdict. The record is sufficient to demonstrate the circumstances surrounding the premature verdict and those circumstances, in turn, demonstrate that appellant was denied the benefit of closing argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\"><em>Id. </em>(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>almost identical facts are present. The reason for the court\u2019s action in cutting off the argument was that it had to be someplace else. That it thought it knew what appellant\u2019s argument would be is of no consequence, since what is paramount is the right of appellant\u2019s counsel to argue. Moreover, as noted earlier, the right to present argument exists notwithstanding how simple or straightforward the facts may appear to be to the trial court or other observer. Appellant was entitled to a full and complete opportunity to present, through counsel, argument on his suppression motion. Denial of that right was reversible error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>SENTENCING</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The following occurred at appellant\u2019s sentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">THE COURT: All right, Mr. Brown. You can stand back up, sir. Sentence of this Court that you be sentenced to the Department of Corrections for a period of 20 years. Going to give you credit for 220 what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">MR. NILAND: Two hundred twenty-four days, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">THE COURT: Two hundred twenty-four days served. You have 30 days in which \u2014 when you are released, I am going to place you under the supervision of the Department of Parole and Probation for a period of five years. No, I can\u2019t do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">MR. NILAND: You can\u2019t do that unless you suspend part of the sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">THE COURT: All right, fine, I am going to sentence you to 30 years, suspend all of that but 20.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">MR. NILAND: I don\u2019t think you can do that now either, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">THE COURT: He hasn\u2019t left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-13\">MR. NILAND: Very well, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-14\">THE COURT: He is standing right in front of me. I want the record to show he\u2019s standing right in front of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-15\">MR. NILAND: I agree he is standing right in front of you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-16\">THE COURT: Okay. I haven\u2019t completed my sentence yet. I found that while I was completing my sentence what I said was not what I intended so I intend now to say what I intended originally which is I sentence him to the Department of Corrections for a period of 30 years. I am going to suspend all of that but 20 years, and when he is released, I am going to place him under the supervision of the Department of Parole and Probation for a period of five years. I am going to give him credit for how many days, Mr. Niland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-17\">MR. NILAND: Two hundred twenty-four, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>THE COURT: Two hundred twenty-four days served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Appellant contends that his sentence must be limited to a term of 20 years. This is so, he says, because once a court has pronounced a legal sentence, it may not then increase that sentence by either adding to its length or imposing a period of probation. He relies upon <em>State v. Sayre, </em>314 Md. 559, 552 A.2d 553 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Unlike <em>Sayre, </em>in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court had not terminated appellant\u2019s case and remanded him to custody, when it changed the sentence. Thus, when the defense notified the court of the defect in the sentence it intended to impose, the court had not then completed the sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In <em>Sayre, </em>the court was presented with the question, \u201cwhen is a sentence deemed to be imposed for purposes of the rule\u2019s[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] prohibition against increase?\u201d 314 Md. at 560, 552 A.2d 553. The question arose in the following context. The trial court sentenced Sayre to a term of imprisonment \u201cto be served <em>concurrently </em>with any sentence that you are currently obligated to serve,\u201d (emphasis in original) <em>id., </em>and ordered him remanded to custody. The judge intended, however, that the sentence be served consecutively. When he was made aware that he had imposed a concurrent sentence, the judge called Sayre back and \u201cclarified\u201d that the sentence would be served consecutively. 314 Md. at 561, 552 A.2d 553. Sayre, of course, contended on appeal that the \u201cclarification\u201d effected an illegal increase in sentence. The Court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Explaining how it reached the result it did, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOg\">After careful weighing of the policy considerations implicated, we, too, are unwilling to allow a procedure that will permit an inquiry of the sentencing judge\u2019s subjective intent under circumstances like those here present. We hold that under Rule 4-345(b), once sentence has been imposed, there can be no inquiry into intention or inad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>vertence. The sentence, for Rule 4-345(b) purposes, stands as pronounced. Like any bright line rule, this holding may produce occasional hardship for the State, but will avoid difficult questions of subjective intent and should encourage trial judges to use great care in pronouncing sentence \u2014 an obviously desirable practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">It remains only to determine when a sentence has been imposed for purposes of Rule 4-345(b). The rule is silent in this respect, and there seems to be no relevant \u201clegislative\u201d history. We do not believe, however, that the answer turns on questions of when the defendant begins serving his or her sentence or when he or she leaves the custody of a court officer and enters the custody of the executive branch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">Ordinarily, sentencing may be considered as the last phase of a criminal trial. When sentence is pronounced or imposed, there is a final judgment for purposes of appeal. <em>See, e.g. Jones v. State, </em>298 Md. 634, 637, 471 A.2d 1055, 1057 (1984). The sentencing phase, for purposes of Rule 4-345(b), is at least at an end when the court indicates that the particular case before it is terminated, as by calling, or directing the clerk to call, the next case. Here, Judge Corderman, after imposing the concurrent sentence on Sayre, said</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADQ\">He is to be remanded to custody. Come, get him. Obviously, Sayre\u2019s case was over. There was nothing more to be done. The court was ready to proceed to the next case. We hold that under these circumstances sentence was imposed. (Footnote omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">314 Md. at 565-66, 552 A.2d 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Since appellant in the instant case had not been remanded to custody, and, indeed, was still before the court, the sentencing phase of the proceeding had not been terminated; consequently, the court was free to change the sentence, which included increasing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>JUDGMENT REVERSED, CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-12\">. <em>Covington </em>v. <em>State, </em>282 Md. 540, 386 A.2d 336 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-9\">.
