Tax-Prop. Code Ann. \u00a7 14-839(a)(l) (1986, 1989 Cum.Supp.), states that the plaintiff shall show, in the title of the complaint, the last known address of the defendant <em>as obtained from:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">(i) any records examined as part of the title examination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">(ii) the tax rolls of the collector who made the sale, as to the property described in the complaint; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">(iii) any other address that is known to the plaintiff or the attorney filing the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Section 14-839(a)(2) of the current code then expressly limits any necessity for further search, stating, \u201c[paragraph (1) of this subsection does not require the plaintiff or the attorney for the plaintiff to make any investigations or to search any other records or sources of information other than those stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Section 14-839(b) then declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">The provisions of this section as to notice ... coupled with the order of publication and the other publicity and notices as ordinarily accompanies the sale ... as well as the knowledge of the taxes and the consequences for nonpayment of the taxes is declared:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">(1) to be reasonable and sufficient ... and necessary in light of the compelling need for the prompt collection of taxes; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">(2) to supersede any other requirement in other cases or civil causes generally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">Section 14-832 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-14\">The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 14-832.1 through 14-854 of this subtitle shall be liberally construed as remedial legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>to encourage the foreclosure of rights of redemption by suits in the circuit courts and for the decreeing of marketable titles to property sold by the collector.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">On July 31, 1982, appellant, St. George Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church (which we will sometimes refer to hereafter as \u201cthe Church,\u201d) received, as a donation from Helen and George Hageage, a parcel of land described in a deed recorded among the Land Records of Prince George\u2019s County at Liber 5576, folio 72. Settlement on the property was performed by Commonwealth Title. Its name and address appears in printed form on the binder of the deed. That binder page was recorded because it also contained a portion of the notary clause. Neither transfer nor recordation taxes were assessed since the transfer was a gift to the Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The Church is located in Washington, D.C., and its officials did not believe that it was required to pay property taxes. They believed that it had tax exempt status with regard to the property,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and they had no knowledge of the taxes charged on the property by Prince George\u2019s County or by the State of Maryland. The County tax bills were sent to the address of the property at issue. This was the only address known to the collector of taxes. No one, including the Church, ever furnished any other address.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">On May 14, 1984, appellees purchased the property at a tax sale. On June 28, 1987, they obtained an order foreclosing the Church\u2019s right to redeem the property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Church never received actual notice of the sale or of the foreclosure proceedings. Appellant filed, on March 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>1989, pursuant to Md.Tax-Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 14-845, a motion to set aside the tax sale, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">On appeal, the Church poses three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">I. Does constructive notice alone satisfy due process requirements in a tax foreclosure proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">II. Is Md.Tax-Prop.Code Ann. Sec. 14-839 violative of due process and, therefore, unconstitutional?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">III. Did the Purchaser fail to comply with the letter of Sec. 14-839, the Maryland Rules, and the spirit of the due process of law?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">I and II</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">We shall address appellant\u2019s first two questions together. Appellant, arguing in its brief that constructive notice does not satisfy due process requirements, relies primarily on <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950), and <em>Mennonite Bd. of Missions v. Adams, </em>462 U.S. 791, 103 S.Ct. 2706, 77 L.Ed.2d 180 (1983). It asserts that <em>Mullane </em>held \u201cunless the interested party is not reasonably identifiable, constructive notice alone does not satisfy the mandate of the due process clause____\u201d The holding in <em>Mullane </em>was not as appellant alleges. It was fact-based and substantially inapposite to the situation presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">The facts in <em>Mullane </em>involved the application of the notice provisions of a trust law in the state of New York. The United States Supreme Court ruled that notice <em>limited </em>to newspaper publication, which did not publish the names of known beneficiaries, was insufficient, and thus did not satisfy the requirements of due process. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFR\">As to known present beneficiaries of <em>known </em>place of residence, however, notice by publication stands on a different footing. Exceptions in the name of necessity do not sweep away the rule that within the limits of practicability notice must be such as is reasonably calculated to reach interested parties. Where the names and post office addresses of those affected by a proceeding are at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>hand, the reasons disappear for resort to means <em>less likely than the mails </em>to apprise them of its pendency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\">The trustee has on its books the names and addresses of the income beneficiaries represented by appellant, and we find no tenable ground for dispensing with a serious <em>effort </em>to inform them personally <em>... at least by ordinary mail to the record </em>addresses____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-6\"><em>Mullane </em>339 U.S. at 318, 70 S.Ct. at 659 (emphasis added). The Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">A construction of the Due Process Clause which would place impossible or impractical obstacles in the way could not be justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-8\"><em>Mullane </em>at 313-14, 70 S.Ct. at 656-57. The Court then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">The statutory notice ... is inadequate, <em>not because in fact it fails to reach everyone, </em>but because under the circumstances it is not reasonably calculated to reach those who could easily be informed by other means at hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-10\"><em>Mullane </em>at 319, 70 S.Ct. at 659 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">Likewise, the holding in <em>Mennonite, supra, </em>462 U.S. 791, 103 S.Ct. 2706, is not nearly so broad as appellant asserts to this Court. We address, to the extent necessary, the underlying factual basis of <em>Mennonite </em>which gave rise to the ultimate decision in that case. We first note that the challenge in <em>Mennonite </em>was made by a mortgagee, not an owner. The Indiana statute at issue in <em>Mennonite </em>required notice as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-12\">1. The county auditor was required to post notice in the courthouse for sale of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-13\">2. The auditor was required to publish the <em>impending </em>sale for three weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-14\">3. Notice <em>of the sale </em>by certified mail had to be given to the owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-15\">There was no Indiana requirement that a mortgagee need be notified and, in fact, Mennonite was not notified. We contrast that statutory omission with the requirement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Maryland law in respect to mortgagees. Md. Tax-Prop. Law Code Ann. \u00a7 14-836(b)(l) (1986, 1989 Cum.Supp.) provides that the defendants<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> shall be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\">(i) The record title holder of the property as disclosed by a search ... of the land records ..., of the records of the register of wills ..., and of the records of the circuit court ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">(iii) any mortgagee ... named as such in any unreleased mortgage recorded in the land records ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">(v) the county ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">(vi) if appropriate, the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Section 14-839(a) provides for notice to defendants. It states that the title of the complaint must indicate the last known address of each defendant obtained from: title records examined, tax rolls, and any other address known to complainant. Section 14-839(b) provides that the plaintiff is not required to investigate any other records or sources. Section 14-839(b) then requires the plaintiff to mail notice to each defendant. This includes mortgagees. The plaintiff then must certify to the mailing. Finally, the legislature has expressly declared that the notice required by the statute is reasonable and sufficient in light of the compelling need for prompt collection of taxes and has also declared that these notice sections supersede the notice requirements of other cases or civil causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">The mortgagee in <em>Mennonite </em>asserted, as to the underlying tax sale, that it had not received constitutionally adequate notice of the sale or of the opportunity to redeem the property. Our reading of the case indicates that the mortgagee, in fact, received neither constructive nor actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>notice, since it was not named as a party and would not, therefore, have had even notice by publication.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the Indiana notice provisions at issue in <em>Mennonite </em>were lacking, as they related to that appellant, by complete absence of any notice provisions. In contrast, the Maryland statute affords to all parties the statutorily required notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The <em>Mennonite </em>Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">When the mortgagee is identified in a mortgage that is publicly recorded, constructive notice <em>by publication must be supplemented by notice mailed to the mortgagee\u2019s last known available address, </em>or by personal service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APx\"><em>Mennonite, </em>462 U.S. at 799, 103 S.Ct. at 2711 (emphasis added). The requirements of the Maryland statute are exactly those set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Mennonite. </em>The Maryland statute then required, and still requires, that which the Supreme Court suggests in <em>Mennonite, </em>is necessary, <em>i.e., </em>notice to the mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Appellant, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>fails to perceive that the <em>Mennonite </em>Court declared the Indiana statute unconstitutional because mortgagees were not afforded the same notice as owners. The Maryland statute requires that identical notice be given to owners and mortgagees. When the <em>Mennonite </em>Court stated that constructive notice alone was insufficient, it was interpreting a factual situation where no notice, by mail or otherwise, was attempted or made prior to the order of publication, It did not hold that a notice procedure, such as Maryland\u2019s, was unconstitutional. It held (without referring to Maryland\u2019s statute), that Indiana\u2019s notice statute was unconstitutional because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>lacked, for mortgagees, that which is contained in Maryland\u2019s notice statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The <em>Mennonite </em>Court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">We do not suggest, however, that a governmental body is required to undertake extraordinary efforts to discover the identity <em>and whereabouts </em>of a mortgagee whose identity is not in the public record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 799, n. 4, 103 S.Ct. at 2711, n. 4 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Aggarwal, the appellee in the case at bar, searched the title to the property; he searched the telephone books of the jurisdiction wherein the land lies; he contacted the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation for addresses; he mailed copies of the bill and summons to the address contained in the tax records which were directed to appellant; he mailed a notice to the address contained in the tax records directed to \u201coccupant\u201d; and he wrote the postmaster for an address. Aggarwal then proceeded with the process of publication and had the sheriff attempt service at the address in the tax records. While actual personal service was not obtained, appellee made diligent efforts in an attempt to effectuate such service and only proceeded with constructive service after those efforts were fruitless. Neither <em>Mullane </em>nor <em>Mennonite </em>requires more of a tax sale purchaser during a redemption foreclosure. Those cases do not require more of statutory notice provisions than are contained in the Maryland statute as they now read, <em>or as they then read.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The Church also states that two other cases support their claims that neither the notice nor the statute in the case <em>sub judice </em>passes constitutional due process muster. The cases are <em>Schroeder v. City of New York, </em>371 U.S. 208, 83 S.Ct. 279, 9 L.Ed.2d 255 (1962) and <em>Michigan v. Dow, </em>396 Mich. 192, 240 N.W.2d 450 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>Schroeder </em>involved an order of publication in two newspapers as to the impending diversion of river water from Schroeder\u2019s property. Under New York law as it then existed, this action amounted to a condemnation. The city had Schroeder\u2019s address which was geographically distant from the diversion area. No notification, either personal or by mail, was attempted, however. While the subject property was not posted, notices were posted on nearby properties. The notice by posting and publication complied with the New York statute. The newspaper advertisement did not contain Schroeder\u2019s name or address.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The Court, quoting from earlier cases, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">\u201cAn elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\"><em>Schroeder, </em>371 U.S. at 211, 83 S.Ct. at 281 (citations omitted). The Court rejected, as unconstitutional for due process reasons, notice \u201cless likely than the mails to apprise them of its pendency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213, 83 S.Ct. at 282 (citation omitted). The present case contains ample facts indicating an attempt at service by mail. The Maryland statute contains such provisions. The constitutional objections extant in <em>Schroeder </em>simply do not exist in this case, nor do they exist in the Maryland statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The same situation exists upon comparison of the facts in <em>Dow, supra, </em>to those of the case at bar. The Supreme Court of Michigan, in <em>Dow, </em>held that the Michigan statute was unconstitutional as applied in that case in that no notice was actually mailed and the Michigan statute specifically provided that no consequences could attach to that mailing failure. On this basis, <em>Dow </em>is clearly distinguishable from the instant case. The Maryland statute requires that a copy of the order of publication be mailed by the complainant by first class or certified mail to each defendant at the defendant\u2019s address, as that address is determined under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>the provisions of the statute, <em>i.e., </em>title examination records, tax rolls, other known addresses. The Maryland notice by publication must identify the owner by name, as well as furnish the other pertinent information. Unlike <em>Dow, </em>the facts of the case at bar indicate that the provisions of the notice statute were substantially met. Unlike the Michigan statute in <em>Dow, </em>Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme contains remedies for significant failures to comply with the notice requirement. <em>See </em>Md. Tax-Prop. Code Ann. \u00a7 14-845.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The Michigan Supreme Court in <em>Dow, </em>after determining that the Michigan statute was unconstitutional on due process grounds stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">Personal service is not required. Notice by mail is adequate. Mailed notice must be directed to an address reasonably calculated to reach the person entitled to notice---- If the state exerts reasonable efforts, then failure to effectuate actual notice would not preclude foreclosure of the statutory lien ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">[I]t would satisfy constitutional requirements if the state were to adopt a procedure providing for (i) ordinary mail notice before sale to the person to whom tax bills have been sent and to \u201coccupant\u201d____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-12\"><em>Dow, </em>240 N.W.2d at 459-60 (footnotes omitted). It is clear that under the analysis utilized by the Michigan court, the statute and notice at issue in this case would meet and surpass the due process requirements espoused by the court in <em>Dow.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">The Maryland Legislature has expressed by statute that it is the policy of Maryland that the notice provisions of the statute, so long as they are substantially complied with, are sufficient and reasonable. Additionally, section 14-832 states that these provisions will be construed liberally as remedial legislation to encourage the foreclosure of rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>of redemption and for the \u201cdecreeing\u201d of marketable title. <em>Mullane, Mennonite, Dow </em>and <em>Schroeder </em>are not authority to the contrary. The fact that the Maryland Legislature, <em>post-Mennonite, </em>may have made the notice requirement less stringent does not, in and of itself, make those requirements unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Golden Sands Club v. Waller, </em>313 Md. 484, 545 A.2d 1332 (1988), a <em>post-Mennonite </em>notice case, reversed a trial court\u2019s finding that the Contract Lien Act was unconstitutional due to the inadequacy of hearing opportunities. Judge Adkins, writing for the Court, also addressed the constitutionality of the Act\u2019s notice requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">Like the concept of a due process hearing, however, the concept of \u201c \u2018notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pend-ency of the action\u2019 \u201d is not a static principle, yielding but a single uniformly applicable rule. Rather, a court considering the constitutionality of notice in a particular case must balance the interests of the state or the giver of notice against the individual interest sought to be protected by the fourteenth amendment. The focus is on the reasonableness of the balance; whether a method of giving notice is reasonable in a given case depends on the specific circumstances of that case. <em>See Tulsa Professional Collection Serv.

Scheve, </em>298 Md. 1, 467 A.2d 499 (1983), failed to respond after having been summonsed. The decree foreclosing the right of redemption was signed on February 18, 1981. On July 2, 1981, Simms filed a motion to vacate asserting a failure to comply with Maryland Rules 320 and 611, in that a decree pro confesso had not been first obtained. The rules then required generally that, in equity, a decree pro confesso must be obtained before proceeding upon default against a party who failed to comply with time requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\"><em>Simms </em>contended that the regular equity rule also applied to tax sales. The Court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">As discussed above, \u00a7\u00a7 97-123C of Article 81, outline a complete, clear, and logical procedure for foreclosing this right. Simms\u2019s argument that the equity Rules requiring the decree <em>pro confesso </em>apply simply is not correct. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>fact, Maryland Rule BS40[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] governing tax sales merely refers to \u00a7\u00a7 70-123, thus acknowledging the statute\u2019s exclusivity in defining the applicable procedure. Although this section notes that general equity practice applies, it specifically excludes such practice if \u201cotherwise provided in this subtitle.\u201d Other sections of Article 81 clearly indicate that the decree <em>pro confesso </em>is not required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">Thus, the statute has logically replaced the decree <em>pro confesso </em>with a special subpoena designed to inform the defendant of the consequences of inaction. No further notice is required for the foreclosure proceeding to become complete.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\"><em>Id. </em>298 Md. at 8-11, 467 A.2d 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Office &amp; Prof. Employees Int\u2019l v.

[212] at 220 [9 A.2d 228] (\u201c \u2018A statute that directs a thing to be done in a particular manner ordinarily implies that it shall not be done otherwise.\u2019 \u201d); 2A Sutherland,[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 57.14-57.18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-9\"><em>Id. </em>295 Md. at 96, 453 A.2d 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Additionally, as we have previously indicated, Md. Tax-Prop. Code Ann. \u00a7 14-839 expressly states that the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>sions of issuance of process and notice to defendants contained in it \u201csupersede any other requirement in other cases or civil causes generally.\u201d By its specificity, this 1986 amendment superseded the provisions of the 1985 statute, which provided that \u201cprocess shall be the same as in other civil actions.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that the notice requirements contained in the redemption foreclosure provisions of the Tax-Property Article of the Code govern redemption foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We must now determine whether the efforts of the appellee to effectuate notice are in sufficient compliance with the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We note initially that Md. Tax-Prop. Code Ann. \u00a7 14-845(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">[a] court in this State may not reopen a judgment rendered in a tax sale foreclosure proceeding except on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or fraud in the conduct of the proceedings to foreclose; however, <em>no reopening </em>of any judgment on the ground of constructive fraud in the conduct of the proceedings to foreclose <em>shall be entertained by any court </em>unless an application to reopen a judgment rendered is filed within 1 year from the date of the judgment, [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The final judgment foreclosing appellant\u2019s right of redemption was rendered by the trial court on July 28, 1987. The Church filed its motion to set aside the tax sale on March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>10, 1989, more than one year after the judgment was entered. It is clear that no actual fraud occurred under the circumstances of the case. Indeed, the Church does not so allege. The Church maintains primarily that because its title insurer\u2019s address was contained on the deed in the land records, the appellee could have contacted the title company and would have been able to obtain from that company the address of the Church. It states that, \u201cunder the circumstances it was incumbent upon the purchaser to obtain the address of the Church by writing to the title company.\u201d The Church maintains that the language of the statute \u201cshould have compelled the purchaser to contact the title company.\u201d The statute, of course, does not specifically require this type of second level search.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Appellant further maintains that, because it is a Church, the appellee should have contacted the \u201cState Corporation Offices\u201d in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia. It directs us to no part of the statute, however, specifying the necessity for such an effort. It also asserts that appellee should have checked the telephone directories for the District of Columbia. Again, it directs us to no statutory requirement. Indeed, it candidly admits that the District of Columbia telephone book listing of the Church at the time in dispute was different than the actual name of the Church on the tax rolls. It argues, however, that the names were sufficiently similar that appellee should have called the Church anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Finally, appellant asserts on appeal for the first time that the appellee failed to attach return receipts relating to the attempt to effectuate service as mentioned in appellee\u2019s affidavit. Our search of appellant\u2019s motion to vacate and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the transcript contained in the record extract fails to demonstrate that this final issue was raised below. Accordingly, it is not preserved for appeal. Maryland Rule 8-131.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A consideration of this alleged error would not, however, change the decision we shall reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The facts as they relate to notice, in the case of <em>Sanchez v. James, </em>209 Md. 266, 120 A.2d 836 (1955), indicated that the tax sale purchaser caused a summons to be issued to the property owner at a Columbia Road, Washington, D.C., address. The tax sale purchaser, Mr. James, asserted in his complaint that the Columbia Road address was the last known address for Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez. The Columbia Road address was the same address contained in the applicable land records.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The Sanchezes filed a petition to set aside this final foreclosure decree alleging that they had not lived at the Columbia Road address for 12 years, and that the assessment records of Prince George\u2019s County contained their correct address, <em>i.e., </em>\u201c6600 Central Ave (Prince George\u2019s County Maryland) post office address Washington, D.C.\u201d The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">However, there was no allegation or proof that complainant furnished the former address for the purpose of fraud or deception. As a matter of fact, complainant\u2019s attorney obtained the address from the margin of the record of defendants\u2019 deed, which was filed in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court in January, 1941. Complainant\u2019s attorney also looked in the assessment book in the office of the County Treasurer, but there was no address opposite the description of the property in controversy, although the address did appear opposite the description of property two items above. It is our conclusion that there was no fraud in the conduct of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>proceedings, and defendants failed to show that the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 273, 120 A.2d 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In <em>Hauver v. Dorsey, </em>228 Md. 499, 180 A.2d 475 (1961), the Court was concerned with the failure of a tax sale purchaser to file an affidavit required by the. then existing Maryland Rule 105.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The <em>Hauver </em>Court stated: \u201cThe only question is whether the failure to file the affidavit is a jurisdictional defect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503, 180 A.2d 475.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">We may assume that the issuance of an order of publication under section 107, <em>supra, </em>is a jurisdictional requirement to bar the claim of a known or unknown party defendant, or one claiming under him. The question is whether Rule 105 adds an additional requirement of a jurisdictional character. We think not. The manner in which the order issues is governed by the rule. But while the rule states that a party shall file an affidavit of the mailing of a notice, where a person\u2019s residence or whereabouts is known, or if unknown, an affidavit of reasonable efforts to locate and warn such person, it is not declared, in terms, that this would affect the jurisdiction of the court. The rule certainly does not require personal service, but, in effect, only a showing of good faith on the part of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 504, 180 A.2d 475. The Court then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">We have frequently pointed out that the tax sales law was designed to improve the marketability of tax titles. See <em>Thomas v. Kolker, </em>195 Md. 470, 475 [73 A.2d 886]. Petitioner was less than diligent in failing to ascertain that taxes were in default, that the sale had been made, and a proceeding to foreclose instituted. Cf. <em>James v. Zantzinger, supra </em>[202 Md. 109] (p. 115 [96 A.2d 10]). We see no reason to hold that a procedural requirement, designed to prevent imposition upon the court and require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>a reasonable effort in good faith to locate and warn the owner, creates a jurisdictional defect in the fundamental sense of preventing the court from dealing with the subject matter and the parties before it____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\"><em>Id. </em>228 Md. at 505, 180 A.2d 475 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The facts in our case of <em>Karkenny v. Mongelli, 35 </em>Md.App. 187, 370 A.2d 137 (1977), indicated that in an action to foreclose a right of redemption, two summons had been returned non est and that publication was then advertised. One of the property owners thereafter claimed, among other things, that the affidavit required to be filed was insufficient. The trial court agreed, and vacated the redemption foreclosure decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">We reversed the decision of the trial court in <em>Karkenny, </em>holding that the failure to supply a sufficient affidavit constituted constructive fraud. Thus, the decree could not be reopened as a year had passed since the signing of the decree. We said, contrasting the earlier case of <em>Jannenga v. Johnson, </em>243 Md. 1, 220 A.2d 89 (1966),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">Under the law as we have discussed it, Mr. Karkenny\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of Rule 105 did indeed amount to a constructive fraud, sufficient to justify the voiding of his decree and deed as to the Mongellis, had they made their attack upon the decree within one year from its date. But the application of the <em>Jannenga </em>ruling was curtailed by the General Assembly two years later when it amended Art. 81, \u00a7 113 by enacting Chapter 729, Laws of 1968, effective 1 June 1968.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-9\"><em>Karkenny, </em>35 Md.App. at 192-93, 370 A.2d 137. The 1968 amendment limited the reopening of redemption foreclosure decrees to one year if based upon constructive fraud, as the current statute also provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">Accordingly, we hold that the alleged deficiencies in notice did not cause the proceeding to be jurisdietionally deficient nor did they constitute actual fraud. While we do not so decide, even if the matters complained of failed to satisfy the exact requirements of the statute, they would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>not rise above the level of constructive fraud. Thus, the appellant did not comply with the statute which required its \u201cMotion to Set Aside Tax Sale\u201d to be filed within a year of the date of the decree foreclosing the right of redemption, and it is not entitled to the relief requested on those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Appellant also seems to argue, though it does not present this matter as a question or an issue, that because it is a church, it is, or should be, exempt from the foreclosure of its redemption rights, saying in its brief that the \u201cChurch received property as a donation from a parishioner. The Church never received the bills. It did not inquire about nonreceipt of the tax bills because it believed it was tax exempt and did not expect to receive any tax bills---Thus, the Church should not have to bear the consequences for nonpayment of taxes as perhaps would a tax evader.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Exemptions from taxation for religious and charitable institutions are provided for by statute. But they are not automatic. They must be applied for and received. Md. Tax-Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 7-103(a) provides: \u201cReal property that is subject to exemption ... is not exempted until the exemption has been applied for and approved____\u201d Section 7-204 states: \u201cProperty that is owned by a religious group or organization is not subject to property tax if the property is actually used <em>exclusively </em>for: (1) Public religious worship; (2) a parsonage or convent; or (3) educational purposes.\u201d (emphasis added) Section 7-101 states: \u201cProperty tax exemptions provided under this title shall be strictly construed.\u201d Given the nature of the subject property (a vacant lot), as described by appellant, it would not qualify for an exemption in the first instance. Even if it would qualify, an exemption was neither requested nor approved. The Church thus enjoys no special status in relation to the property at issue because of the religious nature of its organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>For the reasons we have stated, we perceive no error and thus shall affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-15\">.

The instant case involves challenges to the redemption foreclosure procedures and the governing redemption statute as opposed to tax sale provisions.

We note appellant\u2019s reference to the Code Revisions Commission Report that the proposed amendments resulting in the current statute would address <em>Mennonite </em>due process issues, and that, as enacted, they fail to do that.
