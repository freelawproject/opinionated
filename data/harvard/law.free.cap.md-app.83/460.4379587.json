Quinn, on the grounds of a two year separation. Although the appellee was denied alimony, the circuit court granted her a monetary award. Obviously unhappy with this turn of events, appellant noted this appeal. Before us, appellant contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">I. In awarding appellee fifty percent of the value of all marital property, the circuit court erroneously refused to consider appellant\u2019s post-separation efforts, increasing the value of certain property, that were made without any monetary or nonmonetary contribution by appellee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">II. The circuit court committed reversible error by failing to determine the value of certain marital property prior to making the monetary award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-13\">III. The circuit court erroneously determined that certain marital property was nonmarital property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-14\">IV. The circuit court erroneously failed to consider other factors affecting the monetary award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>For reasons we will explain, we shall vacate the monetary award and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The parties were married on August 5, 1964. Their only child, a daughter born in 1965, is now emancipated. The parties have resided in Maryland since 1967. Both of them are practicing attorneys and members of the Maryland Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">After almost twenty-two years of marriage,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the parties separated on July 12, 1986. A complaint and a cross-complaint for divorce followed. Ultimately, in addition to an absolute divorce and a monetary award of $249,866, the appellee was awarded $16,000 in attorney fees and $5,480.80 in suit money. The award was reduced to judgment, as authorized by Md.Fam.Law Code Ann. \u00a7 8-205(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">In determining an equitable distribution of marital property, Maryland courts are required to engage in a three-step process. First, all property owned by the parties must be categorized as either marital or nonmarital. Second, the marital property must be valued. Finally, the court may make a monetary award. <em>See Sharp v. Sharp, </em>58 Md.App. 386, 394, 473 A.2d 499 (1984). Failure to comply with the three-step process requires that any monetary award be vacated. <em>Campolattaro v. Campolattaro, </em>66 Md.App. 68, 78, 502 A.2d 1068 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">In determining the amount and method of payment of the monetary award, the court must consider the statutory factors enumerated in Md.Fam.Law Code Ann. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\u00a7 8-205(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The failure to consider the statutory factors also requires that any monetary award be vacated. <em>Holston v. Holston, </em>58 Md.App. 308, 318, 473 A.2d 459, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 484, 479 A.2d 372 (1984).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Post-Separation Efforts</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant contends that in awarding appellee fifty percent of the value of all marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>property, the circuit court erroneously refused to consider, or in any case failed to consider, appellant\u2019s post-separation efforts, which increased the value of certain property, without any monetary or nonmonetary contribution by the appellee. Specifically, appellant contends that the circuit court should have considered his post-separation efforts in increasing his retirement fund, in purchasing a home on Linwood Avenue, and in developing his new law firm. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Section 8-205(b)(8) of the Family Law Article requires that, in determining the amount and method of payment of a monetary award, the court must consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aka\">how and when specific marital property or interest in the pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, was acquired, including the effort expended by each party in accumulating the marital property or the interest in the pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, or both____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">And, we have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">[t]he extent to which the efforts of one spouse may have led to acquisition of property or an increase in its value without any monetary or non-monetary contribution by the other spouse after the parties separated can, and should, be taken into account in determining what would constitute an equitable monetary award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-9\"><em>Wilen v. Wilen, </em>61 Md.App. 337, 354-355, 486 A.2d 775 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">In arriving at a monetary award, the trial judge is not required to \u201carticulate every step in his thought processes.\u201d <em>Bangs v. Bangs, </em>59 Md.App. 350, 370, 475 A.2d 1214 (1984). The trial judge is presumed to know the law and to apply it correctly, and that presumption is not rebutted by \u201cmere silence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The presumption, however, may be rebutted by the trial judge\u2019s words. <em>Campolattaro, supra, </em>66 Md.App. at 80, 502 A.2d 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">In the instant case, the trial judge did not merely remain silent as to whether she had considered the post-separation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>efforts of appellant in determining the monetary award. At the close of the evidence, after hearing argument from counsel, during which counsel for the appellant specifically asked her to consider \u201cwhat increase [sic] marital property occurred post-separation,\u201d the trial judge delivered her opinion from the bench. After granting appellee an absolute divorce, and denying her alimony, the trial judge identified and valued the marital property. She then considered at length the various factors involved in deciding whether to make a monetary award. The trial judge specifically mentioned the acquisition of the marital property and the contributions of each of the parties during the marriage. At no point in that consideration, however, did she refer to appellant\u2019s post-separation efforts in increasing the value of his retirement fund, in purchasing a home on Linwood Avenue, or in developing his new law firm. After the trial judge had made a monetary award and had granted appellee attorneys fees and suit money, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AziL\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, has the court talked about what, how and when those assets were acquired. Did the court address when they were acquired in the reasoning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">THE COURT: Well, I thought that I had. [APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I thought you said how they were acquired. You said that Mr. Quinn contributed the bulk financially. I\u2019m wondering whether the court considered the assets, considered post separation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think that makes any difference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtS\">Under these circumstances, we hold that this statement by the trial judge clearly indicates that she failed to consider appellant\u2019s post-separation efforts which may have increased the value of certain property. Of course, as we have said, such consideration is required. Md.Fam.Law Code Ann. \u00a7 8-205(b)(8) (1984 &amp; 1989 Repl.Vol.). <em>See also Wilen, supra, </em>61 Md.App. at 354-355, 486 A.2d 775. As the circuit court failed to consider this factor in determining the monetary award, we shall vacate the award. <em>See Holston, supra, </em>58 Md.App. at 318, 473 A.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Valuation of Marital Property</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Appellant next contends that the circuit court erred by failing to determine the value of certain marital property prior to making the monetary award. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">A. Marital Debt</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Both parties acknowledged that they received a loan from appellant\u2019s mother in 1973 to assist them in purchasing their first home. There is some disagreement, however, as to the amount of the loan and the terms of repayment. Appellant contends that the loan was to both parties in the amount of $7,500 with an interest rate of nine percent. Appellee testified that she was uncertain whether the loan was for $7,000 or $7,500. She also testified that the promissory note which evidenced the loan did not bear any interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Inasmuch as the parties agree that the loan was made to both of them, and was used in purchasing their first home, <em>See Rogers v. Rogers, </em>80 Md.App. 575, 583, 565 A.2d 361 (1989), the obligation to repay the loan was a marital debt. <em>Id. </em>at 585, 565 A.2d 361. <em>See also Schweizer v. Schweizer, </em>301 Md. 626, 636-637, 484 A.2d 267 (1984). Consequently, the net value of the marital property must be reduced by the amount of the marital debt. <em>Rogers, supra, </em>at 584, 565 A.2d 361. <em>See also Zandford v. Wiens, </em>314 Md. 102, 107, 549 A.2d 13 (1988); <em>Niroo v. Niroo, </em>313 Md. 226, 240-241, 545 A.2d 35 (1988); <em>Schweizer, supra, </em>at 637, 484 A.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Accordingly, on remand, the circuit court must determine both the value of the marital debt and the rate of accrued interest, if any, and reduce the value of the marital property by the amount of the marital debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">B. Colorado Condominium</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">Appellant also contends that the circuit court lacked an evidentiary basis to assign a value to appellant\u2019s interest in the Colorado condominium. Specifically, appellant contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>that the court erroneously failed to consider evidence regarding diminution of the value of the property. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">At trial, appellant offered recent newspaper articles and a publication of the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) which reported that the condominium development had been built on a toxic waste site, resulting in diminished property values. The circuit court refused to admit the E.P.A. report into evidence. The circuit court ultimately valued appellant\u2019s twenty-five percent interest in the condominium at $1,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">We hold that the circuit court erred in failing to consider the E.P.A. report in determining the value of appellant\u2019s interest in the condominium. Maryland courts have held that reliable government evaluative reports should be admitted into evidence, unless they are otherwise shown to be unreliable. <em>See Ellsworth v. Sherne Lingerie, Inc., </em>303 Md. 581, 610-612, 495 A.2d 348 (1985) (and cases cited therein holding that reports of various government agencies are admissible). To be admitted into evidence under the public records exception to the hearsay rule, the report must contain reliable facts. <em>Id. </em>at 612, 495 A.2d 348. Evaluations or opinions contained in the public report are not to be received into evidence unless they are otherwise admissible under the Maryland rules of evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Accordingly, on remand, the circuit court should consider such reliable facts as are contained in the E.P.A. report in determining the value of appellant\u2019s interest in the Colorado condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">C. Appellant\u2019s Law Firm</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Finally, appellant contends that the circuit court erroneously accepted the opinion of appellee\u2019s expert in determining the value of appellant\u2019s law firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">At trial, the parties each presented an expert to value appellant\u2019s law firm. After hearing from them, the trial judge accepted the valuation of appellee\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>We have held that whether to admit expert testimony is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Scott v. Department of Social Services, </em>76 Md.App. 357, 386, 545 A.2d 81, <em>cert. denied, </em>314 Md. 193, 550 A.2d 381 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 3226, 106 L.Ed.2d 575 (1989). Ordinarily, a decision to admit expert testimony will be sustained on appeal unless clearly erroneous. <em>Troja v. Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>62 Md.App. 101, 110, 488 A.2d 516, <em>cert. denied, </em>303 Md. 471, 494 A.2d 939 (1985). To qualify as an expert, one must possess such skill, knowledge or experience in the field that his opinion will assist the trier of fact. <em>Id. </em>And, of course, the expert\u2019s opinion \u201cmust be based on facts sufficient to support a reasonably accurate conclusion.\u201d <em>Scott, supra, </em>at 386, 545 A.2d 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Where, as here, there are two experts, the trier of fact must evaluate the testimony of both of them and decide which opinion, if any, to accept. <em>Duvall v. Potomac Electric, </em>234 Md. 42, 46-47, 197 A.2d 893 (1964). And, the trial judge need not accept the testimony of any expert. <em>Rosenberg v. Rosenberg, </em>64 Md.App. 487, 517, 497 A.2d 485, <em>cert. denied, </em>305 Md. 107, 501 A.2d 845 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">In the case at hand, we do not quarrel with the trial judge\u2019s decision to accept the opinion of appellee\u2019s expert rather than that of appellant\u2019s expert. We do, however, conclude, for reasons we shall shortly explain, that appellee\u2019s expert erroneously valued appellant\u2019s law firm. Accordingly, on remand, the value of appellant\u2019s law firm will have to be recalculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">In calculating the value of appellant\u2019s law firm, appellee\u2019s expert included both contingent and non-contingent work in progress in his calculations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Generally, in valuing a professional partnership, the value of work in progress, along with other tangible factors, should be considered. <em>See Stern v. Stern, </em>66 N.J. 340, 331 A.2d 257, 261 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>(1975). This is so because at any time the amount of work actually done on the work in progress can be itemized and its value calculated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">By contrast, a contingent fee cannot be recouped until the case is completed and either an award is made or a settlement is reached. Inasmuch as the amount of the fee, if one is ever realized, depends on the amount of the award or settlement, its ultimate value is, to say the least, highly speculative. Moreover, there is no guarantee that a settlement will ever be had or that an award will ever be made in any particular case. Consequently, the attorney may never receive a contingent fee. Even if such a fee is ultimately received, its value to the attorney is not ascertainable until he or she actually receives it.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Other courts have held that a contingent fee cannot be considered an asset of a law firm. Those courts have also held that a contingent fee cannot be considered an asset of the marital estate for purposes of equitable distribution. <em>See In re The Marriage of: Myra Joyce Zells, </em>197 Ill. App.3d 232, 143 Ill.Dec. 354, 554 N.E.2d 289 (1990) (held that contingent fee \u201ccannot be considered an asset of either the marital estate, or of the law practice from which it is derived. Rather a contingent fee represents merely the unenforceable expectation of future income.\u201d). <em>See also Beasley v. Beasley, </em>359 Pa.Super. 20, 518 A.2d 545, 554 (1986) <em>app. denied, </em>516 Pa. 631, 533 A.2d 90 (1987) (held that no value can be placed on contingent fee for the purpose of equitable distribution as such attempted valuation would be \u201ctenuous and risky\u201d); <em>Lamparski v. Sikov, et al., </em>384 Pa.Super. 491, 559 A.2d 544, 547-548 (1989), <em>app. denied, </em>\u2014 Pa. -, 569 A.2d 1368 (1990) (citing with approval <em>Beasley, </em>as being instructive on the nature of contingent fees); <em>Dugan v. Dugan, </em>92 N.J. 423, 457 A.2d 1, 11 (1983) (court noted that recent successes in contingent fee cases may lead to overestimating expected income).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>While we are aware that other courts have held that contingent fees cannot be considered as assets of a law firm or as marital assets, we are not prepared to say that the value of a contingent fee can <em>never </em>be determined or considered as an asset of a law firm. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, we find that appellee\u2019s expert did not have a sufficient basis on which to value the contingent fees of appellant\u2019s law firm. We reach this conclusion because, insofar as we can determine from the record, appellee\u2019s expert valued the contingent fee cases based solely on the number of hours expended on the cases multiplied by an hourly rate. As we have already mentioned, the hours worked on a contingent fee case may have little or no relation to the ultimate award or settlement. For these reasons, the value of appellant\u2019s law firm will have to be recalculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Determination of Marital Property</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erroneously determined that certain marital property was nonmarital.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Appellant first contends that the $1,100 security deposit which appellee deposited on her current residence is marital property. The circuit court found that there was not enough evidence to show that the security deposit was marital property. We see it somewhat differently. Appellee conceded at trial that the security deposit was an asset. Hence, the circuit court should have considered it as marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Appellant also contends that the circuit court erroneously failed to consider appellee\u2019s 1983 Mazda as marital property. A review of the record before us reveals that the trial judge did not consider the 1983 Mazda, valued at $4,550, in the equitable distribution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On remand, both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>security deposit and the 1983 Mazda should be considered in recalculating the equitable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u201cOther Factors\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Appellant also contends that the circuit court erroneously failed to consider other factors affecting the amount and method of payment of the marital award. Specifically, appellant contends that the circuit court failed to consider the resulting tax consequences if appellant were to withdraw funds from his retirement plan to satisfy the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we find that this issue was neither raised in nor decided by the circuit court. Nevertheless, inasmuch as we are remanding the case for reconsideration, we shall, in the exercise of our discretion, address appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">We have held that potential tax consequences of a disposition of property should be considered as an \u201cother factor\u201d pursuant to Md.Fam.Law Code Ann. \u00a7 8-205(b)(10).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Williams v. Williams, </em>71 Md.App. 22, 37, 523 A.2d 1025 (1987). Hence, if the issue of tax consequences should arise on remand, the trial judge should consider them in determining the amount of any monetary award. <em>See Id. </em>Such evidence, however, must be more than merely speculative. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Finally, appellant contends that the circuit court\u2019s award is too \u201charsh\u201d, because by reducing the award to judgment appellant will have to liquidate his retirement fund and other assets to satisfy the judgment. Alas for appellant, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The court may reduce to judgment any monetary award made under Md.Fam.Law Code Ann. \u00a7 8-205(c). <em>See su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>pra, </em>n. 2. That, of course, is precisely what the court chose to do in this case. The fact that the result is \u201charsh\u201d on appellant may be cause for chagrin, but it does not constitute grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">COSTS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-11\">.
