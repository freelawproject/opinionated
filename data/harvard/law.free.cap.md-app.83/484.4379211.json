Reynolds, a domiciliary of Montgomery County, died on May 2, 1987, leaving an estate worth more than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>million dollars. The estate included, inter alia, four improved real properties in Washington, D.C. In her last will and testament Ms. Reynolds named as personal representative, Charles W. Foster (Personal Representative). She authorized and directed the Personal Representative to sell all of her properties in Washington \u201cas soon as may be practicable after my death upon such terms and at such prices as my Personal Representative, in the exercise of his sole and absolute discretion, may deem fair and prudent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">After receiving letters of administration from the Register of Wills for Montgomery County, the Personal Representative filed the appropriate documents in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The Personal Representative also enlisted a real estate appraiser, J. Morgan Little, whose name appeared on a list of qualified real estate appraisers maintained by the Register of Wills for the District of Columbia. Little\u2019s date-of-death appraisals of the four properties were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">Property Address Appraised Value</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">831 Ingraham Street, N.W. $ 60,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">3532 T Street, N.W. 140,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">3602 T Street, N.W. 125,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">3629 S Street, N.W. 145,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">TOTAL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-11\">$470,000.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">With assistance from Shirley\u2019s Realty Company as to 831 Ingraham Street, N.W., and Millicent Chatel Associates, Inc. (Millicent Chatel) as to the other three properties (the subject properties), the Personal Representative negotiated contracts to sell the properties for the following prices:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-13\">Property Address Sales Price</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-14\">831 Ingraham Street, N.W. $ 62,500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-15\">3532 T Street, N.W. 159.600.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-16\">3602 T Street, N.W. 158.500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-17\">3629 S Street, N.W. 162.500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-22\">TOTAL $543,100.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>After the payment of real estate commissions and, presumably, other costs, the net proceeds from the sales of the properties were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWEE\">Property Address Net Proceeds</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANKg\">831 Ingraham Street, N.W. $ 61,662.22</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1b\">3532 T Street, N.W. 149,558.82</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">3602 T Street, N.W. 146,546.54</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">3629 S Street, N.W. 150,994.34</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">TOTAL $508,761.92</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">After the sale of the properties, the Register of Wills for Montgomery County apparently approved the Personal Representative\u2019s First and Final Account. The Personal Representative then distributed the specific bequests and devises designated in Ms. Reynolds\u2019s will. Finally, the Personal Representative disbursed $350,000 to the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) as residuary legatee, retaining approximately $55,000, apparently pending receipt of a federal estate tax closing letter from the Internal Revenue Service. The First and Final Account, however, indicated a payment to NWF of $404,210.63.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">After receiving the Personal Representative\u2019s account, NWF concluded that the sales prices of the houses had been too low and, through counsel, it attempted to convince the Personal Representative to file a claim against Millicent Chatel for breach of its contractual and fiduciary duties to the estate. To support its position that the subject properties had been under-appraised and under-sold, NWF apparently provided the Personal Representative with data about six 1987 sales of properties that it asserted were comparable to the subject properties. According to the Personal Representative, he determined that the six properties were \u201csignificantly larger and in substantially better condition than the subject properties.\u201d The Personal Representative then told NWF that he would not take action against Millicent Chatel.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">The Personal Representative received the estate tax closing letter in late August 1988. Before receiving the letter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>however, he apparently learned that NWF was contemplating filing suit against him, for failing to obtain the highest prices for the subject properties, unless he agreed to institute litigation against Millicent Chatel. Rather than disbursing to NWF the approximately $55,000 he had retained after the sale of the Washington properties, the Personal Representative held onto the money to cover legal fees and expenses he might incur if NWF filed an action against him. He also engaged a Bethesda law firm to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">On April 24, 1989, NWF filed a complaint against the Personal Representative and Millicent Chatel in the Superi- or Court of the District of Columbia. In the complaint, NWF alleged that the Personal Representative breached his fiduciary duty by (1) failing to take action against Millicent Chatel; (2) acquiescing in Millicent Chatel\u2019s breaches of fiduciary duty; (3) failing to verify personally the market values of the properties and leaving the sales prices blank to be filled in by Millicent Chatel; (4) failing to offer a particular one of the three subject properties for sale to the public, rather than to a Millicent Chatel employee; and (5) withholding the remaining $55,000. NWF also alleged that the Personal Representative had been negligent and breached the standard of care he owed to the estate by acquiescing in Millicent Chatel\u2019s breaches of contract and of fiduciary duty. The Personal Representative filed an answer and a counterclaim, in which he alleged that NWF sued him in bad faith. The Superior Court apparently granted NWF\u2019s motion to dismiss the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The Personal Representative filed a Petition to Reopen the Estate in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, sitting as the Orphans\u2019 Court, on June 2, 1989. In the petition he sought four forms of relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">(1) the reopening of the estate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">(2) permission to restate his First and Final Account and to file periodic subsequent accounts showing the liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>gation expenses incurred in defending the claim against him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">(3) permission to pay himself $1,532.60 that he had already paid his defense counsel for services rendered <em>before </em>NWF filed its complaint (pre-litigation fees and expenses); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">(4) permission to pay $3,434.95 in initial legal fees and expenses incurred <em>after </em>NWF filed the complaint (litigation fees and expenses).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Along with the Petition to Reopen the Estate, the Personal Representative filed copies of NWF\u2019s complaint, the Personal Representative\u2019s answer and counterclaim, and the billing statements the Personal Representative had received from defense counsel for the pre-litigation and litigation fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Judge Paul H. Weinstein granted the Personal Representative\u2019s petition in full on June 21, 1989. Because the Personal Representative sought attorneys\u2019 fees, however, NWF was entitled to 20 days from the date of the June 2 petition in which to request a hearing pursuant to Md. Est. &amp; Trusts Code Ann. \u00a7 7-502. On June 22, NWF filed a timely request for such a hearing. When it discovered that Judge Weinstein had mistakenly issued the premature order granting the Personal Representative\u2019s petition, NWF filed a Motion to Reconsider Order Authorizing Payment of Attorneys\u2019 Fees. The motion\u2019s introductory language stated that NWF \u201cmoves that this Court reconsider and rescind its order dated June 21, 1989, insofar as that order authorizes the Personal Representative to <em>reimburse </em>himself from the estate\u2019s funds for certain attorneys\u2019 fees that he has incurred.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In conclusion, NWF requested that the court \u201creconsider its order of June 21, 1989, granting the Personal Representative\u2019s request to use estate assets to <em>pay </em>his attorneys\u2019 fees, rescind that order, and grant NWF a hearing on the merits of that request for attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Along with its motion to reconsider, NWF filed an order, drafted by its counsel, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-4\">Upon consideration of the Motion of National Wildlife Federation to reconsider this Court\u2019s order of June 21, 1989, granting the Personal Representative leave <em>to reimburse </em>himself for attorneys\u2019 fees from funds of the estate, it is, this _ day of -, 1989, hereby ordered that National Wildlife Federation\u2019s Motion to Reconsider is granted, and that this Court\u2019s order of June 21, 1989 be, and hereby is, rescinded insofar as it permits the Personal Representative <em>to reimburse </em>himself for attorneys\u2019 fees, and that a hearing on the Personal Representative\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees is hereby scheduled for_, 1989.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">(Emphasis added.) Judge Weinstein signed the order on June 28 exactly as counsel for NWF drafted it. Someone, apparently Judge Weinstein, also wrote on the June 21 order the following: \u201cOrder vacated regarding fees. 6/28/89.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">At the requested hearing before the orphans\u2019 court, held on September 20, 1989, Judge Irma R. Raker heard arguments from counsel for both parties. Counsel for the Personal Representative argued that because the June 28 order used the word \u201creimburse,\u201d it reopened only the issue of his request for payment of pre-litigation fees, which the Personal Representative had already paid to his defense counsel out of personal funds. According to defense counsel, the actual litigation fees and expenses, incurred after NWF filed suit in April 1989, were not at issue because the Personal Representative had not yet made payment on them and thus could not be \u201creimbursed\u201d for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Counsel for NWF countered that he had simply drafted the phrase \u201cinsofar as it permits the Personal Representative to reimburse himself for attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d inelegantly. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">Mr. Dunbar [Counsel for NWF]: [M]y request, and the intent of my motion for reconsideration, which I think was granted, at least in effect, was to put the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>attorneys fees request, whether prior reimbursement or post-litigation payment, in issue. The issue is the same, the legal issue is the same with regard\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t read Judge Weinstein\u2019s order that way. You may not like how you drafted it, but he signed your order, and it is limited to a hearing on the personal attorneys \u2014 request for attorneys fees. He only rescinded it insofar as it permits the PR to reimburse himself for attorneys fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">MR. DUNBAR: Your Honor, I would just submit, very briefly, that my client should not be prejudiced by my sloppiness, if that is what it was, in drafting the order; that the idea, the reason the order was vacated was\u2014 THE COURT: I am dealing with Judge Weinstein\u2019s order that you gave him, that he signed. That is all I am dealing with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">MR. DUNBAR: In that case, Your Honor, I would like to move now that we reconsider, as well, the portion of Judge Weinstein\u2019s order vacating the $3400.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">THE COURT: I am not going to do that, because I am not going to vacate Judge Weinstein\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Raker granted the Personal Representative\u2019s request for payment of his pre-litigation fees from the estate\u2019s assets. The judge also refused to consider NWF\u2019s request that she order the Personal Representative to distribute the remaining $55,000 to NWF, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think that is before me.\u201d The next day, September 21, Judge Raker signed a written order granting the Personal Representative leave to \u201creimburse\u201d himself the $1,532.60 he had paid defense counsel for pre-litigation legal fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Fourteen days later, on October 5, NWF filed a Notice of Appeal, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">Please enter an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from the Order dated September 21, 1989 by the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, sitting as the Orphan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Court (Raker, J.), authorizing the personal representative to reimburse himself $1,532.50 for attorney\u2019s fees allegedly incurred by him and permitting the personal representative to restate an account so as to reflect the above-mentioned reimbursement; and from the Court\u2019s refusal, in open court, to reconsider the Order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, sitting as the Orphan\u2019s Court (Weinstein, J.), dated June 21, 1989, insofar as that Order permits the Personal Representative to pay from the estate $3,434.95 in attorneys\u2019 fees allegedly incurred by him, and to restate his account to reflect that payment; and from the Court\u2019s refusal, in open court, to consider or act upon the request of the National Wildlife Federation for an Order requiring distribution of the estate\u2019s assets to it, as the sole beneficiary____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The Personal Representative moved to strike the notice of appeal, pursuant to Md.Rule 8-203(a)(l), on the grounds that the 30-day period for noting an appeal to Judge Weinstein\u2019s June 21 order, as modified by that judge\u2019s June 28 order, had expired. The Personal Representative also argued that none of the three orders \u2014 June 21, June 28, or September 21 \u2014 was an appealable interlocutory order. NWF filed an opposition to the motion to strike the notice of appeal, requesting a hearing on the Personal Representative\u2019s motion to strike and requesting that Judge Weinstein be specially assigned to the motion \u201cbecause the motion to strike involves the interpretation of orders entered by him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">On November 24, without explanation or a hearing, Judge Paul McGuckian granted the Personal Representative\u2019s motion to strike NWF\u2019s notice of appeal. NWF then filed a notice of appeal from Judge McGuckian\u2019s order on December 19. On appeal, NWF presents three arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">I. NWF\u2019s appeal is properly before this court, and the Orphans\u2019 Court erred in striking NWF\u2019s [first] notice of appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">II. Mr. Foster did not and could not establish that his attorneys\u2019 fees were incurred in good faith and with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>just cause, and the court\u2019s approval of those fees was improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">III. Mr. Foster should be required to distribute the remainder of the estate to NWF.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">I. <em>Appealability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Apparently, the Personal Representative does not dispute that Judge McGuckian\u2019s November 24 order striking NWF\u2019s first notice of appeal was appealable. The question, then, is whether that order was correctly issued. In other words, was NWF\u2019s October 5 notice of appeal an appeal from an appealable order or orders?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">To answer this question, we first address the Personal Representative\u2019s argument that the October, 5 notice of appeal was defective because it appealed from Judge Weinstein\u2019s June 21 and June 28 orders and thus was untimely under Md.Rule 8-203(a)(l). We disagree. NWF could not have appealed from the June orders even if it had wanted to because the June 28 order, which its attorney drafted verbatim, was a wholly favorable judgment. An appeal from such a judgment is impermissible. <em>Paolino v. McCormick &amp; Co., </em>314 Md. 575, 579, 552 A.2d 868 (1989). Moreover, NWF\u2019s mentioning of the June orders in the October 5 notice of appeal did not amount to an \u201cappeal\u201d from those orders. NWF simply appealed from Judge Raker\u2019s refusal, in open court on September 20, to reconsider portions of the June 21 order. The appeal, therefore, was from Judge Raker\u2019s decision, made only fifteen days, before the October 5 notice of appeal, and not from Judge Weinstein\u2019s two orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The Personal Representative\u2019s other argument in support of Judge McGuckian\u2019s striking of the October 5 notice of appeal is that the September 21 order was not an appealable interlocutory order as defined by Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 12-501. Specifically, he argues that the order is not a final judgment because of the ongoing litigation in the District of Columbia court \u201cand the certain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ty that the Personal Representative will seek additional authority from the Orphans\u2019 Court on an interim basis to pay and/or reimburse for subsequent legal fees and expenses.\u201d We disagree with this argument as well. Section 12-501 permits a party to appeal to this court \u201cfrom a final judgment of an orphans\u2019 court.\u201d Maryland Est. &amp; Trusts Code Ann. \u00a7 7-502(b) provides that when a personal representative requests permission to pay attorneys\u2019 fees out of the estate\u2019s assets,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">[ujnless there was fraud, material mistake, or substantial irregularity in the proceeding, or a request for a hearing is filed within 20 days of the sending of the notice, any action taken by the court on the petition is <em>final and binding </em>on all persons to whom the notice was given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Judge Raker\u2019s September 21 order clearly permitted the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees out of the estate\u2019s assets. The judge\u2019s order thus was \u201cfinal and binding\u201d under \u00a7 7-502(b) and, accordingly, appealable under \u00a7 12-501. <em>See also Wright v. </em>Nuttle, 267 Md. 698, 701, 298 A.2d 389 (1973) (appeal normally lies from order granting or denying allowance of counsel fee). We therefore conclude that Judge McGuckian erred in striking NWF\u2019s October 5 notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">II. <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">Maryland Est. &amp; Trusts Code Ann. \u00a7 7-603 provides: When a personal representative or person nominated as personal representative defends or prosecutes a proceeding in good faith and with just cause, he shall be entitled to receive his necessary expenses and disbursements from the estate regardless of the outcome of the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">If the D.C. case had been resolved before Judge Raker approved the granting of the attorneys\u2019 fees, our task of evaluating her decision would be relatively simple. With all or part of the record of the D.C. case before us, we could conclude intelligently whether the proceeding was defended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u201cin good faith and with just cause.\u201d Had the Personal Representative prevailed, then we could conclude that he did defend in good faith and with just cause. If, on the other hand, the D.C. court found in favor of NWF, that \u201coutcome\u201d notwithstanding, we would still have before us a record from which to determine good faith and just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Unfortunately, the D.C. court has not resolved the dispute. We thus are faced with a situation in which the trial court granted the Personal Representative\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees on an interim basis. We have discovered no Maryland cases addressing the propriety of such an award, and there is a dearth of authority from other jurisdictions. <em>See Duggan v. Keto, </em>554 A.2d 1126, 1142-43 (D.C.App.1989) (trial court did not err in awarding personal representative\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees before underlying litigation had ended); <em>compare Matter of Estate of Bimbaum, </em>112 A.D.2d 778, 113 A.D.2d 1032, 492 N.Y.S.2d 275, 277 (1985) (trial court erred in awarding interim attorneys\u2019 fees for legal services in defense of breach of fiduciary duty charges); 31 Am. Jur.2d <em>Executors and Administrators </em>\u00a7 472, at 238 (1989) (fiduciary charged with breach of fiduciary duties may not be awarded interim attorneys\u2019 fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">While the allowance of counsel fees by an orphans\u2019 court requires the exercise of discretion and \u201cwill not be disturbed in the absence of proof of abuse of discretion,\u201d <em>Wolfe v. Turner, </em>267 Md. 646, 653, 299 A.2d 106 (1973), neither Maryland case law, the Maryland Code, nor the Maryland Rules are instructive in determining how the court\u2019s discretion is to be exercised in awarding interim attorneys\u2019 fees to personal representatives. We therefore must formulate our own set of guidelines. Our action in this regard is not without precedent. Indeed, when faced recently with a lack of authority on the issue of when it is proper for insurers to file declaratory judgment actions regarding tort suits against their insureds, where there is a dispute as to coverage, the Court of Appeals created new guidelines for trial courts to follow. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Atwood, </em>319 Md. 247, 264, 572 A.2d 154 (1990). Rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>than permit a separate declaratory judgment action after the tort suit in a conflict of interest situation, the court created a new procedure under which coverage disputes are resolved in declaratory proceedings, as part of the tort case, but are not initiated until after the jury\u2019s verdict or the court\u2019s decision as to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">In fashioning our guidelines, we find a useful model in the factors that courts consider in determining whether to grant interlocutory injunctions. As we said in <em>Teferi v. Dupont Plaza Associates, </em>77 Md.App. 566, 551 A.2d 477 (1989), trial courts making such a determination should consider the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">(1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">(2) the \u201cbalance of convenience\u201d determined by whether greater injury would be done to the defendant by granting the injunction than would result from its refusal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">(3) whether plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction is granted; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">(4) the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 578, 551 A.2d 477 (citing <em>Department of Transp. v. Armacost, </em>299 Md. 392, 404-05, 474 A.2d 191 (1984); <em>State Dep\u2019t v. Baltimore County, </em>281 Md. 548, 554, 383 A.2d 51 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">The three factors in our new test for awarding interim attorneys\u2019 fees to personal representatives are quite similar to the first three factors of the interlocutory injunction test. The first, and most important, factor is whether there is prima facie evidence that the personal representative will succeed on the merits and thus is defending or prosecuting the underlying action in good faith and with just cause. Like the judge in an interlocutory injunction hearing, the orphans\u2019 court must attempt to predict the outcome of the trial on the merits. The stronger the prima facie evidence of good faith and just cause, the less emphasis the orphans\u2019 court will place on the other two factors in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the test. Conversely, the weaker the prima facie evidence, the more emphasis the court will place on the second and third factors. If the personal representative utterly fails to present prima facie evidence of good faith and just cause, the orphans\u2019 court shall deny the interim attorneys\u2019 fees without even considering the other two factors in the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">We create this \u201csuper\u201d first factor to avoid the injustice that would occur each time a meritorious personal representative, who would have been granted attorneys\u2019 fees at the end of litigation pursuant to \u00a7 7-603, is prevented from pursuing the litigation to its conclusion by an inability to pay attorneys\u2019 fees as they arise. In the instant case, for example, the Personal Representative had accrued nearly $5,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees by the time he filed his Petition to Reopen the Estate in June 1989. That figure may have increased substantially since then. Justice would be served poorly if the Personal Representative has breached no fiduciary duty yet is unable to establish that in the D.C. court because he cannot pay these fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Conversely, we are mindful of the harm that could result if a personal representive is permitted to use the estate\u2019s assets to defend or prosecute a claim in bad faith and without just cause. Not only might the estate be dissipated and the legatees unable to recover the money paid in attorneys\u2019 fees from the personal representative at the conclusion of the underlying litigation, but such meritless litigation also causes an unnecessary drain on the judicial system. It is for these reasons that we direct orphans\u2019 courts to require prima facie evidence of good faith and just cause before granting interim attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The second factor is the \u201cbalance of convenience,\u201d similar to the balance performed by hearing judges in interlocutory injunction cases. The orphans\u2019 court judge must determine from the evidence whether greater injury would be done to the personal representative by denying the interim attorneys\u2019 fees than would be done to the party opposing the interim attorneys\u2019 fees if such fees were granted. The third factor in the test is whether the party opposing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>interim attorneys\u2019 fees, like the plaintiff requesting the interlocutory injunction, will suffer irreparable injury if the interim fees are awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Having set out a three-factor test for determining when to award interim attorneys\u2019 fees to personal representatives, we now address the type of hearing required by that test. It is clear that the party opposing a personal representative\u2019s request for interim attorneys\u2019 fees is entitled to an evidentiary hearing. <em>Cosden v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>41 Md.App. 519, 554, 398 A.2d 460, <em>cert. denied, </em>285 Md. 728 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 941, 100 S.Ct. 295, 62 L.Ed.2d 308 (1979). The question is how extensive that hearing should be. We do not suggest that the entire underlying action should also be tried by the orphans\u2019 court. While broad discretion should be vested in the trial judge as to the quality and quantity of the evidence <em>(e.g., </em>affidavits, counter-affidavits, and documentary evidence might be used), the personal representative or other party seeking interim fees must be subject to examination and cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Judge Raker did hold a hearing, in which counsel for the parties were permitted to argue, before deciding to award interim attorneys\u2019 fees to the Personal Representative. Judge Raker also must have had before her the record, which included the Personal Representative\u2019s Petition to Reopen the Estate. Attached to the petition were NWF\u2019s complaint; the Personal Representative\u2019s answer and counterclaim, including the amounts at which his appraiser valued each of the four D.C. properties; and the bills for legal fees from the Personal Representative\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Counsel for NWF argued at least twice during the hearing that an evidentiary hearing had to be held to determine whether the Personal Representative incurred the attorneys\u2019 fees in good faith and with just cause. Judge Raker granted the interim attorneys\u2019 fees without holding such a hearing. She heard no testimony from either the Personal Representative or an NWF spokesperson. She also admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ted no evidence beyond what already was part of the Petition to Reopen the Estate. Based upon the test we have created today, we believe an evidentiary hearing was required and its denial was an abuse of discretion. We thus remand to the orphans\u2019 court so that such a hearing may be held. We do not decide what, if any, effect the allowance, vel non, of interim attorneys\u2019 fees would have on a claim made after the D.C. case is decided for reimbursement of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">We also direct the orphans\u2019 court on remand to address both the pre-litigation attorneys\u2019 fees and the actual litigation fees. It is clear from NWF\u2019s Motion to Reconsider Order Authorizing Payment of Attorneys\u2019 Fees that it opposed the awarding of <em>any </em>attorneys\u2019 fees on an interim basis. It also is apparent to us that Judge Weinstein intended to vacate his entire award of attorneys\u2019 fees when he, or someone apparently directed by him, wrote on the June 21 order, \u201cOrder vacated regarding fees.\u201d The fact that counsel for NWF used the word \u201creimburse\u201d rather than \u201cpay\u201d in the order he drafted for Judge Weinstein\u2019s signature did not indicate that he was concerned only with the pre-litigation fees already paid by the Personal Representative. Nor did Judge Weinstein\u2019s signing of the order mean that he intended to keep in place his June 21 order as to the actual litigation expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">III. <em>Distribution of the Remaining $55,000</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">NWF\u2019s final argument is that in failing to distribute the remaining estate assets, totalling approximately $55,-000, the Personal Representative breached his fiduciary duty under Md. Est. &amp; Trusts Code Ann. \u00a7 7-101(b). We disagree. That section provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">[u]nless the time of distribution is extended by order of court for good cause shown, the personal representative shall distribute all the assets of the estate of which he has taken possession or control within the time provided in \u00a7 7-305 for rendering his first account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>In his June 21 order, Judge Weinstein granted the Personal Representative\u2019s request for permission to restate his First and Final Account. Judge Weinstein did not address this portion of the order in his June 28 order. In addition, he (or someone else at his direction) wrote on the June 21 order by hand: \u201cOrder vacated as to fees.\u201d Again, there was no mention of the Personal Representative\u2019s request for leave to restate the account. Thus, the June 21 order remained effective on this issue even after Judge Weinstein issued his June 28 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Judge Weinstein\u2019s granting of the Personal Representative\u2019s request clearly constituted a court order extending the time of distribution of the estate\u2019s assets. We also believe there was \u201cgood cause shown\u201d for such an extension of time. The Personal Representative said in his Petition to Reopen the Estate that NWF had filed a complaint against him and that he wished to retain the remaining assets to cover legal fees and litigation costs incurred in defending against the complaint. In <em>Wolfe v. Turner, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals approved the withholding of estate assets where the personal representative retained $25,000, virtually the entire estate, for further accounting, pending the audit of estate and income tax returns. According to the court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">Clearly, [the personal representative] was entitled to act within reason to insulate himself from the possibility of personal liability. It may well be that his apprehensions spiralled far beyond the limits of any possible liability, but he can hardly be faulted for an excess of caution, if he acted in good faith, and we cannot say that he did not____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">267 Md. at 659, 299 A.2d 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Similarly, we cannot say that the Personal Representative in the case before us failed to act in good faith in retaining the estate\u2019s assets. Thus, he was entitled to retain the remaining $55,000 \u201cto insulate himself from the possibility of personal liability\u201d for the legal expenses he has incurred, and will continue to incur, in defending against NWF\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>claim. Neither Judge Weinstein nor Judge Raker erred in permitting the Personal Representative to do so. If the orphans\u2019 court, presently or after the D.C. case is decided, determines to award counsel fees, then the money will be readily available. If counsel fees are presently or ultimately denied, then obviously the remaining funds shall be remitted to NWF.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE ORPHANS\u2019 COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO ABIDE THE RESULT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
