One recent law review article even suggests that we \u201cblast the cap\u201d that limits recovery of noneconomic damages in personal injury actions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As shall be seen, we choose not to follow that suggestion. While the centerpiece of our decision in this case is the constitutionality of the cap, there also are other important issues that we must address. We begin with a brief summary of the incident that precipitated this action and an overview of the case\u2019s procedural history. We will add other factual details as they become necessary for our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Shortly after noon on a clear December day in 1987, Richard Edmonds was driving north on Interstate 83 in Baltimore County in a tractor trailer owned by his employer, Port East Transfer Company (Port East). The road surface was dry and visibility was good. Suddenly, the truck\u2019s left front tire exploded, causing Edmonds to lose control of the vehicle. The truck, which had been in the center lane, crossed over the left lane northbound, the grass median, and the three southbound lanes before colliding with an embankment on the southbound side of the highway. Sarah Murphy was driving in one of the southbound lanes when her car collided with Edmonds\u2019s truck. Ms. Murphy suffered serious physical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Sarah Murphy and her husband, Clark Murphy, Jr. (appellees), filed suit against Edmonds and Port East (appellants) in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County alleging gross negligence and negligence, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages. A jury trial was conducted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Judge Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., presiding) in August 1989. At the trial, the Murphys presented evidence that, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) Edmonds was late for a delivery in Harrisburg; (2) the tire blew out because it had been improperly repaired; (3) before the accident, the tire had two visible holes; and (4) Edmonds dove to the floor of the truck because he feared for his life. The jury returned a verdict awarding compensatory damages against both appellants in the total amount of $797,165.31, of which $510,000 were awarded for pain and suffering. The jury also awarded punitive damages of $3,000 against Edmonds and punitive damages of $1,000,000 against Port East.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Appellants filed a motion requesting that the trial court apply \u00a7 11-108(b) to the noneconomic damages awarded to the Murphys, as well as a motion for remittitur or, in the alternative, for a new trial, pursuant to Md. Rule 2-533. Judge Murphy denied both motions. He refused to apply the cap because he concluded that it violated equal protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>tion provisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judgment was entered on the jury\u2019s verdict on September 19, 1989. Appellants filed this appeal two days later and assert that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">I. The trial court erred in holding that the cap statute was unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">II. The trial court erred in holding that the award for loss of homemaker services was not includable within the cap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">III. The plaintiffs failed to present evidence sufficient to justify an award of compensatory damages against either defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">IV. The plaintiffs failed to present evidence sufficient to justify an award of punitive damages against either defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">V. The lower court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the doctrine of sudden emergency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">VI. The lower court erred in failing to instruct the jury regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 burden to establish notice of the defect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">VII. The trial court erred in denying the defendants\u2019 motion for new trial or in the alternative remittitur on the issue of punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">I. THE CAP</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">The cap statute, Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 ll-108(b), requires that a trial judge in a personal injury action reduce any jury verdict for noneconomic damages that exceeds $350,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Noneconomic damages are defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>as pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement, loss of consortium, or other nonpecuniary injury, but does not include punitive damages. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 ll-108(a). In the instant case, Judge Murphy ruled that the cap was unconstitutional under an equal protection analysis, and therefore refused to reduce the jury\u2019s $510,-000 award for pain and suffering to $350,000. In so ruling, Judge Murphy chose not to address other constitutional attacks that appellees mounted on the cap. Nevertheless, we shall address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">A. <em>Presumption of Constitutionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">At the outset of our discussion of the cap\u2019s constitutionality, we note that \u201cstatutes are generally presumed to be constitutional, ... they should not be declared otherwise unless the repugnancy is clear, and ... courts should avoid declaring a statute invalid if there is some less drastic way of deciding the case.\u201d <em>Miller v. Maloney Concrete Co., </em>63 Md.App. 38, 46-47, 491 A.2d 1218 (1985). As the court in <em>Sun Oil Co. v. Goldstein, </em>453 F.Supp. 787, 791 (D.Md.1978) noted, \u201c[T]he presumption of constitutionality attaches to the enactment of every statute. The burden is on plaintiff to overcome this presumption.\u201d Thus, appellees in the case before us were required to overcome a strong presumption that the cap was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>B. <em>Right to Jury Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">On the subject of the right to a jury trial, we note that \u201c[a]s of yet, the Seventh Amendment <em>per se </em>has not been applied to proceedings in state courts. Thus, we need only examine the statute\u2019s constitutional muster under the analogous state constitutional provision.\u201d <em>Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Smith, </em>79 Md.App. 591, 626 n. 20, 558 A.2d 768 <em>cert. denied, </em>317 Md. 393, 564 A.2d 407 (1989) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Maryland right to jury trial provision is Article 23 of the Declaration of Rights, which states in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">The right of trial by Jury of all issues of fact in civil proceedings in the several Courts of Law in this State, where the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of five hundred dollars, shall be inviolably preserved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Appellees contend that the cap, requiring noneconomic damages to be stricken if they exceed $350,000, \u201cinterferes with [Ms. Murphy\u2019s] fundamental right to have the issue fully determined by a judgment of her peers under Article 23.\u201d In support of their argument, the Murphys cite <em>Chauffers, Teamsters and Helpers, Local 391 v. Terry, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 1339, 108 L.Ed.2d 519 (1990), in which the Supreme Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">Maintenance of the jury as a fact-finding body is of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a jury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-11\"><em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 110 S.Ct. at 1344-45, 108 L.Ed.2d at 528 (quoting <em>Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, </em>359 U.S. 500, 501, 79 S.Ct. 948, 952, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959)).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">We addressed the constitutionality of \u00a7 ll-108(b) under Article 23 last year in <em>Potomac Electric, supra. </em>In that case, the personal representative of the estate of an adoles<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>cent killed when she came into contact with the power company\u2019s high voltage line brought a wrongful death action against the power company pursuant to Maryland\u2019s wrongful death statute, Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 3-901 to 904. We noted that wrongful death beneficiaries had only been permitted to recover for noneconomic damages under the statute since 1969. We held that \u00a7 ll-108(b) did not violate Article 23 as it pertained to wrongful death actions, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">The General Assembly would be well within its authority to abolish wrongful death actions if it chose to do so. Certainly, it would be well within its authority to repeal the 1969 statute permitting recovery for noneconomic loss in wrongful death actions. Within its powers to create a cause of action or abolish a statutory cause of action is the power to modify such statutory actions. Limitation of the jury\u2019s determination of damages in a statutorily-created cause of action is a proper modification of the remedy available in such actions and does not violate Article 23 of Maryland\u2019s Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtJ\"><em>Potomac Electric, </em>79 Md. at 628, 558 A.2d 768. We specifically declined to decide, however, whether the cap violates Article 23 when applied to common law actions for personal injuries such as the one before us now.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In <em>Franklin v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>704 F.Supp. 1325 (D.Md.1989), U.S. District Court Judge Paul Niemeyer concluded that the cap did not violate the seventh amendment or Article 23, opining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">[A] legislature adopting a prospective rule of law that limits all claims for pain and suffering in all cases is not acting as a fact finder in a legal controversy. It is acting permissibly within its legislative powers that entitle it to create and repeal causes of action. The right of jury trials in cases at law is not impacted. Juries always find facts on a matrix of laws given to them by the legislature and by precedent, and it can hardly be argued that limitations imposed by law are a usurpation of the jury-function ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>... [W]hen a legislative body, <em>without regard to facts of a particular case, dispute or incident, </em>but rather as a matter of policy and rule determines for all citizens in all incidents that may occur thereafter that recovery will be limited, the function is legislative, completely analogous to the adoption or repeal of causes of action and remedies therefor. Juries function as parts of the dispute resolution apparatus between parties; a legislature functions to make rules in advance of disputes to be applied to the disputes. The Court here can discern no blurring of the lines separating these functions in this case where Maryland adopted a prospective law limiting awards for pain and suffering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">The power of the legislature to define, augment, or even abolish complete causes of action must necessarily include the power to define by statute what damages may be recovered by a litigant with a particular cause of action____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1331 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The Supreme Court of Virginia recently upheld a $750,000 cap on <em>all </em>damages arising out of medical malpractice actions against a number of constitutional challenges, including the right to a jury trial under the Virginia Constitution, in <em>Etheridge v. Medical Center Hospitals, </em>237 Va. 87, 376 S.E.2d 525 (1989).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to the <em>Etheridge </em>court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">Without question, the jury\u2019s factfinding function extends to the assessment of damages. Once the jury has ascertained the facts and assessed the damages, however, the constitutional mandate is satisfied. Thereafter, it is the duty of the court to apply the law to the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">The limitation on medical malpractice recoveries contained in [the cap] does nothing more than establish the outer limits of a remedy provided by the General Assembly. A remedy is a matter of law, not a matter of fact. A trial court applies the remedy\u2019s limitation only <em>after </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>jury has fulfilled its fact-finding function. Thus, [the cap] does not infringe upon the right to a jury trial because the section does not apply until after a jury has completed its assigned function in the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5D\"><em>Id. </em>376 S.E.2d at 529 (emphasis in original; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The Fourth Circuit also found the Virginia cap analyzed in <em>Etheridge </em>constitutional under the seventh amendment. <em>Boyd v. Bulala, </em>877 F.2d 1191, 1196 (4th Cir.1989). A number of other courts have also upheld caps against right to jury trial challenges. <em>See Davis v. Omitowoju, </em>883 F.2d 1155 (3rd Cir.1989) (Virgin Islands cap of $250,000 on nonmedical damages in medical malpractice actions); <em>Johnson v. St. Vincent Hospital, Inc., </em>273 Ind. 374, 404 N.E.2d 585 (1989) ($500,000 cap on all damages in medical malpractice actions); <em>Samsel v. Wheeler Transport Svcs., </em>244 Kan. 726, 771 P.2d 71 (1989) ($250,000 cap on pain and suffering damages in any action <em>except </em>medical malpractice suits did not violate right to trial by jury under state constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Some courts, however, have held that their state\u2019s cap did violate the right to a jury trial. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Department of Ins., </em>507 So.2d 1080 (Fla.1987) ($450,000 cap on noneconomic damages in tort actions does not provide injured person with constitutional benefit of jury trial); <em>Wright v. Central DuPage Hosp. Assoc., </em>63 Ill.2d 313, 347 N.E.2d 736 (1976) ($500,000 cap on recovery in medical malpractice actions violates right to jury trial under state constitution); <em>Kansas Malpractice Victims Coalition v. Bell, </em>243 Kan. 333, 757 P.2d 251 (1988) (Kansas caps in medical malpractice actions of $1,000,000 for total recovery and $250,000 for noneconomic damages violate right to jury trial under state constitution); <em>Sofie v. Fibreboard Corp., </em>112 Wash.2d 636, 771 P.2d 711 (1989) (en banc), <em>modified, </em>780 P.2d 260 (1989) (statute limiting, according to formula, noneconomic damages recoverable in personal injury or wrongful death actions violated right to jury trial under state constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The logic and reasoning of <em>Franklin </em>and <em>Etheridge </em>is compelling. Thus, we hold that \u00a7 ll-108(b) does not violate the right to a jury trial guaranteed by Article 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">C. <em>Article 19 and Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">That every man, for any injury done to him in his person or property, ought to have remedy by the course of the Law of the land, and ought to have justice and right, freely without sale, fully without any denial, and speedily without delay, according to the Law of the land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The Association of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA) and the Maryland Trial Lawyers Association (MTLA)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> argue, as amicus curiae, that the $350,000 cap violates Article 19 in that it prevents seriously injured plaintiffs from fully redressing their injuries, without offering a viable <em>quid pro quo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">ATLA raised a similar argument in <em>Potomac Electric, supra. </em>We noted in that case that \u201cArticle 19 provides \u2018the same due process of law required by the fourteenth amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>79 Md.App. at 629, 558 A.2d 768. We went on to hold there that \u00a7 ll-108(b) does not violate Article 19 as applied to wrongful death beneficiaries. <em>Id. </em>at 630, 558 A.2d 768. Our holding was strongly influenced by the fact that wrongful death beneficiaries were not entitled to recover any noneconomic damages at all when Article 19 was adopted in the mid-19th century. Because wrongful death beneficiaries today, even under the $350,000 cap, are entitled to a greater remedy than the wrongful death statute provided at the time Article 19 was adopted, we held that there was no Article 19 violation. <em>Id. </em>at 630, 558 A.2d 768 (citing <em>Hill v. Fitzgerald, </em>304 Md. 689, 704-05, 501 A.2d 27 (1985)). As with the right to jury trial, we did not address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the right to a full remedy as it pertained to common law tort actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Judge Niemeyer did just that in <em>Franklin v. Mazda Motor Corp., supra, </em>and found that \u00a7 ll-108(b) does not violate Article 19.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He pointed out that \u201ca statutory limitation on recovery is a classic economic regulation and ... must be upheld if it is reasonably related to a valid legislative purpose.\u201d 704 F.Supp. at 1337 (citing <em>Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., </em>438 U.S. 59, 83, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2636, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1977)). Continuing his due process analysis, Judge Niemeyer said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">The cap certainly survives plaintiff\u2019s challenge under a reasonable basis analysis. Reducing uncertainty in damages awards and increasing the availability of insurance through reduced costs in Maryland surely are valid legislative goals. And the method chosen, that is by imposing an economic limitation on damages not otherwise measurable economically, is reasonably related to these goals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARt\"><em>Franklin, </em>704 F.Supp. at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The Supreme Court of Virginia in <em>Etheridge, supra, </em>and the Fourth Circuit in <em>Boyd, supra, </em>reasoned in a fashion somewhat similar to Judge Niemeyer\u2019s in upholding the Virginia cap on recovery in medical malpractice actions that we discussed in Part B. The <em>Etheridge </em>court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">The purpose of [the cap] \u2014 to maintain adequate health care services in this Commonwealth \u2014 bears a reasonable relation to the legislative cap \u2014 ensuring that health care providers can obtain affordable medical malpractice insurance. We hold, therefore, that substantive due process has not been violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">376 S.E.2d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">In holding that the Virginia cap did not violate the fourteenth amendment\u2019s guarantees of due process and equal protection, the Fourth Circuit said in <em>Boyd,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>[W]e agree with the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Virginia [in <em>Etheridge </em>] that the cap on liability bears a reasonable relation to a valid legislative purpose \u2014 the maintenance of adequate health care services in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">877 F.2d at 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The majority of courts that have addressed caps under either a fourteenth amendment due process analysis or an analysis under st\u00e1te constitutional provisions similar to Article 19 have upheld the caps. <em>See Davis v. Omitowoju, </em>883 F.2d 1155 (3rd Cir.1989) (Virgin Islands cap);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Lucas v. United States, </em>807 F.2d 414 (5th Cir.1986) (Texas cap on nonmedical damages in medical malpractice actions did not violate due process clause of fourteenth amendment);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Johnson v. St. Vincent Hospital, Inc., </em>273 Ind. 374, 404 N.E.2d 585 (1980); <em>Samsel v. Wheeler Transport Svcs., </em>244 Kan. 726, 771 P.2d 71 (1989) (cap did not violate right to justice without delay guaranteed by state constitution); <em>Sibley v. Board of Supervisors, </em>462 So.2d 149, <em>modified on reh\u2019g, </em>477 So.2d 1094 (La. 1985) ($500,000 cap on recovery in medical malpractice actions did not violate due process under fourteenth amendment or right of access to courts guaranteed by state constitution). <em>Contra, Smith v. Department of Ins., </em>507 So.2d 1080 (Fla. 1987) ($450,000 cap on noneconomic damages in all tort actions violates plaintiffs\u2019 right of access to courts under state constitution); <em>Lucas v. United States, </em>757 S.W.2d 687 (Tex.1988) <em>(see </em>footnote 6, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">We agree with the sound reasoning of the majority of courts that have analyzed caps under due process analy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>ses or under constitutional provisions similar to Article 19 and found no constitutional violation. Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 ll-108(b) violates neither Article 19 nor the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">D. <em>Separation of Powers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">ATLA also mentions in passing that \u00a7 ll-108(b) violates the separation of powers doctrine in Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That article states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOR\">That the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">According to ATLA, the cap violates Article 8 in that it (and through the cap, presumably, the Legislature) interferes with the jury\u2019s function to determine the true amount of damages. We disagree. As Judge Niemeyer said in concluding that the cap does not violate Article 8,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">The power of the legislature to abolish the common law necessarily includes the power to set reasonable limits on recoverable damages in causes of action the legislature chooses to recognize. The Court therefore agrees with [the defendant] that if the legislature can, without violating separation of powers principles, establish statutes of limitations, establish statutes of repose, create presumptions, create new causes of action and abolish old ones, then it also can limit noneconomic damages without violating the separations of powers doctrine____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-9\"><em>Franklin, </em>704 F.Supp. at 1336. The Supreme Court of Virginia in <em>Etheridge, supra, </em>held that that state\u2019s cap did not violate the Virginia Constitution\u2019s separation of powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>provision, which is very similar to Article 8.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> According to the <em>Etheridge </em>court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">[W]hether the remedy prescribed in [the Virginia cap] is viewed as a modification of the common law or as establishing the jurisdiction of the courts in specific cases, clearly it was a proper exercise of legislative power.

If the legislation infringed a fundamental right or involved a suspect classification, strict scrutiny was applied.

Appellees do not appear to argue that the right to receive an award of noneconomic damages in full is fundamental, or that personal injury victims whose noneconomic damages exceed the cap constitute a suspect class. According to Judge Murphy, however, the cap does infringe upon an \u201cimportant right,\u201d which he termed \u201cthe right to press a claim for pain and suffering.\u201d He noted that such a right \u201cwas recognized at common law before the Maryland Constitution was adopted.\u201d The trial judge said the cap creates two classes of plaintiffs: those who are less severely injured and are entitled to keep everything the jury awards them, and those who are catastrophically injured and are not entitled to receive anything the jury awards them for noneconomic damages over $350,000. Because he found the right infringed upon to be an \u201cimportant\u201d one, Judge Murphy applied the heightened scrutiny test to the cap, ruling that the statute is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">It seems from the trial judge\u2019s opinion that he based his equal protection analysis on Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> rather than on the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution. Nevertheless, we will address the latter provision briefly because appellee and ATLA argue that \u00a7 ll-108(b) violates equal protection principles under both constitutions. Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s use of the rational basis test in <em>Duke Power Co. v.

Performing this \u201cminimal scrutiny\u201d test, we held that the cap does not violate the fourteenth amendment\u2019s equal protection clause. As we said in that case, \u201cWe believe that the General Assembly possessed a rational basis to believe that a liability insurance crisis existed and that the enactment of the cap was not arbitrary or unreasonable to alleviate the financial crisis it may have perceived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, 558 A.2d 768. We have not changed our view on this subject since we decided <em>Potomac Electric </em>last year. Thus, we hold that the cap does not violate the fourteenth amendment\u2019s equal protection provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">As we pointed out in <em>Potomac Electric, </em>however, upholding the cap\u2019s constitutionality under the federal constitution does not necessarily resolve the equal protection issue under the state constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">Although the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and the equal protection principle embodied in Article 24 are \u201cin pari materia,\u201d and decisions applying one provision are persuasive authority in cases involving the other, we reiterate that each provision is independent, and a violation of one is not necessarily a violation of the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">79 Md.App. at 633, 558 A.2d 768 (quoting <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, supra, </em>289 Md. at 714, 426 A.2d 929). We noted, for example, that the Court of Appeals in <em>Hornbeck v. Somerset County Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 597, 458 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>758 (1983) \u201cimplicitly recognized that significant interference with the \u2018right to take advantage of a thorough and efficient education\u2019 would merit heightened scrutiny,\u201d despite the fact that the Supreme Court had applied only the rational basis test in analyzing the same right under the fourteenth amendment in <em>Rodriguez, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We begin our analysis of the cap under Article 24 by reiterating that the right involved here \u2014 the right to be compensated fully for noneconomic damages \u2014 is not a fundamental right and does not involve a suspect class. Thus, we will not apply strict scrutiny. In addition, we note that we already have determined that the Legislature had a rational basis for its classifications under the cap. Accordingly, we will uphold the statute under Article 24 as well if we determine that the rational basis test is the appropriate test.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The only question remaining is whether the statute should be analyzed under the rational basis test (under which we certainly will hold it constitutional under Article 24) or under the heightened scrutiny test (under which we might conclude that it violates Article 24). More specifically, because \u00a7 ll-108(b) clearly does not impact upon any \u201c \u2018sensitive,\u2019 although not necessarily suspect criteria of classification,\u201d such as gender discrimination, the question is whether the statute either affects an \u201cimportant\u201d personal right or \u201cworks a \u2018significant\u2019 interference with liberty or a denial of a benefit vital to the individual.\u201d <em>Potomac Electric, </em>79 Md.App. at 631, 558 A.2d 768. The able and experienced trial judge based his ruling that the cap was unconstitutional on a finding that the right involved here is an \u201cimportant\u201d one. Appellees and ATLA agree, and neither appears to contend that a liberty was interfered with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>or a vital benefit was denied. Appellant and amici,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> on the other hand, contend that the right to be fully compensated for noneconomic damages in a tort action is not an important right and that the appropriate test is thus the rational basis test.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">As one noted constitutional scholar seems to imply, the Supreme Court has never articulated the criteria that make an interest \u201cimportant.\u201d L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>1611-12 (2d ed. 1988). The only appellate decision in Maryland to utilize the heightened scrutiny standard of review, <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 426 A.2d 929 (1981), although somewhat instructive, is not dis-positive. In that case the Court of Appeals struck down, on equal protection grounds, a statute that prevented certain retired judges from practicing law for compensation. The Court applied heightened scrutiny because it held that the \u201cright to engage in a chosen calling, once all reasonable requirements established by the legislature for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens have been complied with,\u201d was an important personal right. <em>Id. </em>at 718, 728-29, 426 A.2d 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">A number of courts have applied equal protection analyses to statutes that limit a plaintiffs recovery for all types of damages, both economic and noneconomic.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>cases, however, do not aid our decision. We have found only five courts that have applied equal protection analyses to statutes limiting only noneconomic or nonmedical damages. Four of the courts held that the caps were constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In <em>Fein v. Permanente Medical Group, </em>38 Cal.3d 137, 211 Cal.Rptr. 368, 695 P.2d 665 (1985), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>474 U.S. 892, 106 S.Ct. 214, 88 L.Ed.2d 215 (1985), the California Supreme Court upheld, against an equal protection challenge, a statute limiting recovery on noneconomic damages to $250,000 in medical malpractice actions. In that case, the trial judge applied the cap to the jury\u2019s $500,000 award of noneconomic damages. The plaintiff appealed, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the statute improperly discriminated within the class of medical malpractice victims by denying a \u201ccomplete\u201d recovery of damages only to those malpractice plaintiffs whose noneconomic damages exceeded $250,000. <em>Id. </em>211 Cal.Rptr. at 385, 695 P.2d at 682. The high court applied the rational basis test. In a footnote, the court distinguished <em>Carson v. Maurer, infra, </em>by saying that in finding the New Hampshire statute violative of equal protective provisions, \u201cthe <em>Carson </em>court ... applied an \u2018intermediate scrutiny\u2019 standard of review that is inconsistent with the standard applicable in this state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>211 Cal.Rptr. at 385 n. 19, 695 P.2d at 682 n. 19. It is clear from this comment that California does not recognize a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>\u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d standard, and the court therefore was not compelled to determine if the right to recover for noneconomic damages was an \u201cimportant\u201d right.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Analyzing the same California cap in <em>Hoffman v. United States, </em>767 F.2d 1431 (9th Cir.1985), the Ninth Circuit held that it did not violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. Following a bench trial, the federal district court judge determined that the cap violated \u201cequal protection,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and entered a judgment including, <em>inter alia, </em>$1,000,000 for noneconomic damages. The Ninth Circuit first noted that the Supreme Court of California already had held in <em>Fein </em>that the statute did not violate the equal protection provision of the California constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The <em>Hoffman </em>court then analyzed the cap under the fourteenth amendment. Unlike the state court, the federal court discussed the intermediate level of scrutiny, saying that the United States Supreme Court has applied heightened scrutiny \u201conly to gender based classifications ... and to categorizations premised on legitimacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1435. The court seemed to rely heavily on an Eighth Circuit case<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in which that court chose not to apply heightened scrutiny to a statute that placed a six-year statute of limitations on malpractice actions except when foreign bodies unintentionally left in the body cause injury or death \u201cbecause the case involved none of the classifications to which the Supreme Court has applied an intermediate test (illegitimacy or gender).\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>767 F.2d at 1436. The <em>Hoffman </em>court then stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">Finding that [the cap] does not involve any suspect or quasi-suspect classification, a fundamental right, or a classification requiring a heightened scrutiny, we conclude that the proper level of scrutiny is the rational basis test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>Id. </em>The court did not discuss whether a plaintiffs right to recover for pain and suffering constituted an \u201cimportant\u201d right.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In <em>Davis v. Omitowoju, </em>883 F.2d 1155 (3rd Cir.1989), the court analyzed the Virgin Islands $250,000 cap on nonmedical damages in medical malpractice actions. The court did not mention the heightened scrutiny test. Its entire discussion of the appropriate level of scrutiny reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASg\">As the Fourth Circuit stated in disposing of both the due process and equal protection claims advanced in <em>Boyd v. Bulala, </em>877 F.2d 1191 (4th Cir.1989),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201ca limitation on a common law measure of recovery does not violate a fundamental right or create a suspect classification.\u201d Davis did not assert any fundamental right to an uncapped jury verdict, nor could she. Nor has Davis attempted to, nor could she, style herself and all malpractice claimants as a suspect class. Any claim that she asserts must therefore be reviewed under the rational basis test. <em>Id. </em>at 1196.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The Fifth Circuit upheld the Texas cap on nonmedical damages against a fourteenth amendment equal protection challenge in <em>Lucas v. United States, </em>807 F.2d 414 (5th Cir.1986).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Like the <em>Davis </em>court, the court in <em>Lucas </em>did not discuss the heightened scrutiny test, saying only that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">Any federal equal protection argument fails under the tests established by the United States Supreme Court. The strict scrutiny standard, <em>see Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969), is inapplicable because we have neither a suspect class nor a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>fundamental right in issue. Under the rational basis test, <em>McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961), we find that there is a rational basis for \u00a7 11.02 and that the legislature enacted the statute in an attempt to accomplish a legitimate purpose. <em>See Chrysler Corp. v. Texas Motor Vehicle Commission, </em>755 F.2d 1192, 1203 (5th Cir.1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The only court that has held that a cap on noneconomic damages violated equal protection provisions was the Supreme Court of New Hampshire in <em>Carson v. Maurer, </em>120 N.H. 925, 424 A.2d 825 (1980). The <em>Carson </em>court was called upon to analyze the constitutionality of RSA ch. RSA 507-C (Supp.1979), in which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">the legislature set forth rigorous standards for qualified expert testimony, created a two-year statute of limitations applicable to most medical malpractice actions, required that notice of intent to sue be given at least sixty days before commencing the action, prohibited the statement of the total damages claimed as an ad damnum or otherwise, abolished the collateral source rule, limited the amount of damages recoverable for non-economic loss to $250,000, empowered the court to order periodic payments of any future damages in excess of $50,000, and established a contingent fee scale for attorneys in medical malpractice actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">424 A.2d at 829. According to that court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">Although the right to recover for personal injuries is not a \u201cfundamental right,\u201d it is nevertheless an important substantive right. In <em>Estate of Cargill v. City of Rochester, supra, </em>119 N.H. [661] at 667, 406 A.2d [704] at 707, we applied the rational basis test in evaluating classifications which, like those in RSA ch. 507 C (Supp.1979), place restrictions on an individual\u2019s right to recover in tort. We now conclude, however, that the rights involved herein are sufficiently important to require that the restrictions imposed on those rights be subjected to a more rigorous judicial scrutiny than allowed under the rational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>basis test. Consequently, the classifications created by RSA ch. RSA 507-C (Supp.1979) \u201cmust be reasonable, not arbitrary, <em>and </em>must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation\u201d in order to satisfy State equal protection guarantees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><em>Id. </em>424 A.2d at 830-31 (citations omitted) (emphasis in Carson). The court went on to address each of the limitations within RSA ch. RSA 507-C (Supp.1979) individually. With regard to the $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages, RSA 507-C:7 II (Supp.1979), the court first pointed out that the New Hampshire limit was modeled after the California law that a lower court in that state had declared unconstitutional. <em>Carson, </em>424 A.2d at 836. <em>(Fein v. Permanente Medical Group, supra, </em>upholding the California cap, was not decided until more than four years later.) The <em>Carson </em>court then held that the cap denied medical malpractice plaintiffs the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the state constitution. <em>Id. </em>424 A.2d at 838. In reaching this holding, the court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">We find that the necessary relationship between the legislative goal of rate reduction and the means chosen to attain that goal is weak for two reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">\u201cFirst, paid-out damage awards constitute only a small part of total insurance premium costs. Second, and of primary importance, few individuals suffer non-economic damages in excess of $250,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-8\"><em>Id. </em>424 A.2d at 836 (quoting Jenkins, <em>California\u2019s Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act: An Equal Protection Challenge, </em>52 S.CaLL.Rev. 829, 960-61 (1979)). While the <em>Carson </em>court chose to apply heightened scrutiny to the New Hampshire cap and the other limitations included in RSA ch. RSA 507-C (Supp.1979), it gave no explanation for why those \u201crights\u201d were \u201csufficiently important\u201d to merit intermediate scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Thus, none of the above cases present us with guidelines for determining whether the right to recover for noneco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>nomic damages is an important personal right meriting heightened scrutiny. We thus decide the issue in a virtual vacuum.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In seeking an answer, we certainly acknowledge that an individual\u2019s unfortunate experience of pain and suffering is indeed \u201cimportant\u201d to the person who feels that pain. That personal importance, as significant as it may seem, does not elevate the right of full compensation to the same status as the right to pursue one\u2019s chosen profession as in <em>Waldron. </em>We believe that every person enjoys the natural right to be free of pain and suffering caused by the negligent or wilful act of another. But that important natural right is not ipso facto transmuted by nature or evolution of the common law into an \u201cimportant\u201d personal right within the scope of constitutional analysis. We are not faced here with a statute abolishing entirely the right to recover noneconomic damages. Instead, the cap limits the noneconomic recovery to $350,000, a significant amount of money. This amount is over and above the damages plaintiffs are awarded for economic loss, such as medical bills and lost earnings, which remain unlimited.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">There is no total deprivation to the individual of the kinds of rights one would expect in a democratic society.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Additionally, unlike many \u201crights\u201d at common law, the right to recover for pain and suffering is not of ancient origin and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>does not enjoy a long history.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Therefore, we shall not consider the right to full compensation for noneconomic damages as an important personal right such as to trigger heightened scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Even if we considered the right to full recovery of noneconomic damages an important personal right, and thus chose to apply heightened scrutiny, we still would hold \u00a7 ll-108(b) constitutional because we believe the classifications the statute creates are \u201creasonable, not arbitrary, and ... rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation.\u201d <em>Potomac Electric, supra. </em>The \u201cobject\u201d of \u00a7 ll-108(b) is the increase in availability and affordability of liability insurance in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The Legislature had before it a report by the Governor\u2019s Task Force to Study Liability Insurance, a group established in August 1985 \u201cto develop ... recommendations to help ensure the availability of adequate liability insurance coverage at an affordable cost in the state.\u201d Report of the Governor\u2019s Task Force to Study Liability Insurance 2 (Dec. 1985).

According to the task force,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">The ceiling on noneconomic damages will help contain awards within realistic limits, reduce the exposure of defendants to unlimited damages for pain and suffering, lead to more settlements, and enable insurance carriers to set more accurate rates because of greater predictability of the size of judgments. The limitation is designed to lend greater stability to the insurance market and make it more attractive to underwriters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">A substantial portion of the verdicts being returned in liability cases are for noneconomic losses. The translation of these losses into dollar amounts is an extremely subjective process as these claims are not easily amenable to accurate, or even approximate, monetary valuation. There is a common belief that these awards are the primary source of overly generous and arbitrary liability claim payments. They vary substantially from person to person, even when applied to similar cases or similar injuries, and can be fabricated with relative ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">A cap on allowable pain and suffering awards will help reduce the incidents of unrealistically high liability jury awards, yet at the same time protect the right of the injured party to recover the full amount of economic losses, including all lost wages and medical expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKs\"><em>Id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In July 1985, Governor Harry Hughes appointed the 28-member Joint Executive/Legislative Task Force on Medical Malpractice Insurance.

The working group identified and discussed four problem areas, including \u201c[t]he explosive growth in the damages awarded in tort lawsuits, particularly with regard to non-economic awards such as pain and suffering or punitive damages.\u201d Report of the Tort Policy Working Group at Introduction, p. 2. The group noted that \u201cthe increase in the number of tort lawsuits and the level of awarded damages (or settlements) in and of itself has an obvious inflating effect on insurance premiums.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Chapter 2, p. 21. Among the working group\u2019s eight recommendations was a suggestion that noneconomic damages be limited to $100,000. <em>Id. </em>at Chapter 4, p. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Based upon this legislative history, we have little difficulty concluding that the classifications created by \u00a7 ll-108(b) \u2014 those plaintiffs who have been awarded noneconomic damages greater than $350,000, and those who have been awarded noneconomic damages less than $350,000\u2014 have a \u201cfair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation\u201d \u2014 increasing the availability and affordability of liability insurance. Thus, we hold that the subject legislation is constitutional on all fronts.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>II. THE CAP AND HOMEMAKER SERVICES</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Appellants contend that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in holding that the award for loss of homemaker\u2019s services was not includible within the cap.\u201d Judge Murphy, in pertinent part, instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">There is a separate claim ... presented in this case by Mr. and Mrs. Murphy for damages to their marital relationship which has resulted from the accident. So here you consider what effect the injuries Mrs. Murphy sustained in this accident have on the marital relationship. The items are set forth here. We\u2019ve got loss of household services in the past, \u201cfuture loss of household services,\u201d and then other corsortium damages. What we\u2019re talking about here is an amount you feel is fair and just compensation for the loss of society, affection, assistance, fellowship. These are the things that you put in \u201cother consortium\u201d damages. There is a total for compensatory damages to Mrs. Murphy, there is a total for the claim of Mr. and Mrs. Murphy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Evidence had been presented to the jury that before the accident Ms. Murphy was a good housewife who did all the cooking, cleaning, and gardening, but that since the accident she was no longer capable of performing normal homemaker services. Those services ranged from polishing the family silver to pulling up weeds from the garden. Additionally, there was supportive expert medical testimony indicating that she would have \u201cgreat trouble doing her housework.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Expert testimony was presented by each side as to the cost of hiring someone to perform, in the future, those household services that Ms. Murphy was no longer capable of performing. The Murphys\u2019 economist valued those services at $270,863, while appellants\u2019 expert estimated the value to be $162,517. As compensatory damages for the Murphys, the jury returned the following verdicts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>(1) past loss of household services $ 20,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">(2) future loss of household services $225,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">(3) other consortium damages $0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">Total of Items (1) through (3) $245,000</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Appellants contend \u201c[b]ecause the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was for loss of consortium and the statute<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> specifically includes loss of consortium within noneconomic damages, the plain meaning and language of the statute must be applied and the claim for loss of homemaker\u2019s services must be included within the cap.\u201d Appellees posit that the cost of hiring someone to perform those household services that Ms. Murphy can no longer perform, although possibly encompassed within the consortium claim, certainly cannot be construed as a \u201cnonpecuniary\u201d loss. They reason that the Maryland cases include certain types of economic loss within the definition of \u201cconsortium.\u201d They point out that the Court of Appeals in <em>Nicholson v. Blanchette, </em>239 Md. 168, 184-85, 210 A.2d 732, 213 A.2d 71 (1965), approved the definition of consortium found in the first <em>Restatement of Torts </em>\u00a7 693, which included any reasonable expense incurred by the husband in providing medical treatment. Appellees further argue that if one were to follow appellants\u2019 theory to its logical conclusion, courts would be compelled to include the cost of plastic surgery required to correct disfigurement which of itself is a noneconomic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Finally, in challenging appellants\u2019 rationale, appellees suggest that \u201cthe cost for special adaptations to home, auto, or workplace due to \u2018physical impairments\u2019 was not intended by the legislature to be considered a \u2018noneconomic damage,\u2019 \u201d yet appellants would have us so rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">While there is much wisdom in appellees\u2019 argument, it is obvious that final resolution of the issue is dependent upon legislative intent. While appellants would have us rely on the plain language of the statute alone, giving the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>their ordinary and natural meaning, <em>see Carolina Freight Carriers v. Keane, </em>311 Md. 335, 338, 534 A.2d 1337 (1988), we suggest that the term \u201cconsortium\u201d may no longer possess the \u201cordinary and natural meaning\u201d that it would appear to have at first glance. Initially, we observe that the \u201cconsortium\u201d as designated in the statute is classified as but another \u201cnonpecuniary injury.\u201d There no longer seems to be a universality of definition with respect to \u201closs of consortium.\u201d We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The \u201cconsortium\u201d rule at <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>is somewhat different from its earlier counterpart quoted with approval by the Court of Appeals in <em>Nicholson, supra. </em>The later version provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">(1) One who by reason of his tortious conduct is liable to one spouse for illness or other bodily harm is subject to liability to the other spouse for the resulting loss of the society and services of the first spouse, including impairment of capacity for sexual intercourse, and for reasonable expense incurred by the second spouse in providing medical treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">(2) Unless it is not possible to do so, the action for loss of society and services is required to be joined with the action for illness or bodily harm, and recovery for loss of society and services is allowed only if the two actions are so joined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-8\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 693, at 495.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">Comment (f), \u201cDamages,\u201d provides in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">The major element of damages in an action based on this Section is any loss or impairment of the other spouse\u2019s society, companionship, affection and sexual relations. These are not matters of economic loss susceptible of pecuniary proof, and their monetary value must be assessed by the jury \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-11\">The impaired spouse, in an action for bodily injury brought against the defendant, may recover for bodily harm and emotional distress, loss or impairment of earning capacity and reasonable medical and other expenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>(See \u00a7 924). The action by the deprived spouse must therefore not include any of these items, directly or indirectly____ To avoid duplication, the deprived spouse can recover expenses for medical treatment of the impaired spouse only for those expenses that have been incurred solely by the deprived spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The modern approach to \u201closs of consortium\u201d is further explicated in a learned treatise, <em>Prosser and Keaton on Torts </em>(5th ed. 1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">In addition to the claims recoverable by either spouse for loss of services and society, the husband was allowed to recover the cost of the wife\u2019s medical treatment. This rule was based on the legal obligations of the husband to provide medical attention for his wife and on the fact that the wife was likely to be dependent upon the husband for such attention. Considerable social change has taken place since this rule was first followed, and the contemporary decisions show no special fondness for it. If the wife has paid the medical bills, or has obligated her credit specifically to do so, or if the injury occurred before marriage, the wife will be permitted to recover her own medical expenses. Some courts have spoken, somewhat generally, about allowing the wife to recover when appropriate, or to recover for future medical, though not past. At least one court has said that equality of treatment requires that the wife always recover her own losses, and statutes in some states have been interpreted to reach the same result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">The cause of action for loss of consortium has been allowed for \u201closs of household and other services that are of such a character that they cannot be rendered by hired help and on which, by reason of their character, no market value can be placed\u201d and \u201cfor loss of services that ... [have been performed] though they are of a type that can be rendered by hired help.\u201d 41 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Husband and Wife </em>\u00a7 449, at 378. Another similar yet slightly different defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>tion is set forth in another learned treatise, 2 F. Harper, F. James and O. Gray, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 8.9 (2d ed. 1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzE\">Loss of spouse\u2019s consortium. The common law recognized the husband\u2019s interest in his wife\u2019s health and companionship and allowed him to recover from a tortfeasor for the loss of her consortium. \u201cThe term \u2018consortium\u2019 is usually defined as encompassing the services of the wife ... and the variety of intangible relations which exist between spouses living together in marriage---These intangible elements are generally described in terms of \u2018affection, society, companionship and sexual relations.\u2019 ... These intangibles have also been defined as the \u2018constellation of companionship, dependence, reliance, affection, sharing and aid which are legally recognizable, protected rights arising out of the civil contract of marriage.\u2019 \u201d Any or all such items may be taken into consideration by the jury in assessing damages, and recovery includes not only damages for services, society, and sexual relations lost at the date of trial but the estimated future loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 550-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">As Judge Adkins said for the court in <em>Carolina Freight Carriers:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">We should search for legislative intent, the purpose, aim, and policy of the legislation, by looking at the words of the statute, as \u201ccontrolled by the context in which they appear,\u201d and as \u201cread in the light of other external manifestations of that purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">311 Md. at 339, 534 A.2d 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">We note again that the legislature characterized \u201closs of consortium\u201d as a \u201cnonpecuniary loss.\u201d It seems that in this day and age \u201cconsortium\u201d includes both pecuniary and nonpecuniary components which can be the subject of loss. It was obviously the goal of the legislature to place a limit or cap upon the nonpecuniary components of loss of consortium such as affection, society, companionship, and sexual relations, and those services that might not be rendered by hired help. This is exemplified by the authors of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>subject legislation placing a certain emphasis on the nature of the loss by distinguishing pecuniary from nonpecuniary loss. But given the implicit legislative recognition that the nonpecuniary loss (and not the pecuniary loss) would be subject to the cap, we hold that compensation for the damages proved under the joint claim<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> of Mr. and Mrs. Murphy for services which can, but need not necessarily, be performed by hired help, was not includable within the cap. They were awarded for those kinds of services that the jury found that Ms. Murphy could no longer perform. The trial judge did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">III. &amp; IV. LIABILITY: COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Appellants contend that appellees failed to present evidence at trial to justify an award of punitive damages. They assert that the evidence did not meet the stringent standard set by Maryland courts for imposing punitive damages in automobile tort cases. To award punitive damages in the absence of actual malice or intent, a defendant\u2019s conduct must constitute a wanton or reckless disregard for human life in the operation of a motor vehicle, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>known risks attendant to such conduct. <em>Thorne v. Contee, </em>80 Md.App. 481, 489, 565 A.2d 102 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Appellees argue that, as to appellant Port East, the jury could well have believed that the condition of the tire was known to the company, and the company \u201cjust took a chance.\u201d This, they assert, would be evidence of a reckless disregard for the safety of others legally sufficient for the jury to exercise its discretion in awarding punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">As to appellant Edmonds, appellees contend that his insistence that he inspected the tire, combined with expert witness Emanuel Zambelas\u2019s testimony as to the tire\u2019s defective condition, would allow the jury to reasonably conclude that Edmonds also decided to take a chance that the tire would not blow despite the risk of harm to himself and others if it did blow out. Appellees argue further that Edmonds\u2019s realization of the risk involved is reflected in his alleged statement that \u201c... the front tire blew out ..., I was afraid for my life and I jumped on the floor of the cab, thought I was going to die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Upon review of the evidence, we hold that there is insufficient evidence to hold that either Port East\u2019s or Edmonds\u2019s conduct was grossly negligent based on the notice of a \u201cdefective tire\u201d alleged at trial. We further hold that testimony as to Edmonds\u2019s conduct subsequent to the tire blowout was not legally sufficient to establish gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">On the issue of whether notice of a punctured tire was evidence of a reckless disregard for the safety of others, we believe, <em>Baublitz v. Henz, </em>73 Md.App. 538, 535 A.2d 497 (1988), is controlling. In <em>Baublitz, </em>we held that evidence as to size and weight of a truck, together with evidence as to \u201cworn\u201d brakes, while sufficient to support a finding of ordinary negligence of the employer in entrustment of the vehicle to an employee, was not sufficient to show extraordinary and outrageous conduct amounting to wanton and reckless disregard for human life. Thus, such evidence did not support an award of punitive damages against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>employer. In reaching that decision, this court relied on the fact that the only testimony of prior knowledge of the defective brakes was (1) testimony from the truck driver that he had reported to his supervisor a statement of another driver that the brakes were \u201cworn,\u201d and (2) the testimony of the plaintiff that he heard the driver say that \u201che told his supervisor a ways back or a while back that something was wrong with the brakes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547, 535 A.2d 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Contrasting <em>Baublitz </em>-with the case <em>sub judice, </em>we perceive no further justification for submitting the issue of punitive damages against either appellant. The only evidence of prior knowledge of a defective tire was the testimony of appellees\u2019 expert witness, Zambelas, that the holes in the tire would have been noticeable by an exterior inspection. In fact, testimony indicated that evidence of the rusting of the belts of the tire caused by defective repair,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the major cause of the blowout, was not visible on exterior inspection. Although such evidence may give rise to simple negligence, it is not demonstrative of extraordinary and outrageous conduct amounting to wanton and reckless disregard for human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Appellees further contend, however, that Edmonds\u2019s alleged reaction to the tire blowout, diving onto the floor of the truck of the cab, constituted a wanton or reckless disregard for human life. On the basis of respondeat superior then, they argue, Port East would be liable for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Upon reviewing the record, we conclude that here again the evidence is not sufficient to find gross negligence. Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred in denying appellants\u2019 motions for judgment on the issue of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">In ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court must assume the truth of all credible evidence on the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>and of all inferences fairly deducible therefrom, and must consider them in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made. <em>Tippett v. Quade, </em>19 Md.App. 49, 56, 309 A.2d 481 (1973). This is not to say, however, that the issue should go to the jury in every case where a party has introduced some evidence of negligence. <em>Id. </em>If the direct evidence approaches the outer limits of credibility, it would be insufficient. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the vice president of Port East testified that Edmonds told him in the hospital that he was scared for his life and jumped onto the floor of the cab. Appellees argue that the jury could believe that Edmonds \u201cabandoned ship\u201d in order to save himself and allowed the truck to cross over into the oncoming lanes of traffic without even attempting to brake. This conduct alone may not be sufficient to establish prima facie evidence of willful and wanton conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Warnke v. Essex, </em>217 Md. 183, 141 A.2d 728 (1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">The relevant inquiry, then, is whether an ordinarily prudent person would have acted in the same manner as the defendant did in this case. The mere fact that a person finds himself in a predicament or emergency does not automatically relieve him of the obligation to use ordinary care. The amount of care might change, of course, but the degree or standard of <em>ordinary care </em>is always the same, <em>i.e., </em>the care that would be used by an ordinarily prudent person under the same circumstances, the emergency itself always being considered and weighed as one of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 187, 141 A.2d 728 (emphasis in original). In judging Edmonds\u2019s actions in light of the emergency circumstances with which he was confronted, we consider that some courts have held that the law imposes no rule of conduct upon one who is suddenly confronted by impending danger, and is compelled to act, not by the dictates of reason but by the instinct of self preservation. <em>Barnhardt v. American Glycerine Co., </em>113 Kan. 136, 213 P. 663, 665 (1923) (court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>held that individual whose automobile loaded with nitroglycerine was stuck on a steep hill, was not guilty of actionable negligence in abandoning the automobile when he discovered it was on fire). <em>See also Donahue v. Kelly, </em>181 Pa. 93, 37 A. 186 (1897) (court held that an individual was not liable for culpable negligence to a third person injured when the individual, burned severely by a lamp he was carrying, threw it and it exploded); <em>State v. Sims, </em>138 W.Va. 482, 77 S.E.2d 151 (1953) (court held that where a fire occurred in a garage and spread immediately to the clothing of a mechanic, the mechanic was not guilty of negligence in his unsuccessful efforts to extinguish or check the fire in the garage even though he initially ran outside to extinguish his own clothing).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We base our holding, however, not on the emergency doctrine but rather on our determination that the direct evidence at trial approaches the outer limits of credibility. <em>See Tippett, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">As discussed above, there exists contested testimony that Edmonds dove onto the floor of the cab because he was afraid for his life. Appellees would have us infer that such conduct occurred immediately upon the blowout of the tire and without any previous efforts of Edmonds to gain control over the vehicle. We are also faced, however, with undisputed evidence that Edmonds had applied his brakes from the beginning to the end of the emergency. This was illustrated by the post-accident photographs supplied by Trooper Boyd, showing skid marks all the way across the road, as well as by his testimony. Evidence and inferences deducible therefrom that Edwards immediately dove to the floor are incredible when considered together with evidence that he applied the brakes throughout the incident. Courts retain the power to set the limits of what is credible evidence. <em>Tippett, supra, </em>19 Md.App. at 57, 309 A.2d 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">We are unswayed in our view by the possibility that Edmonds may have \u201ctaken a dive\u201d after failing to regain control through application of the brakes but prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>collision. We hold as a matter of law that evidence of such conduct at that point in time considering the emergency circumstances, would be insufficient to constitute gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We are convinced, on the other hand, that appellees presented evidence sufficient to justify an award of compensatory damages against either appellant. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellees, the jury could have reasonably believed that the tire holes were noticed and ignored by the company or would have been noticed had the driver made a reasonable inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Appellant contends that there is insufficient evidence to establish negligence since the only testimony offered by appellees as to what inspection procedure of the tire was \u201cproper\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d or as to what inspection actually took place was that of Edmonds himself. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">We cite again the testimony of appellees\u2019 expert witness, Zambelas, that the holes in the tire would have been observable through an exterior inspection and that the driver probably did not do a good job of inspecting the tire if he did not see the holes. Furthermore, Edmonds\u2019s testimony at trial is contradicted on several occasions by his deposition testimony. The deposition testimony read into the record at trial indicated that Edmonds had stated the following: Edmonds\u2019s supervisor told him he was late and should hurry; Edmonds was going 59 or 60 m.p.h.; the employees in the shop told him that the tire that later blew out was a new tire; he was \u201cpushing it\u201d because he was late; and that he did not touch the brakes. Edmonds denied, or claimed not to remember, making any of the above statements. We hold that Zambelas\u2019s testimony, in conjunction with the inconsistent testimony of Edmonds, provided sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer that both Port East and Edmonds were negligent of either failing to inspect the tire or ignoring notice of a punctured tire.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>V. &amp; VI. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Appellants also contend, on appeal, that the lower court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the doctrine of sudden emergency and in failing to instruct the jury regarding the Murphys\u2019 burden to establish notice of the defect. Appellants had provided the judge with requested instructions on each of these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Appellees counter that the issues are not properly preserved for our review under Maryland Rule 2-520. This rule provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Subsequent to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, appellants\u2019 counsel made the following exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">Your Honor, Instructions 11 through 37 that we have presented to you talk about basically the elements of negligence as it pertains to the plaintiffs\u2019 case, and I don\u2019t believe from the instructions that were given the jurors are going to be able to differentiate between the driving and what happened subsequent to the blowout, the cause of the blowout, patching of the tire or all of the other elements that are a part of what the plaintiff is required to prove. Your instructions, although they define \u201cnegligence,\u201d did not break it down with regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 burden of proof as to what would constitute negligence, and I feel without giving Instructions 11 through 37, that they will not be able to make that type of determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Appellees argue that this exception is inadequate to preserve this issue for appellate review under the holding in <em>Belt\u2019s Wharf Whses., Inc. v. International Products Corp., </em>213 Md. 585, 132 A.2d 588 (1957). There the court held that mere reference to numbers of proposed instructions that the court has declined to grant is clearly insufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>preserve the issue on appeal. Appellants counter that <em>Sergeant Co. v. Pickett, </em>283 Md. 284, 288, 388 A.2d 543 (1978), not <em>Belt\u2019s Wharf, supra, </em>is controlling here. In <em>Sergeant Co., supra, </em>the court held that reference to a written prayer by number and subject matter, coupled with the court\u2019s implicit acknowledgment that it comprehended the point being asserted, was substantial compliance with the applicable Maryland Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In the instant case, it is far from certain that the trial judge actually comprehended the point being asserted. A review of the record fails, at least, to indicate any explicit or implicit acknowledgment of such comprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Appellants\u2019 exception makes reference to twenty-six of a total of fifty-one instructions submitted to the court. This exception to the court instructions complains that the instructions, although they define negligence, did not break it down with regard to the Murphys\u2019 burden of proof as to what would constitute negligence. Appellants\u2019 counsel, however, made no specific reference to the court\u2019s failure to instruct as to \u201cnotice of defect\u201d or the \u201cemergency doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Furthermore, after hearing appellants\u2019 exception and then discussing with counsel the adequacy of other instructions dealing with punitive damages and future medical damages, the court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">All right. Well, I\u2019ll take care of that for you. But as to the others, I think I\u2019ve covered all of the issues, so I\u2019m not going to at this point say anything other than the clarification that\u2019s been requested about punitive damages. Depending upon what\u2019s said by either side or both sides concerning the theories of liability, I may then supplement my instructions. But I didn\u2019t want to get into <em>rules of the road and all of that stuff, </em>other than to simply say the things I did say about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">(Emphasis added.) This response does not indicate that the trial judge was aware that counsel was concerned specifically with an instruction as to the burden of proof on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>notice of defect or an instruction as to the emergency doctrine.

This raises yet another interesting question which, unfortunately, was neither raised, tried nor decided by the court below: Since the claim of the marital entity is indeed separate and apart from an injured party\u2019s individual claim, does it have a separate cap or is it subsumed into the individual claim for the purpose of applying the cap?
