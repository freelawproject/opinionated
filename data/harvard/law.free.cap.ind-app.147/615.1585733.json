Oral argument on the petition was had and thereafter the petition was overruled. On February 11, 1970, the defendants filed their praecipe for transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"AVo\">Before the adoption of the Indiana Rules of Procedure on January 1, 1970, the proper method to appeal from an adverse entry of summary judgment was to appeal directly from the judgment by assigning as error in this Court the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment. <em>Aldridge v. Aldridge </em>(1968), 143 Ind. App. 685, 233 N. E. 2d 781; Rules of the Supreme Court of Indiana, Rule 2-6, as amended April 22, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"ADpG\">The defendants\u2019 Petition for Rehearing and Review did not operate to extend the time for appeal even though the trial court set the same for oral argument. <em>Sacks </em>v. <em>Winkler </em>(1967) (on rehearing), 141 Ind. App. 13, 227 N. E. 2d 177; <em>Dawson et al </em>v. <em>Wright, Mayor, etc., et al </em>(1955), 234 Ind. 626, 129 N. E. 2d 796.</p>\n<p id=\"AvL0\">Even if the defendants\u2019 petition were to be construed as a Motion for New Trial, a Motion for New Trial following the entry of summary judgment was improper before the adoption of Indiana Rules of Procedure on January 1, 1970, and did not extend the time for perfecting the appeal. <em>Aldridge </em>v. <em>Aldridge, supra; </em>Rule 2-6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_I\">The failure to perfect an appeal from the final judgment within 90 days after the judgment was rendered, in the absence of the time therefor being extended as provided for by the Rules, deprives this Court of jurisdiction of the appeal, and we only have jurisdiction to dismiss the matter. <em>Ind. A. B. C. </em>v. <em>Biltz </em>(1968), 142 Ind. App. 418, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>235 N. E. 2d 79; <em>Stover </em>v. <em>Parker GMC Truck Sales </em>(1967), 140 Ind. App. 475, 223 N. E. 2d 777, 778; <em>City of Indianapolis </em>v. <em>Hoffman </em>1966), 247 Ind. 228, 213 N. E. 2d 700; <em>Schilling </em>v. <em>Ritter </em>(1963), 134 Ind. App. 168, 186 N. E. 2d 887; <em>Dawson, et al </em>v. <em>Wright, Mayor, etc., et al, supra; Wiltrout, Indiana Practice, </em>Vol. 3, \u00a7 2524, p. 293, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is sustained and this cause is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 263 N.
