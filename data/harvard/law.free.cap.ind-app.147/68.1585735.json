The cause was set for trial upon appellant\u2019s amended petition which, in substance, alleges that on July 28, 1965, appellant delivered a child conceived and born out of wedlock; that appellee is the father of said child; and, that appellee should be declared the father of, and compelled to support such child. Trial was to the court, and at the conclusion of appellant\u2019s evidence appellee moved the court for a finding. After submission of briefs upon the question presented by appellee\u2019s motion, the court overruled the motion and, at that time, appellee rested. The court then entered judgment for appellee, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">\u201cThe Court finds for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMA\">The Court orders the plaintiff to pay costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Thereafter, within the time set by statute, appellant filed her motion for a rehearing pursuant to Acts 1965, ch. 246, \u00a7 1, Ind. Stats. Ann., \u00a7 3-640, Burns\u2019 1968 Repl., which motion alleges, in substance, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">1. The decision of the court is contrary to law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">2. The decision of the court is not sustained by sufficient evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">3. The court erred in refusing to admit into evidence the conditional examination of the defendant, Hugh Robertson; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">4. The court abused its discretion in refusing to permit the plaintiff an opportunity to reopen her case and to permit her to clarify the fact that Hugh Robertson was the only man with whom she had sexual relations during the period from the 1st of August, 1964, until the birth of the baby on July 28, 1965, and that she never reconciled with her first husband, John Maney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing was overruled on December 13, 1968, and this appeal followed. The sole assigned error upon appeal is that the court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>As this is an appeal from a negative judgment, appellant\u2019s specification that the decision is not sustained by sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>evidence presents nothing for our consideration. <em>Hardy et al. </em>v. <em>Town of New Harmony, Indiana, et al. </em>(1967), 248 Ind. 350, 227 N. E. 2d 689.</p>\n<p id=\"AjJz\">Neither, in our opinion, is the court\u2019s decision contrary to law. We conclude from the record that, during the natural period of possible conception, appellant was married to one John Maney and that appellant remained married to Maney until she received her divorce from him in March of 1965, approximately four to five months before the child\u2019s birth. We find no evidence of record which would indicate less than a full term pregnancy, and counsel did not so contend. In such instance we must presume the legitimacy of the child as it was conceived during the time in which appellant was married to Maney. The presumption of legitimacy is one of the strongest known to the law and is for the protection of the child. At common law the presumption was conclusive, but today it is considered subject to rebuttal. In <em>Pursley </em>v. <em>Hisch </em>(1949), 119 Ind. App. 232, at page 237, 85 N. E. 2d 270, at page 272, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">\u201cThe modern trend is away from the rule of conclusiveness, which has sometimes achieved nonsensical results, and toward a sane and reasonable ascertainment of the facts. <em>In re Findley </em>(1930), 253 N. Y. 1, 170 N. E. 471, per Cardozo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">\u201cIn a proceeding of this kind we think the presumption or inference, although it is one of the strongest known to the law, is susceptible of being rebutted. See <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Jacobs </em>(1871), 21 Ohio St. Rep. 646. We are of the opinion however, that such can only be done by evidence which is <em>direct, clear and convincing. Evans </em>v. <em>State ex rel. Freeman, supra.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">Also, in <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>Whitman </em>(1967), 140 Ind. App. 289, at page 292, 215 N. E. 2d 689, at page 690 (Transfer denied) ,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this court stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-12\">\u201cHowever, the modern law has relaxed the obvious severity of this presumption to a limited degree and such pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>sumption now may be rebutted by 'evidence which is direct, clear and convincing.\u2019 <em>Pursley </em>v. <em>Hisch </em>(1949), 119 Ind. App. 232, 85 N. E. 2d 270.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">\u201cTo date, this Court has developed logical exceptions to the presumption of legitimacy. These exceptions are set forth in <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>State ex rel. </em>(1925), 82 Ind. App. 356, 145 N. E. 895, as follow:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">\u201c '* * * the presumption could be overcome by proof that the husband was <em>impotent; </em>or that he was entirely absent so as to have had <em>no access to the mother; </em>or was entirely absent at the time the child in the course of nature must have been begotten; or was present only under such circumstances as to afford clear and satisfactory proof that there was no sexual intercourse. * * *\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">There is evidence of record which indicates that in August of 1964, appellant and John Maney legally separated and remained separated until the decree of divorce in March of 1965. However, the only evidence in the record, at best, gives rise to merely an inference that Maney had no <em>access </em>to appellant. This evidence came in the direct examination of appellant, and the question and answer read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">\u201cQ. Now, from the 20th of November [1964] when you returned from Cody, Wyoming until March the 16th when you left to go back to Wyoming to get your divorce, did you have any dates with any other man other than Mr. Robertson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">\u201cA. No sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">By the laws of nature and human experience, it is quite possible that conception in this instance could have occurred prior to the 20th of November, 1964. We conclude that appellant has not sustained the burden of establishing by <em>direct, clear and convincing evidence </em>that John Maney had no access to her during the period of time in which the experience of man would indicate conception to have occurred in this instance. We, therefore, feel that the decision of the trial court is not contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Appellant further argues that the court erred in refusing to admit into evidence the conditional examination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>defendant, Hugh Robertson. The conditional examination of Hugh Robertson was taken under oath and properly notarized. Defendant\u2019s counsel objected to introduction of the document by reason of Mr. Robertson\u2019s presence in the court room. The court sustained the objection and refused the introduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Appellant asserts that she was prejudiced by the court\u2019s ruling. Without passing upon the question of admissibility, it is sufficient to state that had the document been admitted in evidence, the testimony contained therein would have done considerable harm to appellant\u2019s case, and the court\u2019s ruling in excluding the same in no way prejudiced appellant. We call attention to the following questions and answers as contained in the conditional examination of Robertson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u201cQ. Hugh, have you thought of any other reasons why you feel you are not the father of this child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">\u201cQ. What are those?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">\u201cA. That her first husband was back in the later part of October or the first part of November and other information that my attorney has.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">\u201cQ. It was then you discovered her husband, her first husband, was in Peru. I take it Peru. Was that what you were referring to, Peru ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-13\">\u201cQ. How did you come to know that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-14\">\u201cA. Patricia told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-15\">\u201cQ. When did she tell you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-16\">\u201cA. In October.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-17\">\u201cQ. In October of 1964?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-18\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-19\">\u201cQ. How long did she say her first husband was in town?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-20\">\u201cA. I believe it was the middle part of one week that he would be there through the weekend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-21\">\u201cQ. She expected him to be in town then for about four or five days ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-22\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u201cQ. And this would have been the later part of October, 1964?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes or maybe into the first part of November, I don\u2019t remember exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">\u201cQ. Now what other information do you have which indicates to you that somebody else . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u201cA. Just general conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">\u201cQ. Let\u2019s apply this general conversation. Whose conversation is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">\u201cA. Well her second husband actually had admitted that it was his child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">\u201cQ. Second husband, what was his name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">\u201cA. Richard Gallio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">\u201cQ. Did you ever meet Mr. Gallio?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-14\">\u201cQ. When did you first meet him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-15\">\u201cA. I met him when he first came to Bunker Hill Air Force Base. He played in the band there. It was (T)he first part of the year of 1964, I believe. It could have May of 1964. Somewhere in that period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-16\">\u201cQ. Did you know whether or not at that time that he knew Patricia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-17\">\u201cA. Yes he knew Patricia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-18\">\u201cQ. How did he come to know her in that May of 1964?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-19\">\u201cA. I\u2019m not saying he knew her then. I don\u2019t know but afterwards, he was in a band which we all went to see, at the same place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-20\">\u201cQ. Who did Gallio admit to that he had had relations with Patricia about the time of her pregnation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-21\">\u201cINTERRUPTION BY MR. BOLINGER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-22\">\u201cI believe Mr. Robertson stated that Mr. Gallio admitted being the father of the child. Do you understand the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-23\">\u201cQ. Did you say that Gallio had stated that he was the father of Patricia\u2019s child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-24\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-25\">\u201cQ. All right who did he indicate this to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-26\">\u201cA. Various people in Peru.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u201cQ. Who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">\u201cA. One was one of the first people was Mike Johnson, Jim Schroll, Jackie Ingle, a lot of different people have told me this when I was in Peru after I moved back up here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The testimony above tends to show that appellant could have had access to her first husband during the time of possible conception of the child. Likewise, there is reference to admissions of paternity by appellant\u2019s second husband. As appellant has demonstrated no prejudice in the court\u2019s ruling, we conclude that said ruling did not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Finally, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing her request to reopen the case and submit further evidence that her former husband, John Maney, could not have been the father of her child. The record reveals commentary of counsel and court surrounding the request, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\u201cMR. BOLINGER. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">I know the record will bear me out as to what the questions were and what her answers were on that point. She simply said I had sexual relations with Hugh Robertson, and there was no statement as to whether she did or didn\u2019t with her husband. The presumption is that she did and it has not been overcome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">\u201cMR. HARRIGAN. Well, Your Honor, I would like to call Patricia Miller to clarify this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">\u201cBY THE COURT: You\u2019re just a wee bit late, don\u2019t you think? After the plaintiff rests, there was a motion for a finding for the defendant. You can\u2019t then repair it by opening the case. I\u2019m sorry. Once the plaintiff rests, the defendant has the right to make a motion for a finding on the basis of the evidence that has been introduced. And then if counsel suddenly discovers something, it\u2019s too late. I will take this matter under advisement because there are some questions, part of which can be answered by minute examination of the record. I have taken, as I always do, rather careful notes, but I would not want to depend on that. So I am going to have the record, so far as pertinent parts of it at least, transcribed and examined, and in the meantime, Gentlemen, if you wish to give me any further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>authorities, I will appreciate it. As to what I said about the reopening of the evidence, there would be very little point in having a motion for a finding if you could do that. However, if you can furnish me some authorities showing that, I will be glad to consider them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">In support of her contention that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing the request to reopen, appellant cites as authority this court\u2019s decision in <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Ryan </em>(1942), 112 Ind. App. 470, 41 N. E. 2d 833 (Transfer denied), in which we held that the trial court abused its discretion in similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In <em>Sanders, </em>the plaintiff-appellant filed a verified motion for leave to reopen the case to submit further evidence. In that case, the motion which was presented to the court stated specifically the name of the witness which the appellant there intended to call and a detailed explanation of the testimony which the appellant expected to elicit from the witness. The motion in <em>Sanders </em>explicitly stated that further testimony could be submitted without inconvenience to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In a prior Supreme Court decision, <em>Working </em>v. <em>Garn et al. </em>(1897), 148 Ind. 546, 47 N. E. 951, it was held that where a party attempts to reopen a case to submit further evidence, there is a presumption that said party was not diligent in procuring the evidence at trial. Absent a showing sufficient to overcome the presumption, the trial court had not abused its discretion in overruling the motion. The <em>Working </em>case was not followed in <em>Sanders, supra, </em>and the denial of transfer by our Supreme Court in <em>Sanders </em>appears to overrule <em>Working, supra, </em>by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"AF4\">However, in the case at bar, we do not feel that the trial court was sufficiently apprised of appellant\u2019s intentions as was the court in <em>Sanders. </em>Likewise, in the case at bar the court gave appellant an opportunity to brief the matter of reopening the case. We find no instance of record in which appellant ever attempted to brief the question or to apprise the court of her intentions by way of a detailed offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>to prove. Under such circumstances we cannot hold that the court abused its discretion in refusing appellant\u2019s request to reopen the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Howard Circuit Court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Judgment affirmed.
