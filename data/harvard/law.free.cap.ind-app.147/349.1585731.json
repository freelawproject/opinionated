Conlin and Sharon Conlin, to recover the value of a furnace and the cost of installation of same.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">Appellee-Phelps\u2019 complaint is framed in two paragraphs. The first paragraph seeks to forelose on a mechanic\u2019s lien, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>but as the court found for appellant thereon, said first paragraph is not involved in this appeal. The pertinent allegations of appellee\u2019s second paragraph of complaint may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">1. That appellee-Phelps is a sole proprietor doing business as Phelps Heating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">2. That appellant was the record owner of certain real estate in Posey County, Indiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">3. That appellee-Norman E. Conlin occupied this real estate and claimed to own an interest therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">4. That at the request of appellee-Norman E. Conlin, and with the consent of appellant, appellee-Phelps furnished and installed a furnace, the total value being $668.94, in a house situated on the abovementioned real estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">5. That said amount remained unpaid, and a reasonable fee for appellee-Phelps\u2019 attorney is $100.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">To appellee\u2019s second paragraph appellant filed an answer in two paragraphs, the first paragraph being an admission and denial under Eule 1-3, Eules of the Supreme Court of Indiana, which, in substance, appellant admitted ownership of land and denied all of the remaining allegations of said second paragraph. Such paragraph of appellant\u2019s answer is in the form of a set-off and alleges that the furnace installed by appellee-Phelps was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Trial was to court, without jury, and subsequent thereto the court entered judgment in favor of appellee-Phelps on said second paragraph of complaint, which judgment reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVS\">\u201cComes now the parties by their respective attorneys and this cause having been heretofore submitted to the court for trial on October 1, 1968, and the Court having heard the evidence and the arguments of counsel, whereupon the Court took the case under advisement, and now the court being advised in the premises finds against the plaintiff on the first paragraph of the complaint and finds for the plaintiff on the second paragraph of the complaint; that the defendants Goldie Conlin Bradley and Norman E. Conlin are jointly and severally indebted to the plaintiff in the principal sum of Six Hundred Sixty Dollars and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Ninety-Four Cents ($660.94) to which interest should be added in the sum of Thirty Nine Dollars and Sixty-Five Cents ($39.65), making a total indebtedness of Seven Hundred Dollars and Fifty-Nine Cents ($700.59).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201cIT IS, THEREFORE, CONSIDERED AND ADJUDGED by the Court that, on his first paragraph of complaint, the plaintiff take nothing, and that, on his second paragraph of complaint, the plaintiff recover of the defendants, or either of them, said sum of Seven Hundred Dollars and Fifty-Nine Cents ($700.59), together with his costs and damages herein laid .out and expended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Appellant timely filed a motion for a new trial which sets out the following specification of errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">\u201c1. The decision of the Court is not sustained by sufficient evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">\u201c2. The decision of the Court is contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">\u201c3. Error in the assessment of the amount of recovery, in this, that the amount is too large.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">\u201c4. Error of law occurring at the trial, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkMg\">\u201cThe Court erred in overruling the objection of the defendant Goldie Conlin Bradley, to the following question propounded by the plaintiff during the direct examination of Merle Phelps, a witness called on behalf of the plaintiff, and in admitting Exhibit No. 3 in evidence, which question, objection, ruling of the Court and Exhibit are in the following words:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">\u201c \u2018Q. O.K. We still submit this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-12\">\u201c \u2018By MR. CLOUSE: To which the defendant Goldie Conlin Bradley objects for several reasons. First, there is now [no] showing that it is a business record which is entitled to be admitted into evidence. The testimony of the witness is that it is prepared specifically for this lawsuit. He does not have the original, that is understandable, he has a carbon copy which would be very interesting, particularly with reference to whom it was addressed to. This is not a business record that is admissible into evidence, having been prepared for this lawsuit. Secondly, I note that on three occasions this man testified, even this last time, that he prepared a statement for Norman Conlin. And he said again, when Mr. Allyn questioned him just a fes [few] minutes ago, that he gave it to Norman Conlin. That\u2019s a crucial matter as far as this defendant is concerned, to whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>bill was made. This is not to Norman Conlin. We object to the introduction of Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit #3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">\u201c \u2018BY THE COURT: Well, I think this might have some weight.

App. 565, 236 N. E. 2d 180, 14 Ind. Dec. 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-27\">Appellant has chosen to group the first two specifications of error and supports same by argument under one heading in her brief.</p>\n<p id=\"ACiC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Appellant, in the argument portion of her brief, urges several possible theories in support of the contention that the decision is not sustained by sufficient evidence and is contrary to law. However, appellant is deemed to have waived those theories presented to this court upon appeal which were not properly presented to the trial court by way of memorandum filed in support of the motion for new trial. Rule 1-14B,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rules of the Supreme Court of Indiana.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">Appellant\u2019s memorandum reads as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">\u201cThe decision of the Court is not sustained by sufficient evidence in the following particulars:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">\u201cNo where in the record is there any evidence that the furnace in question was furnished and installed at the special instance and request of the defendant Goldie Conlin Bradley nor is there any evidence that she contracted with the plaintiff for the installation or purchase of the same nor is there any evidence of any relation of said defendant to the plaintiff which would impose upon her, by law, some duty to pay for said furnace. The undisputed evidence is that the plaintiff had already commenced work of installation of the furnace before the defendant Goldie Conlin Bradley was informed of plaintiff\u2019s action in so doing. Thus, there is no evidence of any obligation either in contract or imposed by law for said defendant to pay for said furnace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">\u201cThe decision of the Court is contrary to law in that it is not sustained by sufficient evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5Oa\">This court in reviewing appellant\u2019s specification of error that the decision of the court is not sustained by sufficient evidence is limited only to that evidence most favorable to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\"><em>Kessler </em>v. <em>Kessler </em>(1963), 135 Ind. App. 85, 192 N. E. 2d 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">Although there is conflict, the evidence most favorable to appellee indicates that appellee-Phelps was contacted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Norman Conlin to install a new furnace in the house occupied by Mr. Conlin; that after beginning installation, Phelps discovered that Norman Conlin did not own the house, but that the lawful owner was the appellant, Goldie Conlin Bradley. Upon discovering this, appellee-Phelps contacted her on or about September 19, 1966, and at that time she told him to proceed with the installation, and that Phelps finished installing the furnace on October 23,1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The evidence above constitutes an order by Norman Conlin, which was ratified by appellant-Bradley and accepted and fully performed by Mr. Phelps.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Even though appellant has introduced conflicting oral testimony, sufficient evidence of probative value does exist to support the finding of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"AhJ9\">Finally, appellant urges reversible error in the court\u2019s admission in evidence of plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 3, <em>supra. </em>Exhibit No. 3 is an itemized statement setting forth appellee-Phelps\u2019 bill for furnishing and installing the furnace in question. The statement is directed to appellant-Goldie Conlin Bradley. Upon cross-examination Phelps testified that plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 3 was not prepared in the ordinary course of business so as to qualify for admission in evidence under the business records rule, but was instead prepared solely for purposes of the trial. At best, under the rules of evidence, plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 3 could have been used only to refresh Phelps\u2019 memory, and it was, in our opinion, error to permit its admission in evidence. However, it is our opinion that although the trial court improvidently admitted plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 3 in evidence said action did not constitute reversible error as there was independent evidence of the facts contained therein, and such exhibit merely constitutes cumulative evidence of those facts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">\u201cIf the evidence is merely cumulative, a new trial should not be granted.\u201d <em>Cobler, Admr. </em>v. <em>Prudential Life Ins.
