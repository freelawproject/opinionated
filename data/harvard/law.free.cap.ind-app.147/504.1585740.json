On plaintiff\u2019s refusal to plead over judgment was rendered against it and plaintiff appeals assigning the sustaining of the demurrer as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">The pertinent allegations of plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-15\">\u201cThat the plaintiff entered into the service of the defendant at its request as Manufacturer\u2019s Sales Representative, whose duties were, to seek customers for defendant\u2019s manufactured lines; . . . commencing on or about the year 1985 and being terminated by this defendant on or about April of 1965.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>\u201cThat defendant agreed to pay to the plaintiff Five Percent (5%) commission as to any sales procured by plaintiff, and did so until said time when plaintiff\u2019s services were terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">\u201cThat . . . when the defendant terminated plaintiff\u2019s services . . . plaintiff had contacted and pursuaded the individuals in charge of certain trading companies to place or list in their national or regional catalogs certain manufactured items of the defendant. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u2756 # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">\u201cThat said listings . . . caused . . . sales of the items listed in that as the catalog company customers made orders to said catalog companies for defendant\u2019s listed items, said catalog companies would and did in turn order from defendant the items involved. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">\u201cThat following said time when the defendant terminated the plaintiff\u2019s services, and ever since, the defendant has refused and still refuses to pay plaintiff the commissions due on defendant\u2019s manufactured items sold through the trading stamp catalog listings as aforesaid;....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The complaint alleges the amount of such sales and prays judgment in a sum said to be five percent thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"ARuj\">We affirm because defendant\u2019s refusal to pay commissions on sales made after \u201cthe defendant terminated plaintiff\u2019s services\u201d is not a clear breach of defendant\u2019s agreement or promise \u201cto pay to the plaintiff Five Percent (5%) commission as to any sales procured by plaintiff .. . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ajm\">In other words, the complaint fails to allege that defendant agreed to pay plaintiff commissions on sales made after the contract was terminated. This interpretation of the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint is confirmed by the following excerpt from plaintiff\u2019s reply brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-14\">\u201cIn ... its argument appellee (defendant) states that recovery should be denied the appellant (plaintiff) because the oral contract that existed between the parties did not specifically state that appellant (plaintiff) would recover any compensation after the agreement\u2019s termination. That the agreement was so silent appellant (plaintiff) admits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>In discussing the essential allegations of a complaint for breach of contract, Dean Gavit makes the statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-4\">\u201cWhether or not the allegation of a breach is sufficient, of course, turns upon the exact terms of the defendant\u2019s promise. Thus in an action against a common carrier for a failure to deliver live stock the plaintiff does not make out a prima facie case by alleging nothing more than a failure to deliver where under the contract of carriage the defendant has only promised to carry safely.\u201d 2 Gavit, INDIANA PLEADING AND PRACTICE, \u00a7 234, p. 1666.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s arguments attempting to avoid the failure of the complaint to allege a promise or contract to pay commissions on sales made after termination are little more than protests that it is inequitable for plaintiff\u2019s work before termination to continue to benefit defendant after termination without also benefiting plaintiff. Plaintiff\u2019s suggestion that defendant could have avoided incurring any obligation to continue paying commissions after termination \u201cby refusing to accept any benefits that flowed from the appellant\u2019s (plaintiff\u2019s) work and effort\u201d is an additional acknowledgment that the promise (contract) pleaded is not a promise to pay commissions on such \u201cbenefits\u201d (or sales). At best it is a theory of liability not pleaded. And because it was not pleaded it cannot be considered in determining whether the trial court erred in holding that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The parties have argued the validity of other possible reasons for sustaining the demurrer, including the statute of frauds. Since our decision does not require it, we express no opinion on these other questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AC2H\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b536-8\">Hoffman, P.J., Pfaff and Sharp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 262 N. E. 2d 209.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
