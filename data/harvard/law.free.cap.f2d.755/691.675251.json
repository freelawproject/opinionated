Horne presents two conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>tions. First, he claims the trial judge should have declared a mistrial because one juror became ill during the trial. Second, Horne claims the trial judge should have entered judgment of acquittal on nine counts of the indictment because the government failed to prove all the elements of those charges. We find no merit in Horne\u2019s appeal and affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">During Horne\u2019s trial, one of the jurors became visibly ill with stomach flu. The ailing juror\u2019s illness required one short break between witnesses and an early recess for the day on one day of the trial. The next day, Horne moved for a mistrial, claiming that all the jurors\u2019 ability to devote full attention to the testimony and evidence had been adversely affected. The district judge questioned the juror, weighed Horne\u2019s contention, and concluded that the temporary illness had not affected and would not affect any juror\u2019s consideration of the case. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial judge\u2019s denial of Horne\u2019s motion. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>717 F.2d 1206, 1209 (8th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Horne next claims that the government presented insufficient evidence on nine counts of the indictment to send those counts to the jury. Horne\u2019s contentions display no more than disagreement with the jury\u2019s inferences from the evidence of Horne\u2019s use of his position for the financial benefit of himself and his family and the jury\u2019s resolution of disputed testimony regarding the penury charge. We find ample support in the record for the trial court\u2019s denial of Horne\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
