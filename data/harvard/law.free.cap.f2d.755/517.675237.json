The court has subsequently decided to issue the decision as an opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b608-19\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b608-20\">Plaintiffs appeal from a district court order granting summary judgment to the government and assessing a $500 frivolous return penalty under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6702(a). The district court also awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to the government because plaintiffs\u2019 legal position was patently frivolous. 579 F.Supp. 1047 (D.Wis.) We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-22\">In April 1983, plaintiffs filed separate Forms 1040 for the 1982 tax year. Each plaintiff claimed no income from wages or salaries during 1982, although each claimed a refund of all the federal income and Social Security taxes that had been withheld during the year. The Lovells also filed Schedule C forms on which they claimed that their gross receipts as \u201clabor contractors\u201d were totally offset by adjustments for the \u201ccost of labor.\u201d Neither plaintiff signed the return; instead, they each wrote on the signature line: \u201cnot a tax return (see attached letter).\u201d The letter explained that they sought a refund and that the forms filed were not tax returns but supporting documentation for their refund claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>The IRS assessed a $500 frivolous return penalty under \u00a7 6702(a);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plaintiffs paid 15% of the penalties and filed claims for refund which were denied by the IRS. Plaintiffs then filed the instant action in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Plaintiffs contend on appeal that \u00a7 6702(a) does not apply to their case because the documents they filed did not purport to be tax returns within the meaning of the statute. This assertion is utterly meritless. The Fifth Circuit recently rejected an identical argument and we agree with the court\u2019s reasoning there. <em>Davis v. United States Government, </em>742 F.2d 171, 173 (5th Cir.1984) (per curiam). A return must be filed in order to obtain the refunds plaintiffs requested. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6402-3(a)(1) (1984).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">Since the plaintiffs\u2019 stated purpose was to obtain a refund, the documents submitted must be deemed to be purported tax returns for purposes of section 6702. It is true that the plaintiffs wrote on the forms that they were not returns, but this disclaimer has no effect in light of the plaintiffs\u2019 stated purpose to have the documents treated as returns. If such a disclaimer were sufficient to avoid liability under section 6702, tax protesters could flood the IRS with frivolous tax returns bearing similar disclaimers without penalty. Section 6702\u2019s purpose of deterring frivolous filings would be completely undermined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\"><em>Nichols v. United States, </em>575 F.Supp. 320, 322 (D.Minn.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">The government has established all of the requisite elements for \u00a7 6702(a) liability. The returns filed by plaintiffs indicate that the self-assessments are substantially incorrect. The fact that taxes were withheld demonstrates that plaintiffs received income in 1982; yet their returns indicate that they earned no income. <em>See Davis, </em>742 F.2d at 172; <em>Holker v. United States, </em>737 F.2d 751, 753 (8th Cir.1984) (per cu-riam). And there is absolutely no doubt that the legal contentions advanced by the plaintiffs are frivolous; indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are patently absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">Plaintiffs argue first that they are exempt from federal taxation because they are \u201cnatural individuals\u201d who have not \u201crequested, obtained or exercised any privilege from an agency of government.\u201d This is not a basis for an exemption from federal income tax. <em>See Holker v. United States. </em>All individuals, natural or unnatural, must pay federal income tax on their wages, regardless of whether they received any \u201cprivileges\u201d from the government. Plaintiffs also contend that the Constitution prohibits imposition of a direct tax without apportionment. They are wrong; it does not. U.S. Const, amend. XVI; <em>Parker v. Commissioner, </em>724 F.2d 469, 471 (5th Cir.1984). Finally, plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that money received in compensation for labor is not taxable has been rejected by numerous courts. <em>See, e.g., Davis, </em>742 F.2d at 172; <em>Simanonok v. Commissioner, </em>731 F.2d 743, 744 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam). <em>Cf. United States v. Koliboski, </em>732 F.2d 1328, 1329 n. 1 (7th Cir.1984). Plaintiffs\u2019 other arguments against the income tax are equally frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">This court recently warned taxpayers who put forth frivolous arguments in bad faith that we would not hesitate to impose sanctions pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 38. <em>Granzow v. Commissioner, </em>739 F.2d 265, 269-70 (7th Cir.1984). <em>See also Edgar </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number><em>v. Inland Steel Co., </em>744 F.2d 1276, 1278 (7th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Ekblad, </em>732 F.2d 562 (7th Cir.1984). Other circuits have imposed sanctions in \u00a7 6702 cases, <em>see Martinez v. IRS, </em>744 F.2d 71 (10th Cir. 1984) (per curiam); <em>Davis, </em>742 F.2d at 173; <em>Baskin v. United States, </em>738 F.2d 975, 977 (8th Cir.1984) (per curiam); <em>Crain v. Commissioner, </em>737 F.2d 1417, 1418 (5th Cir. 1984), and we believe sanctions are appropriate in this case. Accordingly, the United States shall recover, from plaintiffs, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in defending this appeal. The government shall file with this court, within 15 days of the date of this order, a submission as to the fees and costs it has incurred on appeal. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-10\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6702(a) (West Pocket Part 1984) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">(a) Civil penalty. \u2014 If\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">(1) any individual files what purports to be a return of the tax imposed by subtitle A but which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-13\">(A) does not contain information on which the substantial correctness of the self-assessment may be judged, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-17\">(B) contains information that on its face indicates that the self-assessment is substantially incorrect; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI2\">(2) the conduct referred to in paragraph (1) is due to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ahj-dedup-1\">(A) a position which is frivolous, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab32\">(B) a desire (which appears on the purported return) to delay or impede the administration of Federal income tax laws,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq-\">then such individual shall pay a penalty of $500.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
