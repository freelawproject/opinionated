Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968); <em>Grigsby v. Mabry, </em>758 F.2d 226 (8th Cir.1985) <em>(en </em>banc). After reviewing the record before the district court, the transcript of the district court hearing, the emergency motion to stay execution and supplement thereto, and the State\u2019s response, we conclude that the judgment of the district court in denying the application for certificate of probable cause and denying the application for stay of execution should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-5\">Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death on February 21, 1974. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed on direct review. <em>Witt v. State, </em>342 So.2d 497 (Fla.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 935, 98 S.Ct. 422, 54 L.Ed.2d 294, <em>reh\u2019g. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1026, 98 S.Ct. 755, 54 L.Ed.2d 774 (1977). The denial of a collateral attack in state court was affirmed. <em>Witt v. State, </em>387 So.2d 922 (Fla.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1067, 101 S.Ct. 796, 66 L.Ed.2d 612 (1980). On appeal from a denial of a federal petition for writ of habeas corpus, this Court affirmed as to the conviction but reversed as to the sentence on the <em>Witherspoon </em>issue. <em>Witt v. Wainwright, </em>714 F.2d 1069 (11th Cir.1984). The Supreme Court of the United States reversed and remanded. <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985). This Court then affirmed the denial of habeas corpus relief. The present petition was filed in the federal district court on February 26, 1985. Witt is presently scheduled to be executed on March 6, 1985 at 7:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-8\">When the State alleges, as they do in the instant case, an abuse of the writ of habeas corpus, it places the burden on the petitioner to rebut the State\u2019s contention in one of several ways:</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-9\">(a) If the ground was previously addressed in a federal habeas corpus proceeding, the petitioner must demonstrate that the decision was not on the merits or the ends of justice would be served by reconsideration of the merits. The \u201cends of justice\u201d are defined by objective factors, such as whether there was a full and fair hearing on the original petition or whether there was an intervening change in the facts of the case or the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-11\">(b) If the ground was not previously presented in a federal habeas corpus proceeding, petitioner must demonstrate the failure to present the ground in the prior proceeding was neither the result of an intentional abandonment or withholding nor the product of inexcusable neglect. <em>See Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963); <em>see also Stephens v. Kemp, </em>721 F.2d 1300 (11th Cir.1983), and <em>Potts v. Zant, </em>638 F.2d 727 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-12\">The first claim petitioner makes relates to ineffective assistance of counsel. Petitioner alleges his counsel failed to investigate and elicit psychological evidence at sentencing that would have shown petitioner to be suffering from organic brain disease. The evidence, counsel contends, should have been presented as mitigating evidence. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.141(6)(b) and (f). The district court assumed that no such claim was raised in the prior federal proceeding but went on to find that there was no adequate justification for failure to elicit until February 1985 the evidence that petitioner\u2019s present counsel secured in the form of a letter report from a clinical psychologist. The conclusion of the district court appears to us to be correct. To explain why this claim was not raised in petitioner\u2019s first habeas corpus proceeding, it would not be sufficient for petitioner merely to answer that the psychological evidence was not available in 1981, because the record is clear that it was within petitioner\u2019s power to elicit such evidence in 1981. As the district court observed, the record reflects no policy in the public defender\u2019s office which would have prevented petitioner\u2019s attorneys from raising an ineffective assistance claim against petitioner\u2019s trial counsel. From an examination of the record, it appears there was also no policy which would have prevented petitioner\u2019s attorneys from eliciting the psychological evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>dence necessary to support that claim. The burden is on petitioner to demonstrate that the failure of his counsel at the first habeas corpus proceeding, who are attorneys from the same public defender\u2019s office which is presently representing petitioner, to elicit the necessary evidence and raise this claim was not due to \u201cinexcusable neglect.\u201d The showing presently made by petitioner reflects nothing to show why this evidence was not discovered and presented in the prior proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-4\">Petitioner\u2019s second argument is based upon a <em>Grigsby </em>variation of the <em>Witherspoon </em>claim. The record indicates that the district court proceeded on the basis that the <em>Grigsby </em>claim was actually addressed by the Supreme Court in its opinion on the first habeas corpus petition in this case. <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985). If the district court is correct that the <em>Grigsby </em>claim has been addressed in the Supreme Court in <em>Witt, </em>its appearance in the present successive petition is purely an abuse of the writ. If the <em>Grigsby </em>claim was not addressed in the previous petition, Witt must demonstrate that the failure to include it was not the product of intentional abandonment or inexcusable neglect. Witt on this point contends that the <em>Grigsby </em>case was not decided until after his initial habeas corpus petition had been filed, argued and rejected. However, this claim will not stand close scrutiny because it is clear that the so-called <em>Grigsby </em>claim had been rejected not only in cases that are not binding on this Court, see <em>Keeten v. Garrison, </em>742 F.2d 129 (4th Cir.1984), but in cases that are binding on this Court, <em>McCleskey v. Kemp, </em>753 F.2d 877 (11th Cir.1985) [No. 84-8176, January 29, 1985]; <em>Smith v. Balkcom, </em>660 F.2d 573 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), modified 671 F.2d 858 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 882, 103 S.Ct. 181, 74 L.Ed.2d 148 (1982); and <em>Spinkellink v. Wainwright, </em>578 F.2d 582 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 976, 99 S.Ct. 1548, 59 L.Ed.2d 796 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-7\">Therefore, it is clear that the <em>Grigsby </em>version of the <em>Witherspoon </em>claim now being presented in this successive petition is a claim that had been raised long before the <em>Grigsby </em>case and the petitioner\u2019s failure to present such a claim in his first petition is necessarily attributable to abandonment or inexcusable neglect. Thus, we find the presentation of this claim is also an abuse of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-9\">In addition to the above analysis, we have reviewed petitioner\u2019s claims and the record to see if either claim should have been considered in the manifest interest of justice. In our view, neither claim presents any \u201csubstantial ground upon which relief might be granted.\u201d <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-10\">The application for certificate of probable cause to appeal is DENIED, and the emergency motion for stay of execution is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
