Because we hold that the plaintiffs\u2019 application was untimely, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-18\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-19\">On November 14, 1972, Pauline Clifton (Clifton) applied for mother\u2019s insurance benefits on her own behalf and for child\u2019s insurance benefits on behalf of her four minor children, alleging that her husband, Herbert Clifton, disappeared in 1965, deserting her and the children. The Social Security Administration denied the applications, and Clifton requested a de novo hearing on the claims before an administrative law judge (AU). After the hearing, on February 21, 1975, the AU awarded the benefits. The Appeals Council, on its own motion, reversed the AU\u2019s decision, prompting Clifton, individually and on behalf of her minor children (the plaintiffs are hereinafter collectively referred to as Clifton), to file the instant action on November 18, 1975, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana for judicial review of the Appeals Council\u2019s decision pursuant to \u00a7 205(g) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court remanded the case to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services) for a second de novo hearing because the tape recording of the original hearing was inaudible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-20\">After the second hearing, on June 23, 1976, the AU determined that Clifton was entitled to benefits from March 31, 1967\u2014 the date on which the wage earner, Herbert Clifton, was presumed to have died. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>On September 30, 1976, the Appeals Council modified the AU\u2019s decision, indicating that the wage earner\u2019s presumed date of death was properly March 8, 1974, seven years from the date of his last known employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">In January 1977, on the Secretary\u2019s motion, the case was reopened in the district court, and the Secretary answered Clifton\u2019s original complaint. Clifton maintained that she and her children were entitled to benefits from March 31, 1967. The September 30, 1976 decision of the Secretary was filed in the district court, and, in April 1977, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In view of Clifton\u2019s allegations that the administrative record was incomplete, however, the district court, on July 19, 1977, remanded the case to the Secretary for a supplemental hearing to gather evidence regarding the disappearance of the wage earner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">On March 31, 1980, following the supplemental hearing, the AU found that the wage earner\u2019s presumed date of death was March 8, 1974. The Appeals Council affirmed the AU\u2019s decision, and, with the filing of the transcript of the supplemental hearing, the case was again reopened in the district court. In September 1980, a hearing was held before a magistrate on the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The magistrate found that the Secretary\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and recommended that the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment be granted. On April 20, 1981, the district court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion and entered judgment dismissing Clifton\u2019s suit. On July 23, 1981, more than ninety days after the judgment was entered, Clifton filed a motion to enlarge the time to appeal from the judgment. The district court denied the motion holding that it could not extend the time for appeal because Rule 4(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure is mandatory and jurisdictional.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court suggested, however, that Clifton file a motion to vacate the April 20, 1981 judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and present evidence that would support her claim for relief. Clifton responded on August 4, 1981, by filing a Rule 60(b) motion to vacate. The district court denied this motion on August 26. Clifton then filed several additional motions to enlarge the time for noticing an appeal, all of which were denied by the district court. Clifton appealed the denials of her motions to extend the time for noticing an appeal and her motion to vacate the April 20, 1981 judgment. In <em>Clifton v. Heckler, </em>732 F.2d 939 (5th Cir.1984) (unpublished), we held that Clifton\u2019s tardiness in filing the Rule 4(a)(5) motions to vacate required dismissal of the appeal and that the district court\u2019s denial of the Rule 60(b) motion was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">On May 23, 1984, thirty days after we dismissed her appeal of the denials of the various motions, Clifton filed in the district court an application for attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), Pub.L. No. 96-481, tit. 2, 94 Stat. 2325 (1980) (the pertinent provisions of which are codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> seeking fees for work done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>in connection with the filing of the original complaint in district court on November 18, 1975, through September 30, 1976, the date on which the Appeals Council decision awarding benefits was filed in the district court. The application was referred to a magistrate, who recommended that it be denied on the alternative grounds that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1), not 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412, controlled the award of attorney\u2019s fees in social security cases and that, in any event, Clifton was not a prevailing party. On July 11,1984, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and denied the application, holding that Clifton was not a prevailing party. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">On appeal, Clifton makes the following contentions: (1) at this stage of the proceedings, the district court was without jurisdiction to consider her application for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA because 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 provides that the agency, here the Social Security Administration, will initially pass upon the application before judicial review of a final agency decision regarding an award may be obtained; and (2) Clifton was a prevailing party because her November 1975 suit forced the Social Security Administration to substantiate its original denial of benefits, which eventually led to a remand for a second de novo hearing and a decision at least partially favorable to her. Although we find that the district court would have been the proper forum to entertain Clifton\u2019s application for attorney\u2019s fees in the instant case, we hold that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the application. We need not address the issue whether Clifton was a prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-13\">A. <em>Consideration by the Social Security Administration or the District Court?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-14\">Clifton first contends that the district court had no jurisdiction to consider her application for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA, relying on 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 and the administrative regulations promulgated thereunder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Clifton argues that, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 governs the award of attorney\u2019s fees to parties who prevail against the federal government in administrative proceedings and that section indicates that the adjudicative officer of the agency will first consider the application before a party may seek judicial review of the agency\u2019s decision, the district court was without authority in the instant action to entertain Clifton\u2019s application in the absence of prior agency adjudication of the claim and a grant of a petition for leave to appeal the agency\u2019s decision. Clifton explains that her application was filed in the district court in conformance with 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 13.-21, requiring that \u201c[a]ll pleadings, including applications for an award of fees, ... shall be pled in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding and served on all other parties and participants.\u201d Because the case was then in the district court, Clifton filed her application there but in no wise intended that the district court pass upon the application before the Social Security Administration did so. Thus, because the Social Security Administration did not first consider her application for attorney\u2019s fees, Clifton concludes, the district court in denying the application improperly interposed itself as the sole arbiter of her claim. Clifton\u2019s contention is without merit, however, largely because the statutory and regulatory tapestry she weaves is incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">We begin by examining the EAJA and its legislative history. The EAJA was enacted to lessen the likelihood that challenges to bureaucratic action would be deterred by the high cost of litigating against the government. EAJA, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 202(c)(1), 94 Stat. at 2325; H.R.Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 9-10, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4984, 4984-88.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Federal agencies, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(1), and courts, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), are authorized to award attorney\u2019s fees to parties who prevail against the federal government in \u201cadversary adjudications\u201d unless the government\u2019s position was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d or there are special circumstances which make a fee award unjust. An \u201cadversary adjudication\u201d is defined as a determination \u201con the record after opportunity for an agency hearing,\u201d with certain inapplicable exceptions, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a), \u201cin which the position of the United States is represented by counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 504(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-12\">It has been held that proceedings before the Social Security Administration are not adversary adjudications and are thus excluded from coverage under the EAJA. <em>Cornella v. Schweiker, </em>728 F.2d 978, 988-89 (8th Cir.1984); <em>Guthrie v. Schweiker, </em>718 F.2d 104,107 (4th Cir.1983); <em>McGill v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>712 F.2d 28, 30 (2d Cir.1983), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number><em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1420, 79 L.Ed.2d 745 (1984).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This conclusion is largely predicated on the fact that the United States is not represented by counsel at the agency level in social security proceedings. The portion of the conference report accompanying the EAJA that defined \u201cadversary adjudication\u201d clearly evinces Congress\u2019 intent to exclude social security proceedings from coverage under the EAJA. The report states: \u201cIt is intended that this definition preclude an award in a situation where an agency, <em>e.g., the Social Security Administration, </em>does not take a position in the adjudication.\u201d H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 1434, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 23, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5003, 5012 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, Clifton fails to cite 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 13.3, which expressly limits application of the Secretary\u2019s rules implementing the EAJA to adversary adjudications. The regulation references an appendix listing of departmental proceedings covered by the rules which does not include social security proceedings. Thus, because the proceedings before the Social Security Administration in the instant action do not constitute an adversary adjudication, Clifton cannot maintain her claim for attorney\u2019s fees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(1), or, for the matter, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(3), the text of which is set out at the margin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">Nevertheless, the EAJA has been held to apply to actions for judicial review of final decisions of the Secretary brought under the Social Security Act. <em>Cornella, </em>728 F.2d at 987 &amp; n. 15; <em>Guthrie, </em>718 F.2d at 107-08; <em>Berman v. Schweiker, </em>713 F.2d 1290, 1293 (7th Cir.1983); <em>McGill, </em>712 F.2d at 30. The legislative history of the EAJA supports this proposition, indicating that Congress intended the EAJA to cover civil actions to review decisions of the Secretary. The House report accompanying the Act states that \u201c[tjhere was much discussion whether the United States should be liable when it is a named party and represented in a civil action under the Social Security Act. The Committee decided that civil actions should be covered.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 12, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4984, 4991. Hence, a court reviewing the Secretary\u2019s disposition of a social security claim may determine whether the claimant should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-11\">Applying the foregoing principles to the case at hand, we hold that the proceedings at the agency level regarding Clifton\u2019s claim for social security benefits did not amount to an adversary adjudication, and thus they were not covered by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(1). Therefore, because the district court was reviewing the Secretary\u2019s disposition of Clifton\u2019s claim for benefits, Clifton\u2019s application for attorney\u2019s fees would be cognizable only in the district court under \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) but only if that court possessed subject matter jurisdiction. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>to the jurisdictional issue that we now turn.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">B. <em>Timeliness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">The Secretary contends for the first time on appeal that Clifton\u2019s application for attorney\u2019s fees was not timely since it was filed over three years after the district court entered its April 20, 1981 judgment affirming the Secretary\u2019s decision concerning Clifton\u2019s claim for social security benefits. Section 2412(d)(1)(B) sets out the procedural requirements for filing a fee application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-6\">A party seeking an award of fees and other expenses <em>shall, within thirty days of final judgment in the action, submit to the court an application for fees </em>and other expenses which show that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under this subsection, and the amounts sought____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-12\">Courts which have considered the thirty-day time limitation in the EAJA have determined that a timely application is a prerequisite to jurisdiction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Action on Smoking &amp; Health v. Civil Aeronautics Board, </em>724 F.2d 211, 225-26 (D.C.Cir.1984); <em>Columbia Manufacturing Corp. v. NLRB, </em>715 F.2d 1409, 1410 (9th Cir.1983) (per curiam) (construing identical thirty-day period applicable to agency adjudication contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(2)); <em>Monark Boat Co. v.

No. 1434, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 26, <em>reprinted, in </em>1980 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5003, 5015; H.R. Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 18, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.

We are not faced with the difficult question whether a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d occurs when the district court enters an appealable order or when a party\u2019s right to appeal that order has lapsed \u2014 an issue that is now pending before another panel in this circuit.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See Russell v. National Mediation Board, </em>No. 84-1345 (5th Cir. argued Feb. 5, 1985). Clifton\u2019s failure to file a timely notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s April 20, 1981 affirmance of the Secretary\u2019s decision obviated the need for us to resolve the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d issue in order to decide this case. With the denials of Clifton\u2019s Rule 4(a)(5) motions to enlarge the time for noticing an appeal and Rule 60(b) motion to vacate the April 20,1981 judgment, there is no doubt that the April 20 judgment became the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in this action. Whether \u00a7 2412(d)(l)(B)\u2019s thirty-day period is viewed as commencing to run from the district court\u2019s entry Of final judgment on April 20, 1981, or from the passing of the time permitted under Rule 4(a), Fed.R. App.P., for noticing an appeal, it is beyond peradventure that Clifton\u2019s fee application, filed nearly three years after the later of the alternative dates, was not timely. It cannot be seriously urged that the thirty-day period begins to run after the denials and unsuccessful appeals from such denials of Rule 4(a)(5) motions to enlarge the time for noticing an appeal or a Rule 60(b) motion to vacate the unappealed judgment. Such a construction would totally undermine sound principles of finality. Therefore, holding that Clifton\u2019s failure to file her fee application in timely fashion de-</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">prived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction to award fees, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AuVT\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1219-14\">. Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act permits the filing of suit in district court to obtain judicial review of a final decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The Appeals Council\u2019s decision represented the final decision of the Secretary at this stage of the proceedings in the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">. The district court noted that, if. the United States or an agency thereof is a party in an action, appeals must be noticed not later than sixty days after the date judgment is entered. The sixty-day period from the April 20, 1981 judgment expired on June 19, 1981. Under Rule 4(a)(5), Fed.R.App.P., Clifton had until July 20, 1981, to move to extend the time in which to notice an appeal. Clifton did not file her motion until July 23, 1981. In holding that it could not extend the time for appeal, the district court cited <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Board of Regents at Texas Southern University, </em>625 F.2d 521 (5th Cir.1980), in which we observed that the requirement of Rule 4(a) cannot \"affect the subject matter jurisdiction and is rather a mandatory precondition to the exercise of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1220-10\">.

While it is true that the EAJA only permits the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees \u201d[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute,\u201d <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), it has been held that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406 is not a fee-shifting statute and acts only to limit the amount of awarded social security benefits an attorney can take as a fee.

We are mindful that the timing issue was recently addressed in <em>Matter of Esmond, </em>752 F.2d 1106, 1108-09 (5th Cir.1985), which involved an application for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA that was rejected as untimely by the district court. In <em>Matter of Esmond, </em>the Small Business Administration (SBA) filed an objection to discharge of debtors who had filed for bankruptcy. After the SBA allegedly informed the debtors that the objection to discharge would be dismissed, the debtors filed an application for attorney\u2019s fees in the bankruptcy court. Six months later, the bankruptcy court dismissed the SBA\u2019s objection to discharge. In the interim, the court had denied the debtors\u2019 application for attorney\u2019s fees. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of the fee application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">In reversing, we held that, because the SBA did not challenge the timing of the debtors\u2019 original fee application until well after the thirty-day period following the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal of the objection to discharge \u201cduring which [the debtors] could have filed a timely application in strict and full compliance with the statute,\u201d id. at 1110, the SBA was precluded from complaining of the procedural deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">The decision in <em>Matter of Esmond </em>is not inconsistent with our holding that the thirty-day limit set out in \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B) is jurisdictional. First, we note that the panel in <em>Matter of Es-mond </em>failed to address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction and, thus, cannot be said to have ruled on the issue. <em>Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, </em>370 U.S. 294, 307, 82 S.Ct. 1502, 1513, 8 L.Ed.2d 510 (1962); <em>United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, </em>344 U.S. 33, 38 &amp; n. 9, 73 S.Ct. <em>67, </em>69 &amp; n. 9, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952) (court not bound by prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where it was not questioned and it was passed <em>sub silentio) </em>(collecting cases). Second, in <em>Matter of Esmond, </em>the fee application was on file in the bankruptcy court before the debtors became prevailing parties and the prematurity of the application was objected to only after the period for filing a second timely application had passed. Hence, <em>Matter of Esmond </em>can be interpreted, not as waiving the requirement of a timely application, but as viewing the original unwithdrawn application as timely, thereby providing the essential jurisdictional predicate. It is the odd procedural posture of <em>Matter of Es-mond, </em>involving a fee application filed <em>before </em>the applicants became prevailing parties, that distinguishes it from cases like the one at bar involving the more familiar procedural deficiency of a tardily filed application. These cases have unanimously recognized the jurisdictional nature of the thirty-day limitation. <em>See, e.g., Action on Smoking &amp; Health, </em>724 F.2d at 225. Finally, <em>Matter of Esmond </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because Clifton could not have been prejudiced by the Secretary\u2019s failure, before this appeal, to challenge the timeliness of the application since, unlike the debtors in <em>Matter of Esmond, </em>Clifton would not have had an opportunity to file a timely application had the Secretary immediately challenged her application. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 225-26; <em>see supra </em>note 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1225-12\">. Our conclusion finds further support in Congress\u2019 most recent clarification of the term \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as used in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. In October 1984, Congress adopted a bill which added to the EAJA a definition of \"final judgment\u201d as \u201ca judgment that is final and not appealable.\u201d H.R. 5479, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 2(b) (1984). Regardless of the President\u2019s veto of the bill, <em>see </em>42 Cong.Q.Weekly Rep. 2964 (1984) (text of President\u2019s memorandum of disapproval), we find its legislative history instructive on the question of the intended nature of the thirty-day limitation under the original EAJA. <em>Cf. Taylor v. United States, </em>749 F.2d 171, 174 (3d Cir.1984) (examining the bill\u2019s legislative history to discern the meaning of \"final judgment\u201d under the original EAJA). The Report of the Senate Judiciary Committee accompanying S. 919, the Senate version of H.R. 5479, stated in addressing the issue of when a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d occurs for purposes of the EAJA: \"This issue is important since <em>the thirty-day deadline for filing the fee application is jurisdictional and cannot be waived.\u201d </em>S.Rep. No. 586, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>98th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1984) (emphasis added). <em>But see </em>H.R.Rep.
