We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-17\">Burnam was discharged by appellee Amoco Container Company (Amoco) on October 9, 1982, but did not file her charge with the EEOC until June 6, 1983, more than 180 days later. Burnam argues, however, that additional discrimination practiced by Amoco occurred on May 23, 1983, the date on which Burnam applied to be rehired for the same position and on which Amoco refused to do so. She argues that this refusal to rehire constituted a new and continuing violation of the ADEA. We realize that the 180 day filing requirement is not jurisdictional and, thus, like a statute of limitations, it is subject to waiver, estoppel and equitable tolling. <em>Zipes v. Trans-World Airlines, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 385, 395 n. 11, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 1133 n. 11, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982); <em>Allison v. Western Union Telegraph Co., </em>680 F.2d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir. 1982); (EEOC filing requirement under Title VII, like that under ADEA, is not jurisdictional).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, a failure to rehire subsequent to an allegedly discriminatory firing, absent a new and discrete act of discrimination in the refusal to rehire itself, cannot resurrect the old discriminatory act. <em>Collins v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>514 F.2d 594, 596 (9th Cir.1975) (Title VII). Otherwise, a potential plaintiff could always circumvent the limitations by reapplying for employment. A simple request for reinstatement \u201cseeks to redress the original termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596; <em>accord National Labor Relations Board v. Auto Ware-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number><em>housers, Inc., </em>571 F.2d 860 (5th Cir.1978)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (relating to six month period for filing of unfair labor practice charge). Here, the original termination occurred on October 9, 1982, more than six months prior to the filing of the EEOC charge. Thus, Bur-nam\u2019s claim is time-barred. \u201cWere we to hold otherwise, we would undermine the significance of the Congressionally mandated [180]-day limitation period.\u201d <em>Collins, </em>514 F.2d at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-14\">. This appeal was the subject of a prior published opinion of this court. In <em>Burnam v. Amoco Container Co., </em>738 F.2d 1230 (11th Cir.1984), we held that Burnam\u2019s appeal had been timely noticed within the meaning of Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b982-15\">. The Supreme Court has indicated that questions concerning the time requirements for filing an EEOC charge under Title VII and the ADEA and for filing an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board call for parallel analysis. <em>Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 385, 395 n. 11, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 1133 n. 11, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982) (noting that the ADEA was modeled after Title VII).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b983-15\">. In <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981. <em>Id. </em>at 1209.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b983-26\">. Burnam also argues that the 180 day period was tolled because she was \"medically unable to return to work\u201d' for a long period of time subsequent to her termination. Because Burnam raised this issue for the first time on appeal, we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-25\">Amoco\u2019s motion for imposition of sanctions is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
