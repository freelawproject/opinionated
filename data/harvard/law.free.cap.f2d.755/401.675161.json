HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b491-31\">Manuel Flores, an unsuccessful claimant for Social Security disability benefits, raises both procedural and substantive challenges to a district court order affirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the Secretary, entered without notice to the parties and without a motion for summary judgment. We agree that the district court should have given the parties an opportunity to present their arguments before its ruling, but find that the error was harmless because Flores later developed his substantive argument to the court in a motion for new trial. On the merits,, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that substantial evidence supported the Secretary\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Flores is 40 years old, has the equivalent of a high school education, and has worked as a millwright, mechanic, truck driver, and laborer, all jobs requiring strenuous physical exertion. Since 1979, he has suffered recurrent episodes of lower back pain; he has been hospitalized three times and has been diagnosed and treated by several physicians. To relieve his back pain, he takes prescribed muscle relaxants and pain pills, exercises, lies on the floor once or twice a day, and uses a heating pad. He has, on occasions when his pain becomes severe, worn a back brace. Flores lives at home and does household chores such as cutting the grass (with a riding mower) and shopping for groceries. He has not worked since February of 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Flores filed for disability benefits on September 29, 1981, alleging that he had been disabled since November 7, 1980. After the Secretary initially denied his claim, Flores, assisted by counsel, appeared before an Administrative Law Judge at a <em>de novo </em>hearing on June 11, 1982. On November 80, 1982, the AU issued a written decision denying benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The AU, reviewing Flores\u2019s medical records, found that Flores suffered from lower back syndrome with strain of the lumbar spine, along with hypertension that was under control with medication. The AU expressly stated that Flores\u2019s assertion that his back pain was disabling was not \u201cfully credible and convincing.\u201d Based on Flores\u2019s \u201cassertions, manner, appearance, and signs,\u201d and on the objective medical evidence, the AU found that Flores\u2019s pain was \u201cnone to mild with occasionally moderate episodes which are controlled with medication and physical therapy.\u201d The AU agreed that Flores could no longer undertake heavy manual labor, as he had in the past, but found that Flores could still perform \u201cthe full range of light and sedentary work\u201d as defined in the Social Security Administration\u2019s vocational regulations, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567. The AU considered his finding of Flores\u2019s residual functional capacity along with Flores\u2019s age, educational level, and transferable skills learned in his job as a millwright, and concluded that Flores was not disabled under 20 C.F.R. subpart P, appendix 2, Rule 201.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">On May 9, 1983, Flores filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for review in the district court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The Secretary answered, attaching to her answer a copy of the administrative record. On April 10, 1984, Flores\u2019s counsel filed a notice of appearance. On June 7, 1984, the court <em>sua sponte </em>entered a written order and judgment affirming the Secretary. Flores\u2019s counsel promptly moved for a new trial and for summary judgment, complaining that he had been deprived of the opportunity to argue Flores\u2019s case to the district court. On July 17, in an amended motion for new trial, Flores\u2019s counsel submitted a 22-page memorandum arguing that the Secretary\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">In a written order dated September 17, the district court denied Flores\u2019s motions for new trial and summary judgment. Citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), which expressly grants district courts reviewing disability decisions the power to enter judgment \u201cupon the pleadings and transcript of the record,\u201d the.court rejected Flores\u2019s contention that the parties should have been allowed to move for summary judgment. The court then stated that \u201c[a]fter considering the motion, the record, and the law,\u201d it would deny the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">Flores attacks on two grounds the procedure used by the district court in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>ciding his case. First, he argues that district courts must follow the mechanism of Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 in disability review actions. The governing statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), though, only authorizes review of the pleadings and the record. As we have noted, district courts in \u00a7 405(g) cases may not consider evidence outside the administrative record, and summary judgment is therefore \u201ca problematic procedure\u201d in disability appeals. <em>Lovett v. Schweiker, </em>667 F.2d 1, 2-3 (5th Cir.1981); <em>see also Igonia v. Califano, </em>568 F.2d 1383, 1389 (D.C.Cir. 1977) (summary judgment improper in disability cases); <em>McMullen v. Celebrezze, </em>335 F.2d 811, 814 (9th Cir.1964) (motion for summary judgment \u201cunnecessary\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 854, 86 S.Ct. 106, 15 L.Ed.2d 92 (1965). Although <em>Lovett </em>noted that summary judgment is frequently used in disability cases, and permitted the use of summary judgment when the district court has not gone beyond the pleadings and record, <em>Lovett </em>certainly does not <em>require </em>the use of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Flores\u2019s second contention, that the district court should not have entered judgment <em>sua sponte, </em>has more force. <em>Myers v. Califano, </em>611 F.2d 980 (4th Cir.1980) held that a district court had erred in entering judgment in a \u00a7 405(g) action before either side had moved for it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Citing <em>Cali-fano v. Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 699-700, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 2556-2557, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979), the <em>Myers </em>court stated that district courts must follow the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in disability cases just as in other civil actions, and that the lower court\u2019s unilateral action was not sanctioned by the Federal Rules. The same result was reached in <em>Kistner v. Califano, </em>579 F.2d 1004 (6th Cir.1978), which reversed a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We agree with <em>Myers </em>and <em>Kistner, </em>at least to the extent that district courts reviewing disability determinations should not conclude their review without'an appropriate opportunity for the presentation of the parties\u2019 contentions. Whether the court proceeds under Rule 56 or under Rule 12(c), which authorizes motions for judgment on the pleadings, does not give us pause. We have noted that Rule 56 does not fully fit the district court\u2019s role in the review of the Secretary\u2019s decision. Regardless, the procedures of Rule 56 are used nigh universally in this circuit because its familiar procedural commands get the job done. Nothing prohibits this course.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">On these facts, however, the district court\u2019s error was harmless. In his Amended Motion for New Trial, Flores fully presented his substantive arguments to the district court. In denying the motion, the court stated that it had reviewed \u201cthe motion, the record, and the law.\u201d Thus, our concern that \u201ca party must have a fair opportunity to develop the record in opposition\u201d to a judgment has been satisfied here. <em>Conley v. Board of Trustees of Grenada County Hospital, </em>707 F.2d 175, 178-79 n. 2 (5th Cir.1983). Given that the district court has already weighed Flores\u2019s contentions, a remand would serve no purpose. <em>Cf. Kistner, </em>579 F.2d at 1006 (because claimant did not receive \u201cfull and fair review\u201d of Secretary\u2019s decision \u201cin the district court in the first instance,\u201d case was remanded). We therefore turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">Flores asserts that his back ailments qualify as <em>per se </em>disabling under 20 C.F.R. subpart P, appendix 1. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1525(a). Specifically, he argues that his impairment falls within section 1.05(C) of appendix 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">Other vertebrogenic disorders ... with the following persisting for at least 3 months despite prescribed therapy and expected to last 12 months. With <em>both </em>1 and 2: 1. Pain, muscle spasm, and significant limitation of motion in the spine; <em>and </em>2. <em>Appropriate radicular distribution of significant motor loss with mus-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>ele weakness and sensory and reflex loss.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">(emphasis added). The AU, though, relied \u2022on the report of Dr. John F. Schultheiss, who examined Flores on November 14, 1981. Dr. Schultheiss found that Flores had good motor strength, no sensory loss, and normal reflexes, and concluded that there was \u201c[n]o evidence of radiculopathy.\u201d His report provides substantial evidence for the Secretary\u2019s rejection of Flores\u2019s claim of automatic disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In addition, Flores argues that his back pain is so severe that he cannot perform even light or sedentary work. The AU disagreed, concluding that Flores\u2019s pain was adequately \u201ccontrolled with medication and physical therapy.\u201d The AU stated that Flores\u2019s claims of pain were not \u201cfully credible and convincing,\u201d and supported his statement by reference to Flores\u2019s \u201cassertions, manner, appearance, and signs\u201d as well as to the medical evidence of record. In doing so, the AU complied with' the command of our cases that the Secretary \u201cindicate the credibility choices made and the basis for those choices in resolving the crucial subsidiary fact of the truthfulness of subjective symptoms and com-plaints____\u201d <em>Scharlow v. Schweiker, </em>655 F.2d 645, 649 (5th Cir.1981), <em>quoted in Carry v. Heckler, </em>750 F.2d 479, 485 (5th Cir.1985). Our review of the record persuades us that there is substantial evidence to support the choice that the Secretary made.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The decision of the district court affirming the Secretary\u2019s denial of benefits is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-7\">. The Fourth Circuit in <em>Myers </em>did not reverse on this ground because both sides urged that it review the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
