EDWARDS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AdlQ\">!\u2022 Prologue</p>\n<p id=\"aev-dedup-0\">On this petition for review, we consider a case in which the petitioner, Kenneth Prill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>was discharged from his job at Meyers Industries, Inc. (\u201cMeyers\u201d), because he complained about the unsafe condition of a company truck and trailer, including a complaint to state authorities following an accident, and because he refused, for safety reasons, to continue driving the truck and trailer following the accident. An investigation by state officials determined that the company vehicle was in fact unsafe due to faulty brakes and a damaged hitch, and a citation was issued against Meyers. Notwithstanding the concededly unsafe condition of the vehicle, Prill was fired because company officials decided that they could not have him \u201ccalling the cops all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">In protest against his discharge, Prill filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d), and a complaint was issued against Meyers. An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), following existing Board precedent, found that Prill\u2019s conduct constituted \u201cconcerted activity] for ... mutual aid or protection\u201d under section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and recommended his full reinstatement. However, the Board, over the dissent of one member, reversed the decision of the AU, overruled its earlier decisions, and dismissed the complaint against Meyers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In rejecting Prill\u2019s charge, the Board adopted a new definition of \u201cconcerted activities;\u201d under the enunciated test, an employee\u2019s conduct is not \u201cconcerted\u201d unless it is \u201cengaged in with or on the authority of other employees, and not solely bv and on behalf of the employee himself.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finding that Prill had acted alone and \u201csolely on his own behalf,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Board held his conduct unprotected by section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">It is not the responsibility of the courts to second-guess the lawful judgments of the NLRB. The Board has been granted broad authority to construe the NLRA in light of its expertise. In appropriate circumstances, the Board even may elect to abandon or modify established precedent. However, judicial deference is not accorded a decision of the NLRB when the Board acts pursuant to an erroneous view, of law and, as a consequence, fails to exercise the discretion delegated to it by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">In the instant case, we find that the Board erred when it decided that its new definition of \u201cconcerted activities\u201d was <em>mandated </em>by the NLRA. Because the Board misconstrued the bounds of the law, its opinion stands on a faulty legal premise and without adequate rationale. Accordingly, we remand this case under the principles of <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp.,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>so that the Board may reconsider the scope of \u201cconcerted activities\u201d under section 7. We express no opinion as to the correct test of \u201cconcerted activities;\u201d we require only that the Board exercise the full measure of administrative discretion granted to it by Congress and reconsider this matter free from its erroneous conception of the bounds of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">The facts were found by the Administrative Law Judge<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and accepted by the Board,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and are largely undisputed on review. Kenneth Prill was hired as a skilled driver on April 24, 1979, by Meyers Industries, a Michigan company engaged in the manufacture, sale and distribution of aluminum boats and. related products. Prill had driven trucks for several years before going to work for Meyers, and he had received two years of training as a mechanic. Throughout the period that he was employed by Meyers, he had a good work record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">Prill was assigned to drive a red Ford truck and its accompanying trailer to haul boats from Meyers\u2019 main facility in Tecumseh, Michigan, to dealers throughout the country. Prill soon began to experience problems with his equipment, especially with the steering and the trailer\u2019s brakes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition to discussing these problems with other drivers,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Prill made numerous complaints to his supervisor, Dave Faling, to the company president, Alan Beatty, and to the mechanic, Buck Maynard, after returning from trips on which the brakes malfunctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">On one trip, for example, while he was driving through Chicago, Illinois, Prill narrowly escaped an accident when his brakes failed during a sudden stop in heavy traffic. On his return Prill asked Faling and Maynard to have the brakes repaired, but Maynard\u2019s efforts were unsuccessful. He told Prill that the axles were so old that it was impossible to secure replacement parts; Prill insisted that new parts be purchased. After his next trip, during which the brakes remained inoperative, Prill again asked Faling when the brakes would be repaired, but was simply referred to Maynard or Beatty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">On a subsequent trip to Xenia, Ohio, Prill stopped at a roadside inspection conducted by the Ohio State Highway Patrol. As a result of that inspection, the truck was issued a citation for a number of defects, including the brakes. When Prill returned to Michigan, he showed the citation to Fal-ing and submitted it together with his post-trip paperwork.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">During the first two weeks in June, 1979, another driver, Ben Gove, drove Prill\u2019s equipment on a trip to Sudberry, Ontario. Gove testified before the ALJ that he experienced a steering problem which made it difficult to hold the road and \u201ccaused [the truck] to swerve back and forth like Ken Prill described,\u201d nearly causing an accident.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When Gove went to Faling\u2019s office to submit his post-trip report, Prill was there at the same time to receive paperwork for the next trip. Gove described the steering and brake problems to Faling, and stated, in Prill\u2019s presence, that he would not drive the truck again until it was repaired.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Faling promised to make the needed repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-16\">In early July, Prill was driving through Athens, Tennessee, when he had an accident which the Board found was caused by the malfunctioning brakes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A pickup <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>truck struck the left rear of Prill\u2019s trailer, causing the truck to jack-knife and sending both vehicles into a ditch.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After giving a statement to the state highway patrol at the scene of the accident, Prill unsuccess- \u201e \u201e , , , , ,, \u2019 , , , .. fully sought to have the truck and trailer i j , , , U1. , \u2022 mspeeted by the state public' service commission<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aou-dedup-2\">Following the accident, Prill called Meyers president Alan Beatty at home to advise him of the incident and of the extensive amage o e um \u2022 ^ as \u00ae Pnll to chain the tractor and trailer togeth- , , , . , , , \u2122 ? \u201e er and tow the trailer back to lecumseh for repairs. Prill responded that \u201cit would be possible to do that, but it would still be a hazard on the highway\u201d because the hitch area was cracked and might give way and cause an accident.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Beatty repeated that Prill should chain and tow the trailer home, but told him that if he insisted he could have a mechanic in Tennessee look at it.</p>\n<p id=\"ab--dedup-0\">... . n -n \u201e , \u201e , The following morning, Prill called Beat- , , , <em>j , , L- </em>, <em>, nT </em>ty at work and spoke to him and to Wayne Seagraves, the company\u2019s vice president for production. Both were upset that Prill was still in Tennessee, and demanded to know why he had not yet left. Prill stated that the vehicle was unsafe because the hitch was damaged and the trailer lacked brakes. Seagraves responded that the company had been running its trucks like that for 20 years.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At the end of the conversation, Beatty and Seagraves decided to send Maynard down to check the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"AqbV\">.. \u201e ... , ., , , After this conversation, Prill decided to \u201e . .. \u201e . \u201e contact the Tennessee Public Service Com- ... \u201e ...... mission to arrange for an official inspection of the vehicle. The inspection resulted in a citation putting the unit out of service becauge of bad brakeg and d e tQ the wtch area. The dtation wag baged on gev. eral Department of Transportation regula- ,. . . \u201e K OA\u201e . , tions, including 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 396.4, which ,.\u2019 ,. \u201e \u2019 ,. e operatfn \u00b0f \u201c unsaf\u00ab ^ cle.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Pn\u201d was instructed to notify the Pohe\u00ae \u00b0r Public Service Commission immelately if anyone attempted to move the vehicle before required repairs were made. When Maynard arrived in Tennessee later the same day, Prill showed him the citation, Maynard and Beatty then decided that the trailer was not worth repairing and should , ... r ,, .. be sold for scrap after removing the tires, 1 <em>b</em></p>\n<p id=\"AA7q\">Two days later Prill reported for work and was summoned to Wayne Seagraves\u2019 office, where he was questioned about the accident and damage to the truck. Both Seagraves and Beatty asked Prill why he had not towed the trailer back as requested; Prill responded that this would have been both unsafe and unlawful.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>end of the conversation, Seagraves told Prill that he was discharged because \u201cwe can\u2019t have you calling the cops like this all the time.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">B. <em>The Decisions of the ALJ and the Board</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">On the basis of these facts, the ALJ found that Prill was discharged because of his safety complaints and his refusal to drive an unsafe vehicle in accordance with Department of Transportation regulations.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Relying on the rationale of <em>Alleluia Cushion Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the ALJ held that Prill\u2019s actions were \u201cconcerted activities for ... mutual aid or protection\u201d under section 7 of the NLRA, and thus protected, because they inured to the benefit of all employees.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In order to understand this conclusion, it is necessary briefly to review the development of the Board\u2019s doctrine of \u201cconstructive concerted activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">During the past 25 years, the Board has gradually extended the concept of \u201cconcerted activities\u201d under section 7 to include certain types of actions taken by individual employees. For example, under the so-called <em>Interboro </em>doctrine, the Board has long held that the assertion by a single employee of rights derived from a collective bargaining agreement is protected under section 7, on the reasoning that such an act is an extension of the concerted action that produced the agreement and that it affects the rights of all employees covered by the agreement.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In addition, in a series of cases since 1959, the Board developed the position that section 7 protects corn-plaints made by an individual, even absent authorization by other employees, \u201cif the matter at issue is of moment to the group of employees complaining and if that matter is brought to the attention of management by a spokesman, voluntary or appointed for that purpose, so long as such person is speaking for the benefit of the interested group.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-15\">In <em>Alleluia Cushion </em>Co.,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the Board extended the doctrine of constructive concerted activity to include an individual employee\u2019s efforts to invoke state and federal laws regulating occupational safety. In <em>Alleluia </em>an employee was discharged for notifying the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of unsafe conditions at his plant. Observing that \u201c[s]afe working conditions are matters of great and continuing concern for all within the workforce,\u201d and that filing the OSHA complaint \u201cwas an action taken in furtherance of guaranteeing Respondent\u2019s employees their rights under the California Occupational Safety and Health Act,\u201d the Board held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-16\">[i]t would be incongruous with the public policy enunciated in such occupational safety legislation ... to presume that, absent an outward manifestation of support, Henley\u2019s fellow employees did not agree with his efforts to secure compliance with the statutory obligations imposed on Respondent for their benefit. Rather, since minimum safe and healthful employment conditions for the protection and well-being of employees has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>been legislatively declared to be in the overall public interest, the consent and concert of action emanates from the mere assertion of such statutory rights. Accordingly, where an employee speaks up and seeks to enforce statutory provisions relating to occupational safety designed for the benefit of all employees, in the absence of any evidence that fellow employees disavow such representation, we will find an implied consent thereto and deem such activity to be concerted.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWL_\">The rationale of <em>Alleluia </em>thus was composed of two stands: (1) the Board\u2019s familiar view that an individual\u2019s activity should be protected if it relates to a matter of \u201cmutual concern\u201d to employees, and (2) a more specific rationale that concert may be presumed when an individual asserts rights under a statute enacted for the benefit of employees.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Applying the principles of <em>Alleluia </em>and its progeny,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the ALT in the instant case held Prill\u2019s conduct protected under section 7. He reasoned that Prill\u2019s refusal to drive the vehicle was mandated by Department of Transportation regulations that reflected a concern for the safety of particular drivers as well as for that of the general public, and that \u201c[a]n employee who complains about the safety of a particular truck speaks for the safety of any employee who may drive that truck.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The ALJ also held that Prill\u2019s complaints prior to the accident \u201cwere clearly concerted because they were joined by driver Gove,\u201d who had made similar complaints to supervisor Dave Faling in Prill\u2019s presence.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Therefore, the AU ruled that Prill\u2019s discharge violated section 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">The Board disagreed and dismissed the complaint. Overruling <em>Alleluia </em>and its progeny, the Board argued that activity could be \u201cconcerted\u201d only if it in fact involved \u201csome kind of group action,\u201d and criticized <em>Alleluia </em>as inconsistent with the statute because it allowed group support to be presumed rather than proven.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Claiming to return to \u201cthe standard on which the Board and courts relied before Alleluia,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the Board announced the following test for protected concerted activity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-11\">In general, to find an employee\u2019s activity to be \u201cconcerted,\u201d we shall require that it be engaged in with or on the authority of other employees, and not solely by or on behalf of the employee himself. Once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>the activity is found to be concerted, an 8(a)(1) violation will be found if, in addition, the employer knew of the protected nature of the employee\u2019s activity, the concerted activity was protected by the Act, and the adverse employment action at issue <em>(e.g., </em>discharge) was motivated by the employee\u2019s protected concerted activity.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">Applying this standard, the Board held that Prill had acted alone and \u201csolely on his own behalf\u201d when he refused to drive the truck and contacted the Tennessee Public Service Commission.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As to whether Prill\u2019s complaints prior to the accident were joined by Gove, the Board found that the record was clear that \u201cPrill merely overheard Gove\u2019s complaint while in the office on another matter.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Stating that \u201cthe most that can be inferred from this scenario is that another employee was individually concerned ... about the truck\u2019s condition,\u201d the Board ruled that \u201c[tjaken by itself, ... <em>individual </em>employee concern, even if openly manifested by several employees on an <em>individual </em>basis, is not sufficient evidence to prove concert of action.\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Although the Board admitted to being \u201c[ojutraged ... by a respondent who \u2014 at the expense of its driver and others traveling on the nation\u2019s highways\u2014 was clearly attempting to squeeze the last drop of life out of a trailer that had just as clearly given up the ghost,\u201d it nevertheless concluded that it did not believe \u201cthat section 7, framed as it was to legitimize and</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-12\">protect group action engaged in by employees for their mutual aid and protection, was intended to encompass the case of individual activity presented here.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Therefore, the Board held that Prill\u2019s discharge did not violate his rights under section 7.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-13\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-14\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-15\">Because the Board is entrusted with the \u201cresponsibility to adapt the Act to changing patterns of industrial life,\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> a reasonable construction of the Act by the Board is entitled to considerable deference.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> An agency decision cannot be sustained, however, where it is based not on the agency\u2019s own judgment but on an erroneous view of the law. For it is a fundamental principle of law that \u201can administrative order cannot be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted in exercising its powers were those upon which its action can be sustained.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court stated in its landmark decision in <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-16\">[I]f [agency] action is based upon a determination of law as to which the reviewing authority of the courts does come into play, an order may not stand if the agency has misconceived the law____ [T]he orderly functioning of the process of review requires that the grounds upon which the administrative agency acted be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>clearly disclosed and adequately sustained.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqx-dedup-1\">These principles were concisely stated by Judge Bork in his separate opinion in <em>Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. v. </em>Heckler:<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aexa\">Under <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943), we must judge the validity of an administrative regulation solely on \u201cthe grounds upon which the [agency] itself based its action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 63 S.Ct. at 459. In particular, an agency regulation must be declared invalid, even though the agency might be able to adopt the regulation in the exercise of its discretion, if it was not based on the [agency s] own judgment but rather on the unjustified assumption that it was Congress judgment that such [a regulation is] desirable.\u201d <em>FCC v. RCA Communications, Inc., </em>346 U.S. 86, 96, 73 S.Ct. 998, 1005, 97 L.Ed. 1470 (1953). If a regulation is based on an incorrect view of applicable law, the regulation cannot stand as promulgated, unless the mistake of the administrative body is one that clearly had no bearing , ,, . , on the procedure used or the substance \u201e , . . , <em>, \u201e </em>,, , ., of decision reached. <em>Massachuse</em>tts <em>Trustees v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 235, 248, 84 S.Ct. 1236, 1245, 12 L.Ed.2d 268 (1964)<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar_4\">, ,. \u201e We think that the teachings of <em>Chenery </em>are plainly implicated in this case. The Board\u2019s opinion clearly reveals that it considered its adoption of a narrow test for \u201cconcerted activities\u201d both to be mandated by the NLRA itself and to be merely a return to \u201cthe standard on which the Board and courts relied before Alleluia.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We believe that the Board misinterpreted the law in two respects. First, we think, espe-dally on the basis of recent Supreme Court decisions, that the Board erred in assuming that the NLRA <em>mandates </em>its present interpretation of \u201cconcerted activities.\u201d In other words, the Board\u2019s opinion is wrong insofar as it holds that the agency is without discretion to construe \u201cconcerted activities\u201d except as indicated in the <em>Meyers </em>test.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Second, contrary to the view expressed by the Board, we find that the <em>Meyers </em>test does not represent a return to the standard relied on by the courts and by the Board before <em>Alleluia, </em>but instead constitutes a new and more restrictive stan-\u00bfard. We therefore conclude that, because the Board\u2019s decision stands on a faulty legal premise and without adequate ration- ^ we must remand the case for reconsid. erat\u00a1on</p>\n<p id=\"arx-dedup-1\">B. <em>The </em>Meyers <em>Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9I\">The Board announced in this case that&gt; \u00ab[i]n general, to find an employee\u2019s activit to be &lt;concerted/ we shall require ^ \u00a1t be d in with or on the author. ., \u00bb ,, , , , , , , lty of other employees, and not solely by <em>, J </em>' .. <em>A </em>\u201e .. and on behalf of the employee himself. <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> . , \u201e <em>~ </em>. , . As counsel for the Board confirmed at oral ,. , . . ,, , argument, this test m effect requires that two or more employees join in or authorize conduct before activity can be \u201cconcerted\u201d under gection 7_</p>\n<p id=\"A-B7\">The Board\u2019s decisions since <em>Meyers </em>indicate that the new definition will be strictly construed to include only activity clearly joined in or endorsed by other employees, Thus, to find that a complaint by an individual employee was made \u201con behalf of\u201d others, the Board in effect will require that the complaint have been specifically autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>rized by other employees.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Further, a single employee who files a complaint with a state agency will not be held to have engaged in concerted activities, regardless of how clearly his concern is shared by other employees.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">The Board\u2019s opinion reveals that it believed its present construction of \u201cconcerted activities\u201d both to be required by the NLRA and to be a return to standards used by the courts as well as by the Board itself before <em>Alleluia. </em>Although it conceded that \u201cthe legislative history of Section 7 does not specifically define \u2018concerted activity,\u2019 \u201d the Board maintained that \u201cit does reveal that Congress considered the concept in terms of individuals united in pursuit of a common goal.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The Board argued that a similar interpretation emerged from an analysis of the language of section 7.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The Board then reviewed its <em>pre-Allel-uia </em>decisions to show that, \u201c[c]onsistent with this interpretation,\u201d they had required \u201csome sort of group action\u201d to be present in order to find conduct to be concerted under section 7.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The opinion criticized <em>Alleluia </em>for deviating from this norm, and observed that the Board\u2019s <em>post-Alleluia </em>decisions had been rejected by the courts of appeals.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The Board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-9\">For all the foregoing reasons, we are persuaded that the <em>[Alleluia </em>] <em>per se </em>standard of concerted activity ... is at odds with the Act. The Board and courts always considered, first, whether the activity is [actually] concerted, and only then, whether it is protected. This approach is mandated by the statute itself, which requires that an activity be both \u201cconcerted\u201d and \u201cprotected.\u201d A Board finding that a particular form of individual activity warrants group support is not a sufficient basis for labeling that activity \u201cconcerted\u201d within the meaning of Section. 7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1038-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Based on the foregoing analysis, we hold that the concept of concerted activity first enunciated in <em>Alleluia </em>does not comport with the principles inherent in Section 7 of the Act. We rely, instead, upon the \u201cobjective\u201d standard of concerted activity \u2014 the standard on which the Board and courts relied before <em>Alleluia. </em>Accordingly, we hereby overrule <em>Alleluia </em>and its progeny.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-M-\">As the foregoing passage makes clear, the Board believed that, in rejecting <em>Alleluia </em>and adopting the <em>Meyers </em>test, it was returning to the standards applied by the courts and by the Board before <em>Alleluia, </em>and that this approach was \u201cmandated by the statute itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s view, it is clear from the Board\u2019s opinion that it considered not only its rejection of <em>Alleluia </em>but also its adoption of the <em>Meyers </em>standard to be required by the statute. In the passage quoted above, the Board contrasts the <em>\u201cper se </em>\u201d standard of <em>Alleluia </em>with the approach it claims was traditionally taken by \u201c[t]he Board and courts,\u201d which required that conduct be actually concerted for protection under section 7. This approach, the Board maintains, \u201cis mandated by the statute itself.\u201d The Board states shortly thereafter that it will rely \u201cupon the \u2018objective\u2019 standard of concerted activity \u2014 the standard on which the Board and courts relied before <em>Alleluia;\u2019\u2019 </em>it then proceeds to articulate the <em>Meyers </em>standard. We think it could hardly be more clear that the standard the Board adopts is the same approach that it claims was \u201cmandated by the statute itself.\u201d Moreover, the Board\u2019s adoption of the \u201c \u2018objective\u2019 standard\u201d occurs almost in the same breath as its overruling of <em>Alleluia, </em>and was evidently regarded as based on the same rationale, the Board\u2019s view of the requirements of section 7. This reading is confirmed by the Board\u2019s opinion as a whole, which is devoted primarily to criticizing <em>Alleluia </em>as inconsistent with the Act and contains not a word of justification for its new standard in terms of the policies of the statute. Thus, even if the dissent were correct that the Board did not regard its adoption of that standard as statutorily compelled, it would still be necessary to remand under <em>Chen-ery </em>because in that event the Board would have given no rationale whatsoever for the standard it adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">Because, in our view, the Board justified its new test as required by section 7 and as a return to traditional standards for concerted activity, we consider these grounds to determine whether they are correct interpretations of law.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">C. <em>The Board\u2019s Determination That the </em>Meyers <em>Standard is Statutorily Required</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">Our review of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions interpreting section 7 convinces us that, contrary to the Board\u2019s view, the statutory language does not compel it to adopt its present definition of \u201cconcerted activities,\u201d but rather gives the Board substantial responsibility to determine the scope of that provision in light of its own policy judgment and expertise. The Court has upheld the Board\u2019s broad construction of section 7 in a variety of contexts,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> and has emphasized that \u201cthe Board has the \u2018special function of applying the general provisions of the Act to the complexities of industrial life.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>Last Term, in <em>NLRB v. City Disposal Systems,</em><footnotemark><em>58</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court specifically rejected the view that the Board was without authority to interpret \u201cconcerted activities\u201d broadly to effectuate the purposes of section 7. In <em>City Disposal, </em>as in <em>Meyers, </em>a truck driver was discharged when he refused to drive a vehicle that he reasonably believed to be unsafe because of faulty brakes. Unlike Prill, however, the employee in <em>City Disposal, </em>James Brown, was covered by a collective bargaining agreement which permitted him to refuse to drive an unsafe vehicle unless the refusal was unjustified. The Board held Brown\u2019s conduct protected under the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine. The Sixth Circuit, following the prevailing view in the courts of appeals, denied enforcement on the ground that <em>Interboro </em>was inconsistent with a literal reading of concerted activities. <footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"amp-dedup-1\">Reversing the Sixth Circuit, the Supreme Court made clear that section 7 does not compel a narrowly literal interpretation of \u201cconcerted activities,\u201d but rather is to be construed by the Board in light of its expertise in labor relations. While agreeing with the <em>Meyers </em>Board that the term \u201cconcerted activity\u201d \u201cclearly enough embraces the activities of employees who have joined together in order to achieve common goals,\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> the Court emphasized that \u201c[w]hat is not self-evident from the language of the Act ... is the precise manner in which particular actions of an individual employee must be linked to the actions of fellow employees in order to permit it to be said that the individual is engaged in concerted activity.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdVQ\"><em>Although one could interpret the phrase, \u201cto engage in concerted activities, </em>\u201d <em>to refer to a situation in which two or more employees are working together at the same time and the same place toward a common goal, the language of \u00a7 7 does not confine itself to such a narrow meaning. </em>In fact, \u00a7 7 itself defines both joining and assisting labor organizations \u2014 activities in which a single employee can engage \u2014 as eoncert-ed activities. Indeed, even the courts that have rejected the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine recognize the possibility that an individual employee may be engaged in concerted activity when he acts alone.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aob6\">Because the Court found that the meaning of \u201cconcerted activities\u201d was subject to varying interpretations based on \u201cdiffering views regarding the nature of the relationship that must exist between the action of the individual employee and the actions of the group in order for \u00a7 7 to apply,\u201d it held that the question was for the Board to resolve in light of its expertise in labor relations, as long as its judgment was reasonable.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The Court concluded that the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine embodied a reasonable view, agreeing with the Board that \u201c[t]he invocation of a right rooted in a collective bargaining agreement is unquestionably an integral part of the process that gave rise to the agreement,\u201d a process that extends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>from the organization of a union to the enforcement of a collective bargaining agreement achieved through group action.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">The Court also found that the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine was not inconsistent with the congressional intent in enacting section 7.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Reviewing the history of that provision,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> the Court concluded that Congress, in enacting section 7, had \u201csought generally to equalize the bargaining power of the employee with that of his employer by allowing employees to band together in confronting an employer regarding the terms and conditions of their employment.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Most importantly, the Court observed that \u201c[tjhere is no indication that Congress intended to limit this protection to situations in which an employee\u2019s activity and that of his fellow employees combine with one another in any particular way.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\">Thus, <em>City Disposal </em>makes unmistakably clear that, contrary to the Board\u2019s view in <em>Meyers, </em>neither the language nor the history of section 7 requires that the term \u201cconcerted activities\u201d be interpreted to protect only the most narrowly defined forms of common action by employees, and that the Board has substantial responsibility to determine the scope of protection in order to promote the purposes of the NLRA. The Board\u2019s failure in <em>Meyers </em>to recognize the extent of its own interpretative authority has significant consequences. For example, in the past, both the Board and some courts have held that it is necessary under certain circumstances to accord protection to individual conduct in order to protect the development of collective activity.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Simi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>larly, in <em>City Disposal, </em>the Supreme Court observed that under section 8(a)(1) of the Act \u201c[i]t is possible ... for an employer to commit an unfair labor practice by discharging an employee who is not himself involved in concerted activity but whose actions are related to other employees\u2019 concerted activities in such a manner as to render his discharge an interference or restraint on those activities.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> In <em>Meyers, </em>however, the Board failed even to consider whether the discharge of an employee because of his safety complaints would discourage other employees from engaging in collective activity to improve working conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">We recognize that the Board did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>City Disposal </em>when it decided <em>Meyers, </em>and that this fact may well have contributed to the Board\u2019s misconception of the scope of its authority under section 7. Our remand in this case will permit the Board to reconsider <em>Meyers </em>in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>City Disposal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-12\">D. <em>Decisions of the Courts and Board Before </em>Alleluia</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-13\">We also think that the Board was mistaken in its claim that, in adopting the <em>Meyers </em>test, it was simply returning to \u201cthe standard on which the Board and courts relied before Alleluia.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Because the Board relied on a misreading of precedent in selecting the new standard in <em>Meyers, </em>we remand the decision for reconsideration under the principles of Chenery,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-14\">The test adopted by the Board in <em>Meyers </em>derives from the Ninth Circuit\u2019s one-sentence per curiam opinion in <em>Pacific Electri-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number><em>cord Co. v. NLRB.</em><footnotemark><em>73</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The <em>Pacific Electri-cord </em>standard, however, has been followed only in the Ninth Circuit, at least as an exclusive definition of concerted activity. Furthermore, the <em>Pacific Electricord </em>test, which had been relied upon by the Ninth Circuit in rejecting the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine, was effectively disapproved by the Supreme Court in <em>City Disposal, </em>at least insofar as it applied to individual action in the context of collective bargaining.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> It is equally noteworthy that no other court has followed <em>Pacific Electricord </em>in defining \u201cconcerted activities\u201d under section 7.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">The Board and most courts have historically taken a broader approach to defining the scope of section 7.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> In particular, the <em>Meyers </em>test appears to be narrower in at least two important respects than the standards traditionally applied by the Board and the courts to define concerted activity. First, both the Board and the courts have long held that an individual who brings a group complaint to the attention of management is engaged in concerted activity even though he was not designated or authorized to be a spokesman by the group.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> In applying the <em>Meyers </em>test, however, the Board has essentially required that such a complaint have been specifically authorized by the group in order to be protected under section 7.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">Second, the courts have long followed the Board\u2019s view that individual efforts to enlist other employees in support of common goals is protected by section 7.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>leading case is <em>Mushroom Transportation Co. v. </em>NLRB,<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> which holds that conduct is protected if it is \u201cengaged in with the object of initiating or inducing or preparing for group action or ... had some relation to group action in the interest of employees.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court indicated in <em>City Disposal, </em>practically all courts follow <em>Mushroom Transportation </em>in holding such conduct protected.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> It is not clear, however, that the <em>Meyers </em>standard would protect an individual\u2019s efforts to induce group action.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"agt-dedup-1\">The <em>Mushroom Transportation </em>standard has been given varying interpretations by the courts of appeals. Some courts have applied the standard narrowly;<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> others have given it a more expansive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>interpretation, emphasizing the Third Circuit\u2019s statement that conduct is protected if it \u201chad some relation to group action in the interest of employees.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Further, a number of cases have expressed the view that an individual employee engages in concerted activity when the purpose of his acts is to promote the welfare of other workers.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Finally, in one case, the Sixth Circuit found concerted activity on facts quite close to those in Meyers.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">We do not undertake to decide in this case whether the Board is required to follow any particular approach to concerted activity under section 7. Rather, we review these cases in order to see whether the Board was correct in its view that, in adopting the <em>Meyers </em>test, it was doing no more than conforming to \u201cthe standard on which the Board and courts relied before <em>Alleluia.\u201d </em>As we have tried to make clear, any fair reading of judicial precedent reveals that the Board\u2019s test in <em>Meyers </em>is substantially narrower in important respects than the various standards for concerted activity that have been followed by past Boards and most of the courts of appeals. We therefore conclude that, in adopting the <em>Meyers </em>test, the Board relied on a misinterpretation of judicial decisions and its own prior cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Our conclusion highlights the lack of any meaningful support for the Board\u2019s opinion in this case. Not only is the Board\u2019s decision grounded on a faulty legal premise (as shown in part III.C. <em>supra), </em>it is also flawed by a lack of rationale. We are therefore constrained, under the authority of <em>Chenery, </em>to remand this case for reconsideration by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-11\">We hold that, in adopting the <em>Meyers </em>test of \u201cconcerted activities,\u201d the Board failed to rely on its own judgment and expertise, and instead based its decision on an erroneous view of the law. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>City Disposal </em>makes clear that the Board is not <em>required </em>to give a narrowly literal interpretation to \u201cconcerted activities,\u201d but has substantial authority to \u201cde-fin[e] the scope of \u00a7 7 \u2018... in the first instance as it considers the wide variety of cases that come before it.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Moreover, we find that, contrary to the Board\u2019s view, its <em>Meyers </em>standard does not constitute a mere return to the standards traditionally applied by the Board and the courts to define concerted activity, but instead is substantially more restrictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-12\">This is not a case in which the \u201cmistake of the administrative body is one that clearly had no bearing on the procedure used or the substance of decision reached.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> As our discussion has shown, the Board and courts of appeals have taken a variety of approaches to defining \u201cconcerted activities,\u201d some of which might result in relief for the petitioner. Moreover, the result in a given case will often turn not only on the governing standard but also on the manner in which that standard is applied, and this may well be influenced by whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>Board believes the standard to be dictated by the statute itself or rather adopted as a matter of policy in order to effectuate the purposes of the Act. Thus, we cannot say that the Board\u2019s error in this case clearly had no bearing on the result reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">Rather than remand to the Board, the dissent would have this court determine for itself whether, applying the <em>City Disposal </em>analysis, the conduct at issue here is sufficiently related to the actions of other employees that it should be held protected under section 7. We believe, however, that such a determination is for the Board and not for this court to make in the first instance. The dissent\u2019s extensive efforts to provide a justification for distinguishing between the assertion of rights within and without a collective bargaining context only underscore the failure of the Board to provide a reasoned basis for such a distinction in its own opinion. Our remand in this case is intended to afford the Board a full opportunity to consider such issues in light of the analysis of section 7 in <em>City Disposal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">The dissent unaccountably characterizes our opinion as holding that the Board had discretion under section 7 to adopt the <em>Alleluia </em>doctrine. However, as we have made clear, we do not find it necessary to consider the validity of <em>Alleluia </em>or any other test of concerted activity in this case, and we express no opinion on this issue. The dissent also urges on various grounds that remand is unnecessary because the Board\u2019s error in this case is \u201charmless.\u201d We do not believe that an agency decision can be sustained under any notion of \u201charmless error\u201d where the agency has failed to exercise its lawful discretion and has provided no rational basis for its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">Although we, like the Board, find the facts of this case to be egregious, we stress that this in no way forms the basis of our decision. Nonetheless, we think that the facts of this case highlight the Board\u2019s failure to give a considered judgment on the issues involved. In the present case, the Board upheld the discharge of an employee for refusing to drive a vehicle determined to be unsafe by state authorities, despite the fact that both the employee and the company were under a legal obligation not to operate the vehicle.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Moreover, the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Meyers </em>produces the anomaly that a unionized worker who complains about safety or other matters covered by a collective bargaining agreement will be held protected under <em>Interboro </em>and <em>City Disposal, </em>while an unorganized employee will be denied protection for engaging in identical conduct. We agree with the Board that its responsibility is to apply the National Labor Relations Act and not to enforce all state and federal law. This does not mean, however, that with respect to matters within its discretion, the Board should ignore the policy implications of its decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">Because we have determined that it was \u201cimproper for the [Board] to suppose that the standard it has adopted is to be derived without more from a national policy defined by legislation and by the courts,\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> we remand the case to the Board for reconsideration of the scope of \u201cconcerted activities\u201d under section 7.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">.

In <em>Mannington Mills, </em>the employee, William Frie, was a crew leader in the respondent's shipping department, as well as the elected representative of that department\u2019s employees to the company\u2019s safety committee, a joint management-employee forum for both safety and nonsafety complaints. Shipping department employees had a \u2018\u2018long-standing complaint\u201d about the employer\u2019s practice of requiring the night-shift crews to perform loading operations left unfinished by the previous shift. In July 1980, Frie, \"acting in his capacity as employee representative,\u201d raised this complaint with the safety committee and was told to take it up with the night-shift foreman. In October, he discussed the matter with the foreman and stated that the night-shift employees would refuse to perform such assignments in the future. Upholding Frie\u2019s discharge, the Board stated that, even accepting Frie\u2019s testimony that a number of other employees had indicated to him that they would refuse to perform the work, nothing in the record showed that they had authorized him to make such a threat to the employer. Thus, the Board concluded that, under <em>Meyers, </em>Frie\u2019s threat constituted individual rather than concerted activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">. In <em>Jefferson Elec. Co., </em>271 N.L.R.B. No. 177, 117 L.R.R.M. 1092 (Aug. 21, 1984), a group of workers was exposed to noxious fumes from a production process as a result of a clogged air vent. Some employees complained to management about the fumes, but without success. The next day 11 employees were sent to the employer's doctor; three were hospitalized for periods of up to two weeks. While in the hospital, the employee most severely ill from the fumes filed a complaint about the incident with the state OSHA. She was later discharged for this action and for her pro-union activity. Because it found no evidence that the employee had solicited the support of others before filing her complaint, the Board held her activity un-concerted under <em>Meyers </em>and therefore upheld her discharge to the extent that it was motivated by her OSHA-related activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">. <em>Meyers </em>at 3, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1025-26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b1037-12\">.

As the Court explained, the protection for concerted activities originated in \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act, ch. 323, 38 Stat. 730, 731, 738 (1915) (currently codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 17 (1982); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 52 (1982)), and \u00a7 2 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, ch. 90, 47 Stat. 70, 70 (1933) (currently codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 (1982)). These provisions were enacted to exempt peaceful labor activities from the reach of the federal antitrust laws and the common law doctrine of unlawful conspiracy, which held that labor protests that would have been lawful if made by a single individual were nevertheless unlawful if conducted by a group. In Norris-LaGuardia Act \u00a7 2, Congress declared that it was the public policy of the United States that \"the individual ... worker shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion, of employers ... in self-organization or in <em>other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\" Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Clayton and Norris-La-Guardia Acts, however, granted legal protection to these rights only against interference by the federal courts through use of the labor injunction. When Congress adopted the National Industrial Relations Act, ch. 90, \u00a7 7(a), 48 Stat. 195 (1933), and the NLRA, ch. 372, \u00a7 7, 49 Stat. 449 (1935), it adopted the language of \u00a7 2 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to define the rights of employees against employer coercion and discipline as. well. <em>See City Disposal, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1512-13. <em>See generally </em>Gorman &amp; Finkin, <em>supra </em>note 27, at 331-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">The petitioner, joined by the amici, argues on the basis of this history that NLRA \u00a7 7 was intended not to protect only conduct engaged in by two or more employees, but rather to extend to group conduct the same protections to which individual actions were entitled. <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioner at 26-29; Brief of Amici Curiae Workers\u2019 Rights Law Project (WRLP) and Philadelphia Area Project on Occupational Safety and Health (PHILAPOSH) at 11-17. This interpretation of the history of \u00a7 7 has the support of a number of commentators. <em>See, e.g., </em>Gorman &amp; Finkin, <em>supra </em>note 27, at 331-46; Lynd, <em>The Right to Engage in Concerted Activity After Union Recognition: A Study of Legislative History, </em>50 Ind.L.J. 720, 726-34 (1975); Note, <em>Individual Rights for Organized and Unorganized Employees Under the National Labor Relations Act, </em>58 Tex.L.Rev. 991, 1006-08 (1980); <em>see also Illinois Ruan Transp. Corp. v. NLRB, </em>404 F.2d 274, 289 n. 6 (8th Cir.1968) (Lay, J., dissenting). We find it unnecessary to consider this argument in the present case, however, since we find that, in any event, the Board was mistaken in its view that the language, history, and prior interpretation of \u00a7 7 left it without discretion to consider adopting a broader interpretation of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b1040-12\">. 104 S.Ct. at 1513.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b1040-13\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b1040-14\">. <em>See, e.g., Hugh H.

In its brief, Brief for NLRB at 7, 24-27, the Board urges us to uphold its decision partly because it \"reasonably acquiesced\u201d in the judicial decisions rejecting the <em>Alleluia </em>doctrine, <em>see </em>note 27 <em>supra. </em>This argument ignores the basic distinction between the Board\u2019s rejection of the sweeping <em>Alleluia </em>principle and its establishment of the new standard. The Board's rejection of <em>Alleluia </em>in no way required it to adopt the test enunciated in <em>Meyers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">For other reasons as well, we find the decisions on which the Board relies to be of limited value in deciding the present case. First, many of the cases that rejected <em>Alleluia </em>relied on reasoning or on earlier decisions that disapproved all forms of \"constructive concerted activity,\u201d including the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Jim Causley Pontiac v. NLRB, </em>620 F.2d 122, 126 n. 7 (6th Cir.1980) (finding adoption <em>o\u00ed Alleluia </em>foreclosed by <em>ARO, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>596 F.2d 713 (6th Cir.1979)); <em>NLRB v. Bighorn Beverage, </em>614 F.2d 1238, 1242 (9th Cir.1980) (relying on several decisions rejecting or criticizing Interboro); <em>NLRB v. Dawson Cabinet Co., </em>566 F.2d 1079, 1082-84 (8th Cir.1977) (relying on <em>NLRB v. Northern Metal Co., </em>440 F.2d 881 (3d Cir.1971), and <em>NLRB v. Buddies Supermarkets, Inc., </em>481 F.2d 714, 719-20 (5th Cir.1973)). As the Board concedes, <em>see </em>Brief for NLRB at 26 n. 8, the rationale of such cases does not survive <em>City Disposal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-10\">Furthermore, many of the judicial decisions refusing to hold individual action to be concerted did not involve occupational safety or other statutory rights, but rather involved individual employee protests about job conditions. <em>See, e.g., Ontario Knife Co. v. NLRB, </em>637 F.2d 840 (2d Cir.1980); <em>Pelton Casteel, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>627 F.2d 23 (7th Cir.1980). In such cases, the employee\u2019s complaint may appear to the court to be little more than a \"personal gripe\u201d unworthy of protection under \u00a7 7. <em>See Pelton Casteel, </em>627 F.2d at 29. Few of the cases rejecting <em>Alleluia </em>involved matters of safety, see, <em>e.g., Jim Causley Pontiac, supra; Bighorn Beverage, supra, </em>and we are aware of no such cases in which the conduct for which the employee was disciplined was <em>required by law, </em>as in the present case. In a case quite similar on its facts to <em>Meyers, NLRB v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., </em>651 F.2d 442 (6th Cir.1981), the Sixth Circuit <em>upheld </em>the Board\u2019s finding that a truck driver who was discharged for his safety complaints was engaged in conduct protected by \u00a7 7. While the court found that there had been considerable group involvement in the safety issue, it also relied on the principles of <em>Alleluia, </em>concluding that the driver was protected because he had \"attempt[ed] to enforce federal safety and state inspection regulations ... intended to provide <em>all </em>employees with a safe job environment and the means to protect themselves against job hazards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445 (emphasis in original). The Board made no reference to the <em>Lloyd A. Fry </em>decision in its <em>Meyers </em>opinion; moreover, it made no effort to consider whether the case of an employee who is discharged for conduct required by laws designed for the benefit of all employees may be distinguishable from the judicial decisions that have rejected the theory of implied concerted activity in other contexts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"73\">\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">. 361 F.2d 310 (9th Cir.1966) (per curiam).

In <em>Root-Carlin, </em>an employee was discharged for discussing with various other employees the need to form a union at their plant. Holding the employee\u2019s conduct protected, the Board stated, \u201cManifestly, the guarantees of section 7 of the Act extend to concerted activity which in its inception involves only a speaker and a listener, for such activity is an indispensable preliminary step to employee self-organization.\u201d 92 N.L.R.B. at 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-16\">In <em>Meyers, </em>in order to maintain its view that the NLRB traditionally has required \u201csome kind of group action\u201d to find conduct concerted, the Board treated <em>Root-Carlin </em>as resting on the rationale that the conversations involved \u201cinteraction among employees.\" <em>Meyers </em>at 4-5, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1026. Although the <em>Root-Carlin </em>Board mentioned this point, 92 N.L.R.B. at n. 5, it relied primarily on the policy ground that protecting such activity was essential to the development of employee self-organization. Thus, in explaining the principle the following year, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>the Board stated, \"Group action is not deemed a prerequisite to concerted activity, for the reason that a single person\u2019s action may be the preliminary step to acting in concert.\u201d <em>Salt River Valley Water Users Ass\u2019n, </em>99 N.L.R.B. 849, 853 (1952) (footnote omitted), <em>enforced in relevant part, 206 </em>F.2d 325, 328 (9th Cir.1953).

Corp., </em>155 N.L.R.B. 255 (1965), in which the Board found no concerted activity where an employee presented to management a complaint that she claimed was shared by a majority of employees although they were too frightened to speak up themselves. As our discussion has shown, we find that <em>Continental </em>did not represent the dominant trend of the Board\u2019s <em>pre-Alleluia </em>decisions. <em>See also </em>Gorman &amp; Fin-kin, <em>supra </em>note 27, at 297-98 &amp; n. 37 (characterizing <em>Continental </em>as questionable and inconsistent with Board\u2019s other decisions). Indeed, less than two months after <em>Continental, </em>the Board, in a decision anticipating <em>Alleluia, </em>held that an employee who, without authorization from other employees, filed a complaint with the Department of Labor seeking an investigation of whether her employer was in violation of the Equal Pay Act was engaged in protected concerted activity under \u00a7 7. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>156 N.L.R.B. 7, 10-11 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"80\">\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">. 330 F.2d 683 (3d Cir. 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"81\">\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">. <em>Id. </em>at 685.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"82\">\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">. 104 S.Ct. at 1511; <em>see, e.g., Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v.

Several considerations suggest that such conduct is not protected under <em>Meyers. </em>First, granting protection to the lone employee who seeks to induce group action is not easy to fit within the language of <em>Meyers, </em>and the Board\u2019s subsequent cases show that the definition generally will be construed strictly. More importantly, the <em>Meyers </em>Board had available to it several decades of judicial and administrative decisions construing \u00a7 7. Despite its claim to be returning to an interpretation generally accepted before <em>Alleluia, </em>however, it did not adopt the <em>Mushroom Transportation </em>standard, which is accepted, at least as a nonexclusive standard, by most courts of appeals. Nor did it adopt the language of the <em>ARO </em>case, <em>see </em>note 75 <em>supra, </em>which incorporated both the <em>Mushroom Transportation </em>and <em>Pacific Electricord </em>standards. Instead, the Board chose to adopt the language of <em>Pacific Electricord </em>alone. One might assume, therefore, that the Board\u2019s choice not to endorse the language of <em>Mushroom Transportation </em>was deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-13\">Several decisions since <em>Meyers </em>contain somewhat conflicting indications on whether the Board will hold efforts to induce group action to be concerted under <em>Meyers. </em>In <em>United Hydraulic Servs., Inc., </em>271 N.L.R.B. No. 18, 116 L.R.R.M. 1450 (June 29, 1984), the majority declined to decide the question whether an employee\u2019s distribution of a complaint to his coworkers constituted concerted activity, holding the employee\u2019s discharge unlawful on other grounds. Member Dennis would have held the conduct protected, relying not on the <em>Meyers </em>standard itself but on Meyers'citation to <em>Ontario Knife Co. v. NLRB, </em>637 F.2d 840, 845 (2d Cir. 1980). <em>See </em>note 73 <em>supra. </em>In two recent cases, divided panels of the Board relied on <em>Mushroom Transportation </em>to hold efforts to promote group action concerted. <em>See Walter Bruckner &amp; Co., </em>273 N.L.R.B.

The Board determined that Prill\u2019s employer, Meyers Industries, Inc., did not commit an unfair labor practice by discharging Prill, because the conduct for which Prill was discharged was not \u201cconcerted activity]\u201d under section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 (1982). <em>Meyers Industries, Inc., </em>268 N.L.R.B. No. 73, 115 L.R.R.M. 1025 (Jan. 6, 1984) (hereinafter referred to as <em>\u201cMeyers </em>\u201d). In my view, the Board reached a result that seems to me compelled by section 7. If Prill\u2019s actions might be called \u201cconcerted,\u201d almost any actions might be so characterized and the qualifying word that Congress wrote into the statute would effectively be removed from it. But, in any event, the Board\u2019s interpretation of the provision is reasonable and should be upheld without hesitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">The majority does not purport to disturb any of the Board\u2019s findings of fact in this case. It is therefore common ground that Prill was discharged for refusing to drive an unsafe vehicle and entering safety complaints about the vehicle to his employer and to state authorities. <em>See Meyers </em>at 15, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1030. It is also common ground that \u201cPrill alone refused to drive the truck and trailer; he alone contacted the Tennessee Public Service Commission after the accident; and, prior to the accident, he alone contacted the Ohio authorities. Prill acted solely on his own behalf.\u201d <em>Meyers </em>at 16, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1030. Moreover, it is undisputed that as to a similar complaint made in Prill\u2019s presence by another driver, one Gove, about the same vehicle, \u201cthe judge correctly made no factual finding that Prill and Gove in any way joined forces to protest the truck\u2019s condition.\u201d <em>Meyers </em>at 16-17, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">In the course of applying section 7 to this case, the Board overruled its decision in <em>Alleluia Cushion Co., </em>221 N.L.R.B. 999, 1000 (1975), which had held that \u201cwhere an employee speaks up and seeks to enforce statutory provisions relating to occupational safety designed for the benefit of all employees, in the absence of any evidence that fellow employees disavow such representation, we will find an implied consent thereto and deem such activity to be concerted.\u201d The Board held that \u201cthe concept of concerted activity first enunciated in <em>Alleluia </em>does not comport with the principles inherent in Section 7 of the Act,\u201d and asserted that it would instead rely \u201cupon the \u2018objective\u2019 standard of concerted activity\u2014 the standard on which the Board and the courts relied before <em>Alleluia.\u201d Meyers </em>at 11, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1028-29. The Board then proceeded to set forth a definition of concerted activity that \u201cis an attempt at a comprehensive one, [but] we caution that it is by no means exhaustive. We acknowledge the myriad of factual situations that have arisen, and will continue to arise, in this area of the law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>115 L.R.R.M. at 1029. The <em>Meyers </em>reformulation is as follows: \u201c[i]n general, to find an employee\u2019s activity to be \u2018concerted,\u2019 we shall require that it be engaged in with or on the authority of other employees, and not solely by and on behalf of the employee himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1029 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">The majority does not dispute that, if the <em>Meyers </em>test is valid, Prill\u2019s conduct is not concerted activity and therefore cannot be protected under section 8(a)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1982). The majority also refrains from holding that Prill\u2019s conduct was concerted activity under section 7, and claims to \u201cexpress no view on whether, under \u00a7 7, the Board may adopt the <em>Meyers </em>test as an act of discretion.\u201d Maj. op. at 948 n. 46. Nonetheless, invoking <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943), the majority sets aside the Board\u2019s order and remands this case to the Board on the grounds that \u201cthe Board misinterpreted the law in two respects.\u201d Maj. op. at 948. First, the majority argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>City Disposal Systems, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 1505, 79 L.Ed.2d 839 (1984), \u201cmakes unmistakably clear that, contrary to the Board\u2019s view in <em>Meyers, </em>neither the language nor the history of section 7 re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>quires that the term \u2018concerted activities\u2019 be interpreted to protect only the most narrowly defined forms of common action by employees, and that the Board has substantial responsibility to determine the scope of protection in order to promote the purposes of the NLRA.\u201d Maj. op. at 952. Second, the majority states that \u201ccontrary to the view expressed by the Board, we find that the <em>Meyers </em>test does not represent a return to the standard relied on by the courts and by the Board before <em>Alleluia, </em>but instead constitutes a new and more restrictive standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 948. Because, in the majority\u2019s view, the Board in its discretion could have adopted a definition of concerted activity under which petitioner\u2019s conduct would be held to be concerted, remand is required. As I shall show, it is the majority rather than the Board that has misinterpreted the law, and in any event the Board\u2019s alleged mistakes, if they existed, would be harmless error under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">In this case, the Board has proposed and applied a new test which it regards as consistent with Congress\u2019 intent in employing the words \u201cconcerted activities\u201d in section 7 of the NLRA. As the majority recognizes, \u201cthe task of defining the scope of \u00a7 7 is for the Board to perform in the first instance as it considers the wide variety of cases that come before it, and, on an issue that implicates its expertise in labor relations, a reasonable construction by the Board is entitled to considerable deference.\u201d <em>NLRB v. City Disposal Systems, </em>Inc.,--U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 1505, 1510, 79 L.Ed.2d 839 (1984) (citations and quotation marks omitted). The question for decision would appear to be straightforward: is the Board\u2019s new construction of section 7 reasonable or not? The anomalous character of the majority\u2019s analysis is well shown by the fact that <em>the majority never answers this question.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">The Board\u2019s reading of section 7 is, in my view, altogether reasonable, and neither <em>City Disposal </em>nor any other Supreme Court decision .suggests otherwise. In <em>City Disposal, </em>the Supreme Court upheld the Board\u2019s <em>Interboro </em>doctrine, under which an employee\u2019s assertion of a right created by a collective-bargaining agreement is treated as concerted activity. <em>See Interboro Contractors, Inc., </em>157 N.L.R.B. 1295, 1298 (1966), <em>enforced, </em>388 F.2d 495 (2d Cir.1967). The Court noted that the Board in <em>Meyers </em>had distinguished cases involving the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine from the run of section 7 cases because <em>Interboro </em>cases concern conduct that relates back to a collective-bargaining agreement, and concluded that \u201c[t]he <em>Meyers </em>case is thus of no relevance here.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 1510 ,n. 6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That remark alone suggests, rather strongly one would think, that <em>City Disposal </em>does not control this case and certainly does not support the majority\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">The Court described the question to which its opinion was addressed as \u201cwhether the Board\u2019s application of \u00a7 7 ... is reasonable.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 1510. The Court summarized the dispute over the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine as one that \u201cmerely reflects differing views regarding the nature of the relationship that must exist between the action of the individual employee and <em>the actions of the group </em>in order for \u00a7 7 to apply.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number><em>City Disposal, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1511 (emphasis added). As this language indicates, <em>some </em>real connection between the individual\u2019s conduct and group action was presupposed by both contending viewpoints before the Court \u2014 and the Court in no way repudiated that threshold requirement. For, as the Court went on to say, the process of which the collective bargaining agreement is a part is \u201ca single, collective activity,\u201d which \u201cextend[s] through the enforcement of the agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201crelationship\u201d the Court identified between individual assertions of rights derived from a collective-bargaining agreement and group action was, moreover, essentially identical to the one it perceived between group action and the individual acts of \u201cjoining and assisting a labor organization, which \u00a7 7 explicitly recognizes as concerted,\u201d <em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 1512. In the latter situation, the individual\u2019s \u201cactions may be divorced in time, and in location as well, from the actions of fellow employees. Because of the integral relationship <em>among the employees\u2019 actions, </em>however, Congress viewed each employee as engaged in concerted activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In a footnote the Court added, \u201c[o]f course, at some point an individual employee\u2019s actions may become so remotely related to the activities of fellow employees that it cannot reasonably be said that the employee is engaged in concerted activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 1512 n. 10. The Court briefly examined the legislative history of section 7, and, finding the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine \u201cfully consistent with congressional intent,\u201d <em>id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 1513, concluded that \u201cthe doctrine constitutes a reasonable interpretation of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 1516.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\"><em>City Disposal </em>establishes only that the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine, which presupposes a real and not imaginary relationship between individual conduct and group action as a condition precedent to finding concerted activity, is a reasonable interpretation of section 7. If the Board in <em>Meyers </em>had held that the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine is inconsistent with the meaning of section 7, I would agree that <em>City Disposal </em>would require us to reject the Board\u2019s reasoning. If the Board had held that some other type of individual conduct that was equally directly related to group action could not be deemed concerted activity consistently with section 7,1 would agree that <em>City Disposal </em>would strongly suggest the Board was wrong. But that is not what happened here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\"><em>Meyers </em>repudiated the <em>Alleluia </em>doctrine, which deems individual protest grounded in a worker protection statute to be concerted activity whether or not any other employees are involved in the protest. <em>Alleluia\u2019s </em>test for concerted activity required less than a \u201cremote\u201d relationship between individual and group activity \u2014 it required no relationship at all. <em>City Disposal </em>is therefore completely consistent with the Board\u2019s determination that \u201cthe concept of concerted activity first enunciated in <em>Alleluia </em>does not comport with the principles inherent in Section 7 of the Act.\u201d <em>Meyers </em>at 11, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">Beyond that, I do not think that <em>City Disposal </em>establishes that the Board has discretion to adhere to the <em>Alleluia </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor is there any basis in the language of section 7 for the majority\u2019s suggestion that \u201cthe case of an employee who is discharged for conduct required by laws designed for the benefit of all employees may be distinguishable from the judicial decisions that have rejected the theory of implied concerted activity in other contexts.\u201d Maj. op. at 953 n. 72. <em>City Dis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number><em>posal </em>makes clear that the words \u201cconcerted activities\u201d were intended to reach individual conduct that is linked to group activity in any of several ways, but it reaffirms the longstanding rule that there must be both group activity and a clear nexus between that activity and the individual\u2019s conduct. The <em>Alleluia </em>doctrine destroyed the statutory requirements of group action and a nexus between that action and the individual\u2019s conduct, thereby reading the word \u201cconcerted\u201d out of section 7 altogether. The <em>City Disposal </em>Court\u2019s careful effort to ground the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine in the language of section 7 confirms the proposition that \u201c\u00a7 7 ... should be read according to its terms.\u201d <em>Ontario Knife Co. v. NLRB, </em>637 F.2d 840, 845 (2d Cir.1980). There is no reading of section 7 \u201caccording to its terms\u201d that would allow a finding of concerted action in this case or in <em>Alleluia-</em>type cases generally.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, while I agree with the majority that the Board believed it had no discretion to adhere to the <em>Alleluia </em>doctrine, in my view the Board\u2019s belief was entirely correct. Since an individual\u2019s appeal to a statute about worker protection involves other workers only in the sense that they \u201cshould\u201d be concerned with such protection, it is difficult to see how that case differs from one in which an individual protests about any matter that, in the estimation of the Board or a court, \u201cshould\u201d be of concern to other workers. Thus, by sleight of hand, Board or judicial policy replaces congressional policy, individual behavior becomes group action, and the requirement that activity be \u201cconcerted\u201d drops from the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">Thus, in <em>Meyers </em>the Board found that \u201cunder the <em>Alleluia </em>analytical framework, the Board questioned whether the purpose of the activity was one it wished to protect and, if so, it then deemed the activity \u2018concerted,\u2019 without regard to its form. This is the essence of the <em>per se </em>standard of concerted activity.\u201d <em>Meyers </em>at 9, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1027. This per se standard presumes that what <em>\u201cought to be </em>of group concern,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 10, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1028, is for the mutual aid or protection of other employees, and therefore that when an individual employee protests over some such matter he is engaging in concerted activity. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1028. The Board contrasted this approach with the practice of the Board and the courts before <em>Alleluia, </em>which \u201cgenerally analyzed the concept of protected concerted activity by first considering whether some kind of group action occurred and, only then, considering whether that action was for the purpose of mutual aid or protection,\u201d <em>Meyers </em>at 4-5, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1026, and held that the <em>Alleluia </em>approach was \u201cat odds with the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">Precisely the same understanding informs <em>City Disposal, </em>where the Court noted at the outset that an employee\u2019s assertion of a right derived from a collective-bargaining agreement falls \u201cwithin the \u2018mutual aid or protection\u2019 standard, regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>whether the employee has his own interests most immediately in mind.\u201d <em>City Disposal, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1510-11 (citation omitted). Had the Court accepted the reading of section 7 that the Board in <em>Meyers </em>identified as underlying the <em>Alleluia </em>doctrine, it could simply have said that because rights contained in a collective-bargaining agreement are secured for the mutual aid or protection of all employees who work under that agreement, an individual\u2019s assertion of any such right must be deemed to be concerted activity. In fact, however, the Court drew no inference from the finding that the \u201cmutual aid or protection\u201d standard had been met. Instead, the Court based its decision that the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine is a reasonable interpretation of section 7 on the integral relationship between the process of collective bargaining \u2014 which is indisputably concerted activity \u2014 and the assertion of rights based on a collective bargaining agreement. <em>City Disposal, </em>then, contains no suggestion that it is within the Board\u2019s discretion to adhere to the <em>Alleluia </em>doctrine or to any other theory of \u201cconstructive\u201d concerted activity that is not grounded in the language of section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">The majority also claims, however, that <em>City Disposal </em>establishes that \u201cthe Board\u2019s opinion is wrong insofar as it holds that the agency is without discretion to construe \u2018concerted activities\u2019 except as indicated in the <em>Meyers </em>test.\u201d Maj. op. at 948. This claim is flatly wrong because the Board nowhere held or implied any such thing. The Board did not say that the Act requires the exact formulation it tentatively adopted \u2014 it said that the general, <em>pre-Alleluia </em>approach which considers \u201cfirst, whether the activity is concerted, and only then, whether it is protected,\u201d is \u201cmandated by the statute itself.\u201d <em>Meyers </em>at 10, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1028. That is simply another way of saying that section 7 does not authorize the Board to find concerted activity merely because one individual\u2019s activity concerns matters that affect the well-being of other employees, and so falls within the \u201cmutual aid or protection\u201d standard. This is the <em>only </em>aspect of its legal analysis that the Board claims is \u201cmandated\u201d by the Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, as I have demonstrated in Part II-B <em>supra, </em>the Board\u2019s view that section 7 leaves it without discretion on this point is entirely reasonable and fully consistent with <em>City </em>Disposal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">Even if I agreed with the majority that the Board\u2019s opinion held that section 7 required it to adopt a definition of \u201cconcerted activit[y]\u201d no broader than the <em>Meyers </em>test, and even if I were convinced that such a holding was erroneous, I would not remand in this case. On the facts as we must take them, there is in my view no definition the Board could propose that would, consistently with the language of section 7, afford petitioner relief. For there is no finding here that petitioner\u2019s conduct was in any way related to group activity. In order to find concerted activity here, the Board would have been forced to hold that con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>cert can be presumed where two employees complain about the same piece of equipment on different occasions, merely because the second employee to complain was aware of the first employee\u2019s protest. Obviously, the <em>first </em>employee\u2019s protest would not be concerted even under this presumption. Hence the Board would be treating the second protest as concerted not because it was related to group activity but merely because it resembled another employee\u2019s individual conduct. The language of section 7 does not admit of such a reading. Since the Administrative Procedure Act requires us to review with due regard for \u201cthe rule of prejudicial error,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1982), I would deny the petition and let the alleged infirmities in the <em>Meyers </em>test await challenge on another occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">The second flaw the majority finds in <em>Meyers </em>is \u201ca misreading of precedent in selecting the new standard.\u201d Maj. op. at 953. The majority\u2019s forced reading of the <em>Meyers </em>test wrongly presupposes that the Board intends that test to be exhaustive and resolves every doubt in favor of construing the <em>Meyers </em>test so that it appears as narrow as possible. The Board, it bears emphasizing, explicitly stated that the <em>Meyers </em>test is not meant to be exhaustive, and may be modified as the Board grapples with the \u201cmyriad of factual situations\u201d that can be expected to arise under section 7. <em>Meyers </em>at 11, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1029. It is virtually certain that there is at least one category of cases the Board would treat as exceptions to the <em>Meyers </em>test: cases involving the assertion of rights under a collective-bargaining agreement (for the Board specifically distinguished the <em>Interboro </em>line of cases, <em>see id. </em>at 11, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1028). The <em>Meyers </em>test, as applied to the facts of this case, holds only that, <em>Inter- </em>- <em>boro </em>cases aside, the Board now requires (1) some evidence of intent to actually induce concerted activity, or (2) some evidence of mutual reliance on the conduct or support of other employees, or (3) some evidence of an actual agreement between employees to protest a given situation, as a condition precedent to a finding of concerted action. <em>Nothing more than this can reliably be made out from Meyers, </em>and the majority does not establish that this interpretation of section 7 runs counter to the case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">The proof of this is that neither of the \u201ctwo important respects\u201d in which the majority finds the <em>Meyers </em>test \u201cnarrower\u201d than \u201cthe standards traditionally applied by the Board and the courts to define concerted activity,\u201d maj. op. at 954, can be established on the basis of the record and decision in the present case. The majority\u2019s initial claim, that \u201cthe new definition will be strictly construed to include only activity clearly joined in or endorsed by other employees,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 948, <em>see also id. </em>at 954, rests solely on the majority\u2019s reading of the Board\u2019s subsequent decisions in <em>Mannington Mills, Inc., </em>272 N.L.R.B. No. 15, 117 L.R.R.M. 1233 (Sept. 21, 1984), and <em>Allied Erecting &amp; Dismantling Co., </em>270 N.L.R.B. No. 48, 116 L.R.R.M. 1076 (Apr. 30, 1984). <em>See </em>maj. op. at 948-949 &amp; n. 48.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Meyers </em>itself, the only indication given as to the Board\u2019s standard in \u201cendorsement\u201d cases is the Board\u2019s remark that \u201cthere is no evidence here ... that either [Prill or Gove] relied in any measure on the other when each refused to drive the truck.\u201d <em>Meyers </em>'at 17, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1030. That reveals only that <em>no </em>reliance will not constitute authorization \u2014 it does not tell us how much reliance will suffice. Similarly, the principal indication in <em>Meyers </em>as to the scope of the words \u201cwith ... other employees\u201d in the <em>Meyers </em>test is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>Board\u2019s finding that \u201cthere is no evidence here that there was any concerted plan of action between Gove and Prill.\u201d <em>Meyers </em>at 17, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1030.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> From this we can infer that the Board will not find a \u201cconcerted plan of action\u201d where two employees complain about the same piece of equipment on different occasions, even though the second employee was aware of the first employee\u2019s protest. The Board\u2019s use of the words \u201cconcerted plan of action\u201d suggests that some kind of agreement between the two must be established, but it remains unclear how express that agreement must be, for the record is barren of any evidence even suggesting agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">The majority\u2019s willingness to go beyond the confines of the record before us to consider how the <em>Meyers </em>test has been applied by the Board in subsequent cases is highly questionable. We are reviewing an <em>order </em>issued by the Board in <em>this </em>case, not a rule or regulation promulgated after notice-and-comment rulemaking, in which we must necessarily consider how the challenged rule will be applied in whatever cases are likely to arise. If the <em>Meyers </em>test, as applied to petitioner Prill, is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, the order should be sustained. The reasonableness of the <em>Meyers </em>test as applied in subsequent cases can and should be reviewed when the orders in those cases come before a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">Moreover, even if these subsequent decisions could properly be considered here, there is simply no connection between this criticism of the <em>Meyers </em>test and the result reached in this case. The majority concedes that, even if the Board did misinterpret <em>pre-Alleluia </em>case law, remand would be inappropriate if that mistake clearly had no bearing on the substance of the decision reached as to petitioner Prill. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 956. Since there was no evidence that other employees in any way joined in or endorsed petitioner\u2019s conduct, that branch of the majority\u2019s critique cannot possibly affect the outcome here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">The majority\u2019s second objection is that \u201cit is not clear ... that the <em>Meyers </em>standard would protect an individual\u2019s efforts to induce group action.\u201d Maj. op. at 955. The majority notes that the Board declined to reach this question in a <em>post-Meyers </em>case, <em>see id. </em>at 955 n. 83, and proceeds to engage in the highly speculative enterprise of deducing, from the Board\u2019s choice of citations, that the Board will not hold individual efforts to induce group action to be concerted. <em>Id. </em>The majority gives the impression that the <em>Meyers </em>test, whose wording is borrowed from the Ninth Circuit\u2019s language in <em>Pacific Electricord Co. v. NLRB, </em>361 F.2d 310 (1966) (per curiam), represents a conscious choice on the Board\u2019s part to adopt a formulation that no other circuit has followed,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> while rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>the predominant standard, which, according to the majority, is that set out in <em>Mushroom Transportation Co. v. NLRB, </em>330 F.2d 683 (3d Cir.1964). The <em>Mushroom Transportation </em>standard differs from the <em>Meyers </em>test principally in that it explicitly states that \u201ca conversation may constitute a concerted activity although it involves only a speaker and a listener, but to qualify as such, it must appear at the very least that it was engaged in with the object of initiating or inducing or preparing for group action or that it had some relation to group action in the interest of the employees.\u201d 330 F.2d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">The majority has overlooked the Board\u2019s finding that neither Prill\u2019s refusal to drive the truck nor driver Gove\u2019s earlier refusal, to which Prill was an accidental and silent witness, was \u201cintended to enlist the support of other employees,\u201d <em>Meyers </em>at 17,115 L.R.R.M. at 1031. If the majority were right in thinking that the <em>Meyers </em>test eliminates the \u201cinducement\u201d category of cases from the definition of concerted activity, the Board would have had no need to make this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">The majority also slights the Board\u2019s discussion of <em>Root-Carlin, Inc., </em>92 N.L.R.B. 1313 (1951), which the majority cites as one of the leading cases holding that individual attempts to induce concerted activity are themselves concerted. The Board in <em>Meyers </em>relied on <em>Root-Carlin </em>as one of a series of cases it read as \u201cdefin[ing] concerted activity in terms of employee interaction in support of a common goal,\u201d <em>Meyers </em>at 5, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1026 \u2014 cases the Board clearly approved. The Board plainly indicated that, at a minimum, individual efforts to induce group action that <em>\u201cinvolve[J only a speaker and a listener, \u201d id. </em>at 5, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1026 (quoting <em>Root-Carlin, Inc., </em>92 N.L.R.B. at 1314 (emphasis added by the Board in <em>Meyers)), </em>will be treated as concerted when the speaker, an employee, is addressing the listener, another employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">Indeed, any fair reading of the <em>Meyers </em>opinion would treat it as incorporating the <em>Mushroom Transportation </em>standard, at least as applied by the court that framed it. It was precisely because the \u201cinteraction\u201d among employees present in the conversation in <em>Root-Carlin, Inc. </em>was absent in <em>Mushroom Transportation </em>that the court in the latter case found that the individual employee\u2019s conduct was not concerted. It reached that result, despite the fact that the discharged employee \u201chad been in the habit of talking to other employees and advising them as to their rights,\u201d 330 F.2d at 684, because there was no evidence that his \u201ctalks with his fellow employees involved any effort on his or their part to initiate or promote any concerted action to do anything about the various matters as to which [he] advised the men or to do anything about any complaints and grievances which they may have discussed with him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684-85. A finding of no concerted activity in the present case would seem to follow <em>a fortiori </em>from <em>Mushroom Transportation </em>\u2014 for in the present case there was not even a conversation between petitioner and another employee about common grievances, let alone one directed towards concerted activity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>The \u201cinducement\u201d branch of the majority\u2019s critique rests, then, on a misreading of the <em>Meyers </em>opinion. Beyond that, the only way in which this alleged error could possibly affect the outcome in this case would be if the Board could have held that where one employee overhears another employee\u2019s complaint (as Prill did Gove\u2019s), an effort to induce concerted activity on the <em>second </em>employee\u2019s part should be inferred without more. Any such inference would be preposterous, and the majority has not pointed to a single case as so holding, let alone established a clear line of authority to that effect.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, even if the majority\u2019s dubious criticisms of the Board\u2019s reading of the case law in <em>Meyers </em>prove well-founded, they are harmless error that cannot support a remand in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">\u00cdV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">There have been protests in recent years that the \u201cconcerted activity\u201d requirement produces such anomalous results that anything resembling a literal reading of section 7 should be abandoned. <em>See, e.g., </em>Gor-man &amp; Finkin, <em>The Individual and the Requirement of \u201cConcert\u201d Under the National Labor Relations Act, </em>130 U.Pa.L. Rev. 286 (1981); <em>see also Illinois Ruan Transport Corp. v. NLRB, </em>404 F.2d 274, 281 (8th Cir.1968) (Lay, J., dissenting). It is a sufficient response that the choice to require that activity be concerted before it may be protected \u201cis one decided by Congress when it drafted \u00a7 7. It is not a choice that can be undone by the courts for policy reasons.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. NLRB, </em>707 F.2d 1076, 1078 n. 2 (9th Cir.1983). Moreover, as the four dissenting Justices in <em>City Disposal </em>pointed out (without controversion by the majority), \u201c[b]y providing an increased degree of statutory coverage to employees participating in that process, the labor laws encourage and preserve the \u2018practice and procedure of collective bargaining.\u2019 The fact that two employees acting together receive coverage where one acting alone does not is therefore entirely consistent with the labor laws\u2019 emphasis on collective action. <em>See NLRB v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 175, 180, 87 S.Ct. 2001, 2006, 18 L.Ed.2d 1123 (1967); <em>Republic Steel Corp. v. Maddox, </em>379 U.S. 650, 653, 85 S.Ct. 614, 616, 13 . L.Ed.2d 580 (1965).\u201d <em>City Disposal, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1518 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (additional citations omitted). Because what the Board did here was compelled by that congressional choice, I would uphold its order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">. Though the Second Circuit originated the <em>In-terboro </em>doctrine, that court found no inconsistency in rejecting the Board\u2019s later efforts \u2014 of which <em>Alleluia </em>is one example \u2014 to find concerted activity in \"any case in which a cause advanced by an individual would redound to the benefit of his fellow employees.\u201d <em>Ontario Knife Co. v. NLRB, </em>637 F.2d 840, 845 (2d Cir.1980). Writing for the court, Judge Friendly urged that \"except in the context of agreements between an employer and his employees which are themselves the product of concerted activities, as in <em>Interboro </em>[,] \u00a7 7 ... should be read according to its terms.\u201d <em>Id. Interboro </em>cases were treated specially because \"a collective bargaining agreement ... is itself the result of concerted activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That very rationale, of course, is central to the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>City Disposal, see </em>104 S.Ct. at 1511. Hence <em>Ontario Knife </em>tends to confirm the validity of the distinction between the <em>Interboro </em>and <em>Alleluia </em>doctrines drawn by the Board in <em>Meyers, </em>and relied on by the Supreme Court in <em>City Disposal.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">. The majority denies that it is <em>holding </em>that the Board has discretion under section 7 to adopt the <em>Alleluia </em>doctrine. Fair enough. But the majority does not explain how its suggestion, that individual complaints relating to safety statutes are distinguishable from other individual complaints, can be reconciled with the language of section 7 except by reliance on one or both of the rationales the majority identifies as underly<em>ing </em>the <em>Alleluia </em>doctrine. Thus, while not directly endorsing \"the sweeping <em>Alleluia </em>principle,\u201d maj. op. at 953 n. 72, the majority also fails to show that there is a middle ground between <em>Alleluia </em>and the general approach taken by the Board in <em>Meyers </em>which, consistently with the language of section 7, could result in a finding of concerted activity in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">. To be sure, there is one reading of section 7 which purports to be literal and which would ratify the <em>Alleluia </em>doctrine. That reading was suggested in the dissenting opinion in <em>Illinois Ruan Transport Corp. v. NLRB, </em>404 F.2d 274, 281 (8th Cir.1968) (Lay, J., dissenting): \"The words \u2018concerted activity\u2019 are directly related and defined in terms of their intended purpose of \u2018collective bargaining' or other \u2018mutual aid or protection.\u2019 The phrases are interrelated and derive substantive meaning from each other.\" <em>Id. </em>at 288. On this reading, concerted activity may be found to exist \"if there is some reasonable relationship connecting an employee\u2019s conduct with the \u2018mutual aid and protection\u2019 of other employees and such activity is based upon rights collectively recognized within a bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289. In the dissent\u2019s view, <em>Illinois Ruan </em>turned on the validity of the <em>Interboro </em>doctrine, <em>see id. </em>at 283, so Judge Lay was not required to take his interpretation further than he did. Clearly, however, once the meaning of \"concerted activit[y]\u201d is defined in terms of the words that follow it, activity is concerted <em>either </em>if it is \"for the purpose of collective bargaining <em>or </em>other mutual aid or protection.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 (1982) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">This reading is not truly literal, for it makes the word \"concerted\u201d in section 7 utterly superfluous: so long as an individual\u2019s conduct is for the \"mutual aid or protection\" of other employees it will always be deemed concerted. And both the Board in <em>Meyers </em>and the Supreme Court in <em>City Disposal </em>rejected this reading \u2014 the former explicitly, the latter implicitly but no less clearly. <em>See infra </em>p. 961.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">. The Board did deny that \u201csection 7, framed as it was to legitimatize and protect group action engaged in by employees for their mutual aid and protection, was intended to encompass the case of individual activity presented here.\u201d <em>Meyers </em>at 18, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1031. At most, that denial is a claim that the <em>result </em>in this case is compelled by the language and purpose of section 7 \u2014 a claim that indubitably rests on a reasonable interpretation of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">. <em>FCC v. RCA Communications, Inc., </em>346 U.S. 86, 73 S.Ct. 998, 97 L.Ed. 1470 (1953), on which the majority relies in reaching the conclusion that remand is required here, is simply inapposite. <em>RCA Communications </em>holds that when an agen-ey reaches a result in the erroneous belief that the statute compels that result, the court should remand rather than reversing if that result might have been upheld had the agency instead relied on its discretion. Because the Board's discretion in interpreting section 7 is not broad enough to allow the Board to adhere to the <em>Alleluia </em>doctrine, or to hold that Prill\u2019s conduct was concerted on any other theory, there is no basis for remanding this case. Remand would be \"an idle and useless formality. <em>Chenery </em>does not require that we convert judicial review of agency action into a ping-pong game.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>394 U.S. 759, 766 n. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1426, 1430 n. 6, 22 L.Ed.2d 709 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">. In addition, the facts of <em>Ontario Knife Co. v. NLRB, </em>637 F.2d 840 (2d Cir.1980), which the Board cited as support for the <em>Meyers </em>test, rather clearly resemble those in <em>Mannington Milts </em>and <em>Allied Erecting &amp; Dismantling Co. Ontario Knife, </em>which found no concerted activity in an individual employee's refusal to work, despite prior activity (in which the same employee was a participant) that was clearly concerted and related to the same issue involved in the refusal to work, <em>see </em>637 F.2d at 842-43, suggests that at least this degree of strict construction has some authoritative support in the case law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">. What we can, I think, be confident of is that the Board does <em>not </em>mean that if the employer here had offered the keys to Prill\u2019s truck to each of his assembled drivers one day, and each had refused to drive it, the Board would find no concerted activity. Under such circumstances, conscious parallelism would be very strong evidence of spontaneous but quite concerted activity. <em>Cf. NLRB v. Washington Aluminum Co., </em>370 U.S. 9, 82 S.Ct. 1099, 8 L.Ed.2d 298 (1962) (holding a spontaneous walk-out protesting working conditions in a non-union plant concerted protected activity). The Board did say that <em>\"indi-, vidual </em>employee concern, even if openly manifested by several employees on an <em>individual </em>basis, is not sufficient evidence to prove concert of action,\u201d <em>Meyers </em>at 17, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1030, and those words could be taken to mean that even this degree of visible cooperation is not concerted activity. But that remark is dictum\u2014 and it will also bear a different, narrower, and more sensible meaning. I would give it that meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">. The Board borrowed the wording of its non-exhdustive <em>Meyers </em>test from that one-sentence opinion, but it also cited as supporting authority Judge Friendly\u2019s trenchant opinion for the Second Circuit in <em>Ontario Knife Co. v. NLRB, </em>637 F.2d 840 (1980). Judge Friendly recognized the \"inducement\u201d exception to the general rule that only concerted activity comes within section 7, which he traced to the fact that \"\u00a7 7 is not limited to concerted activity per se. Instead, it protects the \u2018right to engage in ... concerted activities.' \u201d <em>Ontario Knife Co., </em>637 F.2d at 844-45. Since workers have the <em>right </em>to engage in concerted activity, Judge Friendly agreed that \"as the Third Circuit recognized in <em>Mushroom Transportation Co. v. NLRB, </em>330 F.2d 683 (3 Cir.1964), employers cannot obstruct an employee's efforts to exercise those rights. Indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>vidual activity can be protected, therefore, if it is \u2018looking toward group action.\u2019 <em>Mushroom Transportation, </em>330 F.2d at 685.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">Judge Friendly\u2019s statutory argument is a powerful one, and it indicates what is wrong with holding the Board to the standard of exactitude the majority demands of the <em>Meyers </em>test. The Board in <em>Meyers </em>focused, quite understandably, on the words \"concerted activities\u201d in section 7, and although it clearly indicated that it would treat at least some \"inducement\u201d cases as involving concerted activity, the majority is right in finding some difficulty in bringing such cases within the literal language of the <em>Meyers </em>test. But we are not to suppose that the Board will set that test in concrete, nor should we rush to assume that in a case in which \u201cthe <em>right </em>to engage in ... concerted activities\u201d is before it, the Board will not adopt the <em>Mushroom Transportation </em>standard on the statutory grounds given by Judge Friendly in <em>Ontario Knife. </em>Here, that issue was not presented, because there was no evidence whatsoever that petitioner\u2019s conduct was \"looking toward group action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1053-12\">. The majority correctly notes that Prill talked \u2022 to other drivers about the defective brakes on his truck, <em>see </em>Tr. at 18, J.A. at 42, but there is no indication that these conversations concerned a common grievance, <em>e.g., </em>a pattern of shoddy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>maintenance by Meyers Industries that had prompted complaints from other drivers about their trucks, or that Prill sought to enlist the aid of other drivers in any way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">. The majority does cite a line of cases including <em>Guernsey-Muskingum Elec. Coop., Inc., </em>124 N.L.R.B. 618 (1959), <em>enforced, </em>285 F.2d 8 (6th Cir.1960), and <em>Hugh H. Wilson Corp., </em>171 N.L. R.B. 1040 (1968), <em>enforced, </em>414 F.2d 1345 (3d Cir.1969), in which the Board treated individual complaints as protected if they related to a matter of moment to other employees and if the individual was acting for the benefit of the interested group. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 945 &amp; n. 24. But the holdings of those cases are little different (and, if anything, narrower) from one of the rationales the majority identifies as underlying the <em>Alleluia </em>doctrine: \"the Board\u2019s familiar view that an individual\u2019s activity should be protected if it relates to a matter of \u2018mutual concern\u2019 to employees.\u201d Maj. op. at 946. That rationale, as I show in Part II-A, reads the word \"concerted\" out of section 7, and finds no support in <em>City Disposal. </em>And, while that rationale may be \"familiar,\u201d it has also repeatedly been rejected by the courts of appeals; even when the courts have enforced the Board\u2019s orders, they have generally done so because they found actual group activity to which the individual employee's conduct was immediately related. <em>See, e.g., Hugh H. Wilson Corp., </em>414 F.2d at 1354 (finding concerted activity because \"[i]n substance, the employees had a gripe. They assembled. They presented their grievance to management____\u201d); <em>Guernsey-Muskingum Elec. Coop., </em>285 F.2d at 12 (finding concerted activity because \"a reasonable inference can be drawn that the men involved considered that they had a grievance and decided, among themselves, that they would take it up with management\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">. The majority\u2019s suggested limitation of the <em>Alleluia </em>presumption of concerted activity to situations where the employee\u2019s conduct is required by laws intended to benefit all employees cannot be linked in any way to the language of section 7, and is therefore completely unpersuasive. The policy considerations that underlie the majority\u2019s suggestions should be addressed to the legislature or to the state courts as expositors of the common law. In this connection it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>is noteworthy that the recent adoption in some states of a \"public policy\" exception to the employment-at-will doctrine would appear to protect employees who find themselves in a predicament such as petitioner\u2019s. <em>See, e.g., Petermann v. International Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>174 Cal. App.2d 184, 344 P.2d 25 (1959); <em>Palmateer v. International Harvester Co., </em>85 Ill.2d 124, 52 Ill.Dec. 13, 421 N.E.2d 876 (1981); <em>Sventko v. The Kroger Co., </em>69 Mich.App. 644, 245 N.W.2d 151 (1976). Indeed, Michigan, where Meyers is located and where Prill was employed, has enacted a statute giving an employee who is discharged for reporting a suspected violation of federal or state law to a public body a cause of action for reinstatement with back pay. Mich. Comp.Laws Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 15.361 to .364 (1981). That whistle-blowing statute, however, did not go into effect until after Prill was discharged, and it is also unclear whether the statute\u2019s definition \u2022 of \"public body\" includes agencies of other states. <em>See </em>Mich.Comp.Laws Ann. \u00a7 15.361(d). Even before adoption of the whistle-blowing statute, there is some reason to think that Prill would have had a cause of action under state common law. <em>See Trombetta v. Detroit, T. &amp; I.R.R., </em>81 Mich.App. 489, 265 N.W.2d 385 (1978) (holding that allegations that an employee was discharged for refusing to falsify pollution control reports required by law to be filed with state agency state a claim for which relief can be granted under Michigan law). But it is not for us or the Board to pre-empt these developments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
