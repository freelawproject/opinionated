RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Because the district court\u2019s ruling was neither a final judgment nor an interlocutory decree reviewable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(3), we dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">Two barge-towing vessels, the M/V ARTIE JAMES and the M/V SETTING SUN, collided in the Inter-coastal Waterway. Hollywood Marine, Inc., owner of the barge in tow of the ARTIE JAMES, sued the ARTIE JAMES, its owner, the SETTING SUN, and its owner. After the original complaint was filed, the Insurance Company of North America (INA), liability carrier for the ARTIE JAMES and its owner, declined coverage under the applicable insurance contract. Hollywood Marine then added INA as a direct defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">The district court divided the trial issues and first considered whether INA\u2019s policy covered any liability the ARTIE JAMES and its owner might face as a result of the collision. It ruled that INA could not deny coverage under its hull policy. INA attempts to appeal this ruling, seeking reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-20\">This court has jurisdiction only of appeals from final decisions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and from such interlocutory orders as are made appealable by statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s ruling was not a final decision against INA because it did not determine INA\u2019s ultimate liability to any party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even in this direct action against the insurer, INA\u2019s ultimate liability awaits a trial court finding that the insured is responsible for the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-21\">INA contends that this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(3): \u201cthe courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from ... [ijnterlocutory decrees of such district courts or the judges thereof determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed.\u201d It cites <em>O\u2019Donnell v. </em>Latham,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in which we held that the district court\u2019s dismissal of an insurance company based upon coverage defenses was appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(3). The dismissal of the insurer in that case, however, \u201csettl[ed] the issue of the insurer\u2019s liability as to both the plaintiff and the principal defendant,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and thus the order was appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(3). Our more recent decision in <em>Offshore Logistics Services v. Mutual Marine </em>Office<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> involved a similar situation. In that case, we held that a district court\u2019s judgment casting an insurer for statutory penalties and attorney\u2019s fees, and its order refusing to amend that judgment, were ap-pealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(3) even though other issues remained in the litigation. We reasoned that \u201c[t]he judgment entered December 15, 1978, and the court\u2019s January 26, 1979 refusal to amend determined that Arkwright-Boston was liable for the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tory penalty and attorney's fees. Thus, both were appealable.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here, unlike the situations in both of those cases, the district court\u2019s order refusing to dismiss the insurer does not conclusively determine its \u201crights and liabilities\u201d as to the claim asserted. The liability of its insured and consequently its own liability remain to be litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">We have stated that \u00a7 1292(a)(3) should be construed narrowly to achieve its original purpose of permitting appeals from orders finally determining one party\u2019s liability to another and referring the action for a computation of damages,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for as Professors Wright, Miller, Cooper and Gressman observe, \u201c[t]here is no apparent reason why admiralty cases as such should be accorded distinctively liberal rules of interlocutory appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">District court rulings rejecting defenses and exceptions have consistently been held not appealable under the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As in the instant case, the party whose contention is rejected remains in the litigation and the issue of its liability on the claim asserted remains to be finally resolved. To permit appeals of such rulings would encourage piecemeal appeals and possible waste of judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Despite our request for special briefs addressed to the jurisdictional question, the parties do not suggest as a basis for appeal the possible effect of the district court\u2019s ruling as determining liability for the costs of defense. We, therefore, express no opinion on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">For these reasons, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction in this court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-13\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AlxK\">. <em>E.g., </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b505-15\">. <em>See, e.g., Brown Shoe Co. v.
