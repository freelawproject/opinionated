This decision was affirmed by the Illinois Supreme Court in <em>People v. One 1979 Pontiac Grand Prix, </em>89 Ill.2d 506, 60 Ill.Dec. 934, 433 N.E.2d 1301 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b190-12\">CUMMINGS, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">On May 27, 1981, plaintiff Lampher, the owner of a seized 1977 Chevrolet, filed this suit against James Zagel, Director of the Illinois Department of Law Enforcement, and Daniel Doyle, State\u2019s Attorney of Winnebago County, Illinois, hereinafter referred to as \u201cdefendants.\u201d In his complaint filed under Sections 1983 and 1985 of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985), plaintiff sought a declaration that Section 4-107(i) of Anti-theft article I of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code (Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 95V2, II4 \u2014 107(i) (1983)) was unconstitutional. This was the statute under which his motor vehicle had been seized by Za-gel\u2019s Department on April 29, 1981. Lam-pher also sought the return of his automobile, damages and attorney\u2019s fees. On June 11th Gerald Richmond petitioned the district court to join the suit as a co-plaintiff and requested similar relief growing out of Zagel\u2019s Department\u2019s seizure of Richmond\u2019s 1978 Ford pickup truck on June 5, 1981. Both seizures were effected under the foregoing provision of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code because the manufacturers\u2019 identification numbers appeared to be altered. Both vehicles were returned to plaintiffs in October 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">On June 17, 1981, at the request of defendants, the district court abstained until a state court action pending in the Circuit Court of Winnebago County was terminated. That action was filed by defendant Doyle on June 16, 1981, in the name of the State of Illinois and sought an order to sell Lampher\u2019s and Richmond\u2019s vehicles under Section 4-107(i) of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code. On June 18 Lampher petitioned to intervene and moved the state court to declare Section 4 \u2014 107(i) unconstitutional, to order the return of his automobile and to dismiss Doyle\u2019s application to sell. Richmond joined in Lampher\u2019s motion on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">On September 15, 1981, the state trial court upheld the constitutionality of Section 4-107(i) and denied intervenors\u2019 motion to dismiss Doyle\u2019s suit. Six days later the circuit court found that Lampher\u2019s vehicle was contraband and permitted Doyle to sell the car. A similar order was subsequently entered as to Richmond\u2019s truck. On September 21, 1981, Lampher filed a motion to vacate the circuit court\u2019s judgment on the ground that on July 31, 1981, the Appellate Court of Illinois ruled that Section 4-107(i) was unconstitutional when applied to <em>bona fide </em>purchasers like plaintiffs. <em>People v. One 1979 Pontiac Grand Prix, </em>98 Ill. App.3d 841, 54 Ill.Dee. 973, 424 N.E.2d 973 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>(3d Dist.1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motion was granted on October 9 and a similar motion by Richmond was granted on October 16. The circuit court ordered the return of plaintiffs\u2019 vehicles. As noted, the vehicles were returned to plaintiffs in October 1981. Thereafter plaintiffs returned to the court below in an endeavor to obtain damages and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">On October 13, 1983, the district court handed down an order holding that defendants were immune from any liability for damages but were liable to plaintiffs for attorney\u2019s fees. In that order District Judge Roszkowski followed the decisions of the Illinois Appellate and Supreme Courts and held that Section 4 \u2014 107(i) was unconstitutional because of substantive due process violations under the Fourteenth Amendment. In holding defendants liable for attorney\u2019s fees, he explained that after the termination of the state trial court proceedings plaintiffs convinced him that the statute in question was unconstitutional. The district court stated that, regardless of the state court proceedings, it \u201cmade its own independent judgment that plaintiffs were denied their constitutional rights.\u201d The order concluded that plaintiffs were therefore entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as prevailing parties in the state and federal actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In a second order, which was filed on December 15, 1983, and allowed attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiffs, Judge Roszkowski reiterated that regardless of the state court proceedings, plaintiffs prevailed in their federal court action based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and he therefore awarded Lampher\u2019s counsel $4,050 and Richmond\u2019s counsel $4,537.50 as reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Defendants have asked us to set aside the awards of attorney\u2019s fees, although defendant Zagel recognizes that a plaintiff in a civil rights action will be considered a \u201cprevailing party\u201d and entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 if he has succeeded on a significant issue achieving some benefit to his client (Zagel Br. 16). Section 1988 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of Sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985 and 1986 * * * of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the court, in its discretion, may allow <em>the prevailing party </em>* * * a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Only defendant Doyle disputes that plaintiffs were prevailing parties within the meaning of Section 1988 (Doyle Br. 3-6; Doyle Reply Br. 2-3), but both defendants advance the following reasons to show \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d why the award of attorney\u2019s fees was unjust. Thus they state (Zagel Br. 19, adopted in Doyle Br. 7):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">1. The state court judge initially found the Illinois statute constitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-13\">2. After the state court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional in view of a decision of the Appellate Court of Illinois, defendants returned the vehicles to plaintiffs with \u201creasonable dispatch.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-14\">3. This was not a class action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-15\">4. Defendants could not amend the Illinois law and \u201cwere simply carrying out the law as it was written.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-16\">5. Defendants exhibited good faith in carrying out their responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-17\">Defendant Doyle is erroneous in stating that \u201cthis change in the law [unconstitutionality of pertinent provision of Illinois Motor Vehicle Act] occurred before the federal lawsuit was heard\u201d (Br. 6). Defendants\u2019 motions to abstain were heard by the district judge on June 17, 1981, and granted the next day, but the Illinois statute was not declared unconstitutional by the state trial court until September 15, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-18\">On April 23, 1982,. a federal magistrate upheld defendants\u2019 contention that they were immune from damages but refused to hold that plaintiffs were not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees (R. Item 33 at 6, 10). His report was adopted by the federal district judge on July 7, 1982 (R. Item 35).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>In the Circuit Court of Winnebago County suit brought by defendant Doyle for the State of Illinois, plaintiffs were permitted to intervene and filed motions and briefs and presented oral arguments attacking the constitutionality of Section 4-107(i) of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Act. After the Circuit Court ruled against them on September 15, 1981, the plaintiffs participated in an evidentiary hearing as to the contraband character and possible sale of their automobiles. Their subsequent motions to vacate the Circuit Court\u2019s adverse rulings in view of <em>People v. One 1979 Pontiac Grand Prix, supra, </em>were resisted by defendants on the ground that the decision of the Appellate Court of Illinois, Third District, was not binding in the Second District in which Winnebago County lies. The state trial judge refused to accept this argument after considering briefs and oral arguments of plaintiffs\u2019 and defendants\u2019 counsel. Defendants concede that from June 19, 1981, when plaintiffs intervened in the state case, they and defendants \u201cwere continuously engaged in litigation before\u201d the state trial judge until October 1981 (R. Item 46 at 4; R. Item 48 at 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">On March 1, 1983, plaintiff Richmond filed a federal court brief arguing why the state statute was unconstitutional, why 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 was violated by defendants and requesting $4,940.50 in damages and $4,350 attorney\u2019s fees. On the next day plaintiff Lampher filed a similar brief seeking $4,075 in damages and $4,050 attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">As noted, on October 13, 1983, the district court held that plaintiffs were entitled under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for the time spent in federal and state court. On October 21, Lampher\u2019s counsel submitted a detailed fee petition showing the expenditure of 54 hours and that $75 per hour was usual and customary, thus entitling him to $4,050. Four days later, Richmond\u2019s counsel submitted a similar petition claiming 60.5 hours at $75 per hour or $4,537.50. Defendants filed objections to the payment of any fees on the ground that plaintiffs did not prevail in federal court and that in any event the court should substantially reduce the fees claimed. However, on December 15, the district judge rejected both arguments and approved the fees sought. In their briefs before us, defendants no longer challenge the amounts of the attorney\u2019s fees awarded but instead.defendant Doyle argues that plaintiffs were not \u201cprevailing parties\u201d within 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988; both defendants additionally argue that \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d invalidate the awards. Nevertheless, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Defendant Zagel seemingly concedes that plaintiffs were prevailing parties because they succeeded \u201con any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing the suit,\u201d quoting from <em>Hensley v. Ecker-hart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40, which in turn was quoting with approval from <em>Nadeau v. He-glemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 278-279 (1st Cir. 1978) (Zagel Br. 16). See <em>Lummi Indian Tribe v. Oltman, </em>720 F.2d 1124, 1125 (9th Cir.1983) (plaintiffs ruled prevailing parties under the \u201cgenerous standard\u201d of <em>Hensley). </em>This federal suit was filed on May 27, 1981, but rather than permitting the district court to determine the constitutionality of \u00a7 4-107(i) of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code, defendant Doyle filed the state court suit on June 16, 1981, and on the following day successfully sought to have the district judge stay his hand until the state trial judge passed on the identical question. This maneuver, of course, forced the plaintiffs to litigate the matter in the Circuit Court of Winnebago County rather than in their chosen forum. After they won that suit, plaintiffs returned to federal court and litigated the constitutional question anew there, persuading Judge Rosz-kowski also to hold the statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The filing of the civil rights action contributed to the relief sought, for it caused defendant Doyle to initiate the state court suit to test the same constitutional ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>tion and then to persuade the federal court to abstain pending the decision of the Circuit Court of Winnebago County. If the state suit had not been filed, the prior federal court suit would have been the forum determining the constitutional question. Moreover, the district judge stated that he was persuaded by plaintiffs to adopt the state court\u2019s construction of Section 4-107(i) rather than slavishly following that decision. In these circumstances, it simply will not do to try to bifurcate the two lawsuits and say the plaintiffs only prevailed in the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><em>New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, </em>447 U.S. 54,100 S.Ct. 2024, 64 L.Ed.2d 723, supports the district judge\u2019s award of these attorney\u2019s fees. There plaintiff Carey was held entitled to attorney\u2019s fees for work done in state administrative and judicial proceedings prior to her federal suit seeking attorney\u2019s fees as \u201cthe prevailing party\u201d under Section 706(k) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k)). Since \u201cthe prevailing party\u201d is also the touchstone of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 which similarly refers to \u201cIn any action or proceeding\u201d (p. 4 supra), under <em>New York Gaslight </em>plaintiffs are entitled to the fees in question. As there explained, both the Title VII fee provision and Section 1988 are \u201clegislation similar in purpose and design * * 447 U.S. at 71 n. 9, 100 S.Ct. at 2034 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">As in <em>Ciechon v. City of Chicago, </em>686 F.2d 511, 525 (7th Cir.1982), and <em>Chrapliwy v. Uniroyal, Inc., </em>670 F.2d 760, 765 (7th Cir.1982), certiorari denied, 461 U.S. 956, 103 S.Ct. 2428, 77 L.Ed.2d 1315, not to provide compensation for counsel here would encourage bypassing state procedures by inhibiting counsel from appearing in state proceedings forced upon federal court litigants by state officials who persuade a federal court to abstain while the same subject matter is being considered in a subsequent state court suit. In the instant suit, if plaintiffs knew they would not be compensated for the hours spent in the case brought in the Circuit Court of Winnebago County, they might well have decided against intervention there.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">At the oral argument, we were urged not to award any fees for services plaintiffs performed in the state court. A similar situation prevailed in <em>Bartholomew v. Watson, </em>665 F.2d 910 (9th Cir.1982), where the defendants persuaded the federal district court to abstain pending the outcome of a state court ruling on a new statute. There the Oregon state court ruled in favor of the state, but thereafter the state defendants adopted a rule giving plaintiffs some of the relief they had sought in their federal cause. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>New York Gaslight Club, supra, </em>and the legislative history of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, the Ninth Circuit permitted attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded to plaintiffs for services performed by their counsel in the Oregon court. In explaining its decision, the court of appeals stated that its result would further cooperation between state and federal courts in the protection of federal constitutional rights and that otherwise serious strains between the state and federal court systems might develop and encourage forum shopping and \u201cinterfere with the efficient allocation of issues and cases between the state and federal systems.\u201d 665 F.2d at 913.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the circumstances in <em>Bartholomew </em>were virtually identical to those before us, the opinion in that case is especially persuasive. Moreover, the First Circuit also allowed attorney\u2019s fees recently on facts similar to this case. In <em>Stathos v. Bowden, </em>728 F.2d 15, 22 (1st Cir.1984), plaintiffs were required to defend a state declaratory judgment action which was brought by federal defendants immediately after they learned of plaintiffs\u2019 federal suit against them. The Court, citing <em>Bartholomew </em>and our <em>Chrapliwy </em>decision, awarded plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees arising from the state court action because defense of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>action \u201cwas a necessary part of plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to achieve their \u00a7 1983 goal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22. We are persuaded by our prior . A , ... . precedent and the reasoning of the First j xr- j.i <em>n- </em>., . ., j- , . . ., and Ninth Circuits that the district court s ... , decision was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"Aez\">Defendant Doyle cites only two cases in his effort to defeat the district court s fee decision: <em>American Constitutional Party v. Munro, </em>650 F.2d 184 (9th Cir.1981), and <em>Bonnes v. Long, </em>599 F.2d 1316, 1318 (4th Cir.1979), certiorari denied, 455 U.S. 961, 102 S.Ct. 1476, 71 L.Ed.2d 681. However, the <em>Bonnes </em>court determined that plaintiffs there could recover attorney\u2019s fees as prevailing parties under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 even though the consent decree benefited both parties because, as here, \u201cenforcement of civil rights legislation can best be achieved by encouraging the public to act as private attorneys general.\u201d The <em>Bonnes </em>test for determining who is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d was satisfied here since these fee claimants obtained a legal position (both in state and federal court) that gained them a benefit and relieved them of a burden. 599 F.2d at 1319. Moreover, their efforts in both tribunals contributed to the favorable outcome in a significant way. <em>Ibid. </em>Under <em>Bonnes </em>these plaintiffs were clearly prevailing part'es-</p>\n<p id=\"A0f\">In the <em>American Constitutional Party </em>case, defendant Doyle\u2019s only other authority, Judge Eugene Wright\u2019s opinion recognized that a plaintiff may recover attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 even if he \u201cdoes not obtain formal relief\u201d or \u201cdoes not prevail on all issues.\u201d 650 F.2d at 187. He also wrote that a plaintiff is entitled to fees if, as here, his \u201clawsuit \u2018acted as a catalyst which prompted the appellee [defendants here] to take action.\u2019 \u201d After pointing out the \u201cgenerous attitude toward the award of fees\u201d mandated by Congress in Section 1988, relief was denied because, unlike the present situation, the plaintiffs before the Ninth Circuit were unable to show any causal relationship between their litigation and a statutory amendment whose genesis had occurred in earlier years. 650 F.2d at 188. Here, as seen, plaintiffs\u2019 efforts in state and federal court did achieve their objective.</p>\n<p id=\"A6r\">,, <em>. </em>, \u201e [2] As an aid to the enforcement of 42 TTOr, R , ,, ,,, TTt!il U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, we hold that 42 U.S.C. \u201e noo , . ,, \u00a7 1988 authorized the assessment of attor- , \u201e . ,,, ney s fees against these defendants to be paid by the State of Illinois regardless of defendants\u2019 personal immunity. <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522.</p>\n<p id=\"ABB\">11</p>\n<p id=\"AgR\">. Both defendants contend that \u201cspecial circumstances preclude the award of attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiffs under the Civil RiShts Act of 1964 This Judicial exception to the recovery of fees by the prevailing Party apparently originated in 1968 in the <em>Per curiam </em>opinion in <em>Newman v. Piggy Enterprises, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263; see <em>Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union, </em>446 U.S. 719, n. 17, 737-738, 100 S.Ct. 1967, n. 17, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"av-dedup-0\">Defendants have relied on five factors (Zagel Br. 19) to show special circumstances here. See <em>supra, </em>p. 101. Perhaps their major emphasis is upon good faith enforcement of Section 4-107(i) of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Act which they considered valid. However, these factors are not special circumstances that would support the denial of these fees. <em>Riddell v. National Democratic Party, </em>624 F.2d 539, 545 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Johnson v. State of Mississippi, </em>606 F.2d 635, 637 (5th Cir. 1979). Even after the Appellate Court of Illinois invalidated the statute, defendants continued to urge its constitutionality and to hold the automobiles for the next two months, hardly a badge of good faith. In any event, as we observed in <em>Harrington v. DeVito, </em>656 F.2d 264, 268 (7th Cir.1981), \u201cthe good faith of the defendant[s] is irrelevant because \u2018the key issue is the provoeative role of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, not the motivation of the defendant\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Nadeau v. Heglemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 280 (1st Cir.1980)) and, as here, \u201cthe defendant must not have acted wholly gratuitously\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>but in response to a plaintiffs claim. 656 F.2d at 266.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">To support their special circumstances concept, plaintiffs rely on three eases: <em>Bonnes v. Long, supra, Chastang v. Flynn &amp; Emrich Co., </em>541 F.2d 1040 (4th Cir.1976), and <em>Bush v. Bays, </em>463 F.Supp. 59 (E.D.Va.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In <em>Bonnes, </em>the Fourth Circuit adhered to its earlier ruling in <em>Chastang </em>that special circumstances barring fee recovery would exist if the discriminatory nature of a profit-sharing and retirement plan were cured by defendants before plaintiffs filed the litigation. 599 F.2d at 1318.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here defendants did not act favorably to plaintiffs until three months after plaintiffs filed their suit causing defendants\u2019 capitulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In <em>Chastang, </em>special circumstances existed for the denial of attorney\u2019s fees because the defendant obviated the discrimination in its retirement plan on December 8, 1970, and plaintiffs\u2019 suits were not filed until June 2, 1971. 541 F.2d at 1045. .</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">In <em>Bush v. Bays, </em>463 F.Supp. 59, 66 (E.D.Va.1978), plaintiffs were denied attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 because they were not prevailing parties. The court added dicta in terms of <em>Chastang </em>finding special circumstances in that unlike the present plaintiffs, the <em>Bush </em>\u201cplaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit was not a contributing factor to any of defendants\u2019 [significant] actions\u201d and unlike Doyle and Zagel the defendants there acted with reasonable dispatch after learning of two adverse decisions. In contrast Doyle and Zagel resisted the adverse decision of the Appellate Court, Third District, in <em>One 1979 Pontiac Grand Prix. </em>The <em>Bush </em>defendants \u201cacted at all times in a manner consistent with their professed desire to distribute the maximum amount of food stamps coupons to every eligible applicant as quickly as possible\u201d (463 F.Supp. at 66-67), while Doyle and Zagel continued to resist plaintiffs until they were unsuccessful in opposing the state trial court\u2019s vacating its first opinion in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Special circumstances favor the plaintiffs, not the defendants. Payment of the attorney\u2019s fees will encourage plaintiffs acting for themselves but also as private attorneys general to advance the public interest in the eradication of this unconstitutional provision of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Act in addition to penalizing litigants who continued to advance constitutional arguments after they were rejected by the Appellate Court of Illinois. Plaintiffs\u2019 victory was in the public interest by eliminating unconstitutional legislation even though this was not a class action. Moreover, our affirmance of the district court\u2019s decision will not hurt individuals of modest means, for payment will admittedly come out of public funds (Zagel Reply Br. 5). In addition, the filing and prosecution of this federal action did contribute to the return of plaintiffs\u2019 automobiles, the very relief sought. In sum, special circumstances here operate to make the award of attorney\u2019s fees just, not unjust as defendants submit.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s December 15, 1983, order assessing attorney\u2019s fees against defendants is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\">.
