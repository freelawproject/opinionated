(Farms) and CWT International (International) are Georgia corporations with their principal places of business in Gainesville, Georgia. Twin Oaks Hatchery, Inc. (Twin Oaks), a domestic poultry producer, organized Farms in 1958 as a sales outlet for its excess broiler chickens for export to the Caribbean and Central and South America. International is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Farms. Farms created International as a commission agent for its export sales to take advantage of the tax savings provided for domestic international sales corporations (DISC). The election to treat International as a DISC was filed on September 7, 1972. Twin Oaks also owns Helen Feed Store, Inc. (Helen Feed).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">During the years in question, 1975, 1976, and 1977, Farms paid International commissions earned by International as a commission agent DISC.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From 1974 to 1976, International made three loans to Farms: each loan was evidenced by a <em>demand </em>promissory note. Although the notes were not identified as \u201cproducer\u2019s loans,\u201d the books and records of International placed each of these loans under the heading \u201cproducer\u2019s loans.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each of the notes was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>renewed within five years of making of the loans, and each renewal note had a fixed, stated maturity date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the renewal notes of December 1, 1979, and September 1, 1981, stated that they were producer\u2019s loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-3\">In determining the maximum statutory amounts that International could lend to Farms as producer\u2019s loans, Farms aggregated its export-related assets with those of Helen Feed and Twin Oaks.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Included in this aggregation was an expenditure of $90,377.44 incurred by Twin Oaks for research and experimental costs connected with its ISA VEDETTE flocks in 1976. Farms did not file written statements electing to aggregate the export related assets of its controlled group with International\u2019s tax returns for the years 1975, 1976, and In November, 1978, however, Farms gave the election statements to the revenue agent examining Farms\u2019s returns. 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">On May 28, 1980, the Commissioner filed a Notice of Deficiency determining that International was not a qualified DISC for the taxable years 1975, 1976, and 1977, because it failed to satisfy the qualified export assets test of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 992(a)(1)(B) (1982).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This determination was based on the findings that International\u2019s loans to Farms were not producer\u2019s loans under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 993(d) (1982), and that the commissions receivable that Farms owed International were not qualified export assets because they were not paid in a timely manner pursuant to Treas. Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 1.993-2(d)(2) and 1.994-l(e)(3)(i).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>As a result of these findings, International was disqualified as a DISC for the taxable years 1975, 1976, and 1977.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Farms and International each filed a petition for rede-termination of deficiencies in federal corporate income taxes in the United States Tax Court. On July 19, 1982, the Tax Court ruled against them, finding that the demand notes, even as renewed, were not producer\u2019s loans. Consequently, International did not qualify as a DISC because 95 percent of its assets were not qualified export assets. The Tax Court, therefore, found it unnecessary to determine whether any of the other requirements for DISC qualification were met. Farms and International, however, filed a motion for reconsideration asking for a determination of whether the commissions receivable due International were qualified export assets. Under the statutes and regulations, International could qualify as a DISC if Farms made a \u201cdeficiency distribution to its shareholders in an amount equal to the fair market value of those assets which are not qualified export assets.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 992(c)(1) (1982). The Tax Court granted the motion for reconsideration and held tht the commissions receivable were not qualified export assets because they were not paid within sixty days after close of the taxable year as required by Treas.Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 1.993-2(d)(2) and 1.994-l(e)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Farms and International appeal. They contend (1) that they complied or substantially complied with the provisions of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 993(d)(1)(B) relating to producer\u2019s loans, and (2) that Treas.Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 1.993-2(d)(2) and 1.994-l(e)(3) are invalid as (a) conditions added to an unambiguous statute, (b) devoid of legislative authority, (c) contradictory of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 992(a)(1)(B), (d) invalidly retroactive, and (e) unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">DOMESTIC INTERNATIONAL SALES CORPORATIONS (DISC)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">Congress enacted DISC legislation in 1971 to provide tax incentives for United States firms to increase their exports.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-11\">This is important not only because of its stimulative effect but also to remove a present disadvantage of U.S. companies engaged in export activities through domestic corporations. Presently, they are treated less favorably than those which manufacture abroad through the use of foreign subsidiary corporations. United States corporations engaging in export activities are taxed currently on their foreign earnings at the full U.S. corporate income tax rate regardless of whether these earnings are kept abroad or repatriated. In contrast, U.S. corporations which produce and sell abroad through foreign subsidiaries generally can postpone payment of U.S. tax on these foreign earnings so long as they are kept abroad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">H.R.Rep. No. 533, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. \u2014, <em>reprinted in </em>1971 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 1825, 1872. A corporation which qualifies as a DISC is not taxable on its profits. Further, the shareholders are only taxable currently on a portion of such profits, the other portion being tax deferred until withdrawn from the DISC or until the corporation ceases to qualify as a DISC. The statutory provisions establishing the DISC scheme are set out at 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 991-997 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">PRODUCER\u2019S LOANS</p>\n<p id=\"b882-14\">Of the five qualifying factors for a DISC, the factor relating to \u201cqualified ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>port assets\u201d is brought into question in this case. The qualified export assets test requires that 95 percent of the adjusted assets of the corporation (the DISC) must be \u201cqualified export assets\u201d for the taxable year. Qualified export assets may include a variety of assets including inventory facilities, accounts receivable, and producer\u2019s loans to the parent corporation. A loan is a producer\u2019s loan, and thus an asset, if it satisfies 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 993(d) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.993-4(a)(4).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Farms and International contend that they have complied with both the statutes and the regulations relating to producer\u2019s loans. They contend that a \u201cstated maturity date not more than 5 years from the date of the loan,\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 993(d)(1)(B), in a demand note is either the date of demand or the date the note is executed, if the loan is paid within five years. They argue that such a reading of the stated maturity date language is consistent with the purpose of the five-year maturity date requirement. This purpose, they argue, is to test the loans to determine whether they are qualified producer\u2019s loans under the borrower\u2019s limitation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 993(d)(2) and under the increased investment limitation of 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 993(d)(3). They further argue that the demand notes in this case comply with the statutory purpose: by renewing the notes within the five-year period, all three notes were subjected to a retesting under the borrower\u2019s limitation and increased investment requirements under the procedures established in Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.993-4(d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Alternatively, Farms and International contend that <em>substantial compliance </em>is the necessary threshold for satisfaction of the DISC requirements; they argue that they have substantially complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>The Tax Court held (1) that when International accepted the demand notes as evidence of its loans to Farms, the loans did not qualify as producer\u2019s loans at the time they were m\u00e1de, (2) the loans could not at renewal be qualified as producer\u2019s loans, and (3), therefore, International was not a qualified DISC. As authority, the Tax Court cites the plain meaning of section 993(d)(1)(B) and the legislative history of the DISC statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The plain meaning of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 993(d)(1) is clear: A loan evidenced by a note must have a stated maturity date of not more than five years from the date of the execution of the loan, and such loan must be designated as a producer\u2019s loan in order to qualify as a producer\u2019s loan and as a qualified export asset. Farms and International\u2019s argument that they have complied with this provision has no factual basis. While the loans made to Farms and International were identified in the books of International as producer\u2019s loans, they neither had a stated maturity date of not more than five years from the date of the loan, nor were they designated as producer\u2019s loans on the face of the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Farms and International argue further, however, that they have substantially complied with the requirements for qualification of producer\u2019s loans. The substantial compliance, they reason, is achieved through execution of the loans consistent with Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the producer\u2019s loans provisions. This purpose, they assert, is to retest the loans every five years to determine whether they satisfy the borrower\u2019s limitations and increased investment limitations as to producer\u2019s loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">While we agree that this is one purpose for enactment of the producer\u2019s loan requirements, an even more important purpose was assuring that the profits of the DISC were used exclusively for export production and were not syphoned off to benefit domestic production. Critics of the DISC proposal were disturbed that DISC funds might be allocated \u201centirely to domestic production or ... entirely to manufacturing activities overseas.\u201d Hearings before the Committee on Finance on the Revenue Act of 1971, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. \u2014 (Part 2) at 733-34 (1971) (Statement of Stanley S. Surrey). <em>See </em>House Hearings Before the Committee on Ways and Means on Tax Proposals Contained in the President\u2019s New Economic Program, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. \u2014 (Part 2) at 507 (1971) (Statement of Rep. Henry S. Reuss). The original conception of producer\u2019s loans allowed \u201cexporting subsidiaries to lend their retained profits to parent corporations without any time limit and few other restrictions.\u201d <em>See also </em>House Hearings Before the Committee on Ways and Means on Tax Proposals Contained in the President\u2019s New Economic Program, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. \u2014 (Part 2) at 634 (1971) (Statement of Ralph Nader). Section 993(d)(1), drafted in such detail, accommodates these criticisms in its imposition of particular formalities in the qualification of producer\u2019s loans. Section 993(d)(1) communicates the purpose of ensuring that DISC income is used for export production: first, loan transactions between the DISC and the parent must show both in form and in fact that the loan is to be used for export production; second, the loan must be paid back within five years; and third, if not paid back, the loan is disqualified retroactively as a producer\u2019s loan or if extended or renewed, the loan must satisfy the formalities of form and substance of producer\u2019s loans at that time.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We hold, therefore, that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>mand notes in question were neither in compliance nor in substantial compliance with 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 993(d)(1). Accordingly, the Tax Court did not err in finding that the loans in question were not qualified export assets, and that International did not qualify as a DISC for the years 1975, 1976, and 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">COMMISSIONS RECEIVABLE</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">\n<em>Validity of Regulations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A98\">Farms and International filed a motion for reconsideration with the Tax Court asking that the value of the non-qualified assets be determined so it could make a \u201cdeficiency distribution\u201d under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 992 in order for International to qualify as a DISC for the taxable years in question.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As a prerequisite to exercise of the option of making a deficiency distribution, the corporation must show that its failure to meet the qualified export receipts and qualified export assets tests and the failure to make such distribution prior to the date on which it was actually made was due to reasonable cause. Further, if the deficiency distribution is made more than nine and one-half months after the end of the taxable year with respect to which it is made, the corporation must pay interest. 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 992(c)(2)(B). While section 992(c) does specify that the distribution must be made after the end of the taxable year, it does not set a time within which the distribution must be made. The Secretary, through promulgation of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.992-3(c)(3), requires that the distribution be made within ninety days \u201cfrom the date of the first written notification to the corporation by the Internal Revenue Service that it had not satisfied ... the 95 percent assets test ... for a taxable year.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The key question before the Tax Court on reconsideration was whether the commissions owed and paid to International by Farms were qualified export assets. To answer this question, we must determine whether Treas.Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 1.993-2(d)(2) and 1.994-l(e)(3) are valid regulations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>The Tax Court found the challenged regulations to be valid. It observed, first, that 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 993(b) does not expressly include commissions receivable in its definition of qualified export assets, yet, the Secretary has provided, through Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.993-2(d)(2), that commissions receivable in certain situations may constitute qualified export assets. Since Farms was a \u201crelated supplier\u201d within the meaning of section 1.994-l(a)(3), the sixty-day rule for payment of commissions receivable applied to the commissions owed International. The commissions were not timely paid. Accordingly, the Tax Court determined that the commissions receivable were not qualified export assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The definition of qualified export assets is found at 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 993(b). That section provides that \u201caccounts receivable\u201d may be qualified export assets if they derive from particular transactions of the DISC. These transactions are identified in 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 993(a)(1) (1982). They include the sale or exchange of export property and of qualified export assets, the lease or rental of export property, provision of services related to any. qualified sale, exchange, lease, rental, etc., provision of engineering or architectural services for construction projects located outside the United States, and the provision of managerial services in the furtherance of other qualified export receipts of the DISC. This section does not identify the acts of a commission agent as a \u201ctransaction of such corporation.\u201d The only mention of commissions within section 993 is found at subsection (f): \u201cIn the case of commissions on the sale, lease, or rental of property, the amount taken into account for purposes of this part as gross receipts shall be the gross receipts on the sale, lease, or rental of the property on which such commissions arose.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 993(f) (1982). The only other relevant mention of commissions is found in 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 994(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This section specifically authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations concerning the price due to be paid by the DISC or received by the DISC in cases of commissions, rentals, or sales of export property derived from transactions between a DISC and a related person. In light of the mentioning of commissions in section 993(f) and in section 994(b), the Tax Court determined that at best the reference in section 993(b)(3) to accounts receivable deriving from transactions of such corporation did not clearly include or exclude commissions receivable as accounts receivable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Sn\">In other words, section 993(b)(3) provides qualified asset treatment for a DISC\u2019S accounts receivable arising out of transactions (e.g., sales) \u2018of such corporation\u2019; a DISC which functions as a commission agent has no sales. In using the term \u2018accounts receivable\u2019 in section 993(b)(3), Congress may have intended to include only those accounts receivable owed to the DISC for sales <em>it </em>made, or owed to the principal, but purchased and held by the DISC, for sales made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>principal where the DISC functioned solely as commission agent. Such interpretation is suggested by the House and Senate committee explanations of section 993(b)(3):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-4\">The types of assets classified as qualified export assets are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-6\">(3) accounts receivable * * * of the corporation <em>{or if the corporation acts as agent, the principal) </em>held by the corporation which arose in connection with qualified export sale * * * transactions * * * [H.Rept. 92-533 (1971), 1972-1 C.B. 498, 533; S.Rept. 92-437 (1971), 1972-1 C.B. 559, 614 [emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-7\">In short, the express reference to commissions in section 993(f) and 994(b) reveals that Congress certainly had in mind that commission arrangements might be used in sales involving DISCs, but it is not at all clear that the reference to accounts receivable in section 993(b)(3) was intended to include commissions receivable owed by a production company to a related DISC acting as selling agent____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-8\">[As] the extent to which Congress intended commissions receivable owed by the producer to the related DISC to constitute qualified export assets is unclear ... the challenged regulation can in no way be said to contradict or limit the \u2018unambiguous\u2019 language of section 993(b)(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">79 T.C. 1054 at 1063-1064. Since section 993(b)(3) was ambiguous, the Tax Court correctly sought to determine whether the challenged regulation is consistent with the statutes\u2019 origin and purpose. <em>United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co., </em>455 U.S. 16, 102 S.Ct. 821, 70 L.Ed.2d 792 (1982). The Tax Court understood that a major purpose of the DISC legislation was to guarantee that loans from a DISC to a producer are used to encourage exporting. The Tax Court reasoned that if the producer is not required to pay the commissions within a particular period of time, that producer would have an unlimited use of the tax-deferred DISC income.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-12\">In the absence of the challenged regulation, the receivable representing the debt would be a qualified asset. Thus, the DISC could achieve qualified asset treatment of a \u2018loan\u2019 which was not subject to the producer\u2019s loan limitation. The DISC could meet the 95-percent assets test even though its tax deferred profits were not applied solely to export activities. Such result contradicts the purpose for which the DISC legislation was enacted</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-13\">If \u2018accounts receivable\u2019 include only the obligations of unrelated third parties, there was no reason to be concerned about disguised loans, but if such receivables included obligations of a related producer, there existed the possibility that for their own reasons, they might postpone indefinitely the payment of such a receivable and thereby frustrate the producer loan limitations. In light of the potential for frustration of a clear congressional purpose, we cannot hold that the challenged regulation is unreasonable or out of harmony with the origin and purpose of the DISC provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az5\">79 T.C. at 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">Farms and International argue that section 993(b)(3) is not ambiguous, and therefore, \u201cthe regulations [section 1.993-2(d)(2) and section 1.994-l(e)(3) ] add a condition to the statutory requirements and are invalid.\u201d <em>Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. United States, </em>589 F.2d 1040, 218 Ct.Cl. 517 (1978). Farms and International contend that the only qualification of which receivables are to be considered \u201caccounts receivable\u201d is whether they arise from transactions identified in section 993(a), defining gross receipts. They reason that since section 993(f) also defines gross receipts, and since that section identifies commissions as a gross receipt, then section 993(f) qualified section 993(a). Commissions receivable, therefore, are accounts receivable because they fall under \u201ctransactions of such corporation\u201d under section 993(b) as defined by section 993(a) and (f). Because the statute does not place a limit on the types of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>counts receivable which qualify, and the regulations do, the regulations are contrary to the statute and are invalid. Farms and International rely heavily on the recent case of <em>Thomas International Ltd. v. United States, </em>6 Cl.Ct. 414 (1984), to support their argument that the regulations were invalid. <em>Thomas International, </em>however, is not wholly applicable to the validity issue because the Claims Court conceded that \u201cit is unnecessary to decide at this time whether section 1.994-l(e)(3) is valid.\u201d <em>Thomas International, </em>6 Cl.Ct. at 421. Rather, the court held that \u201cadoption of the portion of that regulation dealing with commissions, to disqualify a corporation as a DISC under the section 992 test, is in itself unauthorized.\u201d <em>Thomas International </em>at 421. It is on the question of the authority for the regulations that <em>Thomas International </em>has relevance and where we must begin our determination as to the ultimate validity of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Our review of the question of validity of the regulations must have as a preliminary task the identification of the kind of regulation involved, thus, identifying the source of the regulation\u2019s authority.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-5\">[T]he current trend in tax cases appears to be shifting towards more careful scrutiny of IRS regulations. <em>See U.S. v. Vogel Fertilizer Co., </em>455 U.S. 16, 24-26, 102 S.Ct. 821, 827-28, 70 L.Ed.2d 792 (1982) (invalidating Treasury Regulation that did not \u2018harmonize\u2019 with the \u2018origin and purpose\u2019 of the enabling act); <em>Rowan Cos. v. U.S., </em>452 U.S. 247, 252-53, 101 S.Ct. 2288, 2292, 68 L.Ed.2d 814 (1981) (invalidating Treasury Regulation that failed to construe the term \u2018wages\u2019 in \u2018consistent and reasonable manner'); <em>U.S. v.

United States, </em>652 F.2d 675, 678 n. 7 (6th Cir. 1981). <em>See United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co., </em>455 U.S. 16, 24, 102 S.Ct. 821, 827, 70 L.Ed.2d 792 (1982); <em>National Muffler Dealers Association v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 472, 99 S.Ct. 1304, 59 L.Ed.2d 519 (1979). Our first question, therefore, is whether the challenged regulations are supported by the specific authority of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 994(b)(1) or by the general authority of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7805(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">The Tax Court avoided the issue by reasoning that even if not supported by the specific authority of section 994(b), the regulations are supported by the general grant of authority in section 7805. 79 T.C. at 1066-1067. Farms and International argue that the only statutory authority for the challenged regulations is section 7805. They contend that section 994\u2019s grant of specific authority is limited to the promulgation of regulations \u201cconsistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>rules ... in subsection (a) for the application of <em>this </em>section [994].\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 994(b)(1) (emphasis added). From their view, \u201chad Congress intended this grant to apply to all transactions between related parties ... it would have provided for rules for the application of \u2018this part,\u2019 not \u2018this section.\u2019 \u201d The Commissioner argues that the specific authority of section 994 applies <em>ia </em>the remaining DISC sections because each section has meaning only when read in the context of the whole DISC legislation. The Commissioner understands that this position is consistent with both the House and Senate reports on the DISC egis a ion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ans-dedup-1\">The bill also provides that the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulations intercompany pricing rules, consistent with those provided by the bill m the case of export transactions where the DISC does not take title to the property, but instead acts as commission agent for the sale, or is a lessee of the property which it then subleases to its customers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyU\">H.R.Rep. No. 533, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. , <em>reprinted in </em>1971 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 1888; S.Rep. No. 437, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. \u2014, <em>reprinted in </em>1971 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"a9o-dedup-0\">It is far too apparent, as might have been conceded by the Tax Court, that the Secretary of the Treasury promulgated the challenged regulations under his general authority to \u201cprescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of this title.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7805(a). Section 994(b), by its terms, is a grant of authority to prescribe rules limited to that section, That this is the intent of Congress is made even more clear by the Commissioner\u2019s citing of the House and Senate reports which iterate that the bounds of this specific grant of authority is section 994. Accordingly, the challenged regulations are not legislative, but interpretive.</p>\n<p id=\"AFMY\">The standard of review of the validity of an interpretive regulation is whether the regulation \u201charmonizes with the statutes \u2018origin and purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co., </em>455 U.S. 16, 26, 102 S.Ct. 821, 828, 70 L.Ed.2d 792 (1982); Na<em>tional Muffler Dealers Association v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 472, 477, 99 S.Ct. 1304, 1307, 59 L.Ed.2d 519 (1979). The challenged regulations, therefore, must be in harmony with the purpose of the overall DISC legislation, sections 991-997, not just that of section 994 as Farms and International have argued. <em>See U.S. v. Vogel Fertilizer, </em>455 U.S. 16, 102 S.Ct. 821, 70 L.Ed.2d 792 (1982); <em>Long v. United States, </em>652 F.2d 675 (6th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"AqCg\">Ag identified under the discussion 0f ducer&gt;s loans&gt; the pUrpoSe of the DISC provisions was to give tax breaks to domestic producers when and for only so long as the \u00a1ncome produced under this tax benefit program is used for export production and not for domestic purposes. The Claims Court \u00a1n <em>Thomas Internationai </em>impiieS) if not suggestej that a principai purpose of ^ DIgc legislation was to provide for commission DISCs and to give them a sub. stantial degree of protection. Taking the yiew ^ &amp; commission DISC subjeet to the challenged regulations would have substantia,l problems qualifying as a DISC under the qualified export test, the court reaSoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"az9-dedup-0\">To avojd diSqUalifiCation of commission DISCs, \u2018accounts receivable ... which arise by reason of transaction of such corporation (the DISC)\u2019 must necessarily be understood to include sales in which the DISC is assigned by the producer the role of commission agent rather than reseller.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aux-dedup-0\"><em>Thomas International </em>at 419. There is no question that Congress contemplated that a \u00bfjgc may function as a commission agent certain circumstances. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 993(f) and 994(h). No where in the statutory scheme, however, does any evidence ex\u00a1S\u00a3 that Congress intended Commission f)iSQs to assume a preferred position over buy-sell DISCs. Indeed, given the ambiguity inherent in the scant references to commission DISCs in section 993(f) and in seetion 994(b), it is quite reasonable to con-elude that the plight of commission DISCs was, at best, of secondary importance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>the drafters of the DISC legislation. Further, the major purpose of the DISC statutory scheme is to assure that the income generated by the DISC goes to export production. As the Commissioner argues, to invalidate the challenged regulations, which do no more than set a due date for the payment of commissions receivable, would run counter to the purpose of regulating the interest-free loans that the DISC is able to make to a related person. Accordingly, we hold that Treas.Reg. 1.993-2(d)(2) and 1.994-l(e)(3) are harmonious with the origin and purpose of the DISC legislation. The challenged regulations, therefore, are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">\n<em>Retroactive Application of Regulations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AIS9\">Farms and International argue that the sixty-day rule is invalid as applied to them retroactively. The scenario on which this claim is based was amply described by the Tax Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-5\">The DISC provisions (sections 991-997) were contained in the Revenue Act of 1971, Pub.L. 92-178, 85 Stat. 535. A corporation could qualify as a DISC for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1971. Sec. 507, Rev. Act of 1971, <em>supra, </em>85 Stat. 553. In January 1972, the Treasury published \u2018DISC \u2014 A Handbook for Exporters\u2019 (Handbook) containing a \u2018plain language\u2019 explanation of the law pertaining to DISCs. The Handbook provided that accounts receivable which arose in connection with the DISC\u2019S qualified export sale transactions were qualified export assets whether the DISC acted as principal or agent. The Handbook did not expressly refer to commissions receivable. <em>The IRS promised that it would follow the rules explained in the Handbook until such rules were modified \u2018in regulations or other Treasury publications. \u2019 The Handbook provided that any such modifications adverse to taxpayers would be applied only prospectively. </em>On September 21, 1972, the Commissioner proposed section 1.994-1(e)(3), Income Tax Regs., 37 Fed.Reg. 19625, 19627-19628, and on October 4, 1972, the Commissioner proposed section 1.993- 2(d)(2), Income Tax Regs., 37 Fed. Reg. 20853, 20858. These proposed regulations were the first pronouncements concerning the treatment of commissions receivable, and they both contained the 60-day payment rule. Proposed section 1.994- l(e)(3) was finally adopted on September 29, 1976 (T.D. 7435, 1976-2 C.B. 238) and contained the 60-day rule; proposed section 1.993-2(d)(2) was finally adopted on October 14, 1977 (T.D. 7514, 1977-2 C.B. 266), and incorporated the 60-day rule by reference to section 1.994-1(e)(3). <em>Section 1.993-2(d)(2), Income Tax Regs., was made applicable to taxable years ending after December 31, 1971.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">79 T.C. at 1067-1068 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">Internal Revenue Regulations are presumed to have retroactive effect. <em>Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>562 F.2d 972 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 944, 98 S.Ct. 2845, 56 L.Ed.2d 785 (1978). <em>See </em>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7805(b) (1967). Under section 7805(b), the Secretary of the Treasury has broad discretion to limit the retroactive application of Treasury rulings and regulations. \u201cThe decision to make a ruling or regulation retroactive will stand unless it constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Wendland v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>739 F.2d 580, 581 (11th Cir.1984) (citing <em>Automobile Club of Michigan v. Commissioner, </em>353 U.S. 180, 184, 77 S.Ct. 707, 710, 1 L.Ed.2d,746 (1957)). An abuse of discretion may be found where the retroactive regulation alters settled pri- or law or policy upon which the taxpayer justifiably relied and if the change causes the taxpayer to suffer inordinate harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">Farms and International' argue that an abuse of discretion occurred because the Commissioner made an explicit promise in the Handbook that (1) the Internal Revenue Service would follow the rules and procedures set forth in the Handbook until those rules and procedures are \u201cmodified\u201d by \u201cregulations or other Treasury publications\u201d; and (2) that any adverse modifications would be applied only prospectively. They argue that they justifiably relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>the Handbook since the proposed regulations issued in 1972 were not \u201cmodifications\u201d of the Handbook, and, even if they were, according to the promise of the Handbook, they should be applied only prospectively. Farms and International rely on the recent case of <em>Lecroy Research Systems Corp. v. Commissioner, </em>751 F.2d 123 (2d Cir.1984) (Lecroy).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The Second Circuit, in <em>Lecroy, </em>found that the Commissioner committed an abuse of discretion in applying the identical regulations challenged here retroactively because that court found the promise in the Handbook to be binding. The court noted that \u201cretroactive application is permissible even where the regulation contradicts a previous Treasury publication such as the Handbook,\u201d but observed that \u201cthe Handbook\u2019s assurances were deliberately unusual in purporting to offer safety in the <em>status quo </em>and were obviously prompted by the need to render the incentives Congress intended to create operable as soon as possible.\u201d <em>Lecroy </em>at 126, 127. The Second Circuit announced and applied the rule that \u201cabsent this assurance of prospectivity to taxpayers ... the regulation in question could clearly have been imposed retroactively.\u201d <em>Lecroy </em>at 126. As authority, the court cites the former Fifth Circuit case of <em>Carpenter v. United States, </em>495 F.2d 175, 184 (5th Cir.1974). <em>Carpenter, </em>in fact, contradicts this proposition. In <em>Carpenter, </em>a petroleum engineer who had been working in the Middle East for ten years brought a suit for redetermination of a tax deficiency for that period under a statute permitting a bona fide resident of a foreign country for a particular tax year to exclude from income amounts earned from non-United States sources during that period of absence. The taxpayer argued that he maintained his status as a \u201cforeign resident\u201d during the taxable year in question by following the prescriptions of a Treasury Department publication. The former Fifth Circuit held that the taxpayer\u2019s reliance was misplaced.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-6\">We do not fault the Treasury Department for trying to provide guidelines for taxpayers confronted with the bewildering maze of our tax laws, and we sympathize with the taxpayer who in fact relies upon what he accepts as an authoritative interpretation of the laws and of the Treasury publication. But nonetheless it is for the Congress and the courts and not the Treasury to declare the law applicable to a given situation. As the Ninth Circuit has observed: \u2018Nor can an interpretation by taxpayers of the language used in government pamphlets act as an estoppel against the government nor change the meaning of taxing statutes ____\u2019 <em>Adler v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>9 Cir.1964, 330 F.2d 91, 93.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9nu\"><em>Carpenter v. United States, </em>495 F.2d at 184. It is settled law that Treasury publications such as the Handbook, which purport to provide a general explanation of the revenue laws, are simply guidelines for taxpayers and do not bind the Commissioner in subsequent litigation. <em>Carpenter v. United States, </em>495 F.2d 184. <em>See also United States v. New York Telephone Co., </em>644 F.2d 953, 959 n. 10 (2d Cir.1981).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-8\">It is unfortunately all too common for government manuals, handbooks, and in-house publications to contain statements that were not meant or are not wholly reliable. If they go counter to governing statutes and regulations of the highest or higher dignity, e.g. regulations published in the Federal Register, they do not bind the government, and persons relying on them do so at their peril. <em>Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. United States, </em>589 F.2d 1040,1043, 218 Ct.Cl. 517 (1978) <em>(A Handbook for Exporters, </em>a Treasury publication). <em>Dunphy v. United States </em>[529 F.2d 532, 208 Ct.Cl. 986 (1975)], <em>supra </em>(Navy publication entitled <em>All Hands). </em>In such cases it is necessary to examine any informal publication to see if it was really written to fasten legal consequences on the government. <em>Dunphy, supra.

United States, </em>740 F.2d 526, 532 n. 3 (7th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>Fiorentino v.

First, Farms and International did not justifiably rely on the Handbook. Taxpayers who rely on Treasury publications, which are mere guidelines, do so at their peril. <em>Caterpillar Tractor v. United States, </em>589 F.2d 1040, 1043, 218 Ct.Cl. 517 (1978). Further, the Treasury\u2019s position on the sixty-day rule was made public through proposed section 1.993-2(d)(2) in 1972, before the taxable years at issue. <em>Charbonnet v. United States, </em>455 F.2d 1195, 1199-1200 (5th Cir. 1972). <em>See also Wendland v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>739 F.2d 580, 581 (11th Cir.1984). Second, whatever harm has been suffered by Farms and International resulted from a lack of prudence. As even the <em>Lecroy </em>court has recognized, \u201csafety lies in complying with proposed regulations.\u201d <em>Lecroy </em>at 127. <em>See also </em>79 T.C. at 1069. \u201cThus, taxpayers knowingly engaged in ... questionable transaction^), the legitimacy of which depended upon ... invalidation of proposed regulations. \u25a0 Under such circumstances, the Commissioner cannot be said to have abused his discretion in giving the [regulation] retroactive effect.\u201d <em>Wendland, </em>739 F.2d at 582. Finally, the challenged regulations did not \u201calter settled prior law.\u201d Absent the adoption of the challenged regulations, the treatment of commissions receivable was not settled law. In light of the lack of any definitive treatment of commissions receivable, Farms and International had no \u201cvested interest in a hypothetical decision in ... [their] favor prior to the advent of the regulations.\u201d <em>Helvering v. Reynolds, </em>313 U.S. 428, 433, 61 S.Ct. 971, 974, 85 L.Ed. 1438 (1941); <em>Chock Full O\u2019 Nuts Corp. v. United States, </em>453 F.2d 300, 303 (2d Cir.1971). We find, -therefore, that the Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in applying retroactively Treas.Reg. 1.993-2(d)(2) and 1.994-l(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">We conclude that the loans made by International to Farms were not producer\u2019s loans either at the time of their execution or at renewal, that the commissions receivable were not qualified export assets when untimely paid, and that the Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in applying retroactively the challenged regulations. We hold, therefore, that International did not qualify as a DISC for the taxable years 1975, 1976, and 1977.

Accordingly, a loan which does not have a stated maturity date or which has a stated maturity date more than 5 years from the date such loan is made can never meet the 5-year requirement of this subparagraph. Thus, for example, even if there is a period of less than 5 years remaining to the stated maturity date of a loan, the loan can never be a producer\u2019s loan if it had a stated maturity date more than 5 years from the date it was made. For a further example, if a loan having a period remaining to maturity of 2 years is extended for a further period of 3 years (making a total of 5 years to maturity from the date of the extension), the extension of the loan would under subparagraph (2)(v) of this paragraph constitute the making of a new producer\u2019s loan and the original producer\u2019s loan would terminate. If, however, a loan having a period remaining to maturity of 2 years is extended for a further period of 4 years (making a total of 6 years to maturity from the date of the extension), the original producer\u2019s loan will terminate and the new loan will not be a producer\u2019s loan. If a producer\u2019s loan is not paid in full at its maturity date and is not formally refinanced, renewed, or extended, such loan shall be deemed to be a new loan which does not have a stated maturity date and, thus, will not be a producer\u2019s loan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b883-10\">.
