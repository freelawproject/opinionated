Davis petitions for review of the Railroad Retirement Board\u2019s decision denying him disability benefits under \u00a7 2(a)(l)(iv) of the Railroad Retirement Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(a)(l)(iv). Davis served more than twenty years as a railroad switchman. He lost his job with the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad in March 1980 when that company went bankrupt. Thereafter he unsuccessfully attempted to obtain work as a switchman with other railroads; at least one rejected him because of his impaired hearing. He then applied for disability insurance benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act. After the Bureau of Retirement Claims turned down his request, he obtained an evidentiary hearing before an appeals referee, who agreed that he was not eligible to receive a disability annuity. In a two to one decision the Railroad Retirement Board denied his appeal, the majority affirming on the basis of the appeals referee\u2019s decision. The appeal to us was submitted on the briefs by agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-18\">The factual issue before the appeals referee was whether Davis had a permanent physical condition disabling him from working in his \u201cregular occupation\u201d as a switch-man. Although one physician examined Davis for an arthritic condition, the focus of the hearing, and of Davis\u2019 appeal to this court, was on his hearing disability. The Railroad Retirement Board\u2019s disability standards for hearing require either total deafness in both ears or total deafness in one ear without a hearing aid and hearing of 16/20 in the other ear. <em>See </em>Provisional Occupational Disability Rating Schedule, U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, at 5. In denying the benefits the appeals referee relied upon the two medical reports in the record concerning Davis\u2019 hearing. One was by K.L. Peacher, M.D., who stated that petitioner suffered from a \u201cmoderately severe\u201d hearing loss. Dr. Peacher submitted a letter stating that if Davis had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>taken the routine periodic physical examination for the Rock Island, which was due at approximately the time the railroad ceased operations, the railroad \u201cmay\u201d have disqualified him from further work as a switchman because of his hearing problem. A subsequent examination by ear specialist Kenneth A. Rogers, M.D., revealed a 37% hearing loss in the right ear and a 33% loss in the left ear. His binaural impairment was approximately 34%. Although the referee\u2019s opinion referred only to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.9 and 208.11 and not to the particularized hearing impairment standard in the Provisional Occupational Disability Rating Schedule, both the referee and the Board denied that Davis\u2019 hearing impairment disabled him.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">On appeal Davis, complains that the Board has failed to follow Congress\u2019 directive to establish uniform standards, consistent with those of the railroads, for purposes of determining disability. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(a)(2) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApUe\">\u201cthe Board, with the cooperation of employers and employees, shall secure the establishment of standards determining the physical and mental conditions which permanently disqualify employees for work in the several occupations in the railroad industry, and the Board, employers, and employees shall cooperate in the promotion of the greatest practicable degree of uniformity in the standards applied by the several employers. An individual\u2019s condition shall be deemed to be disabling for work in his regular occupation if he will have been disqualified by his employer for service in his regular occupation in accordance with the applicable standards so established; if the employee will not have been so disqualified by his employer, the Board shall determine whether his condition is disabling for work in his regular occupation in accordance with the standards generally established; and, if the employee\u2019s regular occupation is not one with respect to which standards will have been established, the standards relating to a reasonably comparable occupation shall be used.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The Board appears to acknowledge that Davis retains a current connection with the railroad industry and that he has completed twenty years of service. Consequently, he need only establish disability for work in his regular occupation in the railroad industry; the law does not require a showing of an inability to engage in any regular employment. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(a)(l)(iv). Although Davis\u2019 impaired hearing condition did not meet the Board\u2019s disability standards, at least one railroad characterized his hearing loss as too severe to hire Davis as a railroad switchman.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, the differing standards for disability and employment cast Davis into a legal limbo \u2014 he cannot qualify for disability yet neither can he find employment in the industry because of his hearing impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(a)(2) mandates uniform disability standards between the Board and the railroad industry for workers currently employed. Although it does not address specifically the problem of laid-off or former employees attempting to gain reemployment, we believe the thrust of this provision and its legislative history demonstrate Congress\u2019 desire to accommodate individuals such as Davis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board may not ignore Congress\u2019 clearly expressed in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>tent that it apply disability standards consistent with those of private industry. The Board\u2019s current regulations appear to tolerate a discrepancy between Board and industry determinations of disability in an employee\u2019s regular occupation. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Davis has presented sufficient evidence to infer that the Board applies different disability standards than the industry. He has presented evidence that one railroad refused to hire him for his regular occupation because of his hearing disability. Additionally, Dr. Peacher\u2019s statement that Davis \u201cmay\u201d not have passed his yearly physical had his employer remained solvent, although equivocal, suggests that the Rock Island Railroad applied less stringent hearing disability requirements than the Board\u2019s requirements of complete deafness in one ear with substantial impairment in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The appeals referee\u2019s decision did not consider the apparent discrepancy between the Board\u2019s standards and the statute. Indeed, the referee may not consider such a legal question, but must apply the regulation. <em>See School Board v. Department of Health, Education &amp; Welfare, </em>525 F.2d 900, 908 (5th Cir.1976). The Board\u2019s opinion also did not treat the point, but merely adopted the referee\u2019s decision as its own. The only possibly relevant comment in the opinions is the referee\u2019s statement that \u201cpre-employment hiring practices are frequently much more rigid and exacting than practices or standards allowing a 20 year employee to stay on a job.\u201d R. I, 11. That is not a justification, but only an observation. We believe the Board is obligated to explain why its standards are more stringent than those applied by the railroad industry in hiring or retaining employees with over twenty years of experience. We reverse the Board\u2019s determination denying Davis disability benefits and remand to the Board for further proceedings. On remand we expect the Board (1) to demonstrate that it is applying the railroad industry\u2019s prevailing standards to disability determinations in this case, or (2) to show that Davis\u2019 impairment is not disabling under railroad industry standards, or (3) to grant Davis a disability annuity because of his hearing impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-5\">. Railroad Retirement Board member Chamberlain, who dissented from the Board\u2019s decision to deny Davis benefits, emphasized that the duties of a switchman require good hearing in order to hear moving cars and engines. \u201cThe inability to hear their approach could produce a life-threatening situation. The MKT [Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad] recognized this in their disqualification of Mr. Davis in their employment physical.\u201d R. I, 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b828-9\">. The legislative history to 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(a)(l)(iv) highlights Congress\u2019 desire to confer special treatment on railroad workers with long service in the industry. \"Men who have had long service in specialized occupations and then become disabled for work in those occupations are in every practical sense retired; yet under present law they must often eke an existence in destitution for years until they become eligible for an age-retirement annuity.\u201d S.Rep.
