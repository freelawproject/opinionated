The district court found the provisions of the ordinance regulating the distribution of \u201cindecent material\u201d constitutionally over-broad. Additionally, the district judge held that the ordinance \u201cviolate[s] the notion of fairness implicit in one\u2019s right to due process of law.\u201d <em>Cruz v. Ferre, </em>571 F.Supp. 125, 126 (S.D.Fla.1983). We affirm on both first amendment and due process grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-21\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-22\">City of Miami Ordinance No. 9223, adopted on October 19, 1981, sets forth the overall system for regulating cable television in the City of Miami. On November 19, 1981, the city enacted Ordinance No. 9332, granting Miami Cablevision (\u201cCablev-ision\u201d), a joint venture of Americable of Greater Miami, Inc., and Miami Telecommunications, Inc., a nonexclusive, revocable license to operate a cable television system in Miami.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-23\">On January 13, 1983, the city enacted a third cable ordinance, Ordinance No. 9538. This ordinance, which is the subject of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>lawsuit, is intended to regulate \u201cindecent\u201d and \u201cobscene\u201d material on cable television. The relevant portions of this ordinance provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1497-5\"><em>Section 1. </em>No person shall by means of a cable television system knowingly distribute by wire or cable any obscene or indecent material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1497-6\"><em>Section 2. </em>The following words have the following meanings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1497-7\">(f) The test of whether or not material is \u201cobscene\u201d is: (i) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (ii) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (iii) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1497-8\">(g) \u201cIndecent material\u201d means material which is a representation or description of a human sexual or excretory organ or function which the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find to be patently offensive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1497-9\">Additionally, section 3 of the ordinance provides procedures for complaints alleging violations of the ordinance to be brought. The city manager is to receive all complaints of alleged violations. Ordinance No. 9538, sec. 3(a). Furthermore, the city manager is empowered to initiate such claims himself. <em>Id. </em>All complaints, whether received or initiated by the city manager, are to be reviewed by him to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a violation has been committed. <em>Id. </em>sec. 3(b). If the city manager determines that such probable cause exists, he must give written notice of the alleged violation to the licensee. The notice must specify the nature of the alleged violation and the date, time, and place of the hearing to be conducted by the city manager. <em>Id. </em>sec. 3(c). At the hearing, which is to be \u201cinformal,\u201d the licensee may be represented by counsel and may present evidence and cross-examine witnesses; the proceedings are to be transcribed by a court reporter. <em>Id. </em>sec. 3(d). The city manager presides over the hearing and governs the admissibility of evidence. <em>Id. </em>sec. 3(e). The burden of proof (a preponderance of the evidence) is on the city, which is represented by the city attorney or his designee. <em>Id. </em>sec. 3(f). Within ten days after the conclusion of the hearing, the city manager is to make his written findings and decision, including the nature and extent of any sanctions imposed and the reasons therefore. <em>Id. </em>sec. 3(h). The only sanctions provided in the ordinance are suspension of the license for a period of time not to exceed nine days, or termination of the license. <em>Id. </em>sec. 3(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-11\">This action for declaratory and injunctive relief was filed in February 1983 against appellants, the City of Miami, its mayor, and its city manager. Plaintiff-appellee Ruben Cruz is a Cablevision subscriber. The complaint sought a judgment declaring the ordinance void on its face and an injunction restraining the enforcement of the ordinance. Appellee Home Box Office, Inc. (\u201cHBO\u201d) was permitted to intervene as a plaintiff. Cablevision was granted leave to intervene as a defendant and later moved to withdraw, but its motion was denied. Cablevision did not take a position in the lower court and has not participated in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-12\">Because the facts of this case were not in substantial dispute, all parties filed motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs also filed motions for preliminary and permanent injunctions. After holding two hearings on the issues presented, the district judge granted plaintiffs\u2019 motions on August 2,1983. The city was permanently enjoined from enforcing sections 1 and 2(g) of Ordinance No. 9538, which regulate \u201cindecent material\u201d on cable television. The court also enjoined the city from implementing the enforcement procedures provided for in section 3 of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-13\">Appellants challenge the district court\u2019s resolution of the first amendment and due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number>process issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An amicus curiae brief urging reversal has been filed by the State of Utah. Amicus curiae briefs urging af-firmance have been filed by the National Cable Television Association, Inc., and the Motion Picture Association of America, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-4\">FIRST AMENDMENT</p>\n<p id=\"ATy4\">The United States Supreme Court has long recognized that the first amendment\u2019s prohibition against any \u201claw ... abridging the freedom of speech\u201d applies to the states and their subdivisions through the fourteenth amendment. <em>Gitlow v. New York, </em>268 U.S. 652, 45 S.Ct. 625, 69 L.Ed. 1138 (1925). The Court has recognized only limited categories of speech that fall outside of the first amendment\u2019s protection. The Court has declined to extend protection to fighting words, <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942); defamation, <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964); speech inciting imminent lawless action, <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969); and obscenity, <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957). In <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), the Court reaffirmed that obscene material is unprotected by the first amendment and set forth the current permissible limits of regulation. However, the <em>Miller </em>court \u201cacknowledge^] ... the inherent dangers of undertaking to regulate any form of expression. State statutes designed to regulate obscene materials must be carefully limited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23-24, 93 S.Ct. at 2614-2615.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-5\">Appellees did not challenge the Miami ordinance\u2019s definition of \u201cobscene\u201d material or the city\u2019s constitutional authority to regulate obscenity on cable television. (The ordinance\u2019s definition of obscenity is in fact closely derived from the test set forth in Miller.) Rather, appellees challenged the provisions of the ordinance which attempt to regulate \u201cindecent\u201d materials. The ordinance\u2019s definition of indecent materials goes beyond the <em>Miller </em>definition of obscenity in two significant respects. First, the ordinance does not require that the challenged materials, \u201ctaken as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615. Second, the ordinance does not inquire whether the materials, \u201ctaken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, if materials falling within the ordinance\u2019s definition of \u201cindecent\u201d are to be regulated, the city\u2019s authority to do so must be found somewhere other than in the Supreme Court\u2019s obscenity cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-8\">Appellants\u2019 primary argument on appeal is that authority for the city\u2019s regulation is found in the Supreme Court decision <em>FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, </em>438 U.S. 726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978). In <em>Pac-ifica, </em>a radio station broadcast a twelve-minute monologue by comedian George Carlin entitled \u201cFilthy Words.\u201d The monologue was replete with language described as \u201cvulgar,\u201d \u201coffensive,\u201d and \u201cshocking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 747, 98 S.Ct. at 3039. The broadcast was in mid-afternoon, and the complaining listener heard the monologue while traveling in his automobile with his young son. The narrow issue presented to the court was whether the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had the authority to regulate and proscribe this particular broadcast. <em>Id. </em>at 742, 98 S.Ct. at 3036. Five members of the Court concluded that broadcasting of indecency could be regulated by the FCC under certain circumstances. The Court noted that \u201cof all forms of communication, it is broadcasting that has received the most limited First Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 748, 98 S.Ct. at 3040. The Court found two factors regarding broadcasting to be of particular relevance to the case with which it was presented. First, the Court found relevance in the fact that \u201cthe broadcast media have established a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all Americans\u201d and that \u201c[p]atently offensive, indecent material presented over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>the airwaves confronts the citizen, not only in public, but also in the privacy of the home, where the individual\u2019s right to be left alone plainly outweighs the First Amendment rights of an intruder.\u201d <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Second, the Court found that \u201cbroadcasting is uniquely accessible to children, even those too young to read.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 749, 98 S.Ct. at 3040. The Court was concerned with \u201c[t]he ease with which children may obtain access to broadcast material,\u201d and also recognized \u201cthe government\u2019s interest in the \u2018well-being of its youth\u2019 and in supporting \u2018parents\u2019 claim to authority in their own household\u2019 ____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 749-50, 98 S.Ct. at 3040-41 (quoting <em>Ginsberg v. New York, </em>390 U.S. 629, 639-40, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 1280-81, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-7\">The <em>Pacifica </em>Court, however, made a point of \u201cemphasizing] the narrowness of our holding.\u201d 438 U.S. at 750, 98 S.Ct. at 3041. The Court suggested that factors such as the time of day of the broadcast, the content of the program, and the composition of the audience might affect whether a particular broadcast could be regulated. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Moreover, the Court wrote that \u201cdifferences between radio, television, and perhaps closed-circuit transmissions, may also be relevant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1499-14\">The district court, after \u201ca careful consideration of <em>Pacifica,\u201d </em>found <em>Pacifica </em>to be \u201cinapplicable to the facts herein.\u201d <em>Cruz v. Ferre, </em>571 F.Supp. at 131. After describing the cable television medium,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the district court contrasted the cable medium with broadcast television. A Cablevision subscriber must make the affirmative decision to bring Cablevision into his home. By using monthly program guides, the Ca-blevision subscriber may avoid the unpleasant surprises that sometimes occur in broadcast programming. Additionally, the district court noted, the ability to protect children is provided through the use of a free \u201clockbox\u201d or \u201cparental key\u201d available from Cablevision. <em>Id. </em>at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>In reaching his conclusions, the district judge relied in great part upon two cases from Utah, <em>Community Television, Inc. v. Roy City, </em>555 F.Supp. 1164 (D.Utah 1982), and <em>Home Box Office, Inc. v. Wilkinson, </em>531 F.Supp. 987 (D.Utah 1982). <em>Roy City </em>and <em>Wilkinson </em>are the only other federal cases to have adjudicated the applicability of <em>Pacifica </em>to cable television. The district court in <em>Roy City </em>summarized the \u201ckey concepts\u201d in <em>Pacifica </em>as \u201cthe broadcasting of patently offensive material, its presence on public airwaves at a time when it could be available to children, audience surprise, and the power of the F.C.C. to control airwaves in the \u2018public interest.\u2019 \u201d 555 F.Supp. at 1166. After listing the differences between cable and broadcast television, <em>id. </em>at 1167,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the <em>Roy City </em>court examined these differences in greater detail and concluded, based upon these differences, that <em>Pacifica </em>is inapplicable to cable television. The court gave particular emphasis to Pacifica\u2019s \u201cpervasiveness\u201d component and found that cable television, unlike broadcast television, is not pervasive. <em>Id. </em>at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-5\">Although we recognize the complicated and uncertain area of constitutional interpretation which we are entering and the importance of the interests asserted by the city, we are persuaded that <em>Pacifica </em>cannot be extended to cover the particular facts of this case. <em>Pacifica, </em>it must be remembered, focused upon broadcasting\u2019s \u201cpervasive presence,\u201d 438 U.S. at 748, 98 S.Ct. at 3040, and the fact that broadcasting \u201cis uniquely accessible to children, even those too young to read.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 749, 98 S.Ct. at 3040. The Court\u2019s concern with the pervasiveness of the broadcast media can best be seen in its description of broadcasted material as an \u201cintruder\u201d into the privacy of the home. Cablevision, however, does not \u201cintrude\u201d into the home. The Cablevision subscriber must affirmatively elect to have cable service come into his home. Additionally, the subscriber must make the additional affirmative decision whether to purchase any \u201cextra\u201d programming services, such as HBO. The subscriber must make a monthly decision whether to continue to subscribe to cable, and if dissatisfied with the cable service, he may cancel his subscription. The Supreme Court\u2019s reference to \u201ca nuisance rationale,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 750, 98 S.Ct. at 3041, is not applicable to the Cablevision system, where there is no possibility that a non-cable subscriber will be confronted with materials carried only on cable. One of the keys to the very existence of cable television is the fact that cable programming is available only to those who have the cable attached to their television sets.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1500-10\">Probably the more important justification recognized in <em>Pacifica </em>for the FCC\u2019s authority to regulate the broadcasting of indecent materials was the accessibility of broadcasting to children.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe ease with which children may obtain access to broadcast material ... justifies] special treatment of indecent broadcasting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 750, 98 S.Ct. at 3041. This interest, however, is significantly weaker in the context of cable television because parental manageability of cable television greatly exceeds the ability to manage the broadcast media. Again, parents must decide whether to allow Cablevision into the home. Parents decide whether to select supplementary programming services such as HBO. These services publish programming guides which identify programs containing \u201cvulgarity,\u201d \u201cnudity,\u201d and \u201cviolence.\u201d Additionally, parents may obtain a \u201clockbox\u201d or \u201cparental key\u201d device enabling parents to prevent children from gaining access to \u201cobjectionable\u201d channels of programming. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>Cablevision provides these without charge to subscribers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-5\"><em>Pacifica </em>represents a careful balancing of the first amendment rights of broadcasters and willing adult listeners<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> against the FCC\u2019s interests in protecting children and unwilling adults. The Court held that, under the particular facts of <em>Pacifica, </em>the balance weighed in favor of the FCC. Because we determine that under the facts of the instant case the interests of the City of Miami are substantially less strong than those of the FCC in <em>Pacifica, </em>we believe that we must hold <em>Pacifica </em>to be inapplicable to this ease.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1501-6\">Our conclusion regarding the applicability of <em>Pacifica </em>to the facts now before us is buttressed by the Supreme Court\u2019s own treatment of <em>Pacifica. </em>Recent decisions of the Court have largely limited <em>Pacifica </em>to its facts. In <em>Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., </em>463 U.S. 60, 103 S.Ct. 2875, 77 L.Ed.2d 469 (1983), the Court pointed out that the majority in <em>Pacifica </em>had \u201cemphasize[d] the narrowness of our holding\u201d and the fact that broadcasting is \u201cuniquely\u201d pervasive and \u201cuniquely\u201d accessible to children. <em>Id. </em>103 S.Ct. at 2884. <em>Bolger </em>involved a challenge to a federal statute prohibiting unsolicited mailing of contraceptive advertisements. The Court rejected the government\u2019s argument that the statute shielded recipients of mail from materials they are likely to find offensive, stating: \u201cThe First Amendment \u2018does not permit the government to prohibit speech as intrusive unless the \u201ccaptive\u201d audience cannot avoid objectionable speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2883 (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Commission, </em>447 U.S. 530, 542, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 2336, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980)). The government also attempted to justify the statute as an aid to parents\u2019 efforts to control the manner in which their children become informed about sensitive and important subjects such as birth control. The Court, while recognizing that this interest was \u201cundoubtedly substantial,\u201d found that the \u201cmarginal degree of protection ... achieved by purging all mailboxes of unsolicited material that is entirely suitable for adults ... is more extensive than the Constitution permits, for the government may not \u2018reduce the adult population ... to reading only what is fit for children.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bolger, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2884 (quoting <em>Butler v. Michigan, </em>352 U.S. 380, 383, 77 S.Ct. 524, 526, 1 L.Ed.2d 412 (1957)). The Court distinguished the facts in <em>Pacifica, </em>finding the receipt of mail to be \u201cfar less intrusive and uncontrollable.\u201d <em>Bolger, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2884.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-14\">Even if we were to find the rationale of <em>Pacifica </em>applicable to this case, we would still be compelled to strike the ordinance as facially overbroad. As the district judge noted, the ordinance \u201cprohibits far too broadly the transmission of indecent materials through cable television. The ordinance\u2019s prohibition is wholesale, without regard to the time of day or other variables <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>indispensable to the decision in <em>Pacifica.\u201d Cruz v. Ferre, </em>571 F.Supp. at 131. The ordinance totally fails to account for the variables identified in <em>Pacifica: </em>the time of day; the context of the program in which the material appears; the composition of the viewing audience. In ignoring these variables, the ordinance goes far beyond the realm of permissible regulation envisioned by the <em>Pacifica </em>Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-4\">However noble may have been the city\u2019s intentions, we are constrained to recognize the limitations imposed by the Constitution and the opinions of the Supreme Court. The city\u2019s attempt through the challenged ordinance to regulate indecency on its cable television system exceeds these limitations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1502-5\">DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-6\">The district court also held that the procedures for the enforcement of the ordinance, found in section 3, violate \u201cthe fundamental notion of fairness implicit in due process.\u201d <em>Cruz v. Ferre, </em>571 F.Supp. at 133. The court found that \u201cconcentrating the functions of complainant, jury, judge and \u2018executioner\u2019 in one person\u201d created a \u201crisk of arbitrary or capricious governmental action [which] under these circumstances is intolerably high.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court recognized that the combination of investigative and adjudicative functions does not of itself amount to a due process violation. However, relying upon language in <em>Withrow v. Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 58, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 1470, 43 L.Ed.2d 712 (1975), to the effect that a court may determine that the facts before the court present an intolerably high risk of unfairness, the district court found such a risk to exist in the Miami ordinance, describing the determinations to be made under the ordinance as involving \u201can area of moral judgment that might well try the neutrality and impartiality of Solomon.\u201d <em>Cruz v. Ferre, </em>571 F.Supp. at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-8\">We find ourselves in agreement with the district judge. The ordinance involves sensitive judgments in areas of potentially great impact upon first amendment rights. The Supreme Court has often recognized that the regulation of a communicative activity must adhere to more narrowly drawn procedures than regulation of ordinary commercial activity. <em>See, e.g., Vance v. Universal Amusement Co., </em>445 U.S. 308, 315 &amp; n. 12, 100 S.Ct. 1156, 1161 &amp; n. 12, 63 L.Ed.2d 413 (1980). \u201c[T]he Fourteenth Amendment requires that regulation by the States of obscenity conform to procedures that will ensure against the curtailment of constitutionally protected expression, which is often separated from obscenity only by a dim and uncertain line.\u201d <em>Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, </em>372 U.S. 58, 66, 83 S.Ct. 631, 637, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963). \u201cThe separation of legitimate from illegitimate speech calls for ... sensitive tools.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because of these considerations, the Court has required tools such as \u201ca judicial determination in an adversary proceeding,\u201d <em>Freedman v.

While it would be inappropriate for us to determine at this time what procedures are necessary and appropriate under the ordinance, it is sufficient to note that the procedural guarantees presently provided in the ordinance are not sufficient to protect the vital interests at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-10\">For the reasons stated herein, we hold that the findings of the district court were correct as a matter of law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1498-6\">.

Because the broadcast audience is constantly tuning in and out, prior warnings cannot completely protect the listener or viewer from unexpected program content. To say that one may avoid further offense by turning off the radio when he hears indecent language is like saying that the remedy for an assault is to run away after the first blow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-9\"><em>Pacifica, </em>438 U.S. at 748-49, 98 S.Ct. at 3039-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1499-10\">. With reference to the Court\u2019s opinion, Justice Powell, joined by Justice Blackmun, stated: \"On its face, it does not prevent respondent Pacifica Foundation from broadcasting the monologue during late evening hours when fewer children are likely to be in the audience, nor from broadcasting discussions of the contemporary use of language at any time during the day.\u201d <em>Pacifica, </em>438 U.S. at 760, 98 S.Ct. at 3046 (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1499-11\">. Judge Hoeveler gave a brief description of the cable television medium, and the nature of subscription services such as HBO:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1499-12\">Unlike broadcast television, which sends over-the-air signals, cable television operates by transmitting programs to subscribers through coaxial cables or wires. These cables or wires are individually attached to ordinary television sets in subscribers\u2019 homes. Through the use of a converter, cable television can increase the channel capacity of a television set dramatically. Cablevision, for example, has the capacity to offer up to 104 channels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1499-15\">Cablevision is presently the sole Miami cable television licensee. It provides basic cable services, which include improved reception of local broadcast television and the reception of more remote broadcast signals. It also has offered and continues to offer subscribers up to six private television services for a separate fee. Subscribers may opt for these services on a monthly basis and must make supplemental payments each month for the services to be maintained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1499-16\">One private service currently offered by Ca-blevision is Home Box Office, Inc. (\"HBO\"). Approximately seventy-five percent of the 2,000 or so Miami households receiving cable television subscribe to HBO. HBO\u2019s programming includes feature films, sporting events, and special programs, and is provided 24 hours a day, seven days a week. By agreement, Cablevision retransmits HBO\u2019s entire viewing daily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1499-17\">HBO shows films rated \u201cG,\u201d \u201cPG,\u201d or \"R\u201d by the Motion Picture Association of America, as well as unrated films which would have received such ratings if rated. It is HBO\u2019s policy not to exhibit films receiving an \u201cX\" rating or its equivalent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1499-18\">Monthly HBO program guides list the times and dates of all program offerings, and they describe and give the ratings, if any, of the programs. Subscriber-households may control family access to the cable system by using \u201clockboxes\u201d and \"parental keys.\u201d These are available from Cablevision free of charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1499-19\"><em>Cruz v. Ferre, </em>571 F.Supp. at 128.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1500-6\">. This list was reproduced in the district court's opinion. <em>Cruz v. Ferre, </em>571 F.Supp. at 132.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1500-7\"><em>. </em>Appellants seem to want to extend Justice Steven\u2019s \"pig in the parlor\u201d analogy. <em>See </em>Brief of Appellants at 16 (\"it makes no difference whether the pig enters the parlor through the door of broadcast, cable, or amplified speech: government is entitled to keep the pig out of the parlor\"). It seems to us, however, that if an individual voluntarily opens his door and allows a pig into his parlor, he is in less of a position to squeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1500-12\">. Justices Powell and Blackmun seem to have placed particular emphasis upon this justification. <em>See Pacifica, </em>438 U.S. at 757-59, 98 S.Ct. at 3044-46 (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1501-7\">. Two members of the <em>Pacifica </em>majority gave more explicit recognition to the rights of willing adult listeners:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1501-8\">It is argued that ... the Commission\u2019s holding in this case is impermissible because it prevents willing adults from listening to Carlin\u2019s monologu\u00e9 over the radio in the early afternoon hours. It is said that this ruling will have the effect of \u201dreduc[ing] the adult population ... to [hearing] only what is fit for children.\u201d <em>Butler v. Michigan, </em>352 US 380, 383, 1 L ed 2d 412, 77 S Ct 524 [526] (1957). This argument is not without force____ But it is not sufficiently strong to leave the Commission powerless to act in circumstances such as those in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1501-11\"><em>Pacifica, </em>438 U.S. at 760, 98 S.Ct. at 3046 (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1501-12\">. Appellants and the State of Utah apparently argue that the limited number of stations on cable television somehow gives the city an interest in regulating indecency on cable television. This argument, however, misconstrues the rationale in <em>Pacifica </em>and in other Supreme Court cases such as <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>395 U.S. 367, 396, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1809, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969). As Justice Brennan noted in <em>Pacifica:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1501-16\">The opinions of my Brothers Powell and Stevens rightly refrain from relying on the notion of \"spectrum scarcity\u201d to support their result. As Chief Judge Bazelon noted below, \"although scarcity has justified <em>increasing </em>the diversity of speakers and speech, it has never been held to justify censorship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1501-17\"><em>Pacifica, </em>438 U.S. at 770 n. 4, 98 S.Ct. at 3051 n. 4 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Pacifica Foundation v.

We note that broadcast stations which are also carried on Cablevision are still subject to the FCC's permissible <em>Pacifica </em>regulation.
