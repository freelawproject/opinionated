We grant the rehearing, vacate our previous decision and reverse the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-17\">The facts of this case are fully set out in the report of our previous decision. The defendant, Edgar Salinas-Ceron, had been charged in a single indictment with violating both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5322(a) for the same conduct. He had already pleaded guilty and had been convicted of violating 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5316(a) and 5322(a). The district court dismissed the remaining count alleging a violation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 on the ground that the false statement made by Salinas-Ceron was not material. We held that the district court erred in that ruling, but we affirmed on the ground that Salinas-Ceron could not be convicted of violating both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5322(a) for the same conduct. In so ruling, we relied on our recent decision in <em>United States v. Woodward, </em>726 F.2d 1320, 1326 (9th Cir. 1984), holding that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 defined a lesser included offense within the offense defined in the predecessor of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5322(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-21\">The Supreme Court subsequently granted certiorari in <em>Woodward </em>and summarily reversed our decision. 53 U.S.L.W. 3476 (U.S. Jan. 8, 1985) (per curiam). The Supreme Court held that the felony of making a false statement, defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, was a wholly separate offense from the misdemeanor of failing to report currency, defined in the predecessor to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5322(a). The Court held that the offenses were distinct under the test of <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), because proof of a currency reporting violation does not necessarily include proof of a trick, scheme or device to conceal material information. The converse is even more obviously true. Finally, after reviewing legislative history, the Supreme Court concluded that Congress intended to permit punishment of conduct such as Woodward\u2019s under both statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-22\">It follows from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Woodward </em>that our previous decision in this case was incorrect. Salinas-Ceron\u2019s conviction under 31 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>\u00a7 5322(a) does not preclude his prosecution for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. For reasons stated in our prior opinion, 731 F.2d at 1377, the district court erred in ruling that Salinas-Ceron\u2019s alleged statement was not \u201cmaterial\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The decision of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-14\">. The government petitioned for reconsideration of our previous decision in light of <em>Ohio v. Johnson, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2536, 81 L.Ed.2d 425 (1984), which was decided after our opinion was filed. Because <em>United States v. Woodward </em>is dispositive of this appeal, we need not reach the double jeopardy issue raised in the government\u2019s petition for rehearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
