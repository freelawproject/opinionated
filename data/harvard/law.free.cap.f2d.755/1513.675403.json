The Administrative Law Judge (AU) determined that claimant had no severe impairment and denied benefits. When the Appeals Council declined to review this determination, the finding of non-disability became the Secretary\u2019s final decision. The district court found that substantial evidence supported the Secretary\u2019s determination and affirmed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-26\">The Secretary has mandated a sequential evaluation of disability claims. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520 (1983). The regulations require that one first consider whether the claimant is working. If so, the claimant is not disabled. If not, one must next determine whether claimant suffers from a severe impairment. If not, the applicant is not disabled. In this case the AU stopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>at this stej)' in the process after finding that Edwards suffered from no severe impairment. This was error. Edwards has a performance I.Q. of 67, a verbal I.Q. of 70, and a full-scale I.Q. of 68. The Secretary\u2019s own rulings establish that an I.Q. of 80 or more is not a severe impairment. Soc.Sec. Rul. 82-54,1982 Cumulative Social Security Rulings 132; Soc.Sec.Rul. 82-55, 1982 Cumulative Social Security Rulings 102. At the least, therefore, an I.Q. below 80 may be a severe impairment. This circuit has established that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1581-4\">[a]n impairment can be considered as not severe only if it is a slight abnormality which has such a minimal effect on the individual that it would not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education, or work experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1581-5\"><em>Brady v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 914, 920 (11th Cir.1984). Under such a definition, the Secretary erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-6\">Had the Secretary not erroneously stopped at the second step of the sequential evaluation, she would have considered whether Edwards met any of the listings in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (1983), which details \u201cimpairments which are considered severe enough to prevent a person from doing any gainful activity.\u201d 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1520(a) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-7\">Edwards asserts that he meets the requirements of Listing 12.05(C), which establishes disability if one has an</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7A0\">IQ of 60 to 69 inclusive (See 12.00B4) and a physical or other mental impairment imposing additional and significant work-related limitation of function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1581-8\">Listing 12.00 B 4 mandates that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqGq\">[wjhere more than one IQ is customarily derived from the test administered, i.e. where Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ\u2019s are provided, as on the WAIS the lowest of these is to be used in conjunction with 12.05.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1581-9\">Because Edwards\u2019s Performance I.Q. is 67, he satisfies the first (I.Q.) requirement of Listing 12.05(C). The question remains whether his asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease imposes an \u201cadditional and significant work-related limitation of function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-11\">An impairment imposes significant limitations when its effect on a claimant's ability to perform \u201cbasic work activities\u201d is more than slight or minimal. The question under Listing 12.05(C), however, is not whether the impairment is in and of itself disabling, <em>see Wright v. Schweiker, </em>556 F.Supp. 468, 476 (M.D.Tenn.1983); thus, \u201csignificant\u201d requires something less than \u201csevere\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4041520(c). That \u201csignificant\u201d involves something more than \u201cminimal\u201d but less than \u201csevere\u201d follows from the regulations. Once a claimant is found to have a \u201csevere impairment\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 404.-1520(c), he is deemed disabled (he must also meet the durational requirement), and the analysis comes to an end. It is only when the impairment is not severe that the inquiry proceeds to determine whether the claimant is disabled under Appendix 1. A claimant is disabled under \u00a7 12.05(C) of the Appendix when the combination of the impairments renders the claimant severely impaired; that is, disabled. Thus, the impairment referred to in \u00a7 12.05(C) is something less than \u201csevere\u201d as defined in \u00a7 404.1520(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-12\">Our recent decision in <em>[Mark] Edwards v. Heckler, </em>736 F.2d 625 (11th Cir.1984), is somewhat ambiguous. But as we construe it, it does not conflict with our holding. There we noted that \u00a7 12.05(C) \u201cclosely parallels\u201d the definition of severe impairment set forth in \u00a7 404.1520(c). 736 F.2d at 629. But the court stated, at page 630, that \u201c[wjhether these impairments (referred to in Appendix 1, \u00a7 12.05(C) are in and of themselves disabling is not the question.\u201d The court expressly relied upon <em>Wright v. </em>Schweiker\u2019s finding that an impairment under the second prong of \u00a7 12.-05(C) need not in itself be disabling, 736 F.2d at 630, in defining \u201csignificant.\u201d To construe <em>Mark Edwards </em>as requiring that the additional impairment itself be severe would be out of step with the statutory scheme. If the claimant has a severe impairment apart from his low I.Q., and meets the duration requirement, analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>comes to an end and consideration of the consequence of the low I.Q. need not be pursued. It would make no sense that when a low I.Q. is present there must be added to it a separate severe impairment. <em>Mark Edwards </em>could not have meant this.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-4\">The record indicates that Edwards suffers from chronic obstructive lung disease and exercise induced asthma. 2 Rec. at 80, 81. The record also shows that he \u201cis doing fairly well with current medications, controlling his exercise. The addition of Albuterol inhaler is. indicated for further control of his exercise induced asthma with two to three puffs prior to exercise (up to four treatments per day).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81. This statement indicates that Edwards\u2019s ability to exert himself is limited. <em>See also id. </em>at 33, 37, 43-44 (testimony by Edwards and his mother indicating the limited nature of his physical activities).</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-5\">No evidence in the record contradicts the findings of chronic obstructive lung disease and exercise induced asthma; there are only x-rays that are unremarkable, <em>id. </em>at 92, and a pulmonary function study that showed a mild restriction. <em>Id. </em>at 82. The Secretary almost concedes that Edwards\u2019s impairment causes some limit on his ability to perform basic work activities.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1582-6\">It is not the existence of a respiratory impairment that is controlling but rather the functional capacity the individual retains for activity in spite of such impairment. Numerous courts have held that although appellant could not engage in physically strenuous activities in a dusty environment, they [sic] could engage in lighter activities in a cleaner environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1582-7\">Brief of Appellee at 16.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1582-8\">It is submitted that since appellant\u2019s physical impairment in this case does not preclude the performance of simple, entry level, repetitive type activity, he does not meet the requirements of 12.05(c)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1582-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 19. However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1582-10\">[w]hether these impairments are in and of themselves disabling is not the question. Rather, applying section 12.05(C), the ALT should have determined solely whether these findings constitute \u201cadditional and significant work-related limitations of function.\u201d While the regulations do not further explain or define those terms, the regulations do define an impairment as non-severe \u201cif it does not significantly affect your physical or mental abilities to do basic work activities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"axe-dedup-1\"><em>Wright v. Schweiker, </em>556 F.Supp. 468, 476 (M.D.Tenn.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-12\">Because Edwards\u2019s asthma and lung disease affect his ability to exert himself, they have more than a \u201cminimal effect\u201d on his ability to perfect basic work activities. The AU therefore erred in finding that these impairments are not severe. Edwards meets the requirements of Listing 12.05(C) and is entitled to benefits. <em>See Mark Edwards, </em>at 630-631.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-13\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
