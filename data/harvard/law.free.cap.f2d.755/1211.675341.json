When the Secretary called upon plaintiff attorneys to make the reports contemplated by section 203(b), they filed an action for declaratory relief and an injunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>tion, and the Secretary filed a counterclaim for an order requiring the attorneys to make the reports. In an extensive and careful opinion, <em>Humphreys, Hutcheson &amp; Moseley v. Donovan, </em>568 F.Supp. 161 (M.D. Tenn.1983), the district court held that the . plaintiff attorneys must comply with all of the disclosure requirements of section 203 and granted summary judgment for the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"AWue\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"AqhD\">The facts in this case are undisputed. Humphreys, Hutcheson and Moseley (\u201cHH &amp; M\u201d) is a law firm that practices labor law in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In 1977, HH &amp; M was retained by Southern Silk Mills, Inc. to represent it during an election conducted by the NLRB. Before the election, two of the firm\u2019s partners, William P. Hutcheson and Ray H. Moseley, made speeches to Southern Silk\u2019s employees urging them to reject representation by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (\u201cUnion\u201d or \u201cACTWU\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Before he began his speech, Moseley was identified as an attorney in the law firm representing Southern Silk. In his speech to the workers, Moseley rendered an account of an unlawful strike against KayserRoth Corporation involving the same Union.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After describing the violence that accompanied the Kayser-Roth strike, Moseley urged the assembled employees to vote against the Union.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hutcheson also described the Kayser-Roth strike violence and exhorted the employees to reject union representation.</p>\n<p id=\"A1k\">On September 7, 1978, the Department of Labor (\u201cDepartment\u201d), through its Nashville, Tennessee office, contacted HH &amp; M by mail, stating that it had received an inquiry regarding the firm\u2019s persuader ac-tivities during the Southern Silk Mills election. The Department informed HH &amp; M that because Mr. Moseley and Mr. Hutcheson had attempted to persuade the employ-ees to reject the Union, the firm must disclose its agreement with Southern Silk pursuant to section 203 of the LMRDA. The Department also instructed HH &amp; M that it must file an annual financial report, Form LM-21, reporting <em>inter alia </em>\u201cre-ceiPts and disbursements of any kind in connection with labor relations advice and services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZE8\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"A2uY\">HH <em>&amp; </em>M contends that the statute prop-erly interpreted does not require it to file the reports contemplated by section 203(b) and that if it does, the statute is unconstitutional. The Secretary, of course, contends the contrary. We approach the is-sues as did the parties,</p>\n<p id=\"abt-dedup-2\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"AevT\">Under LMRDA section 203, a person who agrees to engage or who engages in per-suader activities must file a thirty day report and an annual report The Secretary has authorized the use of Form LM-20 for the thirty day report, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 406.2 (1984)) and Form LM_2i for the annual report) 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 406.3(a) (1984). The annual report is more comprehensive than the thirty day report. The annual report requires the persuader to disclose all receipts from all employers on account of labor relations advice or services and the persuader must' designate the source of these receipts. In addition, the persuader <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>must reveal all of his disbursements made in connection with his labor relations advice and services, and the persuader must specify the purpose for these disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\">HH &amp; M has stipulated that it has acted as a persuader, yet it contends that the firm should be excused from filing the reports, especially the annual report. HH &amp; M first argues that section 203(b) of the statute is inapplicable to the firm because it did not act as a covert middleman. It is undisputed that the HH &amp; M partners identified themselves as attorneys representing Southern Silk management before speaking to its employees. HH &amp; M contends that the LMRDA is aimed at covert management middlemen who engage in activities such as spying, bribery and influence peddling rather than at persuaders who openly engage in \u201clegitimate\u201d persuasive activities such as the speeches given by the partners of the firm who were disclosed persuaders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">When enacting the LMRDA, Congress did not distinguish between disclosed and undisclosed persuaders or between legitimate and nefarious persuasive activities. Rather, Congress determined that persuasion itself was a suspect activity and concluded that the possible evil could best be remedied through disclosure. It was hoped that persuasive activity would be curbed by subjecting persuaders to glaring publicity. We agree with the summation of congressional intent set forth by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Price v. Wirtz, </em>412 F.2d 647 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-6\">The legislative judgment that one who engages in the persuader business must be subjected to the pressure of revealing publicity is amply justified by the difficulty in distinguishing between those activities that are persuader activities and those that are not, and by the opportunity for misleading concealment of the true nature of such Attorney\u2019s work in situations involving intricate corporate conglomerate associates or, equally pressing, industry-wide labor controversies. Behind this judgment, of course, was the congressional conviction that quite without regard to the motives or methods of particular individuals engaging in it, the persuader business was detrimental to good labor relations and the continued public interest. Since a principal object of LMRDA was neutralizing the evils of persuaders, it was quite legitimate and consistent with the Act\u2019s main sanction of goldfishbowl publicity to turn the spotlight on the lawyer who wanted not only to serve clients in labor relations matters encompassed within \u00a7 203(c) but who wanted also to wander into the legislatively suspect field of a persuader.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1295-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 650 (footnotes omitted). We find the fact that the attorneys identified themselves to the Southern Silk employees did not remove them from the ambit of LMRDA section 203(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">Appellant contends that even if it is required to file the reports contemplated by section 203(b), that section 203(c) relieves its persuader-attorneys from the necessity of reporting information regarding the clients for whom it performs no persuader services. Section 203(c)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> exempts persons advising an employer or representing an employer before a court, agency or administrative tribunal and persons engaging in negotiations or arbitration on behalf of an employer from the reporting requirements of section 203(b). This court agrees with the majority of courts<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that find the purpose of section 203(c) is to clarify what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>is implicit in section 208(b) \u2014 that attorneys engaged in the usual practice of labor law are not obligated to report under section 203(b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">We determine that section 203(c) means that as long as an attorney confines himself to the activities set forth in section 203(c), he need not report, but if he crosses the boundary between the practice of labor law and persuasion, he is subject to the extensive reporting requirements. As the Fifth Circuit stated in <em>Price v. Wirtz, </em>412 F.2d 647, 651 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApPW\">It boils down to this. As long as the attorney limits himself to the activities set forth in \u00a7 203(c) [rendering advice and representing a client in proceedings or in bargaining], he need not report. Engaging in such advice or collective bargaining does not give rise to a duty to report. No report is set in motion \u201cby reason of\u201d his doing those things. What sets the reporting in motion is performing persuader activities. Once that duty arises, \u00a7 203(c) does not insulate from reporting the matters in \u00a7 203(b) for non-persuader clients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">Once HH &amp; M\u2019s partners engaged in persuasion and the duty to report arose, section 203(c) ceased to shield the persuader attorneys\u2019 law firm from reporting the matters described in section 203(b) regarding their non-persuader clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-12\">The appellant contends that even if it is subject to the reporting requirements of section 203, the requested information is protected by the attorney-client privilege recognized in section 204.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This is an issue of first impression.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant contends that the attorney-client privilege codified in LMRDA section 204 is broader than the traditional attorney-client privilege. We find to the contrary, that in section 204 Congress intended to accord the same privilege as that provided by the common-law attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-13\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-14\">On March 22, 1958, Senator John F. Kennedy introduced S. 1555. As introduced by Senator Kennedy, S. 1555 contained no provision codifying the attorney-client privilege. Senator Kennedy believed that attorneys were adequately protected under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>provision in his bill that eventually became LMRDA section 203. Senator Goldwater, however, vigorously advocated an amendment to S. 1555 that would codify the attorney-client privilege. Senator Kennedy, who referred to the Goldwater amendment as \u201cthe amendment which takes care of the lawyers,\u201d 105 Cong.Rec. 1161 (1959), originally opposed the amendment. Senator Kennedy accepted the amendment only after satisfying himself that the scope of the amendment, now codified at LMRDA section 204, did not exceed that of the traditional attorney-client privilege. The following exchange took place on the floor of the Senate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-4\">Mr. Goldwater. The amendment specifically exempts from the reporting requirements of the bill any communications between an attorney and his client. I do not know how I can explain the amendment any more completely than that. I think every attorney and every Member of this body understands the historic relationship and sanctity of such communications. I hope the Senator from Massachusetts will accept the amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-5\">Mr. Kennedy. Mr. President, I am prepared to accept the amendment. As I understand, it is the amendment which takes care of the lawyers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-6\">Mr. Goldwater. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-7\">Mr. Kennedy. It goes against my grain to accept the amendment, because no bar association in the United States, as of tonight, has moved against one lawyer who has come before the McClellan committee and who has participated, in one way or another, in the improper practices which have been found____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-9\">Mr. Goldwater. I am not any happier than is the Senator from Massachusetts about the activities of some of the attorneys who appeared before the committee. But as a layman I recognize that there must be lawyers to represent these people, whether we like the people or not. As a layman, I believe that there should be a perpetuation of the sanctity of relations between attorney and client. I know that if I were involved in a situation in which an attorney was representing me, and a report had to be made, I would not want all of the intimate details of communications between the attorney and me to become public property____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-12\">Mr. Kennedy. I was not referring to the lawyers who represent criminals, however obnoxious they may be. I was referring to lawyers who deal collusively with crooked unions, crooken union leaders, or crooked employers, and then, in an attempt to protect themselves, justify their actions on the basis of a confidential relationship____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-13\">Mr. Dirksen. Unless I have been laboring under a delusion for the last 20 years as a member of the bar, it is my understanding that the safeguard of the lawyer-client relationship was designed not to safeguard or protect the lawyer, but the client. I am not so certain that the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has been under a misapprehension about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-14\">Mr. Kennedy. If the Senator from Illinois had sat on the McClellan committee, he would understand that the practice works both ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-15\">Mr. Dirksen. But that was not the reason it was designed in the first instance, when it was written into the law. The idea was that when a client came into a lawyer\u2019s office and laid out his confessional story, a confidential relationship was created, and the lawyer could not be brought into court to testify to the conversations between his client and himself. The law was not designed to defend the lawyer; it was designed to safeguard the American citizen who hired the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-16\">Mr. Kennedy. There is no doubt in my mind that the bill which was originally drafted by lawyers adequately protected them. Therefore, I do not feel that the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona is wholly necessary. But in order that there may be no question about it, I will accept the amendment____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-18\">Mr. Dirksen____ [I] think it is important to anchor the fundamental reason or pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>pose for protecting this relationship. It has existed since time immemorial. It was designed to protect the client against harassment in case somebody tried to compel him, by process or otherwise, to disclose conversations, confessions, and statements which might have been interchanged between lawyer and client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-4\">Mr. Kennedy. Mr. President, I am delighted to accept the amendment \u2014 I mean to say I accept the amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9C\">105 Cong.Rec. 19759-62 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">The American Bar Association, which was concerned about the ramifications the proposed legislation might have upon attorneys, adopted a resolution at its 1959 midwinter meeting which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-6\"><em>Resolved, </em>That the American Bar Association urges that in any proposed legislation in the labor management field, the traditional confidential relationship between attorney and client be preserved, and that no such legislation should require report or disclosure, by either attorney or client, of any matter which has traditionally been considered as confidential between a client and his attorney, including but not limited to the existence of the relationship of attorney and client, the financial details thereof, and any advice or activities of the attorney on behalf of his client which fall within the scope of the legitimate practice of law____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">The House version of LMRDA section 204 contained an attorney-client exclusion almost identical to the ABA proposal. The House version provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-8\">Attorney-Client Communications Exempted</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-9\">Sec. 204. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to require an attorney who is a member in good standing of the bar in any State, or any client of such an attorney, to include in any report required to be filed pursuant to the provisions of this Act any information which is confidential between the attorney and such client in the course of a legitimate attorney-client relationship, including but not limited to the existence of the relationship of attorney and client, the financial details thereof, or any information obtained, advice given, or activities carried on by the attorney within the scope of the legitimate practice of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\">H.R. 8342, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 204 (1959), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1959, p. 2318. The House Report accompanying H.R. 8342 stated \u201c[t]he purpose of this section is to protect the traditional confidential relationship between attorney and client from any infringement or encroachment under the reporting provisions of the committee bill.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 741, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. 37 (1959), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1959, p. 2459. The House version of the bill, and by implication the ABA Resolution, was rejected by the Conference Committee. The Senate version of the bill, S. 1555, which contained a much narrower attorney-client privilege, was enacted into law as LMRDA section 204. The Conference Committee Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-12\">The Senate bill provides that an attorney need not include in any report required by the act any information which was lawfully communicated to such attorney by any of his clients in the course of a legitimate attorney-client relationship. The conference substitute adopts the provisions of the Senate bill, but in connection therewith the conferees included, in section 203(c), a provision taken from the Senate bill that provides that an employer or other person is not required to file a report covering the services of such person by reason of his giving or agreeing to give advice to such employer or representing or agreeing to represent such employer before any court, administrative agency, or tribunal of arbitration or engaging or agreeing to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of such employer or the negotiation of an agreement or any question arising thereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq3\">H.R.Rep. No. 1147, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. 33 (1959), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1959, p. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>We find that in contending that the attorney-client privilege contained in section 204 exceeds the scope of the traditional attorney-client privilege, the appellant has misconstrued the statute. Our review of the legislative history convinces this court that in LMRDA section 204, Congress intended to accord the same protection as that provided by the common-law attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">This court<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> set forth the essential elements of the attorney-client privilege in <em>United States v. Goldfarb, </em>328 F.2d 280 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 976, 84 S.Ct. 1883, 12 L.Ed.2d 746 (1964), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-7\">(1) Where legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his instance permanently protected (7) from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser, (8) except the protection be waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 281, (quoting 8 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence in Trials At Common Law </em>\u00a7 2292, at 554 (McNaughton rev. 1961)). In <em>Goldfarb, </em>this court recognized that the attorney-client privilege \u201cdoes not envelope everything arising from the existence of an attorney-client relationship\u201d and emphasized that \u201cthe attorney-client privilege is an exception carved from the rule requiring full disclosure, and as an exception, should not be extended to accomplish more than its purpose.\u201d 328 F.2d at 282. <em>See also United States v. Bartone, </em>400 F.2d 459, 461 (6th Cir.1968) (attorney-client privilege is not all inclusive), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1027, 89 S.Ct. 631, 21 L.Ed.2d 571 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">The attorney-client privilege only precludes disclosure of <em>communications </em>between attorney and client and does not protect against disclosure of the facts underlying the communication. <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 395, 101 S.Ct. 677, 685, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981). In general, the fact of legal consultation or employment, clients\u2019 identities, attorney\u2019s fees, and the scope and nature of employment are not deemed privileged. In <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation No. 83-2-35, </em>723 F.2d 447 (6th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 3524, 82 L.Ed.2d 831 (1984), this court reiterated the principle that the attorney-client privilege should be narrowly construed and held that the attorney-client privilege does not protect the identity of a client except in very limited circumstances. In <em>United States v. Haddad, </em>527 F.2d 537, 538-39 (6th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 974, 96 S.Ct. 2173, 48 L.Ed.2d 797 (1976), this court held that the amount of money paid or owed by a client to his attorney is not privileged except in exceptional circumstances not present in the instant case. We conclude that none of the information that LMRDA section 203(b) requires to be reported runs counter to the common-law attorney-client privilege. Any other interpretation of the privilege created by section 204 would render section 203(b) nugatory as to persuader lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">HH &amp; M contends that the disclosure requirements are unconstitutional in that they infringe upon its free speech and associational rights guaranteed by the first amendment. In essence, the contention here is that it will be deterred from exercising its right of free speech by making persuader speeches for its clients if, by doing so, it will be compelled to file the reports required by section 203(b). The argument is that a law firm such as HH &amp; M would be reluctant to place on public record its payments to its partners, associates and employees and that labor relations clients would be reluctant to employ a law firm that, because of its persuader status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>with respect to some clients, is compelled to place their payments to the firm on public record. Thus, argues HH &amp; M, its free speech and associational rights are unconstitutionally chilled by the requirement that it comply with section 203(b). The Secretary concedes that HH &amp; M\u2019s right to make otherwise legal persuader speeches for its clients is protected by the first amendment but contends that the requirement that the information be filed with the Secretary does not unconstitutionally chill HH &amp; M\u2019s exercise of its free speech and associational rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">In dealing with this contention, we agree with the analytical framework employed by the Fourth Circuit in <em>Master Printers of America v. Donovan, Secretary of Labor, </em>751 F.2d 700 (4th Cir.1984), which involved a constitutional attack on section 203(b). Master Printers is a trade association to which nonunion printing firms belong. It distributed a publication to its employer members and to some of their employees which, among other things, argued against union membership by printing employees. The Secretary determined that this activity was persuader activity and that therefore it must file the reports required by section 203(b) as to its membership. Without reciting the long history of this litigation, suffice it to say that it reached the Fourth Circuit for the third time on the narrow issue of the constitutionality of section 203(b) as applied to Master Printers. This trade association contended that its free speech and associational rights were unconstitutionally infringed by the report requirements because compliance with them would deter membership by employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">The <em>Master Printers </em>court recognized that the Supreme Court had declared unconstitutional compelled disclosure of membership in groups involved in advocacy, such as in <em>NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, </em>357 U.S. 449, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958), and that in doing so, the Court held that disclosure laws that significantly encroach on such associational rights must survive exacting scrutiny. The court in <em>Master Printers </em>then set out the analytical framework for testing Master Printers\u2019 claim that the reporting requirements are unconstitutional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-7\">[O]ur analysis must focus on four factors: the degree of infringement on first amendment rights; the importance of the governmental interest protected by the Act; whether a \u201csubstantial relation\u201d exists between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed; and the closeness of the \u201cfit\u201d between the Act and the governmental interest it purports to further.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">751 F.2d at 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">This court must weigh these four factors in order to determine whether the burden imposed on HH &amp; M\u2019s exercise of its free speech and associational rights, assuming such a burden exists, is justified by the government\u2019s interest in maintaining antiseptic conditions in the labor relations setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">As the <em>Master Printers </em>court stated, \u201c[a] finding of a substantial \u2018chill\u2019 on protected first amendment rights requires a showing that the statutory scheme will result in threats, harassment, or reprisals to specific individuals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704 (citing <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 74, 96 S.Ct. 612, 661, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976)); <em>NAACP, </em>357 U.S. at 462-63, 78 S.Ct. at 1171-72 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-12\">In <em>NAACP, </em>the Court found that the statutorily mandated disclosures of the NAACP\u2019s membership lists were not warranted because the NAACP had \u201cmade an uncontroverted showing that on past occasions revelation of the identity of its rank- and-file members ha[d] exposed these members to economic reprisal, loss- of employment, threat of physical coercion and manifestations of public hostility.\u201d <em>NAACP, </em>357 U.S. at 462, 78 S.Ct. at 1172. In <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>the seminal case on the constitutionality of compelled disclosures in the first amendment context, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the disclosure re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>quirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431 <em>et seq. </em>(1982). In rejecting the complaining parties\u2019 arguments that portions of the Act violated the rights of minority parties and independent candidates, the <em>Buckley </em>Court pointed out that \u201cno appellant in this case has tendered record evidence of the sort proffered in <em>NAACP v. Alabama.\u201d </em>424 U.S. at 71, 96 S.Ct. at 659-60. The Court found that individual exceptions from the reporting requirements were justified when a party proved \u201conly a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of a party\u2019s contributors\u2019 names will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74, 96 S.Ct. at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\">William P. Hutcheson, one of HH &amp; M\u2019s partners, submitted an affidavit dated April 15,1981, in which he avers that if HH &amp; M is compelled to file Form LM-21 and include therein all the information required by section 203(b), he fears that clients of the firm who are listed on the LM-21 Form will suffer reprisals and retaliation from private parties and government officials. Mr. Hutcheson cites several bases for his fear. He maintains that the Amalgamated Clothing Textile Workers Union, angered because it lost the election at Southern Silk Mills, intends to harm HH &amp; M. Hutche-son argues that ACTWU, which Hutcheson avers \u201chas engaged in numerous acts of violence in and around Chattanooga, Tennessee,\u201d will use the information contained in a Form LM-21 report to embarrass the firm\u2019s clients, with whom ACTWU has no dispute whatsoever \u201csolely in an effort to harm Humphreys, Hutcheson &amp; Moseley.\u201d Hutcheson suggests that ACTWU may use the LM-21 Form to compile an \u201cenemies list\u201d and urge its members to boycott the firms included in the list. In addition, Hutcheson avers that the Secretary of Labor may harass the clients listed on the LM-21 Form even though they had no dealings whatsoever with labor unions and even though Humphreys, Hutcheson &amp; Moseley performed no persuader services for them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">We find these allegations regarding the actions of the ACTWU and the Secretary of Labor to be speculation. Like the <em>Master Printers </em>court, \u201cwe do not believe that the evidence and allegations of first amendment infringement here constitute the sort of threat of physical harm and loss of employment found in <em>NAACP v. Alabama </em>and its progeny.\u201d 751 F.2d at 704. <em>See also Donovan v. Master Printers Association, </em>532 F.Supp. 1140, 1148 n. 11 (N.D.Ill.1981) (court found that members\u2019 allegations fell far below the level of reprisals articulated in <em>NAACP v. Alabama </em>and its progeny), <em>aff'd and adopted, </em>699 F.2d 370 (7th Cir. 1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 703, 79 L.Ed.2d 169 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-9\">Because HH &amp; M has failed to establish that the report requirements contained in section 203(b) as applied to it produce a \u201cdeterrent effect\u201d akin to that present in <em>NAACP, </em>we conclude that the report requirements do not substantially burden HH &amp; M\u2019s first amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-11\">Although we determined that HH &amp; M\u2019s allegations of the chill upon its first amendment rights are not substantial, we find that the chill is not inconsequential. Therefore, we must look further to determine whether this disclosure legislation is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. As the <em>Buckley </em>Court stated, \u201cthere are governmental interests sufficiently important to outweigh the possibility of infringement [upon first amendment rights], particularly when the \u2018free functioning of our national institutions\u2019 is involved.\u201d 424 U.S. at 66, 96 S.Ct. at 657 (quoting <em>Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, </em>367 U.S. 1, 97, 81 S.Ct. 1357, 1411, 6 L.Ed.2d 625 (1961)). Among these compelling interests, holds <em>Master Printers, </em>are \u201cdeterring actual corruption\u201d in the labor field and \u201cbolstering [the government\u2019s] own ability to investigate \u2018in order to act and protect.\u2019 \u201d 751 F.2d at 707 (quoting <em>Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Committee, </em>372 U.S. 539, 544, 83 S.Ct. 889, 892, 9 L.Ed.2d 929 (1963)). Like the <em>Master Printers </em>court, we find that the government\u2019s compelling interest in maintaining harmonious labor re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>lations outweighs the chill placed upon HH &amp; M\u2019s exercise of its first amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">We agree with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the disclosures required by section 203(b) of the Act are \u201cunquestionably \u2018substantially related\u2019 \u201d to the government\u2019s compelling interest in deterring corruption in the labor relations field. <em>Master Printers, </em>751 F.2d at 707. Our conclusions are supported by the evidence of persuaders\u2019 track record of illegal conduct as developed by the McClellan Committee Hearings and contained in the legislative history of the LMRDA. We find that the disclosure requirements aid employees in understanding the source of the information they receive, tend to discourage abuse, reduce the appearance of impropriety and supply information to the Secretary that will aid in detecting violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">Like the <em>Master Printers </em>court, we find that the persuader provisions are carefully tailored so that first amendment freedoms are not needlessly curtailed. <em>Id. </em>at 708. We conclude, therefore, that HH &amp; M\u2019s contentions that disclosures regarding \u25a0 clients for whom the firm performed no persuader activities have no relation to the government\u2019s compelling interest in preserving harmonious labor relations are without merit. Congress determined that only extensive financial disclosure by persuaders would curb the abuses by these middlemen. S.Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. at 10. As the <em>Master Printers </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-8\">In order to deter both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption, Congress concluded that it would be necessary to require the disclosure of a wide-ranging number of employers and activities, even if it meant reporting activities that were not improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-10\">HH &amp; M contends that the disclosure requirements do not conform closely to the government\u2019s compelling interest because the reports required by section 203(b) often are not filed until after an election takes place and thus do not serve the government\u2019s interest in maintaining laboratory conditions during labor elections. Although the required reports may not be filed until after an election, we find that these reports nevertheless serve the government\u2019s interest in ensuring fair labor elections. Requiring disclosure, even after the fact, will inhibit and expose illegal and unethical actions by persuaders that hamper employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by the NLRA. The reports also enable employees in the labor relations setting, like voters in the political arena, to understand the source of the information they are given during the course of a labor election campaign. Past reports that disclose the interests of persuaders serve as a valuable source of information in current elections. In addition, the reporting mechanism promotes industrial peace by ensuring the enforcement of the labor laws. The annual reports serve as a cross-check on the accuracy of the thirty day reports, and the annual reports notify the Secretary of the relationships between persuaders and employers which may give rise to the duties to file thirty day reports. We conclude that both the thirty day and the annual reports serve the government\u2019s compelling interest in maintaining antiseptic conditions in the labor relations field. Therefore, we agree with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the statute is not overly broad. <em>Id. </em>at 709-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-12\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-13\">We have balanced the four factors set forth by the <em>Master Printers </em>court, at 704, and like the Fourth Circuit we hold that when the four factors of the <em>Buckley </em>balancing test are carefully weighed, it is clear that the government\u2019s interests advanced by the statute are compelling, the degree of infringement is minimal, the purpose of the statute is substantially related to its requirements, and the level of disclosure required is carefully tailored to the goals of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-14\">We further point out that, in addition to <em>Master Printers, </em>every court that has considered the issue has held that the report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>requirements contained in section 203(b) are constitutional. <em>Marshall v.
