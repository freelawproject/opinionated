The property on which Lu-gar\u2019s Texaco station was located had been leased to Texaco in 1966 by Anna Wukich, the owner. The lease provided for an initial term which expired on May 31, 1981, but Texaco could renew the lease for three additional five-year terms. The lease also gave Texaco an option to purchase the property for $125,000 at any time after the tenth year of the lease. Texaco in turn subleased the property to Lugar. The sublease also expired on May 31, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">Although the district court made no findings on this issue, the parties agree that Texaco decided to cease supplying its branded products directly to service stations in western Pennsylvania and to market them instead through distributors. To implement this decision, Texaco sought to divest itself of its direct obligations to retailers, including those to Lugar. Texaco advised Lugar in January 1981, confirmed by letter on February 20, 1981, that it would not renew the lease and sales agreement between them. On February 8, 1981, Lugar\u2019s attorney sent a letter to Texaco requesting that the purchase option in the Wukich to Texaco lease be assigned to Lu-gar. Texaco never responded to this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">On May 31, 1981, both the lease and the sublease expired. Lugar took with him all his tools and equipment and Texaco, pursuant to its rights under the lease, razed the building and relinquished all interest in the property. Thereafter, Lugar filed the present action alleging that Texaco had violated the PMPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-19\">Congress enacted the PMPA in June 1978 after considerable debate and extensive inquiry into alleged unfair treatment of fuel dealers by their suppliers. Title I of the Act was designed to strengthen the position of the franchisees in bargaining with their franchisors. S.Rep. No. 731, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 1, 18-19 <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 873, 876-77 (hereafter Senate Report). Congress focused on two areas of particular concern to service station operators: nonrenewal of the franchise or its arbitrary termination. The Act provides that a franchisor may terminate or fail to renew a franchise only for the reasons provided in the statute and by giving the requisite notice, \u00a7 102(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(a) (1982). The permissible grounds are set forth in two sections of the Act, sections 102(b)(2) and 102(b)(3), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2802(b)(2), 2802(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Five grounds are listed in section 102(b)(2) of the PMPA as valid bases for either termination or nonrenewal. They are: (A) the failure of the franchisee to comply with reasonable and material provisions of the franchise, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(A); (B) the failure of the franchisee to make good faith efforts to carry out the provisions of the franchise, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(B); (C) the ocurrence of an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship and which makes termination or nonrenewal reasonable, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C); (D) the termination or non-renewal by written agreement, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(D); and (E) a determination by the franchisor made \u201cin good faith and in the normal course of business\u201d to withdraw from the relevant geographic marketing area, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The succeeding section 102(b)(3) sets forth additional grounds which may form the basis for nonrenewal, but not for termination. These include (A) failure of the parties to agree to changes in the franchise arrangement \u201cmade by the franchisor in good faith and in the normal course of business,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(A); (B) receipt by the franchisor of numerous bona fide complaints from customers regarding the franchisee\u2019s operations, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(B); (C) the franchisee\u2019s failure to operate the premises in a clean, safe, and healthful manner; and, finally, (D) the franchisor\u2019s determination \u201cin good faith and in the normal course of business\u201d to convert the premises to another use, to alter, add to or replace them, or to sell the premises, or its determination that renewal of the franchise relationship is likely to be uneconomical to the franchisor despite reasonable additions to the agreement, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">A franchisor who relies on the grounds set forth in \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(E) or \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D) for nonrenewal must first, if it leases the marketing premises, have made \u201ca bona fide offer to sell, transfer, or assign to the franchisee such franchisor\u2019s interests in such premises,\u201d or have offered the franchisee a right of first refusal. 15 U.S.C. \u25a0 \u00a7\u00a7 2802(b)(2)(E)(iii)(I), 2802(b)(3)(D)(iii). <em>See Roberts v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>740 F.2d 602, 605-06 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">In his complaint Lugar alleged that Texaco was required to assign the purchase option to him pursuant to the provision in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D)(iii). However, this section imposes obligations on a franchisor only if it seeks to justify nonrenewal of the franchise arrangement on the basis of its determination as set forth in that section. As the district court recognized, Texaco made no such determination. Therefore, the court held 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D) inapplicable, and Lugar has not appealed this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">Texaco moved for summary judgment, claiming that it had a statutory right not to renew Lugar\u2019s franchise because 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C) permits the franchisor not to renew a franchise if an event occurs that makes nonrenewal \u201creasonable\u201d, and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(c)(4) gives as an example of such an event \u201cthe expiration of an underlying lease.\u201d Since the Wukich lease to Texaco expired on May 31, 1981, it argued it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">The district court entered summary judgment <em>sua sponte </em>against Texaco and for Lugar. The court held that Texaco could not claim the protection of \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C) because its failure to assign the purchase option to Lugar was unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, the issue of damages was submitted to a jury which awarded damages of $47,-000.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-15\">Texaco now challenges both the holding of liability and the facts and theories on the basis of which damages were awarded. Because we reverse on the issue of liability, we have no occasion to consider the damages issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Under the PMPA, it is the franchisor\u2019s \u201cburden of going forward with evidence to establish as an affirmative defense that such termination or nonrenewal was permitted....\u201d \u00a7 105(c), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(c) (1982). The text of the provision upon which Texaco relies in order to justify its failure to renew Lugar\u2019s franchise states that if the proper notice has been given, \u201cthe following are grounds for ... nonre-newal of a franchise relationship:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">(C) The occurrence of an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which ... nonrenewal of the franchise relationship is reasonable, if such event occurs during the period the franchise is in effect____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u00a7 102(b)(2)(C), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Lugar makes no complaint about the manner or timing of his notification; rather, he insists that no event occurred that made nonrenewal \u201creasonable\u201d. Congress provided an illustrative but non-exclusive list of such \u201cevents\u201d in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(c). The illustration on which Texaco relies is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au2\">(4) loss of the franchisor\u2019s right to grant possession of the leased marketing premises through expiration of an underlying lease, [provided the requisite notice is given].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Looking only at the language of the statute, it is plausible to argue that the franchisor\u2019s voluntary relinquishment of a lease does not constitute a permissible \u201cevent\u201d. However, the legislative history shows otherwise. According to the Senate Report,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXt\">Expiration of the underlying lease could occur under a variety of circumstances <em>including, </em>for example, <em>a decision by the franchisor not to exercise an option to renew the underlying lease. </em>However, it is not intended that termination or non-renewal should be permitted based upon the expiration of a lease which does not evidence the existence of an arms length relationship between the parties and as a result of the expiration of which no substantive change in control of the premises results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Senate Report at 38, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 896 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Consequently, every court that has had occasion to address this issue has held that the presence of an option to renew the underlying lease does not change the result. <em>See, e.g., Bernardini v. Exxon Corp., </em>1981-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) \u00b6 63,921 at 75,772-73 (E.D.Pa.1981); <em>Gaspar v. Chevron Oil Co., </em>490 F.Supp. 971, 974 (D.N.J. 1980); <em>Sachi v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>1980-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) \u00b6 63,044 at 77,194-95 (E.D.N.Y.1979). <em>See generally </em>Finch, <em>Judicial Interpretation of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act: Strict Construction of Remedial Legislation, </em>37 Bus.Law. 141, 155-160 (1981). Moreover, the First Circuit has held that even where the franchisor took affirmative action not to extend a lease that would otherwise have renewed automatically, there was no violation because the nonrenewal was justified by an enumerated \u201cevent\u201d, the \u201cexpiration\u201d of the underlying lease. <em>Veracka v. Shell Oil Co., </em>655 F.2d 445, 448 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">The district court treated this line of precedent as inapplicable because Texaco did not assign Lugar the option to purchase the property when requested. The court held, \u201cSince Texaco did not assign this right, Texaco cannot claim the protection of section 2802(b)(2)(C) because it retained the right until May 31, 1981 to grant Mr. Lugar a guarantee of possession if he exercised the option even though the lease would expire.\u201d However, as the cases cited above have held, the franchisor has no obligation under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(c)(4) to take affirmative steps to put itself in the position where it can grant possession to the franchisee. It follows that if the franchisor has no obligation to exercise its option to renew the lease, it has no obligation under the same section to exercise or assign the option to purchase the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">Although there is no other case presenting precisely this issue, the available precedent is that obligations imposed under other sections of the Act cannot be imposed on a franchisor who relies on 15 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u00a7 2802(c)(4). Thus, in <em>Sachi v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>1980-1 Trade Cas. at 77,192, the court rejected the dealer\u2019s argument that the franchisor had an affirmative obligation to negotiate about the franchise agree.ment before permitting the option to lapse, The court held that \u00a7 102(c)(4) of the Act \u201cmust be read independently of the terms [such as the negotiation requirements of \u00a7 102(b)(2)(D)(i)(IV) ] contained in other see-tions of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77,194.</p>\n<p id=\"Av\">Similarly, in <em>Bernardini v.Exxon Corp., </em>1981-1 Trade Cas. at 75,770, the court de-dined plaintiff\u2019s invitation to read 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(c)(4) in conjunction with other provisions of the PMPA. Specifically, it held that the franchisor relying on that section had no obligation to make a bona fide offer to sell, transfer or assign the renewal option to the franchisee as it must under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D)(iii)(I) if the franchisor relies on its determination to convert, replace or sell the premises or not to renew the franchise as uneconomical, <em>See also Brungardt v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>530 F.Supp. 744, 746-47 (D.Kan.1982). As the court noted in <em>Veracka v. Shell Oil Co., </em>655 F.2d at 448, the Act\u2019s reference to expiration of the lease is without reference to the expiration\u2019s cause.</p>\n<p id=\"Azl\">The obligation that the district court imposed on Texaco, the duty to negotiate concerning the franchisor\u2019s interest in the land, could have been, but was not, imposed by Congress on a franchisor who relies on the lease expiration under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(c)(4). Significantly, in two specific circumstances, those covered under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2802(b)(2)(E) and 2802(b)(3)(D), Congress imposed such an obligation on the franchisor. Texaco\u2019s decision may fit within 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(E) in that it might have been found to be \u201ca determination made by the franchisor in good faith and in the normal course of business to withdraw from the marketing of motor fuel through retail outlets in the relevant geographic market area in which the market-ing premises are located.\u201d Such a determination constitutes a basis for nonrenewal only if the franchisor offered to sell, transfer, or assign its interest in the premises to the franchisee. Even if this issue were squarely presented,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when the franchisor has two statutory bases for its nonrenewal, one that is conditional and one that is not, its reliance on the nonconditional basis would not be precluded. Otherwise, the courts would be adding a qualification to the statutory language which Congress did n\u00b0t impose.</p>\n<p id=\"AbY\">Because the district court believed that Texaco did not fit within one of the 12 statutory illustrations of an event that makes nonrenewal \u201creasonable\u201d, it proceeded to determine the \u201creasonableness\u201d of Texaco\u2019s action. It is apparent from the legislative history that this is the proper standard to be applied to <em>non-enumerated </em>grounds for nonrenewal or termination. The Senate Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amr\">One of the grounds specified in paragraph 2 of section 102(b) as a ground for termination or nonrenewal is the occurrence of an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship as a result [of which] termination or nonrenewal of the franchise is reasonable. Subsection (c) of section 102 sets forth an illustrative list of such events. The enumerated list is not exclusive. Other events satisfying the statutory standards set forth in section 102(b)(2)(C), but not enumerated in the list set forth in subsection (c) of section 102, may nevertheless serve as a ground for termination or nonrenewal under section 102(b)(2)(C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7d\">However, the enumerated list is intended to provide a measure of Conges-sional intent with respect to the meaning of this statutory standard. For that reason the term \u201cincludes events such as\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>utilized. Thus, a judicial determination may be made that an event, other than one enumerated in this list, or an event similar but not identical to one enumerated in the list, constitutes an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship as a result of which termination or non-renewal is reasonable. However, events which are not enumerated in subsection (c) must be carefully scrutinized by the courts prior to a determination that the statutory standard set forth in section 102(b)(2)(C) has been satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Senate Report at 37-38, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Accordingly, courts have examined the reasonableness of a franchisor\u2019s action when based on grounds not specified in the enumerated list. <em>Compare Hifai v. Shell Oil Co., </em>704 F.2d 1425, 1430 (9th Cir.1983) (franchisor acted reasonably in recovering possession of premises so that it could avoid forfeiture of the improvements) with <em>Brach v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>677 F.2d 1213, 1219-23 (7th Cir.1982) (nonrenewal because franchisee failed to purchase the marketing premises must be examined for materiality of a real estate contract to franchise relationship, reasonableness of terms of the real estate contract, and whether the default was beyond the reasonable control of the franchisee). <em>Cf. Kostantas v. Exxon Co., </em>663 F.2d 605 (5th Cir.1981) (franchisee\u2019s death justified termination), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 1009, 102 S.Ct. 2302, 73 L.Ed.2d 1305 (1982). However, because we have found that Texaco\u2019s nonrenewal fit within 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(c)(4), the court could not evaluate the reasonableness of Texaco\u2019s action under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">There is no other statutory basis to apply a reasonableness test here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is of some significance that even where Congress did subject certain franchisor\u2019s decisions to judicial scrutiny, it eschewed a broad \u201creasonable business judgments\u201d test, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ar-dedup-0\">At this point it is appropriate to note that considerable debate has focused upon recognition of so-called \u201creasonable business judgments\u201d of the franchisor as grounds for termination or non-renewal. <em>This standard has not been adopted by the committee. </em>Instead, a two-fold test has been utilized to judge <em>certain specified determinations </em>including that of market withdrawal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">One test is whether the determination was made \u201cin good faith\u201d. This good faith test is meant to preclude sham determinations from being used as an artifice for termination or non-renewal. The second test is whether the determination was made \u201cin the normal course of business\u201d. Under this test, the determination must have been the result of the franchisor\u2019s normal decisionmaking process. These tests provide adequate protection of franchisees from arbitrary or discriminatory termination or non-renewal, yet avoid judicial scrutiny of the business judgment itself. Thus, it is not necessary for the courts to determine whether a particular marketing strategy, such as a market withdrawal, or the conversion of leased marketing premises to a use other than the sale or distribution of motor fuel, is a wise business decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Senate Report at 37, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 895-96 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">We recognize that there are strong policy reasons to support Lugar\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>that a franchisor should be obliged to offer to sell, assign or transfer its option to purchase the premises. Unlike a lease, which would involve the franchisor in a continuing obligation to its lessor, the purchase of the premises by the dealer would probably terminate the franchisor\u2019s responsibilities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, in enacting the PMPA, Congress undertook the delicate task of balancing the competing interests of fuel franchisors and their dealers. In light of the detailed obligations it imposed on franchisors under certain circumstances, such as the duty to offer to assign a purchase option, we believe that we cannot impose that obligation where Congress did not. Consequently, the district court erred in holding that Texaco\u2019s failure to negotiate the assignment of the purchase option took it outside the terms of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the expiration of Texaco\u2019s lease justified its failure to renew Lugar\u2019s franchise as provided in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C) and 2802(c)(4), and that Texaco\u2019s option to purchase the premises does not change this result. Therefore, we will reverse the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for Lugar and remand with direction to enter summary judgment for Texaco.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">. The court also entered judgment for Lugar on Texaco\u2019s counterclaim seeking attorneys\u2019 fees for what it claimed was Lugar\u2019s \"frivolous\" suit. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(d)(3). Texaco has not appealed that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"As\">. Lugar did not cite or rely on this section in the district court in opposition to Texaco\u2019s motion far summary judgment, nor does it cite or rely on it here. Our jurisprudence ordinarily limits our consideration to issues presented by the parties. <em>See Battle v. Pennsylvania, </em>629 F.2d 269, 271 n. 1 (3d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 968, 101 S.Ct. 3123, 69 L.Ed.2d 981 (1981). Because of the failure to present the issue below, the district court did not make any findings as to the applicability of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(E).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\">. The provision at issue here is unlike those considered by this court recently in <em>Sun Refining &amp; Marketing Co. v. Rago, </em>741 F.2d 670 (3d Cir.1984). There, the franchisor sought to justify termination on the two grounds enumerated as justifications for termination or nonrenewal in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(c)(8) and (9): the franchisee\u2019s failure to pay money due in a timely manner and its failure to operate the station for ten consecutive days. Because the statute excuses a franchisee\u2019s failures when they are due to \"a cause beyond the reasonable control of the franchisee,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801(13)(B), we were obliged to analyze whether the franchisee\u2019s failure to open the station for ten days was unwarranted before we could find that the termination was justified under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(c)(9). <em>Rago, </em>741 F.2d at 674. Significantly, we held that termination was justified so long as the franchisor had met the terms of one condition for termination, even if it did not qualify under the other condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\">. Texaco argues that it is uncertain whether they could assign the purchase option apart from the lease. <em>But see Meyers v. Epstein, </em>37 Pa. D <em>&amp; </em>C 2d 549, 554-58 (C.P.Leh. County 1965). Texaco also expressed concern that a default by Lugar would open it to liability, an issue on which we express no opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
