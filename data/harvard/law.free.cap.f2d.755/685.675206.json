She raises three issues on appeal. First, she contends that her fourth and fifth amendment rights were violated when she was compelled, pursuant to a grand jury subpoena, to provide handwriting exemplars. She attempts to distinguish <em>United States v. Mara, </em>410 U.S. 19, 21, 93 S.Ct. 774, 775, 35 L.Ed.2d 99 (1973) (production of handwriting exemplars before grand jury is not a \u201cseizure\u201d within the meaning of the fourth amendment); <em>United States v. Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. 1, 15, 17, 93 S.Ct. 764, 772, 773, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1973) (grand jury may obtain evidence without first establishing probable cause) and <em>Gilbert v. California, </em>388 U.S. 263, 266-67, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 1953-54, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967) (compelling the production of handwriting samples for purposes of identification does not violate one\u2019s fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination) by arguing that these cases are inapplicable because she was required to write a portion of the exemplars in a backward slant, unlike her natural handwriting. After carefully reviewing the arguments of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>the parties and the relevant case law, we reject Richardson\u2019s argument on the basis of Judge Oliver\u2019s opinion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Richardson\u2019s second argument is that she cannot be convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 because a United States Treasury check is not a \u201cthing of value\u201d within the meaning of that statute. We reject this argument on the basis of Judge Oliver\u2019s opinion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Finally, Richardson contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict. We disagree. The evidence adduced at trial reveals ample evidence to support the verdict. At the time the check was stolen from the home of Gerald and Barbara Dye, Richardson was a real estate agent for a firm which the Dyes had hired to sell their home and she had access to a key to the Dyes\u2019 home. Richardson\u2019s fingerprints were found on the stolen check and a stolen deposit slip used to cash the check. A handwriting expert testified that, based on comparisons with the handwriting exemplars which Richardson produced for the grand jury, Richardson \u201cprobably\u201d signed \u201cBarbara Dye\u201d on the stolen check and \u201cBarbara L. Dye\u201d on the stolen deposit slip, and \u201cthere was some evidence\u201d that she signed \u201cGerald Dye\u201d on the check. Finally, during the period of time that the stolen check was cashed and $400 in cash taken, exactly $400 in cash was deposited in Richardson\u2019s account. The jury could properly have concluded from this evidence that there was no reasonable doubt that Richardson had stolen and converted the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir.R. 14.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
