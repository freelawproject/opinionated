Simonson Co. sought declaratory relief and liquidated damages for an alleged breach of a covenant not to compete. It now appeals from the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants-appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Green Textile Associates, Inc. (GTA) and Maurice J. Simon (Simon). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">On September 13, 1979, the Nedlog Company, an Illinois corporation, agreed to purchase a beverage company from GTA, GTA\u2019s president Simon, and Wilmot H. Si-monson Co. (WHS-Mass.), a Massachusetts corporation. At the time, the beverage company, WHS-Mass., was a wholly owned subsidiary of GTA. The Simonson name was among the assets to be transferred to Nedlog. Prior to the sale, Simon\u2019s brother-in-law, Richard Green (Green), was the vice president, assistant treasurer, clerk, and a director of WHS-Mass.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Shortly before closing of the. sale on October 3, 1979, Nedlog organized an Illinois corporation by the name of Wilmot H. Si-monson Co. (Simonson) and assigned its rights under the September 13 agreement of sale to this new corporation. Thus, Si-monson acquired the assets of WHS-Mass. and later became the plaintiff in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The dispute concerns the liability of GTA and Simon for Green\u2019s competition with Simonson. At the heart of the dispute is paragraph 8.0 of the agreement of sale, entitled \u201cCovenants Not to Compete,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">[WHS-Mass.], [GTA] and Simon, jointly and severally, hereby agree that, from the date of execution of this Agreement, <em>and for a period often (10) years thereafter, </em>and in any area in which [WHS-Mass.] or [Nedlog] (or any of their respective parent, subsidiary or affiliated entities) currently conduct their business they (or <em>any of their respective subsidiary, parent or affiliated entities or persons </em>) shall not directly or indirectly become a shareholder, member, partner, employee, investor, counsel, associate, agent, advisor, or participate in any manner with any corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship or any other business, entity or person (i) which directly or indirectly engages in the same or similar business as [Nedlog] or [WHS-Mass.] as they currently conduct their business or (ii) which directly or indirectly solicits the principals, customers or clients of [Ned-log] shall make payment to [WHS-Mass.] (or any assignee approved by [Nedlog] in writing in the exercise of its reasonable discretion) of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($100,000.00) payable in eight (8) annual installments of TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($12,500.00) each, the first payment to be due a year from the Closing Date. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">A crucial issue is whether or not Green was an \u201caffiliated person\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 8.0 and, thus, whether his competition with Simonson constituted a breach by GTA and Simon of the covenant not to compete. In this connection, another provision of the agreement of sale required Nedlog to hire Green as an employee of its subsidiary, Simonson. That obligation was set forth in paragraph 7.1 of the sale agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">[Nedlog] agrees that on Closing Date, it will enter into an Employment Agreement in the form of Exhibit \u201cD\u201d attached hereto with Richard Green for a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date at an annual salary of TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($25,000.00). Pursuant to that agreement, Richard Green will perform for [Nedlog] substantially the same duties as he now performs for [WHS-Mass.].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">Simonson and Green executed the employment agreement on October 3, 1979, the date on which the sale was closed. The employment agreement contained a covenant barring Green from competing with Simonson for a period of three years following the termination of his employment, as opposed to the ten-year period covered by paragraph 8.0 of the sale agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">On November 24, 1980, Simonson fired Green. After he was discharged, Green obtained employment with one of Simon-son\u2019s competitors, only to be fired after three months. Green then found employment with a second competitor of Simon-son, but was again fired after ten months.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Alleging that Green\u2019s employment with these competitors constituted a breach by GTA and Simon of paragraph 8.0\u2019s ten-year covenant not to compete, Simonson brought this action for a declaratory judgment \u2014 to determine the rights and duties of the parties \u2014 and for liquidated damages. Green was not a party to the sale agreement and is not a party to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Both sides moved for summary judgment. The district court, in an unpublished memorandum and order, concluded that Green was, at the time the parties agreed to the sale, an \u201caffiliated person\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 8.0. The court added, however, that \u201cGreen was not an affiliated person at the time of his disputed activities,\u201d since he had by then severed his ties with GTA. The issue, then, for the district court was GTA\u2019s liability for competitive activities by a person who was \u201caffiliated\u201d at the time of sale but not at the time of the competitive activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Finding no guidance in the language of the sale agreement or the prior negotiations, the court applied Massachusetts law \u2014 as required by the agreement of sale and by Green\u2019s employment agreement with Simonson \u2014 and construed the perceived ambiguity of paragraph 8.0 against Simonson, the putative drafter of the contract. <em>See Chelsea Indus., Inc. v. AccuRay Leasing Corp., </em>699 F.2d 58, 61 (1st Cir.1983). Since that paragraph, if construed against Simonson, would not bar competitive activities by a person no longer \u201caffiliated\u201d with GTA, the court allowed GTA\u2019s and Simon\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This appeal by Simonson followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">We disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Green was an \u201caffiliated person\u201d at the time of the agreement of sale. The short of the matter is that the agreement of sale not only required Simonson to hire Green; it specifically incorporated his employment agreement. Whereas the sale agreement barred competition by WHS-Mass., GTA, Simon, and \u201caffiliated entities or persons\u201d for a period of ten years, the employment agreement barred competition by Green for a period of only three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">In interpreting the scope of paragraph 8.0, we are assisted by several principles. \u201cContract interpretation is largely an individualized process, with the conclusion in a particular case turning on the particular language used against the background of other indicia of the parties\u2019 intention.\u201d <em>United States v. Seckinger, </em>397 U.S. 203, 212 n. 17 at 213, 90 S.Ct. 880, 885 n. 17 at 886, 25 L.Ed.2d 224 (1970). <em>Accord Shea v. Bay State Gas Co., </em>383 Mass. 218, 222-23, 418 N.E.2d 597, 600 (1981). <em>Cf. Chelsea Indus., Inc. v. AccuRay Leasing Corp., </em>699 F.2d 58, 60 (1st Cir.1983) (contract is what parties reasonably understand). \u201c[T]he meaning given by the parties to a term in an integrated agreement may be affected by the factual setting in which the agreement is negotiated.\u201d <em>Blake Bros. Corp. v. Roche, </em>12 Mass.App. 556, 558, 427 N.E.2d 501, 503 (1981). The Appeals Court of Massachusetts also observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">\u201cThe interpretation of an integrated agreement is directed to the meaning of the terms of the writing or writings in the light of the circumstances\u201d of the transaction. [Citations omitted.] No form of words is self-interpreting; meaning can only be understood in context. [Citation omitted.] However, \u201cafter the transaction has been shown in all its length and breadth, the words of an integrated agreement remain the most important evidence of intention.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-11\"><em>Thomas v. Christensen, </em>12 Mass.App. 169, 175, 422 N.E.2d 472, 476-77 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">In <em>Chelsea Indus., Inc. v. Florence, </em>358 Mass. 50, 260 N.E.2d 732 (1970), the Supreme Judicial Court, confronting a purchase contract that was coupled with an employment contract \u2014 both of which contained covenants not to compete \u2014 stated: \u201cThe two contracts were part of a single transaction. In construing them, weight must be given to that circumstance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55, 260 N.E.2d at 735. Here, too, the agreement of sale and the employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>agreement \u201cwere part of a single transaction.\u201d Where \u201cthe two contracts together seem reasonably complete,\u201d Massachusetts law provides that they \u201care to be treated as an integrated agreement setting forth the entire understanding reached by the parties.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>12 Mass.App. at 174, 422 N.E.2d at 476 (citing <em>Robert Indus., Inc. v. Spence, </em>362 Mass. 751, 754, 291 N.E.2d 407, 409 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Reading the documents as a unit, we conclude that Green could not have been an \u201caffiliated person\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 8.0, because the parties included in his employment agreement a separate covenant not to compete. As in <em>Florence, </em>the covenants not to compete in the sale and employment agreements \u201cdeal in very similar, but not precisely the same, manner with the same subject matter.\u201d 358 Mass, at 55, 260 N.E.2d at 736. We take the three-year covenant of the employment agreement, which is specific to Green, as the only covenant applicable to him. If the parties had intended Green to be an \u201caffiliated person\u201d under paragraph 8.0\u2019s ten-year covenant, the three-year covenant would have been unnecessary. <em>Cf. Florence, id. </em>at 56, 260 N.E.2d at 736 (\u201cWe are not persuaded that each of these provisions was to operate independently of the other, or that each had any significant separate business purpose.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">What is more, the employment agreement\u2019s covenant, in placing a three-year limit on competition by Green, implies that he would be free to compete at the conclusion of the three-year term. That right would be nugatory if its exercise compelled GTA\u2019s forfeiture of $100,000, under paragraph 8.0\u2019s ten-year covenant. We cannot believe that the parties intended such an implausible result, particularly when we consider the contract as a whole, \u201cthe circumstances and background of its negotiation and execution,\u201d and its purpose. <em>See East Coast Aviation Corp. v. Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>346 Mass. 699, 704-05, 195 N.E.2d 545, 548 (1964). \u201c[W]e cannot ignore the basic rule of construction that we must give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions and construe the language to give it reasonable meaning wherever possible.\u201d <em>Shea v. Bay State Gas Co., </em>383 Mass. 218, 224-25, 418 N.E.2d 597, 601 (1981). To avoid a repugnancy between the employment and sale agreements, we must conclude that Green\u2019s conduct was governed only by the three-year covenant in which he was specified, and that the ten-year covenant referred to others when it barred competition by \u201caffiliated persons.\u201d Of course, the issue whether Green breached the covenant not to compete in his employment agreement is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Given our understanding of paragraph 8.0, which does not depend on who drafted the sale agreement, we need not consider plaintiff-appellant\u2019s contention that the district court erred in assuming that Simonson was the drafter. Moreover, contrary to Simonson\u2019s suggestion, it is not necessary to consider further evidence of the parties\u2019 intentions, since we find paragraph 8.0 \u2014 in conjunction with the employment agreement \u2014 unambiguous. <em>See Robert Indus., Inc. v. Spence, </em>362 Mass. 751, 756, 291 N.E.2d 407, 410 (1973). \u201c[T]he parol evidence rule bars giving effect to any agreement not contained in the integrated writings,\u201d and extrinsic evidence that Green\u2019s conduct was barred by paragraph 8.0 would only \u201cput an \u2018impossible strain\u2019 on the words used.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Christensen, </em>12 Mass.App. 169, 176, 422 N.E.2d 472, 477 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">To defeat GTA\u2019s and Simon\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Simonson was required to \u201cestablish the existence of an issue of fact [that was] both \u2018genuine\u2019 and \u2018material\u2019.\u201d <em>Hahn v. Sargent, </em>523 F.2d 461, 464 (1st Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 904, 96 S.Ct. 1495, 47 L.Ed.2d 754 (1976). While the meaning of paragraph 8.0 is a material issue, it is not a genuine issue. \u201c[L]ook[ing] at the record in the light most favorable to, and indulgpng] all inferences in favor of [Simonson],\u201d we conclude, nevertheless, that no \u201cfurther exploration of the facts is really necessary.\u201d <em>Packish v. McMurtrie, </em>697 F.2d 23, 27 (1st Cir.1983) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
