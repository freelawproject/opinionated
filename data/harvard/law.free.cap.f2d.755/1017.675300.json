(\u201cLincoln\u201d or the \u201cCamp\u201d), of his one-year contract of employment with Lincoln. The district court granted Lincoln\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that Lincoln had terminated the contract pursuant to a clause that the court construed to permit Lincoln to terminate Rothenberg\u2019s employment at any time, with or without cause. On appeal, Rothen-berg contends (1) that the court misinterpreted the clause, and (2) that even if that clause purported to allow Lincoln to terminate at will, the termination was impermissible because the law of the State of New York requires just cause for the early termination of an employment contract for a stated term. We conclude that summary judgment was improperly granted, and we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">In July 1983, Rothenberg and Lincoln signed an agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) for the employment of Rothenberg as the Camp\u2019s assistant director from May 2, 1983, through May 1, 1984, at an annual salary of $30,000. The Agreement contained a provision (\u201cClause 4\u201d) stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak1i\">[i]f for unforseen <em>[sic </em>] condition, circumstance, war, epidemic, governmental restriction, administrative decision, Act of God or any other reason the Camp should find it advisable to terminate this agreement before * the contract expiration date, either party shall provide the other party with two weeks\u2019 notice, salary for which period shall constitute sev-erence <em>[sic </em>] pay in full discharge, release and settlement of any and all claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amq-dedup-1\">The portion of Clause 4 preceding the asterisk was part of a preprinted form supplied by Lincoln; the asterisk and the portion following it were added by . hand. Clause 5 of the Agreement gave the Camp the right to terminate the Agreement for cause, and made no provision for notice or severance pay. On or about August 16, 1983, Lincoln gave Rothenberg notice that it was terminating the Agreement effective August 21, 1983, and on August 20 it gave Rothenberg a check apparently designated as severance pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-12\">Rothenberg promptly commenced the present diversity action, contending that the August 1983 termination constituted a breach of the Agreement and seeking payment of the remaining $19,000 due for the agreed term of his employment. Lincoln moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, contending that Clause 4 gave it the right to terminate the Agreement for any reason, and that in any event it had terminated the Agreement because Rothenberg\u2019s services had been unsatisfactory and detrimental to the Camp. Rothen-berg cross-moved for summary judgment in his favor, asserting (1) that Clause 4 could not be construed as broadly as Lincoln would have it, since the phrase \u201cfor any reason\u201d should be read, in accordance with the principle of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>allowing termination only for any unstated <em>force majeure </em>reason, and (2) that he had consistently been informed that his services for the Camp were satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">The district court granted Lincoln\u2019s motion, finding that Clause 4 clearly and unambiguously allowed Lincoln to terminate the Agreement \u201cfor any other reason,\u201d and that the rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>therefore did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">On appeal, Rothenberg contends that summary judgment should have been granted in his favor because (1) the district court should have applied the principle of <em>ejusdem generis </em>to conclude that Lincoln was not entitled to terminate the Agreement on its whim, and (2) where, as here, the employment contract was for a definite term, New York law does not permit the employer to terminate the contract prior to the agreed termination date without just cause. Although we do not agree that Rothenberg was entitled to summary judgment, we conclude that summary judgment could not properly be granted against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">A. <em>The Meaning of Clause 4</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-9\">As a general matter, the objective of contract interpretation is to give effect to the expressed intentions of the parties. <em>E.g., Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Wesolowski, </em>33 N.Y.2d 169, 171-72, 350 N.Y.S.2d 895, 898, 305 N.E.2d 907, 910 (1973); <em>Mallad Construction Corp. v. County Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, </em>32 N.Y.2d 285, 291, 344 N.Y.S.2d 925, 930, 298 N.E.2d 96, 101 (1973); <em>Airco Alloys Division, Airco, Inc. v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., </em>76 A.D.2d 68, 77, 430 N.Y.S.2d 179, 184 (4th Dep\u2019t 1980); 4 S. Williston, <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 600 (3d ed. 1961). Where the language of the contract is unambiguous, and reasonable persons could not differ as to its meaning, the question of interpretation is one of law to be answered by the court. <em>West, Weir &amp; Bartel, Inc. v. Mary Carter Paint Co., 25 </em>N.Y.2d 535, 540, 307 N.Y.S.2d 449, 452, 255 N.E.2d 709, 712 (1969); <em>Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Turner Construction Co., 2 </em>N.Y.2d 456, 459, 161 N.Y.S.2d 90, 92, 141 N.E.2d 590, 592 (1957); <em>Heller &amp; Henretig, Inc. v. 3620-168th Street, Inc., </em>302 N.Y. 326, 330, 98 N.E.2d 458, 459 (1951); 3 A. Corbin, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 554, at 222 (1960). However, \u201c[wjhere contractual language is susceptible of at least two fairly reasonable interpretations, this presents a triable issue of fact, and summary judgment [is] improper.\u201d <em>Heyman v. Commerce &amp; Industry Insurance Co., </em>524 F.2d 1317, 1320 (2d Cir.1975) (quoting <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Giesow, </em>412 F.2d 468, 471 (2d Cir.1969)); <em>see M. O\u2019Neil Supply Co. v. Petroleum Heat &amp; Power Co., </em>280 N.Y. 50, 56, 19 N.E.2d 676, 679 (1939); <em>Holgerson v. Swan Lake Poultry Co., </em>30 A.D.2d 591, 592, 290 N.Y.S.2d 21, 23 (3d Dep\u2019t 1968). Since an interpretation that gives a reasonable and effective meaning to all the terms of a contract is generally preferred to one that leaves a part unreasonable or of no effect, <em>Corhill Corp. v. S.D. Plants, Inc., </em>9 N.Y.2d 595, 599, 217 N.Y.S.2d 1, 3, 176 N.E.2d 37, 39 (1961); <em>Rentways, Inc. v. O\u2019Neil Milk &amp; Cream Co., </em>308 N.Y. 342, 347, 126 N.E.2d 271, 273 (1955); <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 203(a) (1981), we are persuaded that there are at least two fairly reasonable interpretations of Clause 4 and that summary judgment was therefore improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">The district court held that the phrase \u201cfor any other reason\u201d in Clause 4 meant that the contract was terminable at will by the employer. Such a reading gives literal effect to the words of that phrase and is therefore not unreasonable. Yet if this had been the intent of the parties, there would have been no reason to include in Clause 4 a listing of any specific grounds for termination. If the parties had intended that the Agreement be terminable at will, Clause 4, rather than mentioning \u201cun-forseen [sic] condition, circumstance, war, epidemic, governmental restriction, administrative decision[, or] Act of God,\u201d could have begun simply \u201cIf for any reason the Camp should find it advisable to terminate this agreement [etc.]____\u201d The latter read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>ing is essentially the one advanced by Lincoln and adopted by the district court; yet it renders entirely superfluous the seven bases for termination specifically described in Clause 4 as actually drafted. We cannot conclude that making meaningless the seven specifications was clearly and unambiguously the intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Rothenberg\u2019s contention that the \u201cany other reason\u201d phrase of Clause 4 should be read in accordance with the principle of <em>ejusdem generis </em>as \u201cany other <em>similar </em>reason\u201d is thus not an unreasonable argument. Though this principle \u201cis not in and of itself a rule of interpretation, but merely an aid to interpretation when the intention is not otherwise apparent^ and i]t never controls when it clearly appears from the instrument that no such limitation was intended,\u201d <em>Brooklyn City Railroad Co. v. Kings County Trust, </em>214 A.D. 506, 511, 212 N.Y.S. 343, 347 (2d Dep\u2019t 1925), <em>aff'd, </em>242 N.Y. 531, 152 N.E. 414 (1926) (per curiam), its use here would not be inappropriate since it is hardly clear that the parties intended the general phrase to be so all-encompassing as to render the seven specified grounds for termination mere surplusage. <em>See Kama Rippa Music, Inc. v. Schekeryk, </em>510 F.2d 837 (2d Cir.1975), in which we affirmed, principally on other grounds, the district court\u2019s narrow construction of the phrase \u201cor for any similar or dissimilar reason\u201d that followed a list of <em>force majeure </em>events similar to the seven items listed in Clause 4. There we noted that <em>ejusdem generis </em>might properly have been applied to \u201cconstru[e] this final and most generic term in [the] series in light of the more specific terms preceding it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 841 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">Thus, there is more than one reasonable interpretation of Clause 4, and we conclude that there are fact questions, to be determined by a jury, as to whether the parties intended that a Clause 4 termination could be effected at will or only for a <em>force majeure </em>type reason. Rothenberg, in support of his position on the motions for summary judgment, submitted his affidavit stating that prior to entering into the Agreement he had advised the Camp\u2019s President, Harold Loren, that he would leave his prior employment and work for the Camp only if guaranteed employment for at least one year and that the possibility of the Camp\u2019s terminating his employment prior to the end of the year was never discussed. The Camp, in contrast, submitted Loren\u2019s affidavit which suggested that all of the terms of the Agreement\u2014 and in particular Clause 4 which was modified by hand \u2014 had been negotiated. There are circumstances that could give credence to each position. In support of the Camp\u2019s position, there is the fact that Clause 4\u2019s provision for notice and a payment to be deemed severance pay was written in by hand at the foot of the Agreement. It is difficult to believe that Rothenberg signed the Agreement, just below this insertion, without being aware of the possible breadth of Clause 4. On the other hand, it is also difficult to believe that Rothenberg, knowing that camping is a seasonal activity, would have granted the Camp the power to terminate his one-year contract early without cause when the bulk of his services would have been performed within the first four months of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">The record thus raised substantial questions as to the intent of the parties. Although a jury might reach the conclusion that the parties intended the \u201cfor any other reason\u201d phrase to give Lincoln license to terminate for any reason whatever, rather than just for a reason of the type already specified, that conclusion was not a proper one for the court to reach as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">B. <em>State Law Requirement of Cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-9\">Notwithstanding the above discussion as to the possible interpretations of Clause 4 and our conclusion that its meaning could not properly be determined as a matter of law, it is possible that the factual questions as to Clause 4 will not, ultimately, have to be decided by the jury, for as a general rule under New York law, \u201c[a] contract of employment for a definite term may not lawfully be terminated by the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>ployer, prior to the expiration date in the absence of just cause,\u201d <em>Alpern v. Hurwitz, </em>644 F.2d 943, 945 (2d Cir.1981) (applying New York law); <em>accord Levine v. Zerfuss Offset Plate Service Co., </em>492 F.Supp. 946, 948 (S.D.N.Y.1980); <em>Crane v. Perfect Film &amp; Chemical Corp., </em>38 A.D.2d 288, 291, 329 N.Y.S.2d 32, 34 (1st Dep\u2019t 1972); <em>Carter v. Bradlee, </em>245 A.D. 49, 50, 280 N.Y.S. 368, 370 (1st Dep\u2019t 1935), <em>aff'd, </em>269 N.Y. 664, 200 N.E. 48 (1936) (per curiam); <em>Vogel v. Pathe Exchange, Inc., </em>234 A.D. 313, 318, 254 N.Y.S. 881, 886 (2d Dep\u2019t 1932) (contract for a stated term may be terminated by employer only for a \u201ccause sufficient in law which would justify an employer in discharging an employee\u201d). This rule applies even where the employment contract, by its terms, purports to reserve to the employer the right to terminate the contract at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">In <em>Carter v. Bradlee, </em>for example, the Appellate Division construed an employment contract that stated that \u201c[t]his Agreement is made for two years from November 1st, 1925, but it is understood and agreed that <em>we retain the right to terminate the Agreement and to discharge you at any time, should we feel called upon to do so for any reason.\u201d </em>245 A.D. at 50, 280 N.Y.S. at 370 (emphasis added). Despite the apparently unequivocal reservation by the employer of the right to terminate the contract at will, the <em>Carter </em>court held that the employer was entitled to discharge the employee prior to the expiration of the contract term only for a \u201c \u2018reasonable\u2019 ground ... that ... must be attended with good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court rejected the contention that the contract should be read as entitling the employer to terminate it at will, reasoning that an interpretation that \u201cwould place one of the parties at the mercy of the other\u201d was to be avoided. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">If this general principle is applicable to the present case, it will make the Camp\u2019s reliance on Clause 4 irrelevant, for if the termination was with just cause Clause 4 need not have been invoked, while if the termination was without just cause Clause 4 could not lawfully be invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">Two exceptions, however, have been carved from the general principle. First, where the employment depended upon a close, confidential relationship, such as between an attorney and client or an individual and his personal servant, the employment contract was considered terminable at will by either party, notwithstanding any stated term. <em>See, e.g., Martin v. Camp, </em>219 N.Y. 170, 114 N.E. 46 (1916) (attorney-client); <em>Brill v. Brenner, </em>62 Misc.2d 102, 308 N.Y.S.2d 218 (N.Y.C.Civ.Ct.1970) (personal servant). Second, where the contract provided unequivocally that the employer could terminate the contract without cause but was thereupon obligated to pay a penalty to the employee, termination without cause was held not to constitute a breach if the penalty was paid. <em>See Olsen v. Arabian American Oil Co., </em>194 F.2d 477, 478 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>344 U.S. 817, 73 S.Ct. 12, 97 L.Ed. 636 (1952); <em>Reiss v. Arabian American Oil Co., </em>279 A.D. 805, 109 N.Y.S.2d 625, 626 (2d Dep\u2019t 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">The first exception plainly does not apply to the present case. The employment relationship between a camp and its assistant director does not involve the special closeness or confidentiality that characterize relationships such as those between individuals and their personal servants or clients and their attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-10\">The applicability of the second exception is unanswerable from the present record. First, it is not clear how strictly the New York courts adhere to the proposition that a provision for termination without cause must be unequivocal, or, in this context, how those courts would regard Clause 4. Second, as Clause 4 is framed, it is not clear whether the employee was expected to work during the two-week period following the giving of notice. If he was expected to render services during that period, we doubt that New York law would consider the employer\u2019s payment a \u201cpenalty.\u201d Thus, there are questions of both law and fact to be determined in connection with the applicability here of the general New York principle that an employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>contract for a stated term may not be terminated without just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">Finally, if the general principle is applicable here, there will remain questions of fact for the jury as to whether or not the Camp terminated Rothenberg for cause. Although Rothenberg\u2019s affidavit stated that the Camp officials had always informed him that his services were being performed in a satisfactory manner, Loren\u2019s affidavit stated that Rothenberg\u2019s services had clearly proven unsatisfactory; the Camp\u2019s answer to the complaint alleged that Rothen-berg had made false and unauthorized representations to the parents of campers that caused those campers to decide not to return to the Camp for the following season, and that these were the reason for Lincoln\u2019s decision to terminate Rothen-berg\u2019s employment. Plainly there are issues of fact to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">The judgment of the district court dismissing the complaint is vacated, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Costs to appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
