In the opinion, the court rejected the government\u2019s argument that Mr. James was barred from raising certain issues on appeal because he had not asserted them in his petition for review before the board. The opinion reasoned that the pertinent regulation, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115, provides only limited grounds for review and that litigants, thus, cannot raise all possible grounds for review in a petition for review. Under the government\u2019s theory, a litigant would have to either ignore the board\u2019s regulations or take a direct judicial appeal to preserve all issues raised before the presiding official. The court\u2019s principal concern is that procedures of the board and the court not create procedural traps for employees, many of whom do not have the benefit of legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">In a prior decision, <em>Lizut v. Department of the Army, </em>717 F.2d 1391 (Fed.Cir.1983), the court refused to consider certain claims raised on appeal which had not been raised to the board either by separate petition or in the party\u2019s response. In the court\u2019s discussion of this ease in <em>James, </em>the government perceives that the MSPB review process is described as a two-step procedure, the first step being the petition for the board to accept review, the second step being the substantive arguments submitted if, and when, review was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">The government is correct that the discussion in <em>James </em>contemplated that, when a petition for review is granted, the board could hear oral arguments, require the filing of briefs, and give the parties an opportunity, upon request, to supplement the original grounds stated in the petition for review or response. This discretionary procedure is, in fact, set forth in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.116. The court\u2019s assumption was based not only on this regulation, but also on its experience in reviewing prior cases where the board has done more than simply decide the issue stated in a petition for review. The government, however, has advised, by way of a declaration of the clerk of the MSPB, that \u201cgenerally no additional pleadings [other than the petition for review and response of the other party] are accepted by the Board\u201d and that the grant of review and the decision on the merits of the case are announced in a single Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">In view of this enlightenment, the court accepts that its understanding of the board\u2019s actual operating procedures was in error, in that 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.116 is rarely available to a party. However, the need for protection of an employee\u2019s rights from a technical waiver appears all the more imperative in view of the board\u2019s one-step review procedure and the restriction of is-' sues contained in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115. Thus, we reaffirm that the petition for review does not limit the issues before this court. The issues or, as in <em>Lizut, </em>the claims, to be heard in a particular case before this court will be determined on the basis of whether the circumstances of the particular case show that the petitioner or respondent knowingly abandoned or waived claims or issues raised below. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>party will, of \u2022 course, not generally be heard on any issues raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In <em>James, </em>upon denial of the petition for review, the unmodified decision of the presiding official became the final decision of the board and all issues raised before the presiding official were appealable. Nothing in the record reveals an affirmative abandonment or waiver of any issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In <em>Lizut, </em>the presiding official had dismissed two claims for lack of jurisdiction (one dealing with right to a promotion; the other dealing with the refusal of the agency to take steps to enable Lizut to secure early retirement). This court refused to address the dismissal of these claims and considered only the third claim (dealing with a removal action) with respect to which a petition for review had been filed by the government. Lizut, in response to the government\u2019s petition, <em>expressly </em>endorsed the presiding official\u2019s decision in all respects. A waiver was, thus, effected as to the other claims. Thus, as stated in the original <em>James </em>opinion, <em>Lizut </em>is clearly not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The petition for rehearing is <em>denied.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
