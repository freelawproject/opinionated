This appeal does not raise the central question of the constitutionality of the Act\u2019s new \u201cpreventive detention\u201d provisions, as Acevedo is held in custody for a traditional reason \u2014 namely that, if released, he may try to tamper with his trial, by, for example, interfering with witnesses or jurors or otherwise \u201cobstructing justice,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1501-1515. We reject Acevedo\u2019s central legal claim \u2014 that the magistrate and district court cannot rely upon hearsay evidence when denying him release \u2014 for the lawfulness of the practice of using hearsay evidence at bail hearings is well established. Nothing in the new Act forbids the use of hearsay, where reliable. The evidence presented at the detention hearing is sufficient to justify the conclusions of both magistrate and district judge that Acevedo ought to be detained. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision. 600 F.Supp. 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b294-18\">On November 15, 1984, a federal grand jury indicted Acevedo and several others charging them with having robbed the Tail-lex Company of over $600,000 worth of diamonds. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 1951 (substantive and conspiracy offenses). After Acevedo was arrested, the government sought a pretrial \u201cdetention hearing,\u201d under the authority of \u00a7 3142(f) of the new Bail Act. At the hearing, held before a federal magistrate, the government supported its request for Acevedo\u2019s detention with the testimony of an FBI agent, Jeffrey Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-19\">Hill stated that he was in charge of the FBI\u2019s investigation of the Taillex robbery. He said that the defendant and others had planned the robbery; and that the others had kidnapped the Taillex office manager, had forced him to open the Taillex safe, had taken about 770 diamonds (that had been shipped to Taillex from New York), and had given the diamonds (valued at $620,000) to Acevedo (in return for $135,-000). In Hill\u2019s words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-20\">Hector Acevedos [sic] conceived the robbery. He conducted surveillances of the plant with another individual, and also of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>a manager of one of the two plants, knowing that an abduction of one of the managers was going to be one of the methods in which the thing was carried out, and following the actual robbery\u2014 receiving the goods \u2014 he received them and paid for them. The money was split by the other participants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Acevedo\u2019s counsel cross-examined Hill. The magistrate then found \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that Acevedo had committed the offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Hill went on to testify about Acevedo\u2019s alleged \u201cdangerousness.\u201d He said that the FBI had evidence that Acevedo had previously participated in several serious crimes \u2014\u201creliable\u201d evidence that consisted of informant information, statements made by other participants in the crime, and tape recordings. The previous crimes, he said, included: 1) the murder-robbery in 1974 of a jeweler, Leo Dershowitz; 2) the murder-robbery in 1974 of another jeweler, Howard Block; 3) the murder-robbery in 1974 of a third jeweler, Abraham Shafizadeh; 4) a conspiracy to murder and to rob the owner of a gold manufacturing company; 5) an armed robbery of the Conseguera jewelry store in Mayaguez in 1981; 6) the burglary of the Gordon jewelry store in 1980 (and a related kidnapping); 7) an attempt to buy a police file with information about the investigation of the Shafizadeh murder; 8) bribery of jurors in two prosecutions brought against Acevedo based on his attempted purchase of the Shafizadeh investigatory file.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Agent Hill testified about many, but not all, of these incidents in some detail. In most instances he said that his information was based upon interviews with actual (cooperating) participants in the crime. In many instances he said that he had corroboration from tape recordings containing the voices of other participants in the crimes. In the Gordon jewelry store abduction/robbery, for example, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2T\">we have got ... a statement of a participant [and we] have got a victim\u2019s statement that corroborates exactly letter-by-letter just about how the participant stated it occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">In the investigatory file matter, Hill said that Acevedo had tried to buy the Shaviza-deh file from an undercover policeman in order to \u201cdestroy [the file,] ... to determine the witnesses that he suspected had been found ... and kill those witnesses.\u201d He said Acevedo was caught in the act. He said that his information consisted of testimony of the policeman, tape recordings on which Acevedo\u2019s voice was heard, and photographs of the actual purchase transaction (which Hill had with him). Hill added that Acevedo had been tried twice for the crime, but, in each instance, the trial had resulted in a hung jury. Hill said that the FBI had information that Acevedo \u201cpaid over a hundred thousand dollars\u201d to bribe enough jurors to obtain nonverdicts. This information came from \u201c[FBI Form] 302 testimony [from] agent interview\u201d of persons \u201creliable in the past\u201d including a \u201ccooperating defendant in another matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Acevedo had two attorneys who cross-examined Hill on two occasions. Counsel sought, through cross-examination, to discredit the reliability of Hill\u2019s statements (for example, by pointing out that Acevedo had not been convicted of trying to purchase the police file). Counsel were hampered in their efforts to discredit Hill, however, by the government\u2019s refusal to allow Hill to name the witnesses whose statements the FBI relied upon or to provide other information that might enable Acevedo to identify them. The government said that such identification might endanger the witnesses\u2019 lives. It added that identification might hamper its ongoing investigation into the claimed jury-tampering efforts. And, it said, in respect to the Taillex robbery/probable cause aspect of the case, that it need not provide Acevedo with a detailed picture of the evidence it would use at trial. Defense counsel sought public disclosure of the evidence underlying Hill\u2019s testimony; they did not ask the magistrate to review that evidence <em>in camera.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The magistrate initially decided to detain Acevedo pending trial. He concluded in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">there is a serious risk that the defendant will obstruct or attempt to obstruct justice. No condition or combination of conditions can assure the safety of the Government\u2019s witnesses and the community, or insure the proper administration of justice in the defendant\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">After hearing several character witnesses testifying in Acevedo\u2019s favor, the magistrate later reaffirmed that conclusion. Acevedo asked the district court to revoke or to revise the magistrate\u2019s order. After considering the transcript and listening to defendant\u2019s arguments of law, the district court refused to do so. Acevedo now appeals from that district court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Acevedo, anxious for a speedy decision, did not file separate briefs in this court, but simply presented oral argument. We have nonetheless examined the arguments made below with care, we have read the entire record, including the hearing transcript, and, on the basis of our own research, we are convinced that the decisions of the district .court and the magistrate are lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">We note at the outset two well-established propositions of law. First, the right of an accused person to bail, while critically important, <em>Stack v. Boyle, </em>342 U.S. 1, 4, 72 S.Ct. 1, 3, 96 L.Ed. 1 (1951), is not absolute. Where risk of flight is unusually great, a court may deny bail and keep a defendant in custody in order to insure that the trial will take place. <em>United States v. Abrahams, </em>575 F.2d 3 (1st Cir.) (upholding against statutory and Eighth Amendment challenges pretrial detention without bail where risk of flight was exceptional), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 821, 99 S.Ct. 85, 58 L.Ed.2d 112 (1978); <em>United States v. Melville, </em>306 F.Supp. 124, 127 (S.D.N.Y.1969) (bail may be denied in cases presenting exceptional flight risk). Similarly, where the court finds that a defendant\u2019s release creates an unusual risk of obstruction of justice, the Constitution and relevant statutes permit detention. <em>United States v. Graewe, </em>689 F.2d 54 (6th Cir. 1982) (per curiam) (upholding pretrial detention without bail where necessary to protect witnesses and judicial process); <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>425 F.2d 490, 491-92 (D.C.Cir.1969) (\u201ccourts have the inherent power to confine the defendant in order to protect future witnesses at the pretrial stage as well as during trial\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Bentvena, </em>288 F.2d 442 (2d Cir.1961) (upholding against statutory and Fifth and Eighth Amendment challenges revocation of bail during trial where necessary to protect integrity of judicial proceedings). The second of these bail exceptions flows logically from the first, for an eventual trial that reflects witness intimidation or jury tampering is as bad as no trial at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Second, magistrates and judges traditionally have been permitted to base their decisions, both as to release conditions and as to possible detention, on hearsay evidence, such as statements from the prosecution or the defendants about what they can prove and how. This authority rests primarily upon the need to make the bail decision quickly, at a time when neither party may have fully marshalled all the evidence in its favor. It may also reflect the realization that at least some hearsay on some occasions may be fairly reliable, perhaps more reliable than certain direct evidence. For example, well-kept records, though hearsay, may be more reliable than eyewitness accounts of, say, a road accident on a foggy night. In any event, the need for speed necessarily makes arraignments, \u201cprobable cause\u201d determinations, and bail hearings typically informal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for discovery. Often the opposing parties simply describe to the judicial officer the nature of their evidence; they do not actually produce it. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d)(3); Fed.R.Crim.P. 5.1(a); Uniform Rules of Criminal Procedure \u00a7 344(f), 10 U.L.A. 103 (1974); <em>see generally Gerstein v. Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 95 S.Ct. 854, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>430 A.2d 1321 (D.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>App.1981) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1022, 102 S.Ct. 1721, 72 L.Ed.2d 141 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Given this background, the two open legal issues that this appeal raises are: 1) whether the new Bail Act changes the evi-dentiary rules and now forbids magistrates to rely upon hearsay evidence in ordering detention; and 2) whether the record here contains sufficient evidence to warrant a detention decision. We consider each question in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">a. Several features of the new Bail Act support appellant in his claim that, regardless of past practice, detention can no longer rest upon hearsay evidence. First, the Act significantly extends the scope of pretrial detention, authorizing judicial officers to keep accused persons in custody, not only on grounds of risk of flight, or of obstructing justice, but also on grounds of general \u201cdangerousness\u201d \u2014 that, if released, for example, they might commit other crimes. <em>See generally </em>S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983). Appellant argues that this broadening of the bases for detention (the constitutionality of which is not here in issue) led Congress to narrow the courts\u2019 authority as to the <em>type </em>of evidence upon which a confinement decision may rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Second, appellant\u2019s claim draws some support from the new statute\u2019s language. The statute provides that the courts can detain allegedly dangerous persons \u2014 those whose release puts at serious risk \u201cthe safety of any other person [or] the community,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f) \u2014 only if the finding of dangerousness is \u201csupported by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the accused person has a right to representation by counsel, \u201cto testify, to present witnesses ..., to cross-examine witnesses who appear ..., and to present information by proffer or otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This language seems to foresee a more elaborate and formal proceeding than current practice exemplifies.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Third, one might ask how the specific statutory right to cross-examine can be made meaningful where hearsay is at issue. How can the accused cross-examine a witness who does not appear? How can he question information, the source of which remains confidential? Must Congress not have intended that the government produce such witnesses or sources at the detention hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">Despite the strength of these arguments, our reading of the statute and legislative history convinces us that Congress did not intend to forbid the judicial officer to rely upon investigatory descriptions of evidence (and similar hearsay) where the judicial officer reasonably concludes that those descriptions, reports, and similar evidence, in the particular circumstances of the hearing, are reliable. For one thing, the new statute itself (in the very section granting a defendant procedural rights) explicitly states that \u201c[t]he rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and consideration of information at the [detention] hearing.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">For another thing, the relevant legislative history states that Congress intended to retain the informality of pre-existing bail hearings. The Senate Committee report, in describing the statutory language we have quoted, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">It is the intent of the Committee <em>to retain current law </em>so that any information presented or considered in any of the release or detention proceedings need not conform to the rules of evidence applicable at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">S.Rep., <em>supra, </em>at 22 n. 65 (emphasis added). Neither the new statute nor its history reflects any effort to modify Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d)(3), which specifically exempts bail hearings from the evidentiary rules prohibiting the use of hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">Further, the magistrate or judge possesses adequate power to reconcile the competing demands of speed and of reliability, by selectively insisting upon the production of the underlying evidence or evidentiary sources where their accuracy is in question. Through sensible exercise of this power of selection, the judicial officer can make meaningful defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine without unnecessarily transforming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the bail hearing into a full-fledged trial or defendant\u2019s discovery expedition. In fact, even in an unusual case, where the government provides strong special reasons for keeping its evidentiary sources confidential <em>(e.g., </em>protecting witness safety), the magistrate or judge, upon defendant\u2019s request, can still test the veracity of the government\u2019s testimony and the quality of the underlying evidence, by, for example, listening to tapes or reading documents <em>in camera. Cf. United States v. Stanford, </em>551 F.Supp. 209, 210-11 (D.Md.1982) (upholding bail hearing <em>in camera </em>inspection requested by <em>government </em>over defendant\u2019s opposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Finally, this interpretation of congressional intent is confirmed by the fact that Congress, in designing the new statute, relied heavily upon a similar statute in effect in the District of Columbia and upon the case of <em>United States v. Edwards, supra, </em>in which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals upheld the statute. <em>See </em>S.Rep., <em>supra </em>at 7-10, 22. When enacting the earlier statute, the House Judiciary Committee stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8e\">as is the present practice under the Bail Reform Act, ... the use of sworn testimony will be the exception and not the rule____ [B]ail hearings under the Bail Reform Act, which frequently result in detention of the accused, proceed primarily by way of proffers. They are not formal trials requiring strict adherence to technical rules of evidence. <em>If the court is dissatisfied with the nature of the proffer, it can always, within its discretion, insist on direct testimony. </em>But the discretion should be left to the court without imposing on it the burden of limiting admissibility to that it would permit a jury to hear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">H.R.Rep. No. 907, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 182, 184 (1970) (emphasis added). When it upheld the lawfulness of the District of Columbia Act, all eight judges who discussed the hearsay issue said that hearsay alone could meet the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evi-dentiary requirements of that statute, <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>430 A.2d at 1334 (quoting above-quoted language of H.R.Rep. No. 907); <em>id. </em>at 1360 n. 16 (Fer-ren, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">For these reasons, we conclude that Congress, in enacting the new Bail Act, did not change pre-existing law, which, as a general matter, allowed a magistrate or judge to consider hearsay evidence and to rest a determination upon that evidence where it is sufficiently reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">b. We must still ask whether the evidence presented to the magistrate in this case \u2014 through the testimony of Agent Hill \u2014 was sufficiently strong and reliable to meet the statutory \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d requirement. We believe that it was for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">First, Agent Hill\u2019s testimony was given under oath and was for the most part detailed and consistent. It described the nature of the evidentiary sources upon which it relied \u2014 tapes, photographs, coconspirator statements, interviews, and so forth\u2014 sources that suggest a strong evidentiary basis for Hill\u2019s conclusions. Defendant\u2019s ability to cross-examine Hill provided at least some check on Hill\u2019s veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">Second, Hill\u2019s testimony indicates that most of the evidence supporting his \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d conclusion (in respect to the Shavizadeh file) was publicly available. The government had presented it in two trials against defendant. Defendant was thus aware of the evidence. He could have questioned Hill about it or presented conflicting evidence. His counsel\u2019s failure to do so indicates that the accuracy of Hill\u2019s description of that evidence was not in question. (Indeed, Acevedo does not here claim that Hill\u2019s description of this evidence was inaccurate.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">Third, Acevedo made no effort to challenge the accuracy of Hill\u2019s descriptions of the tapes or FBI interviews of co-conspirators. The government hampered his ability to do so by denying him descriptions of this evidence that might be used to identify witnesses. But, Acevedo might at least have asked the magistrate to review the tapes or interview information <em>in camera. Cf. United States v. Stanford, supra. </em>Such examination offers a practical way to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>reconcile the (here plausibly established) need for witness protection with defendant\u2019s reasonable interest in securing an independent judicial check on the quality of the evidence the government advances as a ground for his detention. We do not here mean to suggest that <em>in camera </em>presentation of evidence is often desirable or often permissible except in a very unusual case. Rather, we mean simply that in the very unusual case in which strong special reasons warrant confidentiality \u2014 and where the defendant is apprised of the gist of the evidence through government testimony at the hearing \u2014 the magistrate\u2019s independent, though <em>in camera, </em>review of the underlying evidence at defendant\u2019s request offers the defendant greater protection than no independent check at all. <em>Cf. </em>Fed.R. Crim.P. 16(d)(1). Defendant\u2019s failure even to ask for such a check, or in any way to cast doubt on the accuracy of Agent Hill\u2019s descriptions here tends to justify the magistrate\u2019s decision to accept those descriptions as accurate. And, if accurate, they justify detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Fourth, Acevedo\u2019s primary attack on Hill\u2019s evidence consists of the claim that the magistrate ought to reject it \u2014 in respect to the obstruction of justice/file purchasing charge \u2014 because two juries, when presented with this evidence, failed to convict Acevedo of \u201cobstruction of justice.\u201d Yet Hill also testified that the government had reliable information (including testimony of cooperating codefendants) that Acevedo had twice avoided conviction by tampering with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Under these circumstances, the magistrate was free to take both earlier and later evidence of obstruction of justice into account. Indeed, when it passed the new Bail Act, Congress specifically referred to the question of whether the magistrate could rely on a defendant\u2019s past bad conduct that had led to indictment but not conviction. The Senate Judiciary Committee wrote in its report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">Under current law, consideration of a defendant\u2019s criminal history is confined to his record of convictions. See 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 3146(b). While a prior arrest should not be accorded the weight of a prior conviction, the Committee believes that it would be inappropriate to require the judge in the context of this kind of hearing to ignore a lengthy record of prior arrests, particularly if there were convictions for similar crimes. <em>Similarly, it would be improper to prohibit consideration of prior arrests if there were also evidence that the failure to convict was due to the defendant\u2019s intimidation of witnesses. </em>In any event, independent information concerning past criminal activities of a defendant certainly can, and should, be considered by a court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">S.Rep., <em>supra, </em>at 23 n. 66 (emphasis added). We see no statutory or constitutional obstacle to carrying out Congress\u2019s expressed intent on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">For these reasons, we conclude that the evidence that release of Acevedo would have posed an unacceptable risk of obstruction of justice was \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d Under the circumstances presented here, neither the new Bail Act nor the Constitution prohibits the government\u2019s presentation of this evidence at the detention hearing through the testimony of Agent Hill. The decision of the district court allowing Acevedo\u2019s detention pending trial is</p>\n<p id=\"a_p-dedup-0\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
