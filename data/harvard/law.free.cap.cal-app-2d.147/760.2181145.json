The three pages were found clipped together at the top with a paper clip and folded together, and the containing envelope was endorsed, \u201cRose Plumer\u2019s Will.\u201d All three sheets were dated in decedent\u2019s handwriting, November 15, 1948, but only one of the sheets bore Rose Plumer\u2019s signature. It is conceded that two of the sheets constitute a valid, holographic will. The contest herein relates to the third sheet entitled \u201cMemorandum for Executors,\u201d dated and written in decedent\u2019s handwriting but unsigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">On the first page of the admittedly valid holographic will, executors were named and instructions given for burial. At the bottom of this first page the decedent started a list of assets which list is continued on the second page. After leaving a blank space of several inches, Mrs. Plumer dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>and signed this page. No legatees or devisees are therein named nor is there any disposition of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The third sheet here under discussion, folded and clipped to the other two sheets, entitled \u201cMemorandum for Executors,\u201d is in decedent\u2019s handwriting, and commences with the statement, \u201cI want my friends to be remembered,\u201d followed by nine names, the last of which has been deleted and initialed by decedent. The paper then states: 1 \u2018 The cash in envelope marked \u2018Mitchell Lewis Personal\u2019\u2014is to be used to pay funeral expenses &amp; remainder to be, after,-\u2014-Executors Fees &amp; expenses, divided with the above named friends.\u201d Several items of jewelry and furnishing are likewise mentioned which are to be given to certain designated persons. The name of one beneficiary has been changed, the alteration being initialed by the decedent. As hereinbefore indicated, this third sheet is unsigned. In addition to the three sheets folded and clipped together, the envelope contained two other papers neither dated nor signed, one of which contained a list of war bonds while the other gave information concerning decedent\u2019s safe deposit box. These last mentioned sheets are not claimed to be a part of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The trial court found \u201cThat the three sheets (original will and memorandum for executors) . . . are each testamentary in character and constitute one instrument and should be read and construed together as a complete, harmonious and homogeneous Will\u201d; that the three sheets are \u201cintegrated,\u201d and \u201cthat the signature of Hose Plumer on the second page of the Will was written by her with the intention that it should serve as a token of execution by her of her Will consisting of three pages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">That these finding of the trial court find substantial support in the record cannot be doubted. Such being the situation, a reviewing court may not enter upon a reconsideration or revaluation of the evidence. Moreover, the determination arrived at would seem to give proper effect to the intentions of Mrs. Plumer without doing violence to established rules of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cOn the question of the proper execution of a will, the intention of the testatrix is entitled to no consideration.\u201d It is also argued that \u201cThe legislature did not intend that a separate document headed \u2018Memorandum for Executors\u2019 dated but unsigned should constitute a part of a will which is complete in itself and signed at the bottom,\u201d and that strict adherence to statutory requirements is required in order to prevent fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Such contentions, however, lose sight of the fact that the doctrine of integration in connection with testamentary disposition is well established in this state, and clearly applicable to the present situation. <em>In re Dumas\u2019 Estate, </em>34 Cal.2d 406 [210 P.2d 697], integration is defined as \u201cthe association of disconnected writing by their internal sense, their coherence, or adaption of parts.\u201d This doctrine is distinguished from that as \u201cincorporation by reference,\u201d and applies where \u201cit is clear that two or more separate writings are intended by the testator to be his will. \u2019 \u2019 This case contains various appropriate citations involving situations where \u201cseveral writings, connected by sequence of thought, . . . folded together, ... or physically forming one document... have been admitted to probate as constituting an holographic will. <em>In re Estate of Wunderle, </em>30 Cal.2d 274, 281 [181 P.2d 874, 878].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">So also, in <em>Estate of Moody, </em>118 Cal.App.2d 300, 308 [257 P.2d 709], the reviewing court says: \u201cIf the papers are all holographic and there is a dating and signing somewhere among them, it is immaterial when or where the dating or signing was done so long as it may be reasonably inferred that the testator meant all the papers together to constitute his will and that the signature was written with the intent that it should serve as a token of execution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Although it is true that mere intention of a testatrix cannot cure the defects of an invalid will, the testamentary document herein considered cannot be deemed an invalid will. Again quoting from the Moody case, just cited, a will \u201cmay consist of several sheets of paper, and it does not in and of itself matter that one of such sheets standing along would not constitute an executed will.\u201d Appellant\u2019s argument that \u201cwhere the possibility of fraud exists, the courts are strict\u201d in reference to such matters, can have no application to the present controversy in which no issue of fraud is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Finally, it is appellant\u2019s contention that \u2018\u2018 Costs should be deferred to the conclusion of the matter and then should be charged to the estate.\u201d The trial court, \u201cin its discretion,\u201d as provided in section 1232 of the Probate Code, ruled that defendants \u201care entitled to recover their costs from contestant.\u201d There has been no showing of any abuse of discretion in this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">As hereinbefore indicated, the court\u2019s findings that all three pages were intended as the will of testatrix and that the sheets in question are all properly integrated, are amply supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>by both law and evidence, and no reversible error has been pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">White, P. J., and Fourt, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 20, 1957.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
