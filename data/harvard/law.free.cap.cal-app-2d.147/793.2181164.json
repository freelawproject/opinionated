Defendant admitted to a police officer that he had put his hand on Janice\u2019s leg and that he had kissed her once.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The only contention is that \u201cIn light of the acquittal of the defendant of the charge of child molesting, there is no evidence to sustain a conviction of the charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">The offense of contributing to the delinquency of a minor is necessarily included in the offense defined in section 288 of the Penal Code, and a conviction of contributing to the delinquency of a minor is an acquittal of a violation of section 288. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Greer, </em>30 Cal.2d 589, 598 [184 P.2d 512].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>46 Cal.App.2d 857 [117 P.2d 15], cited with apparent approval in <em>People </em>v. <em>Greer, supra, </em>the defendant was charged with aiding and abetting her codefendant in the commission of statutory rape. The question as stated by the court was: \u201cWhere a defendant is charged in one count with the violation of section 261 of the Penal Code, can such defendant be found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor (section 702, Welfare and Institutions Code), a misdemeanor, where no such crime is charged or alleged in the information or complaint?\u201d The court held (p.858) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-9\">\u201cThe minor prosecutrix testified that her clothing was removed against her will by appellant and that appellant then placed said minor on the bed and held her down while the act of intercourse was accomplished. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>\u201cThere was sufficient evidence introduced to justify the trial court in finding appellant guilty as charged in the information. However, it is apparent that the trial judge discounted a great deal of the testimony and disbelieved some portions of it, but the evidence was sufficient to support his finding that appellant committed the offense of which he found her guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-5\">\u201cThe only question raised which is worthy of discussion is, whether the court was justified as a matter of law in rendering the judgment which it did. There is some slight conflict in the decisions as to the law on this subject, but it is the better rule to hold that, where the acts committed tended to show the commission of the acts charged and where such acts in themselves actually constituted the lesser offense, i.e., contributing to the delinquency of the minor, a conviction had of the lesser offense should be sustained. The judgment rendered would prevent the retrial of appellant upon the original charge, for the reason that it amounted to an acquittal of the greater crime, to-wit: aiding and abetting in the commission of the crime of statutory rape, which is a felony, while the lesser offense, of which appellant was found guilty, is a misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">In <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>27 Cal.2d 500 [165P.2d 1], the same contention was made as defendant makes here. The court answered (p. 502) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">\u201cWhile it is true that acts constituting statutory rape or attempted rape may also constitute a violation of section 702, since those acts by their very nature would contribute to the delinquency of the minor, the converse is not true. The facts may fail to establish rape or attempted rape yet justify a conviction under section 702. Consequently, petitioner\u2019s acquittal under the first count of the information is not a bar to his prosecution and conviction under the second count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-8\">\u201cPetitioner also claims that not only is the occurrence underlying the rape charge identical with that relied upon to support the accusation under section 702, but that the proof in support of the two charges is the same. He says that he would be guilty of rape if the things the prosecutrix testified to actually occurred, but that if her story is untrue he is not guilty of any offense. Petitioner argues that his acquittal of rape and of the included offense of attempted rape establishes the falsity of her testimony, and that he cannot be retried upon evidence which was addressed to the charge of which he stands acquitted. There is no merit in this contention. The jury may reject a portion of the testimony of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>witness and accept a part of it. The testimony accepted by the jury may support a conviction of one offense, while another charge contained in the same information may fail because the jury has rejected evidence necessary to establish an essential element of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Greer, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d 589, the defendant was charged with statutory rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. 1), and lewd and lascivious conduct (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288) arising out of the same act. In a previous trial he was charged not only with these identical offenses but also with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, the same person on whom the rape and lewd and lascivious conduct were alleged to have been committed. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 702.) In that trial he was found guilty of violating section 702, but the jury disagreed as to the counts of statutory rape and lewd and lascivious conduct. The court observed: \u201cIn the first trial, therefore, it was not necessary for the district attorney to charge a violation of section 702 to obtain a conviction of defendant for committing that offense. He could have charged statutory rape and lewd and lascivious conduct, and the jury, under proper instructions, could have returned a verdict of guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor,\u201d citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.2d 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In the case at bar there was sufficient evidence introduced to have warranted the trial judge in finding defendant guilty as charged in the information.  To establish a violation of section 288 there must be proof of a specific intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify the lust or passions or sexual desires of the defendant or of the child. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>42 Cal.2d 219, 223 [266 P.2d 38].)  Proof of such specific intent is not necessary to establish the commission of the offense commonly called contributing to the delinquency of a minor. It is apparent the trial judge discounted some parts of the testimony of Janice. He may have had a reasonable doubt that defendant had the specific intent required by section 288. The evidence was adequate to support his finding that defendant committed the offense of which he found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">Defendant\u2019s acquittal of a violation of section 288 of the Penal Code is not a bar to his conviction of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Defendant appealed from the judgment and the sentence imposed. The judgment in a criminal action is the sentence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tokich, </em>128 Cal.App.2d 515, 519 [275 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>P.2d 816], See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>146 Cal.App.2d Supp. 904 [304 P.2d 271].) Affirmance of the judgment carries with it affirmance of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Shinn, P.
