No request was then made to include additional matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">On September 21, 1956, respondent filed in the superior court a motion for correction of the reporter\u2019s and clerk\u2019s transcripts on appeal in this action which motion was heard in Department 11 on October 5, 1956. Bruce Murchison, attorney for appellants, was present at the argument of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>motion, and as pointed out by respondent, the appellants \u201cat that time could have called to the Court\u2019s attention the matter which he now wishes included in the record but he failed so to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">As to the prejudice that will ensue to respondent should the motion herein be granted in its entirety, it is urged that \u201cthe accident to respondent occurred on February 11, 1953, and the trial of the within action ended on March 5, 1956. It has taken from that date until the present time to get the record filed in this court. Respondent is a little girl now nine (9) years of age whose parents have no funds,'and who urgently needs two additional operations to correct conditions caused by the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">As stated in <em>Estate of Easton, </em>136 Cal.App. 213, 216 [28 P.2d 376], \u201c. . . parties to an action must take notice of the contents of a record that comes to the appellate courts.\u201d In the instant case it is plain that appellants were not taken by surprise nor have they shown any excusable neglect or other good cause to secure the relief prayed for. We are satisfied that the application should be denied insofar as it asks for inclusion in the record of all instructions requested by the parties and refused by the court. This because of the unexcused delay of appellants in seeking their relief, and further because of the manifest injustice that would occur to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">It is therefore ordered that the record on appeal he augmented by adding to the clerk\u2019s transcript on appeal herein a supplement showing separately each instruction given to the jury, by whom each such instruction was requested, and whether the same was -given as requested or was given as modified by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">And it is further ordered that the clerk of the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles be, and he is hereby directed to prepare said supplemental transcript in accordance with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">It is further ordered that the time for appellants to file their opening brief herein be and it is hereby extended until 30 days after said supplemental transcript herein ordered has been filed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">In all other respects the application is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
