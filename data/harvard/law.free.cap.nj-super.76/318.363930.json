J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A5E\">Defendant was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape <em>(N. J. S. </em>2A:90-2). His conviction was based on the verdict of a jury in the County Court. The sole ground on which defendant seeks reversal of the conviction is based on remarks during summation by an assistant prosecutor (other than the attorney who appeared for the Slate on the argument of this appeal). No objection to the remarks was made at trial by defendant\u2019s then attorney. However, it is claimed by defendant\u2019s present attorney that the remarks were so prejudicial as to constitute plain error <em>(R. R. </em>1:5-1(a), 2:5), warranting reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The proofs on behalf of the State were that at about 2:30 A. M. on May 16, 1961, the complaining witness, a young woman en route to her home, had stopped for refreshments at a diner following a visit at the home of a friend. She had driven to the diner in an automobile which she had parked on the adjacent public highway. The doors of the automobile were not locked. She testified that, after partaking of food she left the diner and, after driving the car a short distance towards her home, she was seized by defendant who had concealed himself on the floor in the rear of the car. She further testified that she was pricked by a knife held by defendant on the right side of her neck; that he ripped the back of her dress, addressed an obscene remark to her and seized her breast. She saw his face in the mirror. She stepped on the accelerator, swung the car to the right, flung open the car door and \u201cthrew\u201d herself out of the car onto the street. She testified that the next thing she knew she was being given medication by a doctor at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">A witness on behalf of the State, who was operating an automobile at a considerable distance behind the car of the complaining witness and in the same direction, testified that he saw \u201ca figure come up from back of the car\u201d; that the \u201cfigure * <em>* </em>* looked like a man\u201d; that the car veered from the highway and hit a parking meter. He further testified that he saw somebody-come out of the car and that on approaching the vehicle he found the complaining witness on the street in an hysterical condition. Another motorist arrived and the police were summoned. The witness later identified defendant as a person he had seen in the diner at the time the complaining witness was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The police officer who arrived at the scene described the hysterical condition of the complaining witness. The police found a cap on the floor of the car and a knife on the rear seat of the vehicle. Possessed of a description of the alleged assailant the police conducted an investigation at the diner and as a result thereof arrested defendant who resided in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>neighborhood. Defendant admitted the ownership of the cap and the possession of the <em>knife on </em>the night in question, but-denied assaulting the complaining witness. At trial he admitted that he had been with her in the car at the time of the alleged assault but testified that he had met her outside of the diner and at his suggestion they had agreed to drive to a tavern in a neighboring town; that as they started he occupied the righthand side of the front seat of the car; that he thought the complaining witness was partially intoxicated; that she drove the car at such an excessive, rate of speed that it swayed on the highway; that, concerned for his own safety, he applied his left foot to the brake and as the car slowed down he jumped out and ran away. He further testified that on entering the car with the complaining witness he had no intention of assaulting her physically and that he did not do so; that his intention was to steal a fur piece which she was wearing, and possibly some of her money, during the period he planned to be with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The record reveals that defendant had a criminal record. The first reference thereto was made by defendant\u2019s counsel during the selection of the jury. He uext alluded to it in his opening statement to the jury in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">\"In the voir dire when I questioned you as prospective jurors I suppose I have asked you to do something which some of us may feel it is almost humanly impossible to do, and that is to put aside any prejudices you may have, especially against (his man. It will be brought, out during the trial (hat the defendant did serve time in a prison for attempted rape, which is the same charge with which he is confronted here today. I think that the State will bring it out. I think that the State will harp on it. The State will seek a conviction merely on that basis because the facts as we know them ai\u2019e quite different than those related by the Prosecutor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">During the presentation of testimony reference to defendant\u2019s prior incarceration in prison was made both by defendant and by bis counsel. It was also emphasized by defendant\u2019s counsel in summation in urging the jury not to convict defendant on \u201cthe basis of a prior conviction or convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>During the trial defendant had been interrogated on cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">\u201cQ. So if they only were interested or if you only thought that they [the police] were interested in knowing your whereabouts, why did you think it was necessary to give a general statement about all these details?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">A. Because I did not have anything to hide and because of my past experience as an ex-eon, and I have been picked up and questioned, and when you are being picked up and questioned if you don\u2019t sort of give them where your activities were and where you have been after, well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">Q. What crimes were you convicted of? A. Two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">Q. What crimes? A. Attempt and of carnal abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">Q. By attempt, you mean attempted rape?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">A. That is the same one. That was in 1943.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-11\">Q. Did you plead to that, or were you convicted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-12\">A. I was convicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-13\">Q. What about the other crime? A. The other crime was brought down to assault and battery, which I received two to three years, to run with the ten to fifteen I was doing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">We turn to a consideration of the portions of the assistant prosecutor\u2019s summation on the basis of which defendant seeks reversal of his conviction. The statements were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-15\">\u201cHow do we come to conclude or infer or find the intent in the mind of this defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-16\">It is true we have his past record. He is a convicted criminal, and he has previously committed similar offenses. He is an admitted rapist. From that we can infer his motive and intent, the reason why he was in the back of this automobile on the morning of May 16th, the reason why he was carrying State\u2019s exhibit which is this knife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-17\"><em>V </em>\u00cd5 * $ $ $ $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-18\">The defense witness DeMarco, the defendant, the main, principal witness, this is for him playing for high stakes in this case. He is a two-time loser or, I should say, a convicted criminal for similar offenses, and don\u2019t you think it is important for him to do everything he would think humanly possible to avoid the penalty of a conviction under this crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-19\">Do you think he is entitled to any consideration or sympathy because he happens to be a convicted criminal?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-20\">Defendant, on this appeal, concedes the right of the State to show defendant\u2019s prior conviction of crime for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>of affecting Ms credibility (N. <em>J. S. </em>2A:81-12), but contends that \u201cplain error\u201d exists because: (a) the assistant prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant\u2019s criminal record during summation was designed \u201cto prevail upon the jury to return a verdict of guilty of the crime of assault with intent to rape by relying on the admission of the prior conviction of carnal abuse as establishing the very crime with which the defendant was charged\u201d; and (b) because of the above quoted portions of the summation in which reference was made to defendant as an \u201cadmitted rapist\u201d and that he was \u201ca convicted criminal for similar offenses.\u201d Defendant\u2019s brief states that because he had \u201cadmitted to one prior conviction of carnal abuse\u201d and had testified that \u201canother charge had been reduced to assault and battery\u201d the \u201cplural reference * * * to similar <em>offenses </em>was highly improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In view of defendant\u2019s own aforesaid testimony, descriptive of the crimes of which he had been convicted, we find no justification for his contention that on the basis of \u201cplain error\u201d we should reverse his conviction solely because, in summation, the assistant prosecutor used the words \u201ca convicted criminal for similar offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">However, no justification exists (under the circumstances of this case) for the assistant prosecutor\u2019s statement in summation that from the fact that defendant was an \u201cadmitted rapist\u201d and \u201ca convicted criminal, * * * his motive and intent\u201d in entering the car of the complaining witness can be gleaned. <em>State v. </em>Kociolek, 23 N. <em>J. </em>400, 418 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The question to be resolved is whether such impropriety, under the circumstances of the instant case, warrants the application of the plain error rule <em>(R. R. </em>1:5-1 (a), 2:5).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Plain error has been defined as \u201clegal impropriety affecting the substantial rights of the defendant and sufficiently grievous to justify notice by the reviewing court and to convince the court that of itself the error possessed a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result.\u201d <em>State v. Corby, </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>106, 108 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>We are convinced that the conviction of the defendant in the instant case was completely justified by the evidence. Proof of his guilt was overwhelming; his presence in the car of the complaining witness at the time in question was conceded; his testimony offered to explain his entry into the car and his story that he intended to rob the complaining witness and not to assault her was so incredible as to warrant its rejection by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The application of the plain error rule must depend upon a consideration of the magnitude of the alleged error and of the facts of the case under scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Initially, it is to be noted that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s remarks at the time they were made permits an inference that <em>\u201che </em>did not in the atmosphere of the trial think them out of bounds.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>31 <em>N. J. </em>489, 511 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We not only conclude that the conviction was so completely warranted by the proofs that no justification exists for the contention that the aforesaid impropriety \u201cpossessed a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result,\u201d but we are impressed with the completeness and accuracy of the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury in this connection. He clearly defined the respective functions of the court and jury, emphasizing that the jury must be guided by the law as pronounced by the court and must disregard observations referable thereto advanced by counsel. With equal clarity he \u25a0emphasized that the proof of previous conviction of crime was admissible as an attack on credibility. The charge in this connection was sufficiently comprehensive so that in our \u25a0opinion any possible harm flowing from the presently criticized remarks of the assistant prosecutor was overcome by the court\u2019s charge. <em>State v. Buffa, </em>31 <em>N. J. </em>378, 379 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The situation in the case at bar is far removed from what the Supreme Court found was \u201can aggravated appeal to prejudice\u201d in the remarks of the assistant prosecutor in summation in the case of <em>State v. Driver, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>255 (1962). It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>bears no similarity to the existence of numerous trial errors which, as stated in <em>State v. Orecchio, </em>16 <em>N. J. </em>125, 134 (1954), \u201cin their aggregate, clearly deprived the defendant of the type of trial upon which our system of criminal justice soundly insists.\u201d As stated in <em>Johnson, supra, </em>31 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>511, our courts have not hesitated to reverse convictions where we have found that the prosecutor by overstepping the bounds of propriety \u201ccreated a real danger of prejudice to the accused.\u201d We find no such situation here present. As observed in <em>Johnson, </em>at <em>p. </em>513, \u201cparticular remarks must be appraised in the setting of the whole trial.\u201d Although the remarks of the assistant prosecutor in the case at bar were, as we have observed, improper, in \u201cthe entire context of the trial we cannot say that they constituted plain error.\u201d <em>State v. Buffa, supra, </em>31 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>379.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The conviction of defendant, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
