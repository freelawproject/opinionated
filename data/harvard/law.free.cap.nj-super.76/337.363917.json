J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AWb\">Appellant Calvin J. Hurd, an attorney of this State, was convicted by a judge of the County Court, Law Division, of contempt committed in the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>presence of the court, lie was fined $25. He seeks a reversal of the conviction on the sole ground that the evidence at the hearing did not establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The contempt conviction was based on appellant\u2019s inexcusable failure to appear in the County Court as directed for the scheduled hearing of a \u201cmunicipal appeal\u201d in which defendant Alejandro Dias was represented by appellant, as attorney. The case was first scheduled for hearing on November 29, 1961 at 9:30 A. M., and was adjourned to December 4, 1961 because of Mr. Hurd\u2019s inability to appear due to a court engagement in another county, of which fact the trial judge was not apprised until after court convened on November 29, 1961. On December 4, 1961 Mr. Hurd was present but his client did not appear. On that occasion the trial judge, in the presence of Mr. Hurd, peremptorily scheduled the <em>Dias </em>appeal for hearing on December 6, 1961 at 9 :30 A. M. On that day Mr. Ilurd did not appear untiL 9 :52 A. M. The order adjudging him in contempt recites that his excuse for his failure io appear on December 6. 1961, as directed, was that \u201cho had been detained because of legal matters requiring attention in his law office.\u201d The court, finding his excuse unsatisfactory, adjudged that he was guilty of contempt committed \u201cin the actual presence of the Court\u201d and with \u201cthe intent to contemn the authority and dignity of the Court, and obstruct the due administration of justice * *</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\"><em>R. R. </em>1:5\u20142, 2:5, defining our scope of review of summary contempt convictions, provides for a review \u201cboth upon the law and the facts.\u201d In <em>Zimmerman v. </em>Zimmerman, 12 N. <em>J. Super. </em>61, 69 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950), we held that the review is a \u201ctrial <em>de novo </em>* * * [with] the facts * * * determined by a review of the evidence already taken, at least where the accused had a full opportunity to present his side of the case, and a stenographic transcript is available.\u201d See also, <em>State v. Zarafu, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>177, 183 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>In the instant case appellant makes no contention that he was not accorded a full hearing by the trial court; neither does-he deny that the alleged contempt is one which can be deemed to have taken place in the \u201cactual presence of the court.\u201d <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:10-1; <em>cf. State v. Gussman, </em>34 <em>N. J. Super. </em>408, 414-417 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"> Prom the stenographic record before us we conclude that the County Court was fully justified in its finding that the \u201cexcuse\u201d advanced by Mr. Hurd for his tardiness was unsatisfactory and that his delayed appearance, coupled with the wholly inadequate \u201cexcuse\u201d therefor, constituted contumacious conduct. The power summarily to punish for contempt committed in the actual presence of the court is essential to the court\u2019s protection in discharging its functions. See <em>In re Clawans, </em>69 <em>N. J. Super. </em>373, 378 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), certif. denied 36 <em>N. J. </em>296 (1962); <em>State v. Zarafu, supra, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>182.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The summary conviction of appellant is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
