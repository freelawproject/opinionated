Taylor pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 40-5-202, -401 through -443, MCA, for past child support which it alleged had not been paid. Charles requested an \u201cin-person\u201d administrative hearing pursuant to \u00a7 40-5-414, MCA, to contest the accuracy of the child support amount claimed. The request for an \u201cin-person\u201d hearing was denied; a telephonic hearing was held; and the Administrative Law Judge found that Charles owed $22,900 for past child support and ordered that the CSED could proceed with delinquency income withholding pursuant to \u00a7 40-5-415, MCA. Charles petitioned for judicial review in the District Court for the Sixth Judicial District in Park County. The District Court reduced the amount owed to $20,900, but otherwise affirmed the procedure, findings, and conclusions of the Administrative Law Jtxdge. Charles appeals from the order of the District Court. We reverse the District Court, vacate the income withholding decision and order, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it affirmed the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s denial of Charles\u2019 request for an \u201cin-person\u201d hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\n<em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In 1981, the Sixth Judicial District Court entered a decree dissolving the marriage of Charles and Marilyn Taylor. Marilyn was awarded custody of the couple\u2019s three children and Charles was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $125 per month per child. In 1982, after the dissolution, Marilyn and the three children moved from the family home in Livingston to Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In January 1984, the couple\u2019s son, Randy, moved back to Montana to live with his father, and continued to live with him until he reached the age of majority. The couple\u2019s oldest daughter, Amy, moved back and forth between Texas and Montana periodically. However, she lived primarily with her maternal grandparents in Livingston from May 1985 until she reached the age of majority on December 30,1990. The couple\u2019s youngest daughter, Jennifer, resided with her mother, except for periodic visits with Charles, until September 1992, when she moved back to Montana to permanently reside with Charles.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">In 1992, the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office requested the CSED to pursue an income withholding proceeding against Charles pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 40-5-202, -412, MCA, to collect child support payments which Marilyn alleged were past due and remained unpaid. Charles was sent notice of the CSED\u2019s intent to withhold money from his earnings; however, he disputed the amount claimed and requested a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 40-5-414, MCA. At the time of his request for a hearing, he also requested that it be \u201cin-person.\u201d In reliance on 46.30.607(1), ARM, the Administrative Law Judge denied Charles\u2019 request for an \u201cin-person\u201d hearing, but granted him leave to resubmit his motion following a telephonic hearing if he could establish substantial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The administrative hearing was held on October 18, 1993, by telephone. The Administrative Law Judge presided from Helena; Charles testified from his attorney\u2019s office in Livingston; Marilyn testified from Garland, Texas; and Karen Trettin, an investigator for the CSED, testified from her office in Helena. Jennifer and Amy testified from other locations which were not specifically identified. The quality of the telephonic connection was apparently poor. Amy complained of being unable to hear the others. They in turn com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>plained of difficulty understanding her; and at one time while Marilyn was talking, everyone had difficulty identifying the speaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">During the hearing, Marilyn and Charles basically agreed on the whereabouts of their children since their dissolution, and there was no apparent dispute regarding the amount that Charles did or did not pay for child support since the dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The disputed issue between the parties was whether Charles\u2019 child support obligation had been modified by an oral agreement in 1986. Charles testified that when Amy began living with her grandparents, Randy was living with him, and Jennifer still resided with her mother, the couple agreed not to exchange child support payments since each parent had one child and the third child was living elsewhere. He claimed that pursuant to the oral agreement, and our decision in <em>In re Marriage of Sabo </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 252, 730 P.2d 1112, Marilyn is estopped from claiming any further child support obligation after that point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Marilyn testified that she did agree to waive Charles\u2019 obligation to pay support for Randy, but adamantly denied any other agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Amy and Jennifer both testified that there had been an agreement similar to the one described by Charles, but that their mother repudiated the agreement during an angry confrontation with Charles at Randy\u2019s graduation.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The Administrative Law Judge found that Charles had not proven by sufficient evidence the necessary basis for estoppel, but concluded that Charles did not owe child support for Randy and Jennifer during those periods of time when they lived with him. He concluded that Charles owed $22,900 for past due support and authorized the CSED to proceed with delinquency income withholding pursuant to \u00a7 40-5-415, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Charles did not renew his request for an \u201cin-person\u201d hearing at the conclusion of his telephonic hearing, nor following issuance of the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision. He did, however, raise the denial of his original request on appeal to the District Court as one basis for reversal of the administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">Did the District Court err when it affirmed the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s denial of Charles\u2019 request for an \u201cin-person\u201d hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">Since this case involves the application of Montana law to undisputed facts, we will review the District Court\u2019s application of the law to determine if it was correct. <em>In re Marriage of Barnard </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>(1994), 264 Mont. 103, 106, 870 P.2d 91, 93 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Burris </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 265, 269, 852 P.2d 616, 619).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Charles contends that denial of his request for an \u201cin-person\u201d hearing in favor of a telephonic conference call violated his right to confront witnesses, which is guaranteed by Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., and our recent decision in <em>In re Marriage of Bonamarte </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 170, 866 P.2d 1132. He contends that he was adversely affected by the denial of this right because the issues of whether he owed past due support, and if so, how much, depended on whether his child support obligation had been orally modified, and that that determination depended upon the credibility of two witnesses who directly contradicted each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Rule 611(e) is made applicable to administrative proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-612(2), MCA, which provides as follows: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute relating directly to an agency, agencies shall be bound by common law and statutory rules of evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\"><em>Except as otherwise provided by constitution, statute, these rules, or other rules applicable to the courts of this </em>state, at the trial of an action, a witness can be heard only in the presence and subject to the examination of all the parties to the action, if they choose to attend and examine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">In <em>Bonamarte, </em>we recently held that telephonic testimony was inconsistent with this right to confront witnesses. We held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">If the phrase \u201ca witness can be heard only in the presence and subject to the examination of all the parties ...\u201d is to have any meaning, then, in the absence of a specific rule or statutory exception to the contrary, the witness must be physically present in the courtroom to testify personally at trial unless all parties and the court agree to a different method of examination which protects the parties\u2019 rights of confrontation and cross-examination and, at the same time, allows the fact finder to assess the witnesses] credibility, testimony and the evidence presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">Here, it was impossible for the court to make a determination as to the relative credibility of the party-witnesses because it did not have an opportunity to observe the testimony of both Mark and Judith. The parties in a dissolution action often deliver conflicting evidence, and it is the court\u2019s role to determine who is the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>credible witness. This can be accomplished most effectively by observing each party\u2019s demeanor during testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><em>Bonamarte, </em>866 P.2d at 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Furthermore, in <em>Bonamarte, </em>866 P.2d at 1137, we followed <em>State ex rel. Juvenile Dept. v. Gates </em>(Or. 1987), 740 P.2d 217, 218, for the conclusion that \u201c \u2018[t]he opportunity to observe a witness is so critical to judicial control and effective cross-examination that its denial is manifestly prejudicial.\u2019 \u201d We held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">[T]he District Court abused its discretion in allowing Judith to testify by telephone over objection at the hearing on the merits. We reverse and remand for a new trial in order to allow Mark a meaningful opportunity to \u201cconfront\u201d the witness and to effectively cross-examine and in order to afford the opportunity for the trial court to observe the witness and make its determination as to her credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANQ\"><em>Bonamarte, </em>866 P.2d at 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The CSED first argues that Charles was barred from raising the denial of an \u201cin-person\u201d hearing in District Court because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, as required by \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA, when he did not renew his request for that type of hearing at the conclusion of his telephonic hearing. However, we conclude that if Charles had a right to an \u201cin-person\u201d hearing in the first place, it was no remedy to require that he first incur the substantial expense of participating in an adversarial proceeding which was procedurally and statutorily defective before he could assert that right. Based on the cost of modern litigation, it is little consolation to a litigant that he or she will be afforded procedural rights only after being forced to participate in a proceeding during which they are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The CSED next contends that there is an exception to the confrontation requirement of Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., where provided by statute, and that this exception was recognized in <em>Bonamarte. </em>The CSED points out that \u00a7 40-5-414(3), MCA, authorizes \u201cteleconferencing\u201d in child support enforcement proceedings, and that 46.30.607(1), ARM, gives the Administrative Law Judge the discretion to deny an \u201cin-person\u201d hearing unless substantial prejudice can be shown at the conclusion of the telephonic hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Section 40-5-414(3), MCA, provides that: \u201cThe administrative hearing must be held by teleconferencing methods <em>unless the obligor or the department expressly requests an in-person hearing before the hearing examiner.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">Section 46.30.607(1), ARM, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Administrative hearings, unless the hearing officer expressly orders to the contrary, shall initially be conducted by telephone conferencing methods. At the request of a party and upon a showing that the party\u2019s case was substantially prejudiced by the lack of an in-person hearing, the hearing officer may, at the close of a telephone hearing, grant a de novo in-person hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">We conclude that \u00a7 40-5-414(3), MCA, provides no support for the CSED\u2019s position. It provides that \u201cin-person\u201d hearings shall be allowed where either party requests one. In this case, Charles made such a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Furthermore, rules adopted by administrative agencies which conflict with statutory requirements or exceed the authority provided by statute, are invalid. Section 2-4-305(6), MCA; <em>Board of Barbers v. Big Sky College </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 159, 161, 626 P.2d 1269, 1270-71. Finally, 46.30.607(1), ARM, is not a rule \u201capplicable to the courts of this state,\u201d and therefore, could not justify the proceeding in this case, even if it was validly enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Section 40-5-414(3), MCA, provides, without qualification, that an obligor is entitled to an \u201cin-person\u201d hearing when he or she requests one. To accept the CSED\u2019s premise would require that we ignore the plain language of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Based upon the right to confrontation provided in Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., our decision in <em>Bonamarte, </em>and \u00a7 40-5-414(3), MCA, we conclude that when Charles requested an \u201cin-person\u201d hearing to challenge the accuracy of the CSED\u2019s income withholding proceeding he was entitled to an \u201cin-person\u201d hearing, and the District Court erred when it affirmed the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s denial of that request. We further conclude that because the amount of Charles\u2019 past child support obligation depended on the existence or absence of an oral modification agreement, pursuant to our decision in <em>Sabo, </em>and since the determination of whether such an agreement existed depended on the credibility of Charles and Marilyn \u2014 the two principal witnesses \u2014 Charles\u2019 substantial rights were prejudiced by the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s denial of his request for an \u201cin-person\u201d hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">For these reasons, we reverse the order of the District Court; we vacate the decision of the Administrative Law Judge; and we remand this case to the District Court, and ultimately to the administrative agency, for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"Ah\">JUSTICES NELSON, GRAY, WEBER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
