We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Five issues were raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">I. Did sufficient evidence exist to support the jury verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">II. Did the District Court err in admitting into evidence the substance of a 911 call?</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">III. Did the District Court err in allowing the State to use defendant\u2019s silence, in reference to consensual sexual intercourse, during his interrogation by the West Yellowstone police as evidence against defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">IV. Did the District Court err in declining to review testimony with the jury at the jury\u2019s request?</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">V. Did the District Court err in defendant\u2019s sentencing?</p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">In May of 1991, complainant, Betsy Baker (Betsy), and her boyfriend moved to West Yellowstone and worked at various jobs. They lived in a small trailer behind the Wagon Wheel Apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-15\">Betsy testified that, on the evening of August 24,1991, she and her boyfriend ate dinner and then consumed several drinks at a local bar. Ultimately, the boyfriend was found to be driving while under the influence (DUI) and arrested. Betsy testified she did not know what happened to her boyfriend after he got out of the truck. She was advised by onlookers that he had been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-16\">Both defendant and Betsy testified to the fact that defendant approached Betsy and offered to drive her truck home. Betsy agreed. Defendant walked with Betsy to her landlords\u2019 (the Hitzlers) house. Defendant did not enter the Hitzlers\u2019 house but remained outside searching for keys Betsy had dropped on the way to the house. Betsy testified that she discussed with the Hitzlers her concerns about her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>boyfriend\u2019s arrest. The Hitzlers testified Betsy was clearly drunk at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Betsy and defendant testified, as Betsy left the Hitzlers\u2019 house, defendant pulled up in his own car, told Betsy he had found her keys, and offered her a ride back to the trailer. Defendant followed Betsy into her trailer. Betsy testified that she allowed defendant to stay but told him he could sleep either on the bed or on the couch and she would stay on the other because they were not sleeping together. Betsy testified that defendant told her that was fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Betsy then testified she was awakened when she felt someone penetrating her vagina from behind her. She said she \u201cdove off of the bed\u201d and yelled at defendant to \u201cjust get the fuck out of here.\u201d Betsy testified defendant told her to \u201chold on\u201d and calm down, but she kept yelling for him to get out. Before he left, Betsy said she asked him, \u201cDid we make love?\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you,\u201d then ran out the door. Betsy said she wrapped a blanket around herself and sat on the floor crying. At about 5:00 a.m., people who lived close by testified that they heard persistent crying.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Betsy testified that shortly after defendant left, someone knocked on her door and she asked him to call the police. A West Yellowstone police dispatcher said someone called 911 on the night in question and told the dispatcher a woman in a trailer behind the Wagon Wheel was screaming, could hardly speak, and thought she may have been raped. The caller would not give his name nor his location. Later, it was discovered he was a seasonal worker and he was not found nor called as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The police officer (Officer Burns) testified that, as he approached the trailer, he heard a woman crying loudly. He knocked on the door and saw Betsy on the floor holding a blanket tightly and crying hysterically. He said he recognized her from the earlier DUI stop and arrest. After Betsy calmed down, she told Officer Burns that a man offered to drive the truck home after the arrest and that she had been raped. Officer Burns locked the trailer and transported Betsy to the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Officer Burns located defendant based on Betsy\u2019s description of defendant\u2019s car. Officer Burns said he asked defendant what had happened that night and was told by defendant, \u2018What, nothing happened.\u201d When Officer Burns told defendant he knew something happened, he testified defendant admitted that he was with a girl and had given her a ride home but that was all. Officer Burns said he again told defendant there was more that had happened. Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>dant then told Officer Burns he approached the girl after her boyfriend was arrested, offered his assistance, and drove her pickup to her trailer. Defendant also told Officer Burns about Betsy losing her keys and going to visit the other people.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Officer Burns said defendant told him that when he and Betsy got to the trailer, she offered to let him sleep in the bed, but that he declined, telling Betsy, \u201cNo, that\u2019s your bed. I\u2019ll sleep on the couch.\u201d Defendant told Officer Burns that Betsy was with him on the bed and she began touching him. Defendant claimed they fell asleep and that \u201c[n]othing really happened after that.\u201d Officer Bums asked defendant what happened in the bed; but he said defendant became evasive. Officer Burns then advised defendant of his rights and the interview ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">On August 25, 1991, defendant was booked and detained at the West Yellowstone, Montana, police station. Betsy and defendant were both taken to Bozeman for a rape examination. Two nonmotile sperm, biologically consistent with defendant, were found in Betsy. Defendant was released after providing police with his permanent address, telephone number, and social security number. On October 15, 1993, defendant was arrested for the offense of sexual intercourse without consent in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Defendant was tried before a jury on March 7-10,1994. He testified on his own behalf at trial. He claimed that, as he drove Betsy home, she sat directly next to him in the truck and placed her hand on his leg. He also claimed she gave him a hug and kissed him affectionately when he said he would go look for her keys. Defendant then testified as to how Betsy and he had finally gone to sleep together and that he awoke when Betsy\u2019s hand was fondling his groin area. He testified that, after about ten or fifteen minutes of foreplay, intercourse took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">He alleged, afterwards, she caressed his face with her fingers, but suddenly stopped when she felt his mustache. He claimed Betsy got up, went to the bathroom, then came out and asked him, \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d Defendant told her, \u2018Well, sure.\u201d Defendant then testified that Betsy asked, \u201cDid we just make love?\u201d He said Well, of course we did.\u201d Defendant claimed Betsy got a couple of tears in her eyes, then calmly suggested he should leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Defendant testified that he got dressed, returned to his friend\u2019s apartment, and went to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">On March 10, 1994, the jury found defendant guilty of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent. He was sentenced on June 8, 1994, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>twenty years\u2019 imprisonment with five years suspended. For purposes of parole eligibility, defendant was designated a dangerous offender. From the final judgment, defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Issue I</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Did sufficient evidence exist to support the jury verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Section 45-5-503(1), MCA, states \u201c[a] person who knowingly has sexual intercourse without consent with another person commits the offense of sexual intercourse without consent. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Defendant claims the State failed to prove all of the necessary elements of the alleged crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant admits he knowingly had sexual intercourse with Betsy. However, defendant argues he was led to believe Betsy fully consented to such intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\u201cWithout consent\u201d as used in \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA, is defined by \u00a7 45-5-501(1), MCA. Section 45-5-501(1), MCA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">(1)... the term \u201cwithout consent\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">(b) the victim is incapable of consent because he is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">(i) mentally defective or incapacitated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">(ii) physically helpless;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Defendant argues the State failed to prove Betsy was incapable of appreciating or controlling her own conduct at the time of sexual intercourse or even earlier the previous evening. Defendant restates various testimony alleging Betsy made numerous thoughtful decisions while in the company of defendant. From this testimony, defendant concludes Betsy clearly possessed the capacity to consent, and to say \u201cno\u201d to sexual intercourse even though later she regretted that course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">Defendant further argues the evidence does not support the State\u2019s claim that Betsy was physically helpless, and therefore incapable of consenting. Section 45-2-101(51), MCA, states \u201c \u2018[p]hysically helpless\u2019 means that a person is unconscious or is otherwise physically unable to communicate unwillingness to act.\u201d Defendant contends this Court has never determined \u201csleep\u201d to be physical helplessness and should not set such a precedent here. In any event, defendant alleges Betsy was clearly not asleep because she was physically active during intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">The State contends defendant\u2019s arguments concerning Betsy\u2019s capacity to consent or say \u201cno\u201d has nothing to do with the facts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>case. The State argues its case is in no way based upon a theory that Betsy was too drunk to make a wise choice about having sex with defendant. The State contends the evidence established that Betsy was \u201cpassed out\u201d \u2014 in other words, unconscious. Betsy testified she told defendant he could sleep in the bed or on the couch, but they would not be sleeping together. Betsy then passed out on the bed, and defendant removed her pants and underwear and took advantage of her unconscious state. The State concludes there was sufficient evidence in the record to show Betsy was physically helpless and could not have consented; therefore, the jury correctly found defendant guilty of sexual intercourse without consent pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u201cIn reviewing a jury verdict in a criminal case, the proper inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. (Citations omitted.)\u201d <em>State v. Little </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 460, 477, 861 P.2d 154, 165. In the light most favorable to the prosecution, the record fully supports the State\u2019s claim that Betsy passed out the night of August 24, 1991; and that defendant, knowing Betsy to be unconscious, penetrated her vagina without her consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Defendant\u2019s contention, that no evidence exists as to Betsy\u2019s mental incapacitation, physical helplessness, or defendant\u2019s knowledge of such at the time of sexual intercourse, is incorrect. Betsy testified she had laid on her bed fully clothed that night and \u201cpassed out.\u201d She then testified she was awaken by someone penetrating her vagina. In <em>Little, </em>we stated \u201c[w]e have held repeatedly that convictions for sexual intercourse without consent and sexual assault are sustainable based entirely on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim. (Citations omitted.)\u201d <em>Little, </em>861 P.2d at 165. Here, we have further testimony from both the Hitzlers and Officer Burns that Betsy was obviously under the influence of alcohol on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u201cThe credibility of witnesses and the weight to be assigned to their testimony are to be determined by the trier of fact, and disputed questions of fact and credibility will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Moreno </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 359, 361, 787 P.2d 334, 336. Additionally, in <em>State v. Losson </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 342, 350, 865 P.2d 255, 260, we stated, \u201cThe jury decides the facts and who to believe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">We conclude, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. We therefore hold sufficient evidence existed to support the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Issue II</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Did the District Court err in admitting into evidence the substance of a 911 call?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In <em>State v. Hall </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 161, 169, 797 P.2d 183, 188, we stated \u201c[i]t is well established that the District Court has latitude of discretion in passing on the admissibility of evidence. [Citations omitted]. The District Court\u2019s determination of the admissibility of evidence is subject to review only for abuse of discretion. [Citations omitted].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The District Court permitted West Yellowstone Police Dispatcher Helene Rightenour to testify regarding the contents of the emergency 911 telephone call she received on the morning of August 25, 1991. Rightenour testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">It was a male caller and he said that there was a woman screaming at 421 Gibbon at a little trailer behind the Wagon Wheel Apartments. There was a truck parked out front that had two bicycles on the top. And he had gone over there and the woman was hardly able to speak, but she asked him to call the police, that she thought she might have been raped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">At trial, defendant objected to the District Court allowing the dispatcher to testify as to the substance of the call. Defendant argues the testimony consisted of prejudicially harmful descriptions by the dispatcher of the caller\u2019s description of Betsy\u2019s behavior and requests. Defendant contends it was double hearsay, and doubly unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">Rule 801(c), M.R.Evid., defines hearsay as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Defendant argues the present-sense impression exception to the hearsay rule (Rule 803(1), M.R.Evid.) does not apply because the dispatcher was too far removed from Betsy to testify as to her present-sense impression. Defendant further argues the excited utterance exception does not apply because the dispatcher is not relating an event or condition, but is testifying to the caller\u2019s description of the event. Defendant concludes none of these exceptions apply. Thus, he contends the District Court abused its discretion in allowing the prejudicial testimony of the 911 caller as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">The State argues \u201cdouble hearsay\u201d is not per se inadmissible. Rule 805, M.R.Evid., provides hearsay within hearsay is not excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>under the hearsay rule \u201cif each part of a combined statement conforms with an exception to the hearsay rule provided in these rules.\u201d The State asserts the caller\u2019s statement was not hearsay, under Rule 801(c), M.R.Evid., because it was not offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted. The caller\u2019s statement was offered to prove the time of the victim\u2019s allegation of rape and the reason the police officer arrived at her trailer at 5:11 a.m. We have closely examined the entire record in this case, however, and cannot find any support for the State\u2019s statement in that regard. The prosecutor did not contend before the District Court that the dispatcher\u2019s testimony regarding the contents of the 911 call was not hearsay because it was merely being offered to prove the time of the victim\u2019s allegation of rape and the reason for the officer being sent to her trailer. To the contrary, the prosecutor argued that the testimony was admissible under exceptions to the hearsay rule, thereby implicitly conceding that the testimony <em>was </em>hearsay. Moreover, it was not on that basis that the trial court allowed the testimony. The State\u2019s argument that the testimony was not hearsay is being raised for the first time on appeal; therefore, we will not address that argument further.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The State then argues that Betsy\u2019s statements to the caller fit within several exceptions to the hearsay rule. Betsy was crying hysterically, asked for the police and claimed she thought she had been raped. Her statements reflected an excited utterance, her present-sense impression, and her then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, and physical condition \u2014 all within the hearsay exclusion exceptions under Rule 803, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">While we concur with the State\u2019s statement that double hearsay is not per se inadmissible, the double hearsay rule does not apply here. The record does not support the State\u2019s contention that the caller\u2019s statement was admissible because it was not hearsay and the police dispatcher was too far removed to testify as to what Betsy said to the 911 caller. The 911 caller is the one who witnessed Betty\u2019s excited utterance, and her then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, and physical condition. Therefore, the caller was the only one who could testify to what Betsy said and to his present-sense impression of her when she made the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">We hold the District Court erred in admitting into evidence the substance of the 911 call. However, we have stated \u201c[t]he admission of improper evidence is not grounds for reversal unless there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence may have contributed to the conviction. [Citation omitted].\u201d <em>State v. Matt </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 136, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>145, 814 P.2d 52, 58. All of the basic elements \u2014 that Betsy was screaming and had asked the caller to call the police because she thought she had been raped \u2014 were established without question by other testimony properly admitted at trial. As a result, while the admission of the testimony was not proper, we conclude it is not reversible error because it did not contribute to the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">We hold that the admission into evidence of the substance of the 911 call was harmless error under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Issue III</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Did the District Court err in allowing the State to use defendant\u2019s silence, in reference to consensual sexual intercourse, during his interrogation by the West Yellowstone police as evidence against defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Defendant argues the State\u2019s improper comment on defendant\u2019s right to remain silent solemnizes the silence into evidence against defendant in direct violation of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution. Defendant did not waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights, thereby assuming he had the right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Defendant alleges statements referencing his silence did not distinguish between post- and <em>pre-Miranda </em>warnings. Thus, he asserts these statements, in their entirety, were improper under <em>Doyle v. Ohio </em>(1976), 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91, where the Supreme Court held \u201cthe use for impeachment purposes of petitioners\u2019 silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, violate [s] the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">The State contends defendant did not establish a Fifth Amendment nor a Fourteenth Amendment violation. The State stresses the fact defendant was not silent. He voluntarily gave statements to Officer Burns. The State believes it properly used those statements through careful cross-examination to expose defendant\u2019s false testimony when he took the witness stand and gave a very different account of the events leading to and during sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">We agree with the State\u2019s contention. In this case, defendant was cross-examined on statements he voluntarily made to Officer Burns prior to his arrest and how his testimony at trial conflicted with those statements. The fact that defendant\u2019s statements did not include a reference to consensual sexual intercourse is not an indication of silence of the type referred to in <em>Doyle. </em>We conclude the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>did not abuse its discretion in permitting the State\u2019s impeachment line of questioning. We therefore hold the District Court did not err in allowing the State to use defendant\u2019s silence, in reference to consensual sexual intercourse, during his interrogation by the West Yellowstone polic\u00e9 as evidence against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Issue IV</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Did the District Court err in declining to review testimony with the jury at the jury\u2019s request?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">During deliberation, the jury sent a written note to the District Court inquiring as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">In reference to Officer Burns [\u2019] statements regarding the conversation with suspect in vehicle in front of apartment\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">The question is \u201cDid the defendant tell the officer that he and Betsy had a conversation to the effect that\u201d he (the defendant) could either sleep on the bed or on the couch and she on one or the other [?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amq\">Upon receiving this request, the court consulted with counsel and inquired of their positions. The court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s inquiry read, \u201cIn the exercise of discretion the [c]ourt has determined that it would be inappropriate to respond to the question you have asked.\u201d Defendant argues the District Court abused its discretion by not responding to the jury\u2019s question. Defendant sets out portions of Officer Burns\u2019 testimony which speak to the jury\u2019s inquiry. Defendant contends the District Court committed reversible error by disallowing that portion of Officer Burns\u2019 testimony to be replayed for the jury during its deliberations as requested. Defendant further argues the District Court erred when it failed to give to the jury the instructions set forth in <em>State v. Henrich </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 258, 267, 886 R2d 402, 408, which specifically deals with requests from the jury about witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Section 46-16-503(2), MCA, refers to the jury\u2019s conduct after its retirement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">46-16-503. Conduct of jury after retirement \u2014 advice from court....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-11\">(2) After the jury has retired for deliberation, if there is any disagreement among the jurors as to the testimony or if the jurors desire to be informed on any point of law arising in the cause, they shall notify the officer appointed to keep them together, who shall then notify the court. The information requested may be given, in the discretion of the court, after consultation with the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>The State argues, and we have consistently held, that the decision to replay testimony to the jury, or to refuse a request by the jury to do so, lies within the sound discretion of the district court. <em>Henrich, </em>886 P.2d at 407; <em>State v. Evans </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 508, 511, 862 P.2d 417, 418; <em>State v. Mayes </em>(1992), 251 Mont. 358, 374, 825 P.2d 1196, 1206; <em>State v. Harris </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 405, 416-17, 808 P.2d 453, 460; <em>State v. Ulstad </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 102, 104, 802 P.2d 1260, 1262. We will review a district court\u2019s decision to allow or disallow a jury\u2019s request to replay trial testimony to determine if the district court abused its discretion. <em>Henrich, </em>886 P.2d at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">After consulting counsel, the District Court commented, \u201calmost any time you respond to a question from the jury, you\u2019re flirting with an error in the case.\u201d The District Court noted Officer Burns\u2019 direct testimony was interrupted by other testimony. He was brought back to the witness stand to complete his direct examination, and to further testify under cross-examination followed by redirect examination; thus, complicating reiteration of his testimony. The court recognized the dangers of emphasizing the testimony of one witness over another, as well as repeating portions of testimony out of context. We, therefore, conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the jury\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">We hold the District Court did not err in declining to review testimony with the jury at the jury\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Issue V</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Did the District Court err in defendant\u2019s sentencing?</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Defendant was sentenced to the Montana State Prison for a period of twenty years, with five years suspended. He was ordered to complete the sexual offender treatment program, classified as being a dangerous offender, ordered to register as a sex offender, and required to pay restitution to the West Yellowstone Police Department and the Crime Victims\u2019 Compensation Bureau of the State of Montana in the amount of $285.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Defendant contends the District Court, in setting his sentence, failed to consider statutory requirements set forth in \u00a7 46-18-101(3), MCA. Defendant further contends the sentence is cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that it is excessive punishment; and, the court has denied defendant equal protection of the laws under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>The State argues \u00a7 46-18-101(3), MCA, does not require the District Court to specifically identify each criterion in the sentencing order, but requires sentences to be based \u201cprimarily\u201d on the criteria listed. District courts are required only to specifically state, in open court and in the written judgment, the reasons for a sentence. Sections 46-18-102 and -115(5), MCA. The State asserts the court properly set forth, in both open court and written judgment, the reasons it imposed such sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">In <em>State v. Cope </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 387, 399, 819 P.2d 1280, 1287, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">We review sentences for legality only. <em>State v. Hurlbert </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 115, 756 P.2d 1110. The standard of review on sentence legality is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Lloyd </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 195, 199, 676 P.2d 229, 231. We find no such abuse here, since [defendant\u2019s] sentence is well within the statutory limits. Questions of sentencing equity, on the other hand, are to be presented to the Sentence Review Division. <em>Lloyd, </em>676 P.2d at 231. If [defendant] wishes to pursue his equity argument, he may do so in the Sentence Review Division.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The above statement applies to these circumstances as well. The sentence is within the guidelines set forth in \u00a7 45-5-503(2), MCA, and is, on its face, neither excessive nor cruel. The District Court properly set forth its reasons for the sentence at the hearing and in its judgment; and those reasons did not manifest an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">We, therefore, hold that the District Court did not err in defendant\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b485-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
