We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">.On June 8, 1992, the appellant James McClure (McClure) was injured in the course and scope of his employment with Smith Enterprises, Inc. (Smith). At the time of the injury, Smith, a tribal-owned business, was an independent contractor of Blaze Construction, Inc. (Blaze). Blaze was the prime contractor for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to construct streets in a subdivision located on the Flathead Indian Reservation. Blaze\u2019s contract with the BIA required evidence of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Aletter incorporated as part of that contract provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-12\">(a) <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance. </em>The Contractor shall furnish evidence to the Government that <em>all operations to be performed under the contract are covered by Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance </em>or that this liability is otherwise provided for in accordance with applicable State laws. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">Similarly, Blaze\u2019s contract with Smith required Smith to acquire workers\u2019 compensation coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-14\">(h) To pay Industrial Insurance and all other payments required under Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws as the same become due, and to furnish to the CONTRACTOR with evidence that the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>has been paid before final payment is made on this SUB-CONTRACT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Moreover, the subcontract which Smith signed also provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">2. [Smith agrees] To be bound by the terms of said MAIN CONTRACT [the contract between Blaze as prime contractor and the property owner] with the OWNER (including every part of and all the general and special conditions, drawings, specifications and addenda) in any way applicable to this Subcontract...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Blaze carried workers\u2019 compensation coverage, however, Smith did not. Because Smith was not insured at the time of McClure\u2019s injury, McClure initially filed a claim with the State Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund) seeking benefits from the Uninsured Employers Fund. The State Fund denied liability on the basis that the Uninsured Employers Fund does not have jurisdiction over businesses owned by tribal members operating solely within the confines of the reservation. McClure then filed a claim for compensation against Blaze pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">On October 7, 1993, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denied McClure\u2019s motion for declaratory ruling yet agreed to bifurcate the issue of the applicability of Montana\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws to the Flathead Indian Reservation. On December 22, 1993, McClure filed a renewed motion for declaratory ruling. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court again denied the motion and on September 7, 1994 issued an order denying McClure\u2019s petition for new trial and certifying judgment as final. McClure appeals the September 7, 1994 order denying petition for new trial and certifying judgment as final.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">McClure raises two issues on appeal. They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Corut err in its determination that McClure is not entitled to benefits under \u00a7 39-71-405, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation court err in its determination that a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits based upon a third-party beneficiary contractual theory is beyond the scope of its jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">The facts of this case are essentially undisputed. McClure argues that the District Court erred in its legal conclusions when it determined that McClure is not entitled to benefits under \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA, and that a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>based upon a third-party beneficiary contractual theory is beyond the scope of its jurisdiction. In reviewing the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law, we determine if the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Plainbull v. Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 120, 124, 870 P.2d 76, 79 (citing <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">(1) Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in its determination that McClure is not entitled to benefits under \u00a7 39-71-405, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">McClure appeals the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s holding that he is not entitled to benefits under Blaze\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation coverage because Smith does not fall within the purview of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and therefore the applicable independent contractor statute, \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA, is not triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">McClure argues that pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA, Blaze, the prime contractor, is liable for payment of benefits to McClure, an employee of Smith, the independent contractor, because Smith did not carry workers\u2019 compensation coverage. According to McClure, state workers\u2019 compensation jurisdiction over Indian employers is not at issue here. In summary, McClure argues that Smith\u2019s contractual obligation triggers \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA, placing liability on Blaze.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">The resolution of the issues presented hinges on \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA (1991), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">Liability of employer who contracts work out. (1) An employer who contracts with an independent contractor to have work performed of a kind which is a regular or a recurrent part of the work of the trade, business, occupation, or profession of such employer is liable for the payment of benefits under this chapter to the employees of the contractor <em>if the contractor has not properly complied with the coverage requirements of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. </em>Any insurer who becomes liable for payment of benefits may recover the amount of benefits paid and to be paid and necessary expenses from the contractor primarily liable therein. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that on its face, the statute \u201capplies only in cases where the subcontractor \u2018has not properly complied with the coverage requirements of the Worker\u2019s [sic] Compensation Act,\u2019 a situation commonly referred to as involving an \u2018uninsured employer.\u2019 \u201d Due to the bifurcation of the issue of the applicability of the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to the Flat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>head Indian Reservation, the court assumed that the Act did not apply to Smith. Therefore, the court interpreted the phrase \u201cproperly complied with the coverage requirements\u201d to apply only to situations where the independent contractor is statutorily required to provide coverage for its employees and fails to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">At the outset, we note that the 1991 codes, not the 1993 codes, apply to McClure\u2019s 1992 injury. <em>Buckman v. Montana Deaconess Hosp. </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 318, 321, 730 P.2d 380, 382. Accordingly, \u00a7 39-71-401(2)(m), MCA, (exempting from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201ca person who is employed by an enrolled tribal member who operates solely within the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation.\u201d) does not apply here. However prior to 1993, the Attorney General opined that Montana\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statutes do not apply to Indian businesses conducted on an Indian reservation. 37 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 28 (May 25, 1977). Accordingly, at the time of McClure\u2019s injury, Smith, an Indian employer operating within the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation, was not required by Montana law to provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage for his employees. With that status of the law in mind, we analyze the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">According to the rules of statutory construction, we construe the language of the statute according to its plain meaning. In construing a statute, \u201cthe office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Tongue River Elec. Coop. v. Mont. Power Co. </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 511, 515, 636 P.2d 862, 864. The plain language of \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA, merely makes the employer liable for the payment of benefits to the contractor\u2019s employee if the contractor fails to properly comply with the requirements of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. There is no language in \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA, indicating that the independent contractor must have a statutory obligation to obtain coverage before the section is triggered. In fact, it is not relevant why the independent contractor did not \u201cproperly comply\u201d with the Act\u2019s requirements, only that the independent contractor did not properly comply with the Act\u2019s requirements, while having some obligation to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">This Court has not previously addressed the issue before us. However, in <em>Webb v. Masonry Const. Co. </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 198, 761 P.2d 343 (concerning immunity from tort liability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act), we interpreted the legislative intent of \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA, stating the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cwas conceived, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>enacted and is supposed to be implemented primarily to provide aid and relief to injured working men and women.\u201d <em>Webb, </em>761 P.2d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA, a \u201ccontractor-under\u201d statute, if Smith has not properly complied with the requirements of the Act, having an obligation to do so, then Blaze is liable for McClure\u2019s benefits. Here, the nature and source of Smith\u2019s obligation to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits does not derive from the Act, however, for although Smith did not have a <em>statutory </em>obligation to comply with the Act, Smith did have a <em>contractual </em>obligation to comply. Moreover, under Blaze\u2019s contract with the BIA, Blaze had the obligation to make sure that <em>\u201call </em>operations to be performed under the contract [were] covered by Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance.\u201d (Emphasis added). Accordingly, it was Blaze\u2019s obligation to enforce his contract with Smith to ensure that Smith carried workers\u2019 compensation coverage for the benefit of his employees. We conclude that Smith\u2019s contract with Blaze triggers Smith\u2019s obligation under \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA, to properly comply with the coverage requirements of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and, hence, Blaze\u2019s \u201ccontractor-under\u201d obligation when Smith failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We note, in passing, that this case does not present the issue of whether the State can enforce its workers\u2019 compensation laws against an Indian employer within the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation. See 37 OpAtt\u2019y Gen. 28 (May 25, 1977), and the 1993 amendments to \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA, at subparagraph (2)(m), 1993 Montana Laws ch. 555, \u00a7 4. While the State may not <em>require </em>an Indian employer operating within the reservation to comply with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, it does not follow that the Indian employer who, nevertheless, elects coverage because of, for example, a contractual obligation to purchase such coverage, would be precluded from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We hold that McClure is entitled to benefits under \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA. Because we conclude that McClure is entitled to benefits pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA, we will not address his third-party beneficiary claims. We reverse and remand to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to fix and determine the amount of McClure\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b121-7\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT, WEBER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b121-8\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AMc\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion but not in everything which is said therein. I write separately to clarify what I perceive to be the thrust of the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>In pertinent part, Blaze\u2019s contract with the BIA required Blaze to furnish evidence that all operations to be performed under the contract were covered by workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Blaze\u2019s subcontract with Smith required Smith to be bound by all terms of the primary contract; this provision, of course, would include the BIA-Blaze contract term that all operations be covered by workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Thus, Blaze\u2019s contract with Smith, taken together with the BIA-Blaze contract required Smith to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Smith did not do so and, therefore, liability is properly imposed on Blaze pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-405(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The portion of the Court\u2019s opinion with which I do not agree states that the following language in the Blaze-Smith subcontract required Smith to acquire workers\u2019 compensation coverage:</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">(h) To pay Industrial Insurance and all other payments required under Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws as the same become due .... The quoted language does <em>not </em>require Smith to obtain workers\u2019 compensation coverage because, as the Court correctly states, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not apply to Smith. Thus, because the Act did not require Smith to obtain coverage, this provision in the Blaze-Smith subcontract is not a proper basis for the Court\u2019s conclusion in this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b122-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE concurs in the foregoing special concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
