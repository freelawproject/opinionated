We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">The only question on appeal is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred when it disallowed the payment of $750 as the fee charged by claimant\u2019s treating physician for the taking of a deposition based upon the <em>Witty </em>rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">Victoria Kloepfer (Kloepfer) sustained an injury to her back on April 14, 1992, while undergoing physical therapy at the Billings Clinic Work Hardening Center (Clinic) where she was undergoing treatment for an existing occupational disease of her arm. Kloepfer\u2019s physician, Peter V. Teal, M.D., testified that she had in fact injured her back at the Clinic. Dr. Teal\u2019s testimony was presented to the court by way of a deposition taken in his office on September 14, 1993, for which he charged Kloepfer $750.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Although several other doctors testified for the insurer that Kloepfer had not been injured at the Clinic, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court relied on Dr. Teal\u2019s deposition and found that Kloepfer had been injured at the Clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court ordered that Kloepfer receive occupational disease benefits and medical and hospital benefits for her back injury. The court also awarded Kloepfer her costs. The court permitted the costs of medical records but denied Kloepfer the $750 cost for Dr. Teal\u2019s deposition fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Kloepfer filed a Request for Redetermination of Costs and the parties further briefed the issue. The court again denied the $750 stating that \u201cirrespective of past practice\u201d it had to follow the directives set out in <em>Witty v. Pluid </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 272, 714 P.2d 169; and <em>Baeta v. Don Tripp Trucking </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 487, 839 P.2d 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Kloepfer appeals the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s denial of the $750 for Dr. Teal\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err when it disallowed as a recoverable cost the expert witness fee of $750 charged for the deposition testimony of Victoria Kloepfer\u2019s treating physician?</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Kloepfer argues that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court misconstrued the case law upon which it relied. Further, Kloepfer contends that the court has historically awarded witness fees for testimony by way of deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">The insurer argues that \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, made applicable to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court by the <em>Baeta </em>case requires that the court can only award witness fees of $10 per day per witness, including fees of expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Our standard of review is whether or not the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly interpreted the law. <em>Russette v. Chippewa Cree Housing Authority </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 90, 874 P.2d 1217. The District Court disallowed the $750 charged by Kloepfer\u2019s physician for his deposition based upon the court\u2019s conclusion that <em>Witty </em>and <em>Baeta </em>were precedent for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\"><em>Witty </em>was a case tried in District Court in which the court had to reconcile two conflicting civil procedure statutes dealing with the compensation for witnesses who appear at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">Witnesses in courts of record and before certain court officers. (1) Witness fees are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-14\">(a) for attending in any civil or criminal action or proceeding before any court of record, referee, or officer authorized to take deposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tions or commissioners to assess damages or otherwise, for each day, $10 ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">Section 26-2-501, MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\">Costs generally allowable. A party to whom costs are awarded in an action is entitled to include in his bill of costs his necessary disbursements, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">(2) the expenses of taking depositions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">(9) such other reasonable and necessary expenses as are taxable according to the course and practice of the court or by express provision of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Section 25-10-201, MCA. The <em>Witty </em>Court stated that \u201c[wjhere there are two statutes concerning the same subject, the particular controls the general.\u201d <em>Witty, </em>220 Mont. at 272, 714 P.2d at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In <em>Witty, </em>we concluded that the specific statute, \u00a7 26-2-501, MCA, which states that expert witnesses can only receive $10 per day controls the more general statute, \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, which says that the court can award costs in keeping with its course of practice. <em>Witty, </em>220 Mont. at 274, 714 P.2d at 170. Because the case was in district court, that court did not consider either the rules or procedure applicable to cases before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The statutes governing workers\u2019 compensation claims direct the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to be bound by \u201cthe Montana Administrative Procedure Act\u201d and the \u201ccommon law and statutory rules of evidence.\u201d Section 39-71-2903, MCA. The statutes governing workers\u2019 compensation cases do not require that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court comply with the rules of civil procedure applicable to district court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Yet, we decided in <em>Baeta </em>that \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, applied to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s award of costs. The <em>Baeta </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">A claimant, like any other party, is still subject to the mandates of \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, and the court\u2019s authority to tax costs. There can be no question that even under the \u201cnet recovery\u201d concept, the court has discretion in determining fees. The same holds true for costs, subject to the mandates of \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA. We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not abuse its discretion in its award of costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>Baeta, </em>254 Mont. at 494, 839 P.2d at 570. The holding in <em>Baeta </em>was affirmed in <em>Stevens v. State Fund </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 460, 886 P.2d 962, where this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">Section 25-10-201, MCA, is a general statute which governs the award of costs and was made applicable to workers\u2019 compensation cases in <em>Baeta v. Don Tripp Trucking </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 487, 493-94, 839 P.2d 566, 570. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The statutes applicable to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court were not considered in either <em>Baeta </em>or <em>Stevens. </em>In pertinent part these workers\u2019 compensation statutes provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">Costs and attorneys\u2019 fees payable on denial of claim or termination of benefits later found compensable. (1) The insurer shall pay <em>reasonable costs </em>and attorney fees <em>as established by the workers\u2019 compensation court </em>if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">(a) the insurer denies liability for a claim for compensation or terminates compensation benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">(b) the claim is later adjudged compensable by the workers\u2019 compensation court.... (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Section 39-71-611, MCA. Further, the legislature reinforced this standard in another statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">Costs and attorneys\u2019 fees that may be assessed against an insurer by workers\u2019 compensation judge. (1) If an insurer pays or submits a written offer of payment of compensation under chapter 71 or 72 of this title but controversy relates to the amount of compensation due, the case is brought before the workers\u2019 compensation judge for adjudication of the controversy, and the award granted by the judge is greater than the amount paid or offered by the insurer, a <em>reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs as established by the workers\u2019compensation judge </em>if the case has gone to a hearing may be awarded by the judge in addition to the amount of compensation. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">Section 39-71-612, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">The above statutes establish that \u201creasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees\u201d may be awarded in workers\u2019 compensation cases. As a result, the costs payable in Workers\u2019 Compensation Court under the reasonable costs standard are not necessarily comparable to the standard applied in normal district court cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">Medical depositions have been consistently used in workers\u2019 compensation cases and the costs of such testimony have been routinely allowed by workers\u2019 compensation judges. We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation statutes do not require that we diminish a claimant\u2019s award by making the claimant pay the high costs of medical depositions which are a requirement in many cases for obtaining benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">We also point out that the statutes covering workers\u2019 compensation state that the \u201cassessments\u201d made by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge are the exclusive assessments that can be levied against an insurer for disputes arising under Chapter 71. See \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA. This statute establishes the necessity of finding the cost assessment standards in Chapter 71. Further, there is no issue of fact regarding the past practice of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to award a successful claimant the cost of medical testimony and depositions. Attorneys for both sides agree such costs have been traditionally awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">We specifically overrule <em>Baeta </em>and <em>Stevens </em>in their holding that \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, governs the award of costs which may be allowed in a workers\u2019 compensation case. We further reverse the holding of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court when it relied on <em>Witty </em>and the provisions for $10 per day witness fees allowed for witnesses in a district court civil proceeding, as that holding is not applicable to workers\u2019 compensation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in disallowing the payment of $750 as the cost of taking the treating physician\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">We amend the Order Awarding Costs entered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and hold that Kloepfer shall recover the sum of $750 as the expert witness fee for Dr. Teal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b105-9\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Az-\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">I concur in the result reached in our opinion, but I disagree in our decision to overrule <em>Baeta </em>and <em>Stevens. </em>That is unnecessary, and neither the parties nor <em>amicus </em>requested that we overrule either of those cases. The problem in this case is not <em>Baeta </em>or <em>Stevens. </em>The problem is <em>Witty </em>and the Court\u2019s assumption that because <em>Witty, </em>a district court case, interpreted \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, in a certain limiting manner, that interpretation automatically is applicable to workers\u2019 compensation cases. Afair reading of <em>Baeta </em>and <em>Stevens </em>does not support that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>Baeta </em>did not address <em>Witty </em>much less determine that the particular rule enunciated in that case limiting expert witness fees to the amount provided by \u00a7 26-2-501, MCA, was applicable to workers\u2019 compensation cases. More important, <em>Baeta </em>did not address the specific language of \u00a7 25-10-201(9), MCA, cited above. At most, <em>Baeta </em>generally applied \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, to workers compensation cases and held that \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, defines the sorts of costs that may be awarded under \u00a7 39-71-612, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Similarly, while <em>Stevens </em>relied on <em>Baeta, Stevens </em>did not address <em>Witty. </em>We simply pointed out that <em>Baeta </em>made \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, applicable to workers\u2019 compensation cases. We then went on to discuss why, <em>under subsection (9) of that statute, </em>the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award private investigator costs to the prevailing claimant. We pointed out in <em>Stevens, </em>that the investigator costs at issue in that case were not historically awarded within the course and practice of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, nor was there any express provision of law which mandated an award of costs for such services or special statute which excepted investigator costs from the list of items in \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA. <em>Stevens, </em>886 P.2d at 968-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Given that <em>Witty </em>was a district court case rather than a workers\u2019 compensation case; given that \u00a7 25-10-201(9), MCA, authorizes the taxing of reasonable and necessary expenses according to the course and practice of the court; given that it is undisputed that physician deposition costs have been traditionally awarded to the prevailing claimant in workers\u2019 compensation cases; and given that the legislature has specifically allowed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to award reasonable costs in contested cases where the claim is determined to be compensable, I would simply hold that, consistent with <em>Baeta </em>and <em>Stevens, </em>the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court had discretion to award Kloepfer her physician deposition costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Accordingly, I specially concur only in the result of our decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b106-7\">JUSTICE GRAY concurs in the foregoing special concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
