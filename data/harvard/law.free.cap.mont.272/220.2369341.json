Woods (Woods) appeals from the Judgment and Order of Conviction entered by the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, on a jury verdict finding him guilty of operating a vehicle with an alcohol concentration of .10 or more. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in admitting breath test evidence over Woods\u2019 objection that a proper foundation was not established and, on that basis, erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Woods originally was charged in the Justice Court of Flathead County with violating \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA, by driving a vehicle while his alcohol concentration, as shown by analysis, was .10 or more. His motion to dismiss the charge was denied and he was found guilty of the offense. After judgment was entered, Woods appealed to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">A jury trial was held in the District Court on October 17, 1994. Deputy Sheriff Annette Holliday testified regarding her activities in arresting Woods, transporting him to the Flathead County Detention Center (Detention Center) and conducting sobriety tests and a breath test to measure Woods\u2019 alcohol concentration. The Montana Department of Justice, Division of Forensic Science, breath analysis report form, reflecting Woods\u2019 breath alcohol concentration (BAC) at .188, was admitted over Woods\u2019 objection of insufficient foundation. Woods moved for dismissal or a directed verdict in his favor on the basis that the State had not listed a witness qualified to lay the necessary foundation for admission of the report form; the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">During Deputy Holliday\u2019s continued testimony, Woods objected on foundation grounds to admission of the Intoxilyzer breath analysis report produced at the Detention Center, which also reflected Woods\u2019 BAC at .188. The District Court admitted the exhibit. A videotape of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Woods performing sobriety tests at the Detention Center was played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, Woods renewed his motion to dismiss the charge and direct a verdict, on the basis that admission of the breath test evidence without the necessary foundation was impermissible and, absent that evidence, the State had failed to prove its case. The District Court again denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The jury found Woods guilty of the misdemeanor offense of driving a vehicle with an alcohol concentration of .10 or more. Woods appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A36\">Did the District Court abuse its discretion in admitting breath test evidence over Woods\u2019 objection that a proper foundation was not established and, on that basis, err in denying his motion to dismiss the charge?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Woods was charged with violating \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA, by driving a vehicle while his alcohol concentration was .10 or more as shown by an analysis of his blood, breath or urine. Absolute liability attaches to commission of the offense; the State need not prove that the offense was committed knowingly, negligently or purposely. Sections 61-8-406 and 45-2-104, MCA. Thus, the critical proof necessary to establish commission of the offense is the blood, breath or urine test result.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The district court has broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible; absent a showing of abuse of discretion, we will not overturn the court\u2019s determination. <em>State v. Passama </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 338, 341, 863 P.2d 378, 380 (citation omitted). Here, given the offense charged and the necessity of the breath test results to establish that Woods committed the offense, error in admitting the breath test evidence would necessitate dismissal of the charge for failure of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The State of Montana closely regulates breath analysis instruments utilized to determine the alcohol concentration of a person charged with an alcohol-related driving offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 23.4.201 through 23.4.221, ARM. A defendant charged with such an offense is entitled to the procedural safeguards which are contained in the administrative rules. <em>State v. West </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 83, 89, 826 P.2d 940, 944; citing <em>State v. O\u2019Brian </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 227, 229, 770 P.2d 507, 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The administrative rule at issue in this case provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">(1) Breath analysis instruments shall be field certified for proper calibration at least once every seven (7) days by a breath test specialist/senior operator, or in the event of a senior operator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>absence, his/her authorized designee, using a solution of ethyl alcohol approved by the division of forensic science and using the field certification report form for the breath analysis instrument being certified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Section 23.4.213, ARM. Woods contends that the State failed to lay a foundation for his BAC test results by establishing compliance with \u00a7 23.4.213(1), ARM, and argues that, as a result, the BAC evidence was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The State concedes that it did not lay a proper foundation for admission of Woods\u2019 BAC test results. No evidence whatsoever was introduced that the Intoxilyzer had been properly and timely calibrated as required by \u00a7 23.4.213(1), ARM. Absent the required foundation, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting the breath test evidence. As a result, we hold that the court erred in denying Woods\u2019 motion to dismiss the charge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter an order of dismissal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
