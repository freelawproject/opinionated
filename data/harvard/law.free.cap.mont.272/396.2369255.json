That court declared invalid three administrative rules adopted by the Board, as improper interpretations of \u00a7\u00a7 37-29-402(2) and -403, MCA. The court denied, without prejudice, the plaintiffs\u2019 request for costs and attorney fees. The Board appeals the declaration of invalidity as to Rule 8.17.808, ARM. The plaintiffs cross-appeal. We reverse the District Court\u2019s ruling that Rule 8.17.808, ARM, is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">We do not address all of the issues raised, because of our resolution of the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">1. Is the court\u2019s August 30, 1994 order an appealable order?</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">2. Did the District Court err in declaring invalid Rule 8.17.808, ARM, and in issuing an injunction barring enforcement of that rule?</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">In 1984, Montana voters passed Initiative No. 97, the Freedom of Choice in Denture Services Act of 1984 (codified at \u00a7\u00a7 37-29-101 through -412, MCA). The Act established a statutory framework allowing the practice of denturitry in Montana. As amended by Montana\u2019s 1987 legislature, it provides that the Board of Dentistry shall adopt rules necessary for the implementation, continuation, and enforcement of the Act. Section 37-29-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">The plaintiffs in this action are denturists and denture users. They filed this action in 1993, asking the District Court for a declaratory judgment invalidating certain rules adopted by the Board concerning the practice of denturitry. Plaintiffs claimed that the Board has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>improperly interpreted the statutes and that the challenged rules are unconstitutional under the Montana Constitution\u2019s right to privacy provision and the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Following a hearing, the District Court issued an order granting the injunction requested by the plaintiffs. It determined that enforcement of the three challenged rules \u201coperates to the prejudice of the public in that they do not have the choice to choose a denturist over a dentist, as provided under the Freedom of Denture Services Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALB\">The Board appeals as to only one of the three rules declared invalid by the District Court, Rule 8.17.808, ARM. It does not appeal the court\u2019s declaration of invalidity as to Rules 8.17.809 and .810, ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"AYC\">The statute at issue on appeal is \u00a7 37-29-403, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">(1) Prior to making and fitting a partial denture, a denturist shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">(a) formulate a study model of the intended denture;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">(b) refer the patient to a dentist, together with the model for tooth cleaning, mouth preparation, and x-rays, as needed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">(c) make the partial denture and fit it to the existing teeth after the dentist has completed the procedures listed in subsection (l)(b) and in accordance with the dentist\u2019s recommendations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">(2) A denturist may not cut, surgically remove, or surgically reduce any tissue or teeth in the process of fitting a partial denture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">(3) A denturist who makes or fits a partial denture in a manner not consistent with this section is subject to the sanctions provided in 37-29-311.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Rule 8.17.808, ARM, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-12\">(1) The board of dentistry interprets 37-29-403(l)(b), MCA, to mean that all partial denture patients shall be referred to a dentist to determine what is needed prior to the denturist starting his services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">As to this rule, the District Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-14\">[T]he only rational interpretation of \u00a7 37-29-403, MCA, is to make referrals to dentists permissive. From the testimony at the trial held on June 21,1994, and the testimony from the administrative hearings on the creation of the administrative regulations (Defendant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, and C), it appears that denturists will make the right choice and refer patients to dentists when needed. There does not appear to be a reasonable explanation for making dentist referrals mandatory except to make the denturist business obsolete.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">The Board appeals the court\u2019s ruling as to Rule 8.17.808, ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Is the court\u2019s August 30, 1994 order an appealable order?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The plaintiffs argue that no final appealable order has yet been entered because the District Court has not yet made a final ruling upon their motion for attorney fees. They cite cases in which this Court has rejected appeals as premature because the issue of attorney fees was yet to be resolved. <em>See Tigart v. Thompson </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 468, 774 P.2d 401; <em>Boles v. Ler </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 266, 692 P.2d 1; <em>Baer v. Baer </em>(1982), 199 Mont. 21, 647 P.2d 835; <em>Ring v. Hoselton </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 414, 643 P.2d 1165. The plaintiffs urge that this appeal likewise be dismissed as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Rule 1(b), M.RApp.P., allows a party in a civil case to appeal to this Court from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">a judgment or order, except when expressly made final by law, in the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">(1) From a final judgment entered in an action or special proceeding commenced in a district court, or brought into a district court from another court or administrative body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">(2) From an order ... granting or dissolving an injunction[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">As this Court has stated, appeal lies \u201cfrom a final judgment or order, <em>or an order otherwise provided </em>for\u201d in the various subsections of Rule 1, M.R.App.P. <em>Baer, </em>647 P.2d at 839-40. All four cases cited by plaintiffs were appeals under Rule 1(b)(1), M.R.App.P. In contrast, the District Court\u2019s August 30, 1994 order is appealable under Rule 1(b)(2), M.RApp.P., as an order granting an injunction. A final order is not necessary for an appeal under that subsection of the rule. The cases cited by the plaintiffs therefore do not control as to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">We hold that the District Court\u2019s August 30, 1994 order is an appealable order granting an injunction, pursuant to Rule 1(b)(2), M.RApp.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">Did the District Court err in declaring invalid Rule 8.17.808, ARM, and in issuing an injunction barring enforcement of that rule?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">An administrative regulation may be overruled as \u201cout of harmony\u201d with the applicable legislative guidelines only upon a clear showing that the regulation adds requirements which are contrary to the statutory language or that it engrafts additional provisions not envisioned by the legislature. <em>Board of Barbers, Etc. v. Big Sky College, Etc. </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 159, 161, 626 P.2d 1269, 1270-71; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>also </em>\u00a7 2-4-305(5) and (6), MCA. The plaintiffs herein argue, and the District Court ruled, that Rule 8.17.808, ARM, imposes an additional requirement upon denturists in that it makes dentist referrals mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The question before us is the proper interpretation of \u00a7 37-29-403(l)(b), MCA. Plaintiffs argue, and the District Court ruled, that the words \u201cas needed\u201d in that statute allow the denturist to decide whether referral to a dentist is needed for tooth cleaning, mouth preparation, and x-rays.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The plaintiffs point out that the Board\u2019s attorney has admitted that \u00a7 37-29-403(1)(b), MCA, is ambiguous. When legislative intent cannot be determined from the plain words of a statute, then the court must examine the legislative history of the statute. <em>Lewis &amp; Clark v. State, Dept. of Commerce </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 223, 226, 728 P.2d 1348, 1350. The plaintiffs contend that this leads us back to an examination of the intent of the Freedom of Choice in Denture Services Act of1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">However, \u00a7 37-29-403, MCA, was not a part of the Freedom of Choice in Denture Services Act of 1984. It was proposed to the 1985 Montana legislature by the Department of Commerce, as part of H.B. 649. The bill, which was adopted by the legislature as Ch. 548, L. 1985, was described by its sponsors as a \u201ccompromise bill between the dentists and denturists of Montana\u201d \u201cto clear up some of the problem areas\u201d of the Freedom of Choice in Denture Services Act of 1984. <em>See </em>Minutes of Senate Public Health Committee Hearing on H.B. 649, March 11, 1985. That, therefore, is the purpose for which the statute was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">An administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute under its domain is presumed to be controlling. <em>Norfolk Holdings v. Dept. of Revenue </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 40-44, 813 P.2d 460, 462. In fact, the construction of a statute by the agency responsible for its execution should be followed unless there are compelling indications that the construction is wrong. <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 367, 381, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1802, 23 L.Ed.2d 371, 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The Board points out, too, that a statute should be read and construed as a whole so as to avoid absurd results and to give effect to the purpose of the statute. <em>Dover Ranch v. County of Yellowstone </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 276, 283-84, 609 P.2d 711, 715. The Board\u2019s position is that the meaning of \u00a7 37-29-403(1)(b), MCA, is resolved by reference to the next subsection of the statute, \u00a7 37-29-403(1)(c), MCA. Subsection (l)(c) comes into effect \u201cafter the dentist has completed the procedures listed in subsection (l)(b) and in accordance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>dentist\u2019s recommendations.\u201d The Board argues that the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of subsection (l)(b) would render subsection (l)(c) superfluous and meaningless. The Board therefore maintains that the proper mode of treatment under the statute is that a denturist\u2019s patient must be seen by a dentist before the denturist constructs and fits partial dentures. Rule 8.17.808, ARM, is consistent with that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Like the Board, the Attorney General of the State of Montana has interpreted \u00a7 37-29-403, MCA, as requiring that a denturist\u2019s patient be seen by a dentist before partial dentures are made. \u201cWhen section 37-29-403, MCA, is construed in its entirety, it becomes clear that a denturist has no discretion with respect to referral of a patient to a dentist before the making and fitting of partial dentures.\u201d 44 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. No. 36 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We conclude that plaintiffs have not made a clear showing that Rule 8.17.808, ARM, adds provisions not envisioned by the legislature. We hold that the District Court erred when it declared that rule invalid as an improper interpretation of \u00a7 37-29-403, MCA. We therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s determination and vacate the injunction prohibiting enforcement of Rule 8.17.808, ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">We make no decision as to plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional argument, which argument the District Court did not reach in rendering its opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b424-7\">JUSTICES GRAY, WEBER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b424-8\">JUSTICE HUNT</author>\n<p id=\"A9G\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">I dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">The majority concludes that the plaintiffs failed to make a clear showing that 8.17.808, ARM, adds provisions not envisioned by the Legislature, and therefore, that 8.17.808, ARM, should stand. However, a party challenging the validity of a regulation is not restricted exclusively to making a clear showing that the regulation adds provisions not envisioned by the Legislature. Under <em>Board of Barbers, </em>and \u00a7 2-4-305(5), MCA, an administrative regulation may also be overruled upon a clear showing that the regulation adds requirements which are contrary to the statutory language. At issue is the correct interpretation of the phrase \u201cas needed.\u201d In any manner of construction, \u201cas needed\u201d is an expression of discretion, rather than compulsion. Had the intent of \u00a7 37-29-403(l)(b), MCA, been to mandate referring a partial denture patient first to a dentist, \u201cas needed\u201d would have been omitted from subsection (l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>The majority adopts the Board\u2019s argument that plaintiffs\u2019interpretation of subsection (l)(b) would render subsection (l)(c) superfluous. The Board asserts that the statute should be read \u201cas a whole to give effect to the purpose of the statute.\u201d However, the only way to reach the Board\u2019s, and the majority\u2019s, conclusion that the phrase \u201cas needed\u201d is compulsory, is to read subsection (l)(c) in isolation. If read in isolation, subsection (l)(c) mandates that the denturist shall make and fit the partial denture after the dentist has completed the procedures listed in subsection (l)(b). If read as a whole, the procedures referred to in subsection (l)(b) by subsection (l)(c) are employed \u201cas needed.\u201d If those procedures are not needed, the denturist will simply make the partial denture and fit it to the existing teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The purpose behind \u00a7 37-29-403, MCA, is to provide less expensive denture services for those who seek to avoid the additional expense of involving a dentist in the process of fitting dentures where his or her services are not needed. The phrase \u201cas needed\u201d gives effect to that purpose. The record shows that the plaintiffs\u2019 made a clear and compelling showing that 8.17.808, ARM, adds requirements which are contrary to the statutory language of \u00a7 37-29-403, MCA. As a result, I would affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to grant plaintiffs\u2019 request for an injunction barring the enforcement of 8.17.808, ARM.</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-5\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER and NELSON join in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
