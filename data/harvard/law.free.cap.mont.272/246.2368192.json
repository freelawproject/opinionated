We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-18\">We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>1. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in affirming the Department\u2019s determination that Synek\u2019s chiropractic treatments were not compensable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">2. Were Synek\u2019s procedural due process rights violated by the Department\u2019s procedures?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">In the course of Synek\u2019s employment with the Professional Nursing Personnel Pool, she suffered two accidents in 1980. In October 1980, she sustained cervical, lumbar and knee injuries. A few months later, she injured her upper back, left shoulder, arm and wrist. The State Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund) is Professional Nursing Personnel Pool\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Synek sought treatment for her injuries from Dr. J.L. Cromwell (Cromwell), a chiropractor. In 1984, Cromwell sold his practice to Dr. Karlene Berish (Berish), who continued treating Synek. The State Fund paid for Synek\u2019s chiropractic treatments.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In correspondence with the State Fund regarding Synek\u2019s condition in 1987, Berish stated that she was treating Synek on a \u201cpatient need basis ... for relief of pain associated with flare-ups due to a very unstable lower back.\u201d She further indicated that Synek\u2019s condition \u201ccontinues to deteriorate\u201d and that she was providing Synek with \u201cpalliative care ... so that [Synek] may function more comfortably on a day to day basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">In November 1988, the State Fund informed Berish that it would no longer pay for Synek\u2019s chiropractic treatments. The State Fund\u2019s decision was based on the report of Dr. Phil Blom, who, after reviewing Synek\u2019s file, opined that the treatments she was receiving were not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Synek filed a petition with the Department for the cost of unpaid treatments and for a determination with regard to the compensability of future treatments. The Department\u2019s hearing examiner denied Synek\u2019s claim, concluding that the State Fund was not liable for payment of past or, in the absence of specific authorization, future chiropractic treatments by Berish. Synek sought judicial review of the Department\u2019s decision in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and the court affirmed that decision. Synek appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">1. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in affirming the Department\u2019s determination that Synek\u2019s chiropractic treatments Were not compensable?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">It is well-settled that \u201c[workers\u2019 compensation benefits are determined by the statutes in effect as of the date of injury.\u201d <em>Buckman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>v. Mont. Deaconess Hospital </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 318, 321, 730 P.2d 380, 382. Thus, the 1979 version of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act applies to Synek\u2019s claim arising from injuries sustained in 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Section 39-71-704, MCA (1979), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB8\">Payment of medical, hospital, and related services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">In addition to the compensation provided by this chapter and as an additional benefit separate and apart from compensation, the following shall be furnished:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">(1) After the happening of the injury, the employer or insurer shall furnish, without limitation as to length of time or dollar amount, reasonable services by a physician or surgeon, reasonable hospital services and medicines when needed, and such other treatment as may be approved by the division for the injuries sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Administrative rules regarding chiropractic services were duly promulgated to implement the \u201cother treatment as may be approved\u201d portion of \u00a7 39-71-704(1), MCA (1979). Those rules, and the evidence regarding the nature of Synek\u2019s chiropractic treatments vis-a-vis those rules, form the crux of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Section 24.29.2003, ARM, sets forth the type of chiropractic treatments which are compensable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\"><em>Workers\u2019Compensation Does Pay </em>(1) For \u201ctherapeutics\u201d defined as: any treatment considered necessary to return the patient to a preclinical status or establish a stationary status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">(2) Rehabilitation procedures necessary for reeducation or functional restoration of a disabled body system or part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">Section 24.29.2004, ARM, sets forth the chiropractic treatments which are not compensable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-12\"><em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Does Not Pay </em>(1) For maintenance \u2014 a regime designed to provide the optimum state of health while minimizing recurrence of the clinical status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-13\">(2) Prevent treatment \u2014 procedures necessary to prevent the development of clinical status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">Via extensive findings based on the testimony and evidence of record, the Department\u2019s hearing examiner determined that Synek\u2019s treatments were \u201cmaintenance\u201d rather than \u201ctherapeutics\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 24.29.2003 and 24.29.2004, ARM. On that basis, the hearing examiner concluded that the treatments were not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">On petition for judicial review to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, Synek argued that the hearing examiner\u2019s decision was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>supported by substantial evidence. The court concluded that substantial evidence supported the decision and affirmed the determination that Synek\u2019s treatments were not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">In reviewing an agency\u2019s decision in a contested case procedure under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, reviewing courts apply the standards of review contained in \u00a7 2-4-704, MCA; <em>State Comp. Mut. v. Lee Rost Logging </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 97, 102, 827 P.2d 85, 88. Section 2-4-704(2)(a)(v), MCA, provides that the agency\u2019s decision may be reversed if substantial rights have been prejudiced because the agency\u2019s findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence of record. <em>Lee Rost, </em>827 P.2d at 88. We apply the same standard of review as did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Synek argues that her treatments have been aimed at achieving stability and, therefore, that they are compensable \u201ctherapeutics\u201d under \u00a7 29.24.2003, ARM, and not \u201cmaintenance\u201d as defined in \u00a7 29.24.2004, ARM. She asserts that a patient whose condition is unstable at any point in time following the work-related injury is entitled to chiropractic treatment at the insurer\u2019s expense. She further contends that the hearing examiner\u2019s application of the chiropractic rules produces an absurd result which justifies reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In 1987, Berish wrote to the State Fund that Synek was being treated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">as needed for temporary relief of pain. Her condition continues to deteriorate gradually and remains unstable. I am providing palliative care for her so that she may function more comfortably on a day to day basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Berish reaffirmed this characterization of Synek\u2019s treatments during the hearing. She testified that her treatment of Synek\u2019s condition was \u201cpalliative\u201d in nature, a term she defined as offering relief from pain with no cure expected. Berish also testified that, as of November 1988, Synek had reached a state of \u201cmaximum medical improvement,\u201d and that she did not expect further improvement in Synek\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Berish\u2019s testimony establishes that the chiropractic treatments for which Synek seeks compensation are not compensable under the applicable administrative rules. Section 24.29.2003, ARM, authorizes payment for treatments necessary to return the patient to a preclinical status or establish a stationary status. Berish\u2019s characterization of Synek\u2019s condition was that it was worsening, was not expected to become preclinical and might never reach a stable condition. Thus, Berish\u2019s testimony supports the Department\u2019s determination that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>treatments of Synek were not \u201ctherapeutics\u201d for which workers\u2019 compensation is available under \u00a7 24.29.2003, ARM. Indeed, Berish\u2019s testimony that the treatments were provided \u201cas needed,\u201d and for \u201ctemporary relief from pain,\u201d corresponds to the definition of \u201cmaintenance\u201d contained in \u2014 and not compensable under \u2014 \u00a7 24.29.2004, ARM, in that the treatments were provided to optimize Synek\u2019s state of health by relieving pain as her condition deteriorates with age. We conclude that the hearing examiner\u2019s findings and decision were supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Anticipating our conclusion that the hearing examiner\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence, Synek argues that \u00a7\u00a7 24.29.2003 and 24.29.2004, ARM, are unreasonable, lead to an absurd result and constitute an improper basis for denial of her claim. She contends that <em>Weis v. Div. of Workers\u2019 Compensation </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 218, 755 P.2d 1385, supports her position. Her reliance on <em>Weis </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><em>Weis </em>involved two issues: whether the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 39-71-122, MCA (1985), intended to restrict the making of an \u201cimpairment rating\u201d to licensed medical physicians; and whether the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation properly exercised its rulemaking authority in promulgating an administrative rule under that statute which restricts impairment ratings to licensed Montana physicians holding a doctor of medicine degree. We first determined that the legislature did intend to limit impairment ratings to licensed medical physicians. On that basis, we concluded that the Division\u2019s administrative interpretation of the statute via its administrative rule corresponded to the statute and was not improper. Weis, 755 P.2d at 1387.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Synek apparently contends that our discussion of the second issue in <em>Weis </em>supports her argument that \u00a7\u00a7 24.29.2003 and 24.29.2004, ARM, are unreasonable and produce an absurd result. There, we stated that we give deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute via its administrative rules \u201cunless the interpretation produces an absurd result.\u201d <em>Weis, </em>755 P.2d at 1387 (citations omitted). In <em>Weis, </em>we concluded that the administrative rule essentially mirrored the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the statute and, therefore, that the Division properly enacted the administrative rule at issue. <em>Weis, </em>755 P.2d at 1387.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Here, unlike in Weis, the statute under which \u00a7\u00a7 24.29.2003 and 24.29.2004, ARM, were promulgated contains broad rulemaking authority. Section 39-71-704(1), MCA (1979), authorizes compensation for \u201csuch other treatment as may be approved by the division for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the injuries sustained.\u201d The administrative rules at issue provide compensation for some types of chiropractic treatment and prohibit payment for other types of treatment. The rules, which constitute the Department\u2019s \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the statute, are entitled to deference unless they produce an absurd result. <em>See Weis, </em>755 P.2d at 1387.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The administrative rules at issue, which include treatments of some kinds and exclude others, and which were promulgated pursuant to broad statutory language, are not facially or inherently arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. Moreover, Synek does not articulate with any specificity the manner in which these rules produce an absurd result in this case under either the statute or the language of the rules themselves. Thus, under the general rule stated in <em>Weis, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 24.29.2003 and 24.29.2004, ARM, are entitled to deference. On the basis of the record before us, we conclude that the administrative rules at issue here do not produce an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err in affirming the Department\u2019s determination that Synek\u2019s chiropractic treatments were not compensable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">2. Were Synek\u2019s procedural due process rights violated by the Department\u2019s procedures?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Synek argues that she was denied due process by the Department\u2019s procedures because of the one-year delay between the hearing and the hearing examiner\u2019s decision. Relying on <em>Carmichael v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Court </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 410, 763 P.2d 1122, she asserts that the legislature\u2019s restructuring of the Department \u2014 including the elimination of the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation\u2014 precipitated this delay and constituted an impermissible retroactive application of statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">The issue before us in <em>Carmichael </em>was whether a statutory mediation requirement enacted in 1987 which, by its terms, applied to all workers\u2019 compensation disputes regardless of when they arose, constitutionally could be applied to employment-related injuries which occurred prior to the effective date of the statute. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determined that the statute was applicable and that, while the extra time required for mediation would cause some delay, the delay was not so substantial as to render application of the statute unconstitutional. <em>Carmichael, </em>763 P.2d at 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">On appeal, Carmichael argued that retroactive application of the mediation requirement unconstitutionally impaired his contractual rights by significantly delaying his right to petition the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. We observed that Carmichael\u2019s contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation rights vested on the date of his injury and entitled him, as of that date, to directly petition the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. <em>Carmichael, </em>763 P.2d at 1124. The mediation statute subsequently enacted by the legislature required exhaustion of the mediation procedure prior to filing a petition in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, a delay of up to 100 days. Accordingly, we held that retroactive application of the mediation statute to Carmichael\u2019s work-related injury substantially and impermissibly impaired his vested contractual rights. <em>Carmichael, </em>763 P.2d at 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">In the case presently before us, no new procedure or inherent delay is contained in the legislature\u2019s restructuring of the Department. As a result, unlike the situation in <em>Carmichael, </em>this case does not involve delay specifically and directly imposed by a legislatively-mandated procedural requirement. We conclude, therefore, that application of the statutes restructuring the Department does not violate Synek\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In a related argument, Synek requests this Court to address the question of what amount of time is \u201creasonable\u201d for adjudication of a workers\u2019 compensation petition. We decline to do so. Each workers\u2019 compensation petition and claim presents its own unique facts and procedural history; these and other legitimate considerations properly influence the amount of time reasonably required to reach a decision. <em>See Capers v. Flautt </em>(S.C. App. 1991), 407 S.E.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Finally, Synek argues that she is entitled to a 20% penalty, as well as attorney\u2019s fees, on reversal of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Based on our conclusions herein, we need not address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, NELSON and LEAP HART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
