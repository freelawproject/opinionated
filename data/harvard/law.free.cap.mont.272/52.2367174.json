We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">The sole issue on review is whether the District Court erred in denying Chance\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the statute of limitations was equitably tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">Carol Thomas Harrison (Harrison) went to work for Chance in September 1986. Harrison groomed and trained Chance\u2019s horses and maintained and cleaned his bam. Harrison terminated her employment with Chance on March 17, 1987, following several alleged incidents of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">On September 28, 1987, Harrison filed a civil suit in the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, alleging various torts against Chance. On October 18, 1989, the District Court dismissed Harrison\u2019s claim. The court determined that all allegations set forth in her complaint stemmed from the alleged sexual harassment by Chance. The court went on to conclude that, pursuant to \u00a7 49-2-509, MCA, a claimant alleging sexual harassment must exhaust his or her administrative remedies with the Montana Human Rights Commission. Because Harrison had not pursued her administrative remedies with the Human Rights Commission, the District Court dismissed her claim without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">Harrison appealed the District Court\u2019s decision to this Court. In affirming the District Court, we concluded that \u00a7 49-2-509, MCA, provided Harrison\u2019s exclusive remedy. <em>Harrison v. Chance </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 215, 797 P.2d 200 <em>(Harrison I). </em>We noted, in dicta, that due to the enactment of an amendment to \u00a7 49-2-509, MCA, between the time Harrison terminated her employment with Chance and the filing of her complaint in District Court, the 180-day statute of limitation for filing a claim with the Human Rights Commission may be equitably tolled. <em>Harrison I, </em>797 P.2d at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Harrison filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on December 20, 1990. The hearing examiner determined that, while more than 180 days had elapsed since Harrison\u2019s discharge, the statute of limitations was equitably tolled. The hearing examiner relied on this Court\u2019s dicta in <em>Harrison I </em>in tolling the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Following a hearing, the hearing examiner held in favor of Harrison, awarding over $43,000 in lost wages and other damages. Chance appealed the decision of the Human Rights Commission to the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, arguing that Harrison\u2019s claim was not timely filed and that the 180-day statute of limitations should not have been equitably tolled. Chance moved for summary judgment on these grounds. The court denied Chance\u2019s motion for summary judgment, upholding the decision of the Human Rights Commission. Chance appeals the denial of his motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Did the District Court err in denying Chance\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the statute of limitations was equitably tolled?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a summary judgment motion de novo. Summary judgment is proper only when there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P; <em>Minnie v. City of Roundup </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 429, 849 P.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Chance argues that Harrison\u2019s claim with the Human Rights Commission should have been time-barred because she did not file her complaint within the 180-day statute of limitation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">On March 17, 1987, the date of Harrison\u2019s termination, an appeal to the Human Rights Commission was not Harrison\u2019s exclusive remedy. Pursuant to our decision in <em>Drinkwalter v. Shipton Supply Company, Inc. </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 380, 732 P.2d 1335, an individual alleging sexual harassment could initiate proceedings directly in the district court without first filing a complaint with the Human Rights Commission. In <em>Drinkwalter </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">If we were to decide the Human Rights Act provides the sole and exclusive remedy for all claims arising out of sexual harassment, we would also be imposing the 180 day statute of limitation found in \u00a7 49-2-501(2), MCA, on every possible remedy. ... We therefore find the imposition of the 180 day statute of limitations to be further proof of the legislature\u2019s intent that <em>the Human Rights Act </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>not be the sole remedy for acts which also give rise to a cause of action independent of the statute.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><em>Drinkwalter, </em>732 P.2d at 1339 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">However, on April 16,1987, after Harrison\u2019s termination but prior to the filing of her initial complaint in District Court, a legislative amendment of \u00a7 49-2-509, MCA, went into effect. The amendment added the following provision to \u00a7 49-2-509, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">(7) The provisions of this chapter establish the exclusive remedy for acts constituting an alleged violation of this chapter, including acts that may otherwise also constitute a violation of the discrimination provisions of Article II, section 4, of the Montana constitution or 49-1-102. No other claim or request for relief based upon such acts may be entertained by a district court other than by the procedures specified in this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">This amendment effectively overruled this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Drinkwalter </em>and mandated that the Human Rights Act was the sole and exclusive remedy for a sexual harassment cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Harrison proceeded with her case in District Court. The District Court dismissed her cause of action based on the amended language of \u00a7 49-2-509, MCA, set forth above. In affirming the District Court\u2019s decision, we noted that Harrison might still be able to instigate an action with the Human Rights Commission despite the clear elapse of 180 days since the time of her discharge. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">In <em>Erickson v. Croft </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 146, 760 P.2d 706, this Court looked favorably upon the doctrine of equitable tolling. Under that doctrine, the statute of limitations may be tolled when a party reasonably and in good faith pursues one of several possible legal remedies and the claimant meets three criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">\u201c(1) timely notice to the defendant within the applicable statute of limitations in filing the first claim; (2) lack of prejudice to defendant in gathering evidence to defend against the second claim; and (3) good faith and reasonable conduct by the plaintiff in filing the second claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">Erickson, 233 Mont. at 150-51, 760 P.2d at 708. In <em>Erickson, </em>we found no need to adopt equitable tolling because the appellant faded to meet the first criteria; the first claim did not give adequate notice of the second claim. <em>Erickson, </em>233 Mont. at 152, 760 P.2d at 709.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-12\">Under the facts of this case, the doctrine of equitable tolling may be appropriate if Harrison refiles her claim with the Human Rights Commission. Unlike <em>Erickson, </em>here the District Court claim may give Chance adequate notice of a claim before the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Furthermore, in filing with the District Court, the appellant appears to have relied reasonably and in good faith upon this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Drinkwalter. </em>As a case of first impression holding that the legislature overruled <em>Drinkwalter, </em>this case should not prevent the appellant from having her substantive claims heard by the Human Rights Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><em>Harrison I, </em>797 P.2d at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">First, we note that at the time of the alleged torts, Harrison had two legal remedies. Pursuant to our decision in <em>Drinkwalter, </em>Harrison was entitled to file her claim in District Court or pursue her administrative remedies with the Human Rights Commission. Unlike our recent decision in <em>Hash v. U.S. West </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 326, 886 P.2d 442, Harrison reasonably and in good faith pursued one of two potential legal remedies. We declined to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling in <em>Hash </em>because at the time of Hash\u2019s claim, the legislature had already amended \u00a7 49-2-509, MCA, and this Court had handed down its decision in <em>Harrison I </em>in which we determined that the amended language of \u00a7 49-2-509(7), MCA, precluded bringing sexual harassment claims in district court. <em>Hash, </em>886 P.2d at 446. Therefore, Hash had only one legal remedy, that being to file her claim with the Human Rights Commission. <em>Hash </em>is thus clearly distinguishable from this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Harrison relied reasonably and in good faith on this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Drinkwalter. A </em>review of our decision in <em>Harrison I </em>reveals Harrison reasonably believed that the amended version of \u00a7 49-2-509, MCA, either was inapplicable to her claims or, if applicable, would not apply because the alleged torts occurred before the effective date of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Harrison filed her initial claim within the applicable statute of limitation. The final tort allegedly occurred on March 17, 1987, the day Harrison terminated her employment with Chance. Harrison filed her complaint in District Court on September 28, 1987. Such a filing was well within the applicable three-year tort statute of limitations. Section 27-2-204, MCA. Chance argues that, under <em>Erickson v. Croft </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 146, 760 P.2d 706, Harrison had a duty to file her complaint within 180 days, the statute of limitations applicable for a Human Rights Commission claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Even if such an interpretation of <em>Erickson </em>is correct, we conclude that Harrison satisfied the 180-day filing requirement. Prior to the amendments to \u00a7 49-2-509, MCA, Harrison was entitled to file her complaint in District Court. Only after \u00a7 49-2-509, MCA, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>amended was Harrison required to file with the Human Rights Commission. The amendment to \u00a7 49-2-509, MCA, went into effect on April 16, 1987. The 180-day statute of limitations therefore commenced running on the effective date of the statute, not on March 17, 1987. Harrison filed her initial claim in District Court within 180 days of the April 16 effective date of the amendment. Harrison therefore satisfied the Human Rights Commission statute of limitation as well as the tort statute of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">A review of the record reveals that Chance was not prejudiced in gathering evidence to defend against the claim filed with the Human Rights Commission. Extensive discovery took place in conjunction with Harrison\u2019s initial complaint filed in District Court. Chance submitted depositions to the hearing examiner and testified telephonically at the hearing. The record does not support Chance\u2019s allegations that he was prejudiced by Harrison\u2019s delayed filing with the Human Rights Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Finally, it is clear to this Court that Harrison acted in good faith in filing her claim with the Human Rights Commission. Harrison justifiably relied on this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Drinkwalter </em>in pursuing her District Court claim. After we determined that her claim was subject to the amended version of \u00a7 49-2-509, MCA, Harrison promptly filed her claim with the Human Rights Commission. Harrison demonstrated reasonable conduct and good faith throughout these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">We conclude that equitable tolling is applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case and that Harrison has satisfied the elements necessary to invoke equitable tolling as discussed in <em>Erickson. </em>We therefore hold that there are no genuine issues of material fact and Harrison is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. We affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b79-7\">JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
