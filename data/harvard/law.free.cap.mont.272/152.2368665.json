(Riverview), appeals the decision of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, granting ArdellMary Peck\u2019s motion for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The sole issue on review is whether the District Court erred in granting Peck\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Peck filed a complaint in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, alleging she was injured during a slip and fall accident on Riverview property. The dispute ultimately proceeded to a jury trial. During closing arguments, Riverview\u2019s attorney made several allegedly improper and prejudicial comments to the jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Riverview. Peck moved the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Peck filed a document entitled \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Motion for New Trial and Brief in Support.\u201d This was a single, three-page document. The motion section of the document set forth the statutory grounds for a new trial while the brief section set forth the particular facts upon which a new trial was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">Riverview objected to the motion for a new trial, claiming that no improper or prejudicial comments were made during closing arguments and that Peck failed to state the particular grounds in support of her motion for a new trial as required by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. The District Court granted Peck\u2019s motion for a new trial. The court found that Riverview\u2019s attorney had argued facts outside the record during closing argument. The court went on to conclude that the argument was prejudicial and warranted a new trial. The court also found that Peck\u2019s Motion for New Trial and Brief in Support satisfied the requirements of a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Riverview appeals only on the grounds that Peck\u2019s Motion for New Trial and Brief in Support did not satisfy the technical requirements for a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Did the District Court err in granting Peck\u2019s motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"A22\">We review a district court\u2019s granting of a motion for a new trial to determine if there was a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Stanhope v. Lawrence </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 468, 787 P.2d 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Riverview argues that Peck failed to strictly comply with Rules 7(b)(1) and 59(a), M.R.Civ.P., because her motion for a new trial did not state with particularity what grounds she felt warranted a new trial. Riverview argues that Peck\u2019s motion for a new trial should not be granted due to her failure to comply with these rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Peck insists that her motion did comply with the relevant rules of civil procedure. Peck claims that her motion for a new trial and her brief in support of her motion for a new trial were submitted to the District Court as a single document and should therefore be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"A3f\">Rule 7(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P., states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">An application to the court for an order shall be by motion which, unless made during a hearing or trial, shall be made in writing, <em>shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, </em>and shall set forth the relief or order sought. The requirement of writing is fulfilled if the motion is stated in a written notice of the hearing of the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao_\">(Emphasis added.) Rule 59(a), M.R.Civ.P., states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">A new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues for any of the reasons provided by the statutes of the state of Montana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\"><em>A motion for a new trial shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, it not being sufficient merely to set forth the statutory grounds, </em>but the motion may be amended, upon reasonable notice, up to and including the time of hearing the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaJ\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">The general rule is that a motion for a new trial must be denied if the movant does not state with particularity the grounds for the motion. <em>See Halsey v. Uithof </em>(1975), 166 Mont. 319, 532 P.2d 686. However, in this case, Peck did not fail to state with particularity the grounds for her motion; rather, the reasons were included under the heading of \u201cBrief\u2019 rather than under the heading of \u201cMotion.\u201d The brief and the motion were contained within the same three-page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>document. The document was served upon Riverview within ten days following Notice of Entry of Judgment as mandated by Rule 59(b), M.R.Civ.P. Although contained under the heading \u201cBrief\u2019 rather than under the heading \u201cMotion,\u201d the document did set forth with particularity the grounds upon which the motion was based.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">In reference to the Rules of Civil Procedure, we recently stated: The rules should be followed at all times by any practicing attorney. In this case, the Landowners\u2019 counsel failed to abide by the mandates and did not specifically set out grounds on which any hearing should have occurred. Considerable evidence was allowed subsequent to the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. <em>Nonetheless, we have stated that the rules encourage disposition of cases on their merits and therefore we will consider all evidence presented to the District Court. </em>(Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><em>Adams v. Department of Highways </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 393, 398-99, 753 P.2d 846, 849 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Riverview does not allege that Peck failed to state the particular grounds for a new trial, but merely that the motion is fatally flawed because the particular grounds were listed under the heading of \u201cBrief\u2019 rather than under the heading of \u201cMotion.\u201d Such a technical flaw is not fatal to Peck\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Rule 8(e)(1), M.R.Civ.P., states, in part, \u201c[n]o technical forms of pleading or motion are required.\u201d Also, in its findings of fact, the District Court correctly pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">The Defendant had notice from December 9, 1994, the date of service of Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for New Trial and Brief in Support, of the precise grounds on which Plaintiff sought relief. This finding is further supported by this Court\u2019s observation of Defendant\u2019s preparedness for the hearing, including by Defendant\u2019s brief, by Defendant\u2019s submission of excerpts of trial testimony and final argument, and by defense counsel\u2019s oral argument at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Are\">Riverview clearly knew on what grounds Peck sought a new trial and was not prejudiced by the specific grounds being listed in the brief section rather than the motion section of Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for New Trial and Brief in Support.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">We conclude that the Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for New Trial and Brief in Support satisfied the notice requirements of Rules 7(b)(1) and 59(a), M.R.Civ.P. The District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in granting Peck\u2019s motion for a new trial.
