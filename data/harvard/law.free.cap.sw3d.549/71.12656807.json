A hearing panel (\"Panel\") imposed a final discipline of twenty-five months' suspension, retroactive to the date of his initial suspension by this Court, which was on October 25, 2016. Neither the Board nor Mr. Cope appealed this judgment. The Board petitioned this Court for an order enforcing the Panel's judgment. Pursuant to Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 9, section 15.4(b) and (c), we determined that the punishment imposed by the Panel appeared inadequate and proposed that it be increased. Mr. Cope subsequently requested oral argument, which we granted. We now consider whether the punishment imposed by the Panel is appropriate under the circumstances of this case and is in uniformity with prior disciplinary decisions in this state. Following a thorough review of the record and the law, we conclude that it is not. Therefore, we modify the Panel's judgment to impose the twenty-five-month suspension prospectively from the filing of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   James Carl Cope is an attorney originally licensed to practice law in Tennessee in 1974. On October 21, 2016, Mr. Cope pleaded guilty in federal district court to one count of the felony offense of insider trading in violation of United States Code title 15, section 78j(b) and Code of Federal Regulations title 17, section 240.10b-5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The federal court ultimately sentenced him to twenty-four months of probation, the first nine months of which required home confinement, with a fine of $200,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 25, 2016, this Court suspended Mr. Cope's license to practice law and referred the matter to the Board for determination of final discipline to be imposed pursuant to Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 9, section 22.3. On November 7, 2016, the Board filed a Petition for Final Discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The matter came before the Panel on April 12 and 18, 2017. The only issue before the Panel was the extent of final discipline to be imposed as a result of the admitted criminal act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 9, \u00a7 22.3. During the hearing, Mr. Cope admitted that while he was on the Board of Directors for Pinnacle Financial Partners, he received non-public material information that Pinnacle was initiating a conversation with Avenue Bank about purchasing Avenue Bank. Mr. Cope purchased a total of 10,179 shares of Avenue Bank using limit orders through his personal TD Ameritrade account on two separate dates. He did not share the information with anyone else. At the hearing, several witnesses, including judges, respected members of the bar, a county mayor, and a university president, testified to Mr. Cope's otherwise impeccable career in Rutherford County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 1, 2017, the Panel entered its Final Order of Discipline. The Panel first determined that the appropriate presumptive discipline under the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (\"ABA Standards\") was disbarment.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote                id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ABA Standard 5.11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Panel found two aggravating factors to be applicable: (1) dishonest or selfish motive and (2) substantial experience in the practice of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ABA Standard 9.22. The Panel also found applicable the following mitigating factors: (1) absence of a prior disciplinary record; (2) full and free disclosure to the Board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; (3) character and reputation of the attorney; and (4) remorse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ABA Standard 9.32. The Panel then weighed the factors and imposed a period of twenty-five months' suspension, reasoning as follows:\n  </blockquote               >\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-15\">\n   The mitigating factors clearly outweigh aggravating factors and the additional mitigating factors justify a deviation from the generally appropriate discipline of disbarment as the public is sufficiently protected by a discipline of a suspension for a period of twenty-five (25) months retroactive to the date of the Order of Enforcement on October 25, 2016, which also coincides with the completion of [Mr. Cope's] federal sentence for insider trading.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Neither the Board nor Mr. Cope appealed the Panel's decision, and the parties agreed to submit the case to this Court for final disposition. On August 17, 2017, this Court issued an order stating that the proposed punishment seemed inadequate and should be increased.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 9, \u00a7 15.4(b)-(c). Subsequently, Mr. Cope requested oral argument, which this Court granted, and the parties filed briefs in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.

For this conduct, the ABA Standards set a presumptive sanction of disbarment because insider trading involves fraud and deceit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ABA Standard 5.11(a)-(b). However, the ABA Standards also allow the application of aggravating or mitigating circumstances to adjust the sanction imposed. ABA Standard 9.1.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    We first consider the facts of this case. Mr. Cope's conduct was essentially limited to one instance, although the intended purchase of 10,000 shares took two separate days to complete. He did not share the non-public information with anyone else, and he did not attempt to hide his action. His unrealized profits amounted to approximately $56,000, which he has disgorged in addition to paying a $200,000 fine. He has had no other disciplinary actions in his lengthy career. Accordingly, the Panel found, and we agree, that two aggravating factors and four mitigating factors are applicable. The aggravating factors are (1) dishonest or selfish motive and (2) substantial experience in the practice of law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ABA Standard 9.22. The four applicable mitigating factors are: (1) absence of a prior disciplinary record; (2) full and free disclosure to the Board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; (3) character and reputation of the attorney; and (4) remorse.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ABA Standard 9.32.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    In view of attaining uniformity of punishment, we must also consider the sanctions imposed in similar cases.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Allison\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301468\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/284/316/#p327\">\n     284 S.W.3d at 327\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . For purposes of our analysis, cases presenting similar circumstances as this case are those in which an attorney has been convicted of a felony.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    In those cases, almost all of the attorneys were disbarred.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g., In re\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Everett Hoge Mechem, BPR #11854\n    </em>\n    , No. M2017-00818-SC-BAR-BP (Tenn. Apr. 28, 2017) (Order) (twenty-eight counts of wire fraud,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    );\n    <em>\n     In re\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Frank Alfred Baker, BPR #31931\n    </em>\n    , No. M2016-01474-SC-BAR-BP (Tenn. Dec. 22, 2016) (Order) (four counts of wire fraud,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    );\n    <em>\n     In re\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     John Lyndon Lowery, BPR #16195\n    </em>\n    , No. M2016-02492-SC-BAR-BP (Tenn. Dec. 15, 2016) (Order) (seven counts of theft and eight counts of forgery). However, there were two cases in which the attorney in question was convicted of a felony meeting\n    the criteria of ABA Standard 5.11 but received a four-year suspension instead of disbarment.\n    <em>\n     See In re\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Carla Ann Kent Ford, BPR #14312\n    </em>\n    , No. M2016-01035-SC-BAR-BP (Tenn.

June 27, 2016) (Order) (attempted criminal usury conviction in New York). In another similar case, the attorney was convicted in state court of felony theft and in federal court of willful failure to file tax returns; in that case, the hearing panel determined that suspension was the appropriate baseline sanction under ABA Standard 5.12 and suspended the attorney for four years.\n    <em>\n     Lockett v. Bd. of Prof'l Responsibility\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7114615\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/380/19/#p27\">\n     380 S.W.3d 19\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 27 (Tenn. 2012).\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Based on the above analysis, we conclude that the circumstances justify the imposition of a term of suspension rather than that of disbarment in this case because,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , Mr. Cope has had no other disciplinary actions in his career, his criminal conduct was atypical, and his conduct did not injure his clients. In addition, the Panel's imposition of a term of suspension of twenty-five months is appropriate because Mr. Cope's conduct was somewhat less egregious than that of other attorneys who received lengthier suspensions, particularly in the\n    <em>\n     Lockett\n    </em>\n    case wherein the criminal conduct spanned three years and directly impacted the attorney's firm.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lockett\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7114615\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/380/19/#p27\">\n     380 S.W.3d at 21-22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, in the interest of maintaining uniformity in attorney sanctions, Mr. Cope's suspension must be prospective rather than retroactive to the date of his initial suspension by this Court in October 2016. If Mr. Cope's suspension were retroactive, the total length of his suspension would only be twenty-five months, half of what other attorneys in similar cases (even those whose suspension was also retroactive) received. Because a retroactive suspension would be a drastic departure from the length of the sanctions imposed in prior cases, we modify the Panel's judgment to impose a twenty-five-month suspension prospectively from the filing of this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Mr. Cope argues that any increase in his sanctions constitutes punishment antithetical to the purposes of attorney discipline and points to the economic consequences of his actions, from the disgorgement of unrealized profits and a hefty fine to the loss of his income, as evidence that he has been punished enough. The ABA Standards provide that \"[t]he purpose of lawyer discipline proceedings is to protect the public and the administration of justice from lawyers who have not discharged, will not discharge, or are unlikely properly to discharge their professional duties to clients, the public, the legal system, and the legal profession.\" ABA Standard 1.1. This Court's opinion in\n    <em>\n     Cowan\n    </em>\n    also draws a distinction between the sanctions imposed for attorney discipline and criminal penalties, noting that the primary purpose for attorney discipline-protection of the public-\"is not abated merely because criminal penalties have already been imposed.\"\n    <em>\n     Bd. of Prof'l Responsibility v.

This Court has recognized that \"[w]hile the attorney disciplinary process is punitive in some respects, its purpose is to safeguard the administration of justice, protect the public from the misconduct or unfitness of members of the legal profession, and preserve the confidence\n    of the public in the integrity and trustworthiness of lawyers in general.\"\n    <em>\n     Hornbeck v.

Mr. Cope insists that the public is in no danger from him and that further sanctions serve merely to punish him, but Mr. Cope's suspension is commensurate with the larger purpose of attorney discipline, which includes preserving the public's confidence in the profession.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Based on our careful consideration of the entire record \"with a view to attaining uniformity of punishment throughout the State and appropriateness of punishment under the circumstances of each particular case,\" Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 9, \u00a7 15.4 (b), we modify the judgment of the Hearing Panel to impose a twenty-five-month suspension, prospective from the filing of this opinion. The costs of this cause shall be paid by James Carl Cope, for which execution may issue if necessary.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-45\">\n     In his brief to this Court, Mr. Cope presented several cases that he argued were comparable to his case. However, the baseline sanction in the cases he cited was not disbarment as in his case; therefore, the cases are not comparable.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Milligan v.

Another case cited by Mr. Cope is not comparable because the opinion concerns only the requirements imposed for reinstatement and does not address the attorney's suspension other than stating that he received a two-year suspension.\n     <em>\n      Dockery v.
