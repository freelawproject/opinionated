I disagree. Marriage is a fundamental right. Spousal benefits are not. Thus, the two issues are distinct, with sharply contrasting standards for review.

II, \u00a7 22. Because Texas law defined marriage to exist only between persons of the opposite sex, same-sex partners were accordingly not entitled to receive such benefits. In November 2013, however, the City announced it would change course. It began offering benefits such as health insurance to same-sex partners of City employees if they married in a state that recognized same-sex marriage. It did so despite a Texas law expressly prohibiting it from giving effect to a \"right or claim to any ... benefit ... asserted as a result of a marriage between persons of the same sex.\" TEX. FAM.

The court of appeals apparently assumed that, if the Supreme Court concluded no government interest justifies recognizing marriage as only between couples of the opposite sex, then no interest justifies offering different benefits to same-sex and opposite-sex spouses of City employees. But, as discussed below, marriage-not spousal employment benefits-is a fundamental right, and laws limiting access to a fundamental right receive stricter scrutiny than laws distributing government benefits.

From the Founding to modern times, it has always been understood that legislatures, rather than courts, decide what policies are in the people's best interest. In Alexander Hamilton's words, \"[t]he legislature ... prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated,\" whereas the judiciary \"may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgment.\" THE FEDERALIST NO.78, at 490 (Alexander Hamilton) (Benjamin Fletcher Wright ed., 1961). These same principles emerge in the \"minimum 'rational-basis review' \" applicable to general social and economic legislation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505733\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/356/#p366\">\n    531 U.S. at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505733\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/356/#p366\">\n    121 S.Ct. 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When fundamental rights and protected classes are not at stake, the legislature may identify goals and take rational steps toward them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court of appeals upset this balance between the judiciary and the legislature by inappropriately applying strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   hinged on marriage's status as a fundamental right.\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 2604. This case, however, involves employment benefits, which the City obviously has no constitutional duty to offer to its employees, let alone their spouses. Though the laws in\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   denying access to marriage were subject to strict scrutiny, the laws in this case allocating benefits among married couples are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Indeed, criteria that cannot be used to restrict marriage may still be relevant when allocating benefits. Consider, for example, that the Supreme Court allowed the government to condition continued eligibility for child disability benefits on not marrying someone who did not also qualify for these benefits, even though the government obviously could not bar disabled persons from marriage for failing this requirement.\n   <em>\n    Califano v. Jobst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179028\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/47/#p58\">\n    434 U.S. 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179028\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/47/#p58\">\n    98 S.Ct. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179028\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/47/#p58\">\n    54 L.Ed.2d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977). Similarly, the Supreme Court allowed Congress to grant continued social security survivor's benefits to widows who remarried after 60, but terminate the same benefits to divorced persons who remarried after 60.\n   <em>\n    Bowen v. Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12761\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/340/#p341\">\n    476 U.S. 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 341-42, 350,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12761\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/340/#p341\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12761\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/340/#p341\">\n    90 L.Ed.2d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). This condition was acceptable for allocating benefits, but could not have been used to prevent anyone from marrying. The same distinction applies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The City, however, emphasizes\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   's holding that states may not \"exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.\"\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 2605. But\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   concerned same-sex couples' right to marry-i.e., to enter into marriage-and must be interpreted accordingly. In Texas, both same- and opposite-sex couples must obtain a marriage license from a county clerk. T EX . F AM . C ODE \u00a7 2.001(a). They must generally be over 18 years of age,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.101, should provide proof of their age and identity,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.005(a), and should not be closely related to the intended spouse or be already married to someone else,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2.004(b)(5)-(6), .009(a)(5). These are the types of \"terms and conditions\" that the Supreme Court held states must allow same-sex couples to enter into marriage on.\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   did not require that the same benefits be provided to all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thus, claims by same-sex spouses of City employees to employment benefits do not enjoy the benefit of strict scrutiny. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Romer v. Evans\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court considered whether a law denying special protections to homosexuals had \"a rational relation to some legitimate end.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745985\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/620/#p631\">\n    517 U.S. 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745985\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/620/#p631\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745985\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/620/#p631\">\n    134 L.Ed.2d 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And in\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   , when the majority conceded that democracy is normally \"the appropriate process for change,\" it made an exception only for laws abridging fundamental rights, without suggesting that same-sex couples are a suspect class. 135 S.Ct. at 2605.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Admittedly, the\n    <em>\n     Obergefell\n    </em>\n    majority assumed same- and opposite-sex couples would receive the same benefits, reasoning that \"[w]ere the Court to stay its hand to allow slower, case-by-case determination of the required availability of specific public benefits to same-sex couples, it still would deny gays and lesbians many rights and responsibilities intertwined with marriage.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2606. The Court described the many benefits married couples enjoy, noting that no difference exists \"between same- and opposite-sex couples with respect to\" how the states have \"contributed to the fundamental character\" of marriage by tying so many rights and responsibilities to it.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2601. Yet, the fact remains that, at most, the majority merely\n    <em>\n     described\n    </em>\n    the benefits that states confer on married couples and\n    <em>\n     assumed\n    </em>\n    states would extend them to all married couples.

Surely the same is true in marriage, the closest and most intimate of communities in our nation. Yet, by applying strict scrutiny, the court of appeals foreclosed any argument that the State has a legitimate or important interest in celebrating these differences when they occur in marriage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Consider the State's interest in encouraging procreation. The State may well have believed that offering certain benefits to opposite-sex couples would encourage procreation within marriage. After all, benefits such as health insurance provide financial security as couples decide whether to have a child. An opposite-sex marriage is the only marital relationship where children are raised by their biological parents. In any other relationship, the child must\n    be removed from at least one natural parent, perhaps two, before being adopted by her new parent(s). This does not diminish any child's inherent dignity, a fact the City presumably recognizes by extending benefits to their employees' children regardless of the employees' marital status. But it does explain why the State might choose to direct resources to opposite-sex couples.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Conversely, at least five justices of the Supreme Court have reasoned that the government has a compelling interest in ensuring access to contraception.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Burwell v.

Obviously, any government interest in providing access to contraceptives is linked to opposite-sex couples: they must plan\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    to get pregnant, whereas same-sex couples must undergo extensive planning and preparation before adopting or using in-vitro fertilization. Again, differences exist between same- and opposite-sex couples, and such differences may explain the State's allocation of benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Admittedly, the State's policy is not perfect. Not all opposite-sex couples want, or are even capable of, procreation. But if rational-basis review instead of strict scrutiny applies, then the imperfections are not fatal. \"The rationality commanded by the Equal Protection Clause does not require States to match [class] distinctions and the legitimate interests they serve with razorlike precision.\"\n    <em>\n     Kimel v.
