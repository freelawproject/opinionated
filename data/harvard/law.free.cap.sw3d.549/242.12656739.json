INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is an interlocutory appeal from the denial of Appellant Baylor Scott &amp; White a/k/a Baylor Health Care System's (BHCS) plea to the jurisdiction based on governmental immunity.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2051.014\">\n    Tex.

Code Ann. \u00a7 51.014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8) (West Supp. 2017) (allowing appeal from interlocutory order that grants or denies a plea to the jurisdiction by a governmental unit). We address a single, narrow issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We assume that BHCS is a \"hospital district management contractor\" under the definition set forth in Texas Health and Safety Code section 285.071, and we address whether, as such, BHCS qualifies for the governmental immunity statutorily created by Texas Health and Safety Code section 285.072.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20285.071\">\n    Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 285.071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , .072 (West 2017). Because\n   BHCS's affiliation agreement with Decatur Hospital Authority d/b/a Wise Regional Health System (Wise Regional) expressly prohibits BHCS from managing or operating any aspect of Wise Regional, and because BHCS is not a hospital district management contractor that manages or operates Wise Regional, BHCS does not possess governmental immunity from suit under section 285.072 in the underlying negligence action filed by Appellee Kimberly D. Peyton; we will therefore dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After suffering negative effects from opiate over-sedation during a total left knee arthroplasty at Wise Regional, Peyton filed suit against multiple defendants, including BHCS. Peyton alleged that, among other things, BHCS was negligent because it had failed to properly train the nursing staff as required by BHCS's affiliation agreement with Wise Regional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BHCS filed a plea to the jurisdiction. BHCS asserted that by virtue of Texas Health and Safety Code section 285.072, BHCS had been statutorily declared to be a governmental unit for purposes of the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA). Claiming governmental unit status, BHCS argued that Peyton failed to provide BHCS with a notice of claim as required by the TTCA and that Peyton's claims do not fall within the waiver of immunity provided by the TTCA, so that the trial court lacks jurisdiction over BHCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Peyton filed a response to BHCS's plea to the jurisdiction. Peyton argued that BHCS's affiliation agreement with Wise Regional conveyed no managerial responsibilities or operational authority to BHCS and that, accordingly, no facts exist enabling BHCS to qualify for the governmental immunity created by section 285.072.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After hearing argument and reviewing the pleadings, the trial court signed an order denying BHCS's plea to the jurisdiction. This interlocutory appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. BHCS IS NOT ENTITLED TO GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In its sole issue, BHCS argues that the trial court erred by denying its plea to the jurisdiction because it is a hospital district management contractor-as that term is defined in Texas Health and Safety Code section 285.071 -and that, as such, Texas Health and Safety Code section 285.072 declares it to be a governmental unit entitled to immunity under the TTCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
