In the petition, Texas Windstorm asks this court to compel the Honorable Lonnie Cox, presiding judge of the 122nd District Court of Galveston County, to set aside his (1) August 25, 2016 order granting the motion to compel production, or alternatively, motion to exclude the testimony of Paul Strickland, filed by the City of Dickinson; and (2) August 25, 2016 order denying Texas Windstorm's motion to withdraw Exhibit 3-A to its response to the motion to compel. We conditionally grant the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Texas Windstorm issued a commercial windstorm policy to the City of Dickinson. The parties dispute the amount Texas Windstorm owed the City under the policy for property damage caused by high winds during Hurricane Ike. The City sued Texas Windstorm for breach of contract, fraud, violations of the Texas Insurance Code, and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and requested a declaratory judgment regarding certain items under Chapter 541 of the Insurance Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The City filed a traditional motion for summary judgment on causation. Texas Windstorm filed a response, which included an affidavit of its corporate representative, Paul Strickland, who also opined as a non-retained expert. During Strickland's deposition, the City learned that Strickland's affidavit had been revised in a series of emails between Strickland and Texas Windstorm's counsel. The City filed a motion to compel all communications between Strickland and Texas Windstorm's counsel, or in the alternative, a motion to exclude Strickland as an expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A series of clerical errors and miscommunications occurred when Texas Windstorm prepared its response to the motion to compel. As a result of those errors and miscommunications, fifty-five pages of documents, which Texas Windstorm claimed were protected under the attorney-client and attorney work product privileges and intended to be tendered physically to the court in camera in a sealed envelope, were inadvertently e-filed as Exhibit 3-A to Texas Windstorm's response to the motion to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Between the evening of August 8, 2016, when Exhibit 3-A was e-filed, and a hearing on the motion to compel set for August 9, 2016, Texas Windstorm's counsel discovered the filing error. Texas Windstorm's counsel sent an email to the City's counsel, requesting an agreement on an emergency motion to withdraw the documents in Exhibit 3-A (\"snap-back\" motion). The City's counsel responded, \"Opposed.\" Texas Windstorm also sent a letter to the City's counsel, invoking the snap-back provision of the Rule 193.3(d) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and requesting that the City delete or destroy all copies of the documents in Exhibit 3-A. Texas Windstorm also filed an emergency snap-back motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court heard the motion to compel and the snap-back motion at the August 9, 2016 hearing. Texas Windstorm presented the inadvertently disclosed documents under seal for in camera review. The trial court did not rule on the parties' respective motions at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 10, 2016, Texas Windstorm's counsel emailed the City's counsel, asking him to agree to a motion to seal the record and not to disseminate the documents pending a final resolution of the privilege issue. The City's counsel agreed, and Texas Windstorm filed the motion to seal. On August 11, 2016, the trial court signed an order, directing the Galveston County District Clerk to place any copies of Exhibit 3-A under seal, and the City not to disseminate Exhibit 3-A until final resolution of Texas Windstorm's motion to withdraw Exhibit 3-A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court held another hearing on August 25, 2016. The trial court denied Texas Windstorm's motion to withdraw Exhibit 3-A, and granted the City's motion to compel, ordering Texas Windstorm to produce the items provided to, reviewed by, or prepared by or for Strickland in anticipation of his testimony as an expert, \"including all e-mails and drafts he exchanged with TWIA's counsel to prepare his Affidavit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court also granted the motion to seal the record as to the emails and the drafts of the affidavit in Exhibit 3-A and prevent their dissemination for ten days unless Texas Windstorm filed a petition for writ of mandamus in ten days, in which case the order would continue in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When Texas Windstorm did not produce the documents, the City's counsel, on August 30, 2016, wrote Texas Windstorm's counsel asking that he advise of the status of the production no later than the close of the day, or the City would move forward for sanctions. Texas Windstorm filed its petition for writ of mandamus in this court the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To be entitled to mandamus relief, a relator must demonstrate (1) the trial court clearly abused its discretion; and (2) the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal.\n   <em>\n    In re Reece\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319355\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/341/360/#p364\">\n    341 S.W.3d 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364 (Tex. 2011) (orig. proceeding).

The City's Motion to Compel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its petition, Texas Windstorm asserts that the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work product privilege protect the emails and drafts of Strickland's affidavit from discovery. The City contends that neither the attorney-client privilege nor the work-product privilege applies to testifying experts, even if the expert is an employee of the client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The City sought to compel all communications between Strickland and Texas Windstorm's counsel pursuant to Rules 194.2(f)(4) and 192.3(e)(6) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 192.3(e)(6) provides that a party may obtain the following items, which have been provided to, reviewed by, or prepared by or for an expert in anticipation of testifying:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (e)\n   <em>\n    Testifying and Consulting Experts.\n   </em>\n   The identity, mental impressions, and opinions of a consulting expert whose mental impressions and opinions have not been reviewed by a testifying expert are not discoverable.

P. 194 cmt. 1 (providing that a party may assert any applicable privileges to written discovery except for the work-product privilege). Thus, Texas Windstorm's assertion of attorney work-product privilege does not protect the emails and drafts from discovery pursuant to rules 194.2(f)(4) and 192.3(e)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   However, even though the work-product privilege does not protect documents and other items from disclosure, the attorney-client privilege generally protects attorney-client communications from discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Moreover, an in camera review of the emails and the drafts of the affidavit in Exhibit 3-A reflects that they are attorney-client communications. Therefore, we conclude that Texas Windstorm met its burden to establish that the emails in Exhibit 3-A are attorney-client communications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mem'l Hermann Hosp.

The City, however, contends that the attorney-client privilege does not protect those communications pursuant to rules 194.2(f)(4) and 192.3(e)(6) because Strickland is a testifying expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Rules 192.3(e)(6) and 194.2(f)(4) contain identical language allowing for discovery or disclosure of \"all documents, tangible things, reports, models, or data compilations that have been provided to, reviewed by, or prepared by or for the expert in anticipation of a testifying expert's testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.3(e)(6), 194.2(f)(4). Nothing in rule 192 or its comments address the applicability of privileges. Given the identical language found in rules 192.3(e)(6) and 194.2(f)(4), it would be inconsistent to allow a party to claim the attorney-client privilege under rule 194.2(f)(4) but not under 192.3(e)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Dallas Court of Appeals addressed the assertion of the attorney-privilege in response to a request for the disclosure of documents provided to the expert, who was also a \"client representative.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Segner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6909527\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/409/\">\n    441 S.W.3d 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion by denying Texas Windstorm's snap-back motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's London\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301496\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/294/891/#p907\">\n    294 S.W.3d 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 907 (Tex. App.-Beaumont 2009, orig. proceeding [mand. denied] ) (holding trial court abused its discretion by denying snap-back motion because the documents\n   were privileged, relator properly requested their return, and the request was timely).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As addressed above, the emails and accompanying drafts of Strickland's affidavit between Texas Windstorm's counsel and Strickland in Exhibit 3-A are protected by the attorney-client privilege and are not subject to disclosure. Therefore, the trial court also abused its discretion by granting the City's motion to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because the trial court abused its discretion by granting the City's motion to compel and by denying Texas Windstorm's snap-back motion, we must determine whether Texas Windstorm has an adequate remedy by appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    II. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The trial court abused its discretion by ordering Texas Windstorm to produce documents protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege. This discovery error cannot be cured on appeal. Therefore, Texas Windstorm does not have an adequate remedy by appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christus Santa Rosa Health Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6783582\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/492/276/#p279\">\n    492 S.W.3d at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that a party claiming a privilege does not have an adequate remedy by appeal when the trial court erroneously orders the production of privileged documents).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We hold that (1) the trial court abused its discretion by ordering Texas Windstorm to produce the email exchanges and drafts of Strickland's affidavit between Texas Windstorm's counsel and Strickland and by denying Texas Windstorm's snap-back motion; and (2) Texas Windstorm does not have an adequate remedy by appeal. Accordingly, we conditionally grant Texas Windstorm's petition for mandamus relief, and direct the trial court to set aside its (1) August 25, 2016 order granting the City's motion to compel production, or alternatively, motion to exclude the testimony of Paul Strickland; and (2) August 25, 2016 order denying Texas Windstorm's motion to withdraw Exhibit 3-A, and grant the motion to withdraw Exhibit 3- A.\n   <em>\n    See In re Living Ctrs. of Tex., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898860\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/175/253/#p256\">\n    175 S.W.3d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256 (Tex. 2005) (orig. proceeding) (stating that mandamus is appropriate to protect confidential documents from discovery). The writ will issue only if the trial court does not act in conformity with this opinion. We further lift our stay entered on September 9, 2016.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
