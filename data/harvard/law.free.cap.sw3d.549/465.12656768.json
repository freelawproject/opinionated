We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Spurgeon's late husband, Gary,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   was an employee of the Missouri Department of Public Safety, Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Control, from January 12, 1976, through November 30, 2009. He retired on December 1, 2009. Gary was covered for health care benefits under MCHCP at the time of his retirement. He elected to continue coverage with MCHCP upon his retirement and maintained coverage until his death on March 4, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Gary did not elect to enroll Spurgeon in MCHCP coverage when he retired. Spurgeon, therefore, was not covered by MCHCP at the time of Gary's death. At the time of Gary's passing, Spurgeon was an employee of Crawford Electric Cooperative covered under her employer's health insurance plan. After Gary's death, Spurgeon completed a Survivor Enrollment Form which was received by MCHCP on April 3, 2014. MCHCP denied Spurgeon's application on the grounds that Spurgeon was ineligible to enroll for survivor coverage under 22 C.S.R. 10-2.020(2)(C)2. This provision only allows survivors of retirees to continue enrollment in MCHCP if the retiree elected at retirement to enroll the survivor; it does not allow a survivor to initiate enrollment at the time of a retiree's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Spurgeon appealed MCHCP's decision to the MCHCP Board of Trustees (\"the Board\"). The Board denied Spurgeon's appeal. On October 2, 2014, Spurgeon filed an amended petition\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the circuit court against the Board and Judith Muck, executive director of MCHCP (\"Respondent's\" collectively). The amended petition alleged that Spurgeon met all of the requirements of Section 103.085 to be allowed healthcare coverage under MCHCP, and the Board's denial of her appeal was unlawful, unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, and deprived her of a property right she is entitled to under the law. Spurgeon also contended that she had relied upon an averment made in a telephone call to MCHCP's customer service representative that Spurgeon could wait until Gary's death to enroll for coverage. Further, she argued that MCHCP had discretion to approve coverage pursuant to\n   22 C.S.R. 10-2.075(6)(B). She contended that 22 C.S.R. 10-2.020(2)(C)2 contradicts Section 103.098 which statutorily authorizes her enrollment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 22, 2014, Respondents moved to dismiss Spurgeon's petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court heard argument on Respondent's motion on November 7, 2014, and on July 15, 2015, entered a Judgment dismissing Spurgeon's petition for failure to state a claim. Spurgeon appealed the circuit court's dismissal to this court. On March 9, 2016, we issued a mandate reversing the circuit court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    Spurgeon v.

In her first point she contends that the circuit court erred in finding that MCHCP was required to deny her application for survivor enrollment because denial of her enrollment is contrary to the purpose of the plan's establishment set forth in Section 103.005,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and she met the statutorily\n   mandated requirements for enrollment under Section 103.085. In her second point she contends that 22 C.S.R. 10-2.020(2)(B)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   is in direct conflict with Section 103.085 and, therefore, the court erred in applying 22 C.S.R. 10-2.020. As both points involve interpretation of Section 103.085, we review them together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    MCHCP's Purpose-Section 103.005\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Section 103.005, titled \"Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan established, purpose-powers to carry out plan,\" states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-21\">\n   For the purpose of covering medical expenses of the officers, employees and retirees, the eligible dependents of officers, employees and retirees and to the surviving spouses and children of deceased officers, employees and retirees of the state and participating member agencies of the state, there is hereby created and established a health care plan which shall be a body corporate, which shall be under the management of the board of trustees herein described, and shall be known as the \"Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan\". Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, such plan may sue and be sued, transact business, contract, invest funds and hold cash, securities and other property and shall be vested with such other powers as may be necessary or proper to enable it, its officers, employees, and agents to carry out fully and effectively all the purposes of sections 103.003 to 103.175.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Spurgeon suggests that Section 103.005 endows her with an absolute right to MCHCP coverage because it states that the MCHCP was created, in part, for the purpose of covering medical expenses of surviving spouses of retirees. It does not. Section 103.005 is clear that the provisions implementing the purposes of MCHCP are set forth in Sections 103.003 to 103.175. Section 103.005, therefore, is inseparable from the entirety of Chapter 103 and the purposes of the MCHCP contained and reflected therein. If a provision within Chapter 103 (in this case Section 103.085) prohibits Spurgeon's enrollment in the MCHCP, it is consistent with the purpose of Section 103.005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Termination of MCHCP Coverage-Section 103.085\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 103.085, titled \"Termination of coverage, when, exceptions, certain persons may choose to continue coverage, requirements,\" states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-25\">\n   Except as otherwise provided by sections 103.003 to 103.080, medical benefits coverage as provided by sections 103.003 to 103.080 shall terminate when the member ceases to be an active employee; except persons receiving or entitled to receive an annuity or retirement benefit or disability benefit or the spouse of or unemancipated children of deceased persons receiving or entitled to receive an annuity or retirement benefit or disability benefit from the state, participating\n   member agency, institution, political subdivision or governmental entity may elect to continue coverage, provided the individuals to be covered have been continuously covered for health care benefits:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) Under a separate group or individual policy for the six-month period immediately preceding the member's date of death or disability or eligibility for normal or early retirement; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) Pursuant to sections 103.003 to 103.080, since the effective date of the most recent open enrollment period prior to the member's date of death or disability or eligibility for normal or early retirement; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-28\">\n   (3) From the initial date of eligibility for the benefits provided by sections 103.003 to 103.080; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-29\">\n   (4) Within sixty days of a loss of group coverage, provided that such coverage was in place for at least twelve consecutive months immediately prior to the loss and that such loss was due to the dependent's termination of employment or termination of group coverage by the dependent's employer. This subdivision only applies to qualifying dependents of members receiving or entitled to receive an annuity or retirement benefit from the state, participating member agency, institution, political subdivision, or governmental entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-30\">\n   Cost for coverage continued pursuant to this section shall be determined by the board. If an eligible person does not elect to continue the coverage within thirty-one days of the first day of the month following the date on which the eligible person ceases to be an employee, he or she may not later elect to be covered pursuant to this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Spurgeon focuses on Section 103.085's statement that the spouse of a deceased retiree may elect to continue MCHCP coverage if the individuals to be covered have been continuously covered for health care benefits under a separate group or individual policy for six months preceding the death of the retiree. She contends that this statement authorized her enrollment in the MCHCP following Gary's death because nothing within this provision requires the separate group or individual policy to be an MCHCP policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 103.005 creates the MCHCP and establishes that it will be managed by the Board. Section 103.008 vests the \"general administration and the responsibility for the proper operation for the plan\" with the Board. Details for administration of the plan are not set forth in the statutes. Section 103.059 requires the Board to formulate and adopt rules and regulations for the administration of the plan. The rules created by the Board pursuant to Section 103.059 are set forth in Missouri's Code of State Regulations. The \"General Membership Provisions\" of the MCHCP are detailed in 22 C.S.R. 10-2.020. Among other things, these provisions encompass active employee coverage, retiree coverage, survivor coverage, and dependent coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   22 C.S.R. 10-2.020 requires that, in order for a surviving spouse to continue enrollment in MCHCP coverage upon the death of a retiree, the surviving spouse must be covered by the MCHCP at the time of the retiree's death. All parties acknowledge that, if valid, 22 C.S.R. 10-2.020 prevents Spurgeon's enrollment in MCHCP. The question before us, then, is whether 22 C.S.R. 10-2.020 improperly expands or modifies Section 103.085 as Spurgeon contends. We conclude that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   22 C.S.R. 10-2.020(2), titled \"General Membership Provisions\" states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (B) Retiree Coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-36\">\n   1. An employee may participate in an MCHCP plan when s/he retires if s/he receives a monthly retirement benefit from either MOSERS or from Public School Retirement System (PSRS) for state employment. The employee may elect coverage for him/herself and his/her spouse/child(ren), provided the employee and his/her spouse/child(ren) have been continuously covered for health care benefits-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. Through MCHCP since the effective date of the last open enrollment period;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   B. Through MCHCP since the initial date of eligibility; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-39\">\n   C. Through group or individual medical coverage for the six (6) months immediately prior to retirement. Proof of prior group or individual coverage (letter from previous insurance carrier or former employer with dates of effective coverage and list of persons covered) is required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-41\">\n   5. If a retiree who is eligible for coverage elects not to be continuously covered for him/herself and spouse/child(ren) with MCHCP from the date first eligible, or does not apply for coverage for him/herself and spouse/child(ren) within thirty-one (31) days of his/her eligibility date, the retiree and his/her spouse/child(ren) shall not thereafter be eligible for coverage unless specified elsewhere herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (C) Survivor Coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-44\">\n   1. At the time of a vested active employee subscriber's death, his/her survivor(s) may elect to continue coverage if the survivor(s) had MCHCP coverage at the time of the subscriber's death. The deceased subscriber's spouse/child(ren) who do not have MCHCP coverage at the time of the death may elect MCHCP coverage and become a survivor if the spouse/child(ren) had coverage through group or individual medical coverage for the six (6) months immediately prior to the subscriber's death. In that case, proof of prior group or individual coverage (letter from previous insurance carrier or former employer with dates of effective coverage and list of persons covered) is required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   2. At the time of a retiree or terminated vested subscriber's death, his/her survivor(s) may elect to continue coverage if the survivor(s) had MCHCP coverage at the time of the subscriber's death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As expressed in the rules above, the Board interpreted Section 103.085's provision allowing for survivor coverage upon proof of six months of non-MCHCP coverage to apply only to survivors of active employees. 22 C.S.R. 10-2.020(2)(C)1. A surviving spouse of a retiree must have MCHCP coverage at the time of the retiree's death in order to elect to continue coverage. 22 C.S.R. 10-2.020(2)(C)2. A retiree may enroll a spouse in MCHCP coverage upon proof of six months of non-MCHCP coverage, however, when the retiree retires. 22 C.S.R. 10-2.020(2)(B)1.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We find the Board's interpretation/application of Section 103.085 via 22 C.S.R. 10-2.020 consistent with Section 103.085's requirement that, \"If an eligible person does not elect to continue the coverage within thirty-one days of the first day of the month following the date on which the eligible person ceases to be an employee, he or she may not later elect to be covered pursuant to this section.\" Although Section\n   103.085 may not unambiguously specify when an election of coverage must occur with respect to an employee's spouse or children, the Board's regulations are consistent with Section 103.085 when they specify that a retiree must elect coverage at the time of retirement for him/herself as well as for any dependents. 22 C.S.R. 10-2.020(2)(B)5. Under the regulations, dependent enrollment in MCHCP requires affirmative action by the employee; enrollment may be continued by a survivor but cannot be initiated by a survivor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because a dependent's eligibility and election for coverage is derived solely from the employee or former employee's eligibility and elective choices, it follows that where a retiree elects to decline MCHCP coverage for his/her spouse at retirement, the spouse cannot later initiate coverage pursuant to Section 103.085. To find otherwise would allow circumvention of Section 103.085's requirement that an employee make an MCHCP election within thirty-one days of the first day of the month following the date on which employment ceases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We find that 22 C.S.R. 10-2.020 does not expand or modify Section 103.085 and does not deprive Spurgeon of any rights established by the statute. Gary had the opportunity to elect MCHCP coverage for Spurgeon at the time of his retirement based on Spurgeon's prior six months of coverage through her own employer. Gary was required to make an election at that time pursuant to Section 103.085. He chose not enroll Spurgeon at that time and, consequently, Spurgeon had no MCHCP coverage she could elect to continue at the time of Gary's death.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    All statutory references are to the Revised Statutes of Missouri as currently supplemented unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    All regulation references are to the Missouri Code of State Regulations as currently updated unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    To avoid confusion, we refer to Gary Spurgeon by his first name.
