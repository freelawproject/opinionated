Concluding, in light of the record before us, that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding an unreasonable amount of attorney's fees and monetary sanctions under the TCPA, by imposing nonmonetary sanctions when the TCPA does not provide for them, and by improperly conditioning the appellate attorney's fee award, we reverse and vacate these portions of the trial court's judgment, affirm the remainder of the trial court's judgment, and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In their emergency motion to stay the order, Appellants raised-among other complaints-the failure of the trial court to hold a hearing on the matter. The trial court granted the motion. After conducting a hearing, the trial court signed a new order setting aside the $1,000,000 sanction award and awarding Appellee $300,383.84 in attorney's fees and expenses, $75,000 in conditional attorney's fees on appeal, and $150,000 in sanctions.

And the supreme court has directed us that the phrase, \"as justice and equity may require\" does not modify the term \"attorney's fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 298-99. This holding is of particular importance here when considering Appellants' argument that \"[o]nly fees incurred in\n   <em>\n    defending\n   </em>\n   against the suit can be shifted to [Appellants].\" A closer look at the underpinning for the\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   holding reveals the fallacy of this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   , the court observed that had the legislature intended for the phrase \"incurred in defending the legal action as justice and equity may require\" to apply to attorney's fees, the legislature could have inserted a comma after \"other expenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 298. But, as the court pointed out, the legislature did not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 298-99. Thus, in addressing the question of whether the principles of justice and equity are to be\n   applied by the trial court when considering attorney's fees, the supreme court said \"no\"; justice and equity are proper considerations in the context of awarding \"other expenses,\" but not in the context of awarding attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The phrase that Appellants urge should apply to the assessment of attorney's fees-\"incurred in defending the legal action\"-is part of the very same phrase that the court in\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   held did not to apply to attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   If the latter part of the phrase \"incurred in defending the legal action as justice and equity may require\" does not apply to attorney's fees, it cannot be said that the former part does.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, following\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   , the phrase \"incurred in defending the legal action\" applies only to the award of other expenses, not attorney's fees. Per\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   , then, under section 27.009, \"other expenses\" outside of court costs and attorney's fees can be awarded only if \"incurred in defending against the legal action as justice and equity may require,\" but the statute requires that attorney's fees awarded under the statute be \"reasonable.\" Consequently, we overrule Appellants' first issue and this part of Appellants' second issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   But our inquiry does not end here. We still must consider Appellants' argument that the attorney's fees awarded were excessive and unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The court's characterization of Appellants' conduct as \"willful\" may be descriptive, but it stops short of a finding of an improper purpose. Thus, it falls outside of the boundary of the findings permitted by section 27.007(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Malice, too, is a type of\n   <em>\n    mens rea.

Again, while descriptive of an improper motive, this stops short of constituting the actual finding of an improper purpose contemplated by the statute. Thus, as with willfulness, maliciousness is a finding beyond those findings authorized by section 27.007(b).

ViaView's Defamation Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   In their ninth issue, Appellants claim that ViaView cannot not be held liable under the TCPA because it had no standing to file suit for defamation and did not file suit for defamation against Appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Setting aside Appellants' assertion that ViaView did not have standing to file suit for defamation, their assertion that ViaView did not, in fact, file suit for defamation is not supported in the record. On February 19, 2014, Appellants-both McGibney\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   ViaView-filed their \"Plaintiffs' Original Petition and Request for Injunctive Relief.\" On page 7 of their petition, Appellants asserted a cause of action for defamation against all named defendants, including Appellee, by pleading: \"Plaintiffs, therefore, sue all Defendants for this pattern of defamation ... that includes defamation per se....\" We note that both the subject of the sentence, \"Plaintiffs,\" and the verb \"sue\" are plural, and only two plaintiffs were named in the lawsuit-McGibney and ViaView. Thus, whether ViaView had standing to do so or not, ViaView did sue Appellee for defamation and defamation per se.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   As to Appellants' additional argument that ViaView did not have standing to maintain a defamation action, we do not address it herein, as Appellants wholly failed to brief this contention on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

However, we sustain the portion of Appellants' second issue with regard to the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of the attorney's fees awarded by the trial court and remand this portion of the case to the trial court once again to conduct a hearing on attorney's fees consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   We likewise sustain Appellants' fourth issue with regard to the imposition of non-monetary sanctions, Appellants' third issue with regard to the $150,000 sanctions award, Appellants' fifth issue in part with regard to the trial court's \"willfulness and maliciousness\" findings, and Appellants' seventh issue with regard to the improper conditioning of appellate attorney's fees, and we vacate these portions of the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Those domain names were: nealrauhauser.com, nealrauhauser.net, nealrauhauser.org, nealrauhauser.info, nealrauhauser.exposed, and nealrauhauserunmasked.com.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    Notwithstanding the fact that\n    <em>\n     Sullivan\n    </em>\n    holds expressly to the contrary, in their brief, Appellants cite\n    <em>\n     Sullivan\n    </em>\n    to argue that attorney's fees must be \"required by justice and equity.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.
