According to Jennings, he then went out to his shop to have a beer and tinker around. He returned, stuffed Christmas stockings, and went to check on Lisa. He entered the master bedroom and saw her in the closet with a head wound. He moved her body, held her briefly, and then called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lisa had been shot in the head. Ballistics traced a nearby bullet to Jennings's revolver, which had been found under Lisa's leg. Other testing showed gunshot residue (\"GSR\") on Lisa's hands and none on Jennings's hands. Local officials (coroner, prosecutor, and sheriff's department) ultimately ruled the death a suicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dissatisfied, a family member asked Highway Patrol investigator Daniel Nash to look into the case. Nash reviewed the evidence, reconstructed the crime scene, and opined that Lisa did not take her own life because the gun and Lisa's hand and arm did not exhibit blood and tissue \"blowback\" that would have been predicted had she pulled the trigger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Several months after Lisa's death, Nash obtained the bathrobe that Jennings had worn that night. Nash sent the robe to the Highway Patrol lab with a request for blood, DNA, and GSR testing. Nash also went to the lab and witnessed the blood and DNA testing, which yielded inculpatory evidence later used against Jennings at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The lab's GSR test on the robe (\"GSR test\"), performed by a different criminalist, yielded facially\n   <em>\n    exculpatory\n   </em>\n   results. These were faxed to Nash's office, but never passed on to anyone-prosecution or defense-involved in the criminal proceedings against Jennings. At a jury trial where Nash was the State's key witness, Jennings was found guilty of killing Lisa and was sentenced to prison. He appealed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Jennings\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and moved for post-conviction relief,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Jennings v.
