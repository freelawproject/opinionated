It presents six points on appeal. In the first three points, Ford Motor Credit claims the trial court erred in finding the parties' arbitration agreement unconscionable and unenforceable. In its last three points, Ford Motor Credit claims the trial court erred in waiving its right to seek arbitration. The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March 2013, Tony Jones and Rebecca Wilson jointly executed a Kansas Vehicle Retail Installment Contract and Security Agreement (\"Retail Installment Contract\") with Bob Allen Ford to document their purchase and financing of a 2013 Ford Focus.

The Petition sought recovery of a deficiency due following Jones and Wilson's failure to make payments to Ford Motor Credit as required by the contract and Ford Motor Credit's subsequent repossession and sale of the vehicle. Ford Motor Credit sought a deficiency balance of $8290.90, plus interest from the date of the judgment, reasonable attorney fees, and costs as provided in the Retail Installment Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In October 2015, a default judgment was entered against both Jones and Wilson in the Cass County case. Pursuant to Jones's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment, and by an Agreed Order entered in September 2016, the judgment was set aside as to Jones only.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jones then filed a Motion and Order for Change of Venue of the Cass County case to Jackson County, Missouri. That motion was granted in December 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On or about December 19, 2016, Jones filed an Answer to Plaintiff's Petition, Affirmative Defenses, and putative class action Counterclaim against Ford Motor Credit. Jones's Counterclaim sought class certification and alleged, inter alia, that Ford Motor Credit failed to provide sufficient pre-sale and post-sale notices required by the UCC relating to the repossession and sale of the vehicle, entitling Jones (and putative class members) to damages. Jones also sought punitive damages and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ford Motor Credit filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings on or about February 21, 2017. The motion came before the trial court for a hearing on April 11, 2017. The trial court denied Ford Motor Credit's motion in a judgment dated May 22, 2017. First, it concluded the arbitration agreement unconscionable and unenforceable. The trial court found: (i) Ford Motor Credit had a superior bargaining position; (ii) the arbitration agreement was difficult to understand; and (iii) the arbitration agreement was one-sided. Second, the trial court concluded Ford Motor Credit waived its right to arbitrate. It found: (i) Ford Motor Credit knew of the right to arbitrate; (ii) Ford Motor Credit acted inconsistently with its right to arbitrate; and (iii) Jones was prejudiced by Ford Motor Credit's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed on appeal unless there is no substantial evidence to support it, it is against the weight of the evidence, or it erroneously declares or applies the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Bertocci v.

It argues the trial court erred because: (1) the arbitrator is the one who decides whether the arbitration agreement is unconscionable; (2) mutuality is not required under state law or the FAA; and (3) the finding of unconscionability is not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Ford Motor Credit's last three points pertain to the trial court's finding that it waived the arbitration agreement. It argues that the trial court erred because: (1) the arbitrator is the one who decides if arbitration has been waived; (2) the FAA preempts state law with respect to prejudice as it relates to class actions; and (3) the FAA preempts state law with respect to prejudice as it relates to the petition to collect a deficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For ease of discussion, these arguments as well as Jones's assertions in his Respondent's Brief are taken out of order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Existence of a Valid and Enforceable Arbitration Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ford Motor Credit attached a copy of the Retail Installment Contract to its petition. That contract was between the dealership and Jones and Wilson. An assignment from the dealership to Ford Motor Credit appears at the bottom of the contract. Ford Motor Credit included with the petition an affidavit signed by Lorrie Rowe, an employee of Ford Motor Credit. The affidavit averred that the attached contract was a true and complete copy of the contract between the parties. Ford Motor Credit attached the same contract to its Motion to Compel. Ford Motor Credit subsequently filed an affidavit from Todd Kolchinsky, an employee of Ford Motor Credit. That affidavit averred that the attached contract was an \"authentic duplicate of the retail installment contract maintained by Ford Motor Credit and associated with Defendant Tony L. Jones. Jr.'s account number (the last four digits of which are 0085).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Jones argued before the trial court and now argues on appeal that the contract was not properly before the trial court. Jones relies on\n   <em>\n    Ryan v.

The\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   court found that the defendant \"failed to establish that the Exhibit 1 was the parties' Retail Installment Contract and, thus, failed to prove that an arbitration agreement compelling participation in arbitration existed between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299268,7299286\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/296/471/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Jones claims the same is true in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The issue of whether the Retail Installment Contract was properly before the court was extensively argued. Ford Motor Credit filed a motion to compel. Jones filed a response, raising this issue along with several others. Ford Motor Credit filed a Reply. Jones filed a Sur-Reply. A hearing was held. Ford Motor Credit, with the trial court's permission, filed a Post-Hearing Brief. In the Post-Hearing Brief, Ford Motor Credit stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   At the hearing, Jones admitted that the only contract at issue in this case is the\n   contract attached to the petition and the motion to compel. ... Jones has not filed his own affidavit or offered any testimony to dispute that the contract at issue containing the arbitration provision is the very same contract at issue in Ford Credit's petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   With respect to this argument, the trial court found the following in its judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   As an initial matter, the Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to prove the existence of any arbitration agreement at all. The Court finds this argument to be without merit. The assignment language in Plaintiff's Exhibit 1, and the Affidavit of Todd Kolchinsky attached to that exhibit, prove that an arbitration agreement existed between the parties. It is clear to this Court that the only contract at issue in the Petition, Counterclaim, and Motion to Compel Arbitration is the Retail Installment Contract found in Plaintiff's Exhibit 1. Defendant's own factual allegations state that, \"Jones signed a consumer credit contract for the purchase of a motor vehicle.\" Defendant's Counterclaim, \u00b6 11. This contract included an arbitration clause. See Plaintiff's Ex. 1. The Retail Installment Contract expressly stated that it was assigned to Plaintiff Ford Motor, and as the result of this assignment, the Court finds that an arbitration agreement existed between Plaintiff Ford Motor and Defendant Tony Jones. See Plaintiff's Ex. A, bottom of Page 1, Assignment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Jones focuses on an argument that the affidavit attached to the contract with the Motion to Compel does not meet the requirements of the business records hearsay exception. Jones concludes the affidavit is insufficient to bring the contract properly before the trial court. Jones cites\n   <em>\n    CACH, LLC v. Askew\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315460\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/358/58/#p63\">\n    358 S.W.3d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63 (Mo. banc 2012) for the proposition that the affidavit from Ford Motor Credit cannot qualify for the business records exception because the dealership, and not Ford Motor Credit, is the business that created the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We find Jones's argument to be misplaced. The\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   court found that the contract's authenticity was not established by \"the usual methods\" including pleadings or a hearing on the matter.\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299268,7299286\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/296/471/\">\n    296 S.W.3d at 472-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, Ford Motor Credit attached the contract to its petition (a pleading) and the trial court held a hearing in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Additionally,\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that the contract needed an affidavit that qualified for the business records hearsay exception. Pursuant to Rule 55.28:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   When a motion is based on facts not appearing of record the court may hear the matter on affidavits presented by the respective parties, but the court may direct that the matter be heard wholly or partly on oral testimony or depositions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"[T]he rule allowing consideration of affidavits in this context does not explain what such affidavits must show, so courts look to the provisions of Rule 74.04(e) for guidance.\"\n   <em>\n    Gemini Capital Grp., LLC v.

Pursuant to Rule 74.04(e):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Form of Affidavit.\n   </strong>\n   Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In this case, the contract states that it is assigned to Ford Motor Credit. The contract\n   bears the signature of Tony Jones. The affidavit states that the attached contract is maintained by Ford Motor Credit and is associated with Tony Jones's account number. Jones states in his counterclaim that he \"signed a consumer credit contract for the purchase of a motor vehicle.\" Moreover, the trial court held a hearing and then made a factual finding that the attached contract was the contract at issue. This court defers to those factual findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greene v. All. Auto., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928651\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/435/646/#p648\">\n    435 S.W.3d 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648-49 (Mo. App. W.D. 2014) (finding that even when the case is submitted solely on documentary evidence, the trial court is the finder of fact and appellate courts defer to those findings.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Jones's argument that the arbitration agreement was not properly before the trial court is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Ford Motor Credit's Judgment against Wilson\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In this case, a default judgment was entered against Jones and Wilson. Pursuant to Rule 74.05(d), Jones filed a motion to set aside the default judgment. In his motion, he claimed he did not live at the address where service purportedly occurred and thus was never served. The trial court granted the motion as to Jones only (not as to Wilson):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   NOW on this day, the court having before it Plaintiffs Agreed Motion to Set Aside Judgment and for good cause shown, the Court finds that the same should be sustained. IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the judgment entered on October 20, 2015 against Tony L. Jones a/k/a Toney L Jones Jr a/k/a Tony James only be set aside and the Plaintiffs' case be set for hearing on December 6, 2016 at 9:00 am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The default judgment remains in effect against Wilson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Jones now complains that the default judgment against Wilson shows Ford Motor Credit's unwillingness to arbitrate all claims involved. This is basically an argument that Ford Motor Credit waived the right to arbitration by obtaining a default judgment against Wilson. That argument is considered in the next section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Second, Jones argues that the judgment against Wilson is not final. He complains that \"a judgment for or against Jones would, as a practical matter, resolve the claims for and against Jones's co-borrower and vice versa.\" His argument misunderstands the nature of default judgments in the context of pending litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"A default judgment cannot, itself, be appealed.\"\n   <em>\n    Hagan v.

App. W.D. 2007). Pursuant to Rule 74.05(d), Wilson would have had one year from the date the default judgment was entered to move to have the judgment set aside.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8330183\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/215/252/#p255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The one year timeframe runs even if claims against other parties in the same action are still pending.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8330183\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/215/252/#p255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"We therefore hold that when a motion to set aside a default judgment is made more than one year after the default judgment was filed, denominated 'judgment,' and signed by the judge, the motion is untimely even if the judgment is not yet 'final' for all other purposes.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Accordingly, Wilson is unable to have her default judgment set aside regardless of the disposition of the claims against Jones. This could potentially result in different judgments against Wilson and Jones, but Jones does not cite and this court does not find any authority for the proposition that different results would be error. This is true beyond the context of arbitration. For example, Ford Motor Credit could chose to dismiss its action against Jones and find relief solely from its default judgment against Wilson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    Points I and IV: Who decides if the arbitration agreement is unconscionable or has been waived?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In Points I and IV, Ford Motor Credit argues that the Court improperly decided that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable and that Ford Motor Credit waived the agreement because those issues are to be decided by an arbitrator. The trial court rejected this argument in its judgment, finding in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Ford Motor's strongest responsive argument is that the Court should not be deciding the issue of unconscionability, or waiver below, because the arbitration agreement delegates to the arbitrator \"[c]laims regarding the interpretation, scope, or validity of this provision, or arbitrability of any issue.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Ford Motor's delegation clause in this Retail Installment Contract did not expressly cover formation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Here, Jones raises a contract formation challenge subject to judicial resolution, which is his assertion that unconscionability permeated throughout the entire transaction such that a contract did not form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, even if the delegation clause covered Jones' claims, the delegation clause itself is also unconscionable, and therefore, unenforceable, because it is buried within the unconscionable Retail Installment Contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A presumption exists that any silence or ambiguity concerning the scope of arbitrability should be resolved in favor of arbitration.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

More than application of a presumption, however, the delegation provision in the contract in this case explicitly provides that the arbitrator determines issues of arbitrability. The presence of this delegation provision distinguishes the cases Jones cites in his brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Jones further claims Ford Motor Credit waived the delegation clause by pursuing self-help repossession and attempting to garnish Jones's wages. These actions are permitted by the terms of the arbitration agreement. Jones is essentially arguing that the terms allowing Ford Motor Credit to do so without waiving the arbitration provision renders the arbitration provision unconscionable. As discussed above, the contract delegates this issue to the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The points are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Given the disposition of Points I and IV, this court need not address Points II, III, V, or VI.
