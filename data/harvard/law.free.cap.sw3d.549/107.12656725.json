We adopt the more open approach espoused in\n   <em>\n    Weinberger v. UOP, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7989484\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/457/701/#p712\">\n    457 A.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 712-13 (Del. 1983), in which the Delaware Supreme Court departed from the Delaware Block method and permitted trial courts to determine fair value by using any technique or method that is generally acceptable in the financial community and admissible in court. This approach allows trial courts to utilize valuation methods that incorporate projections of future value, so long as they are susceptible of proof as of the date of the corporate action and not the product of speculation. In this dissenters' rights case, the defendant minority shareholders were forced out of the corporation as a result of a merger, and the corporation petitioned the trial court to determine the fair value of the minority shareholders' stock. Both parties presented expert testimony regarding the valuation of the dissenting shareholders' stock, and both experts assumed that\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   required use of the Delaware Block method to value the stock. However, both experts also valued the dissenting shareholders' stock under more modern approaches, such as the discounted cash flow method. After a bench trial, the trial court discredited the testimony of the dissenting shareholders' expert and credited the testimony of the corporation's expert. The trial court's order indicates that it may have based its decision on the premise that\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   compelled use of the Delaware Block method to determine stock value. Consequently, we remand to the trial court to reconsider its determination on valuation in light of our decision to partially overrule\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff/Appellee Athlon Sports Communications, Inc. (\"Athlon\"), was formed in 1967 and incorporated in 1972. It is a private, closely-held corporation with its principal place of business in Nashville, Tennessee. Athlon publishes special-interest consumer sports magazines, websites, and other branded products, including sports annuals, newsletters, and handbooks. It also sells authenticated sports memorabilia to consumers and wholesale clients. For over fifty years, Athlon enjoyed steady profits until it fell victim to the global economic downturn of the late 2000s.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    In re Fannie Mae 2008 Securities Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160425\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/742/382/#p391\">\n    742 F.Supp.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 391 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (describing the \"well documented\" events surrounding the Great Recession).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant/Appellant Stephen Duggan is a certified public accountant and an executive with magazine publishing experience.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After learning of Athlon's financial difficulties, Mr. Duggan conceived a turnaround plan for the company. He proposed a monthly sports publication called \"\n   <em>\n    Athlon Sports\n   </em>\n   ,\" which would be inserted and distributed in newspapers. Like Athlon's other sports publications, the proposed insert would generate revenues through advertising sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2010, Athlon accepted Mr. Duggan's proposal and hired him to implement the\n   <em>\n    Athlon Sports\n   </em>\n   newspaper-insert project. In addition, Mr. Duggan invested $1.5 million in the company and in return received 15% of the company's ownership shares, or 222,100 shares of Athlon stock. He was also eligible to receive additional shares of restricted stock amounting to an additional 10% ownership in Athlon; the number, timing, and vesting of the restricted shares were based upon EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) performance targets from 2010 to 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Around the same time, Athlon retained a CPA firm, Lattimore Black, Morgan &amp; Cain (\"Lattimore Black\"), to conduct a valuation of Athlon. The valuation was obtained in part to establish a basis price for Mr. Duggan's restricted shares for tax purposes. The valuation was intended to be available for other purposes as well, since there had been no valuation of Athlon since its business began to decline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In a report dated April 22, 2010, Lattimore Black placed Athlon's enterprise value at $8.1 million. It determined that the fair market value of Athlon's common share equivalents was $1.85 per share, and the fair market value of the restricted stock was $.98 per share.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lattimore Black's valuations were based in part on probability estimates of the success of the\n   <em>\n    Athlon Sports\n   </em>\n   project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Over the next several months, Athlon secured the new infrastructure necessary to support the\n   <em>\n    Athlon Sports\n   </em>\n   newspaper-insert project. It found a manufacturer for the insert, negotiated contracts, and made other preparations for the new endeavor. Finally, the\n   <em>\n    Athlon Sports\n   </em>\n   launch took place in October 2010. It was a success, and\n   <em>\n    Athlon Sports\n   </em>\n   became a nationally-distributed sports magazine with a monthly rate base of 7 million copies. During 2011, while Mr. Duggan was still President and CEO, the\n   <em>\n    Athlon Sports\n   </em>\n   rate base grew to over 9 million copies per month, a figure that was touted in Athlon company documents. Media Industry Newsletter named Mr. Duggan 2011 Publisher/CEO of the Year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Unfortunately, the increased circulation and other successes did not translate into higher advertisement revenue for Athlon; the ad revenue lagged substantially behind pre-launch projections. This precipitated a significant cash-flow shortfall for Athlon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To raise the capital necessary for payroll and other operating expenses, Athlon was forced to take extraordinary measures. By October 2011, a year after the launch of\n   <em>\n    Athlon Sports\n   </em>\n   , Athlon had sold its main asset-the building that had housed the business for twenty years-for about $3.9\n   million. The building had served as the collateral for Athlon's approximately $1 million line of credit, so the proceeds of the sale were used to pay off the line of credit. The remaining proceeds of the building sale were retained for working capital and to fund the ongoing business. All of Athlon's key employees, except Mr. Duggan, took pay cuts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a further measure, Athlon surrendered its key-man life insurance policies on seventy-five-year-old Spencer Hays, the chairman of the board and controlling shareholder. This decision relieved the company from the obligation of paying the hefty insurance premiums and also allowed it to recover the cash value of the policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties dispute whether Mr. Duggan was hindered from pursuing outside capital to address Athlon's cash flow issues during early 2011. Regardless, it is undisputed that, beginning in October 2011, Mr. Duggan was permitted to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In connection with his effort to seek outside capital, Mr. Duggan oversaw the preparation of a Confidential Information Memorandum (CIM) for Athlon to use to attract would-be investors. In the CIM, the projections for Athlon's future were quite optimistic: \"Based on the investments made since 2010, Athlon is poised for strong multi-year double-digit revenue growth.\" The CIM also asserted that Athlon was \"forecasted to generate total revenue of $14.3 million in fiscal 2012, which represents year-over-year growth rate of 34.6%.\" Despite these rosy forecasts, the record shows that, by the time the CIM was prepared, Athlon's financial circumstances had deteriorated substantially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 28, 2011, at a board of directors meeting, Athlon effectively terminated Mr. Duggan's employment. Mr. Hays asked Mr. Duggan to resign as CEO of Athlon, and Mr. Duggan did so. However, after resigning from his employed position, Mr. Duggan remained on Athlon's board of directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Around that same time, Mr. Hays, along with Charles Allen (chief operating officer) and Mary Dunn Vanderkooi (chief financial officer), formed an Ad Hoc Strategic Alternatives Committee (\"the Committee\") to explore options for returning Athlon to profitability. The Committee devised a so-called \"Plan of Merger\" to form a new corporation. Under the merger plan, Athlon would merge with a newly-created Tennessee corporation, Athlon Merger Subsidiary, Inc. (\"Merger Sub\"). Another newly-created Tennessee corporation, Athlon Acquisition, Inc. (\"Newco\"), would be the sole shareholder of Merger Sub. After completion of the planned merger, the separate Merger Sub would cease to exist, leaving the Newco, also referred to as \"New Athlon,\" as the only surviving corporation. Shares in New Athlon would be purchased via proportional investments by Mr. Hays and certain other Athlon employees. Under the merger plan, the total investment in the new corporation was expected to be $2 million, which was to provide a much-needed infusion of capital for New Athlon's ongoing business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Plan of Merger contemplated that some Athlon shareholders would not be invited to participate in the new corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   For this reason, the Committee anticipated\n   that some shareholders would dissent from the planned merger. Accordingly, for the purpose of determining the value of dissenting shareholders' stock, the Committee sought a new valuation of Athlon prior to the planned merger. The Committee retained Michael Collins at 2nd Generation Capital, an investment firm in Nashville, Tennessee, to perform the valuation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Collins completed his valuation of Athlon by February 29, 2012. In it, Mr. Collins opined that the fair market value of the company was \"$NIL,\" meaning zero. Mr. Collins also rendered a fairness opinion. In his fairness opinion, he recommended that all shares of Athlon stock not converted into shares of the new corporation be canceled and that the owners of those shares be compensated at the rate of 1\u00a2 per share.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During March 2012, the Athlon board of directors convened three times. Over the course of those meetings, Mr. Collins presented his valuation of Athlon, and Mr. Hays presented the Plan of Merger. Initially, Athlon offered the recommended 1\u00a2 per share to those not participating in the new corporation, but this was ultimately increased to $.10 per share. Mr. Hays' proposed Plan of Merger was accepted by the board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Duggan was not invited to participate in ownership of the new corporation. Along with Mr. Duggan, the other Defendants/Appellants in this appeal, minority shareholders Daniel R. Grogan and Robert Kelly Grogan, were also not invited to participate in the new corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the plan was not described as a \"squeeze out\" or \"take out\" merger, this was in fact its effect on Mr. Duggan and the other shareholders who were not invited to participate in the new corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 10, 2012, the planned merger was consummated. Pursuant to the Tennessee dissenters' rights statutes, Tennessee Code Annotated sections 48-23-101,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , Athlon was required to compensate Mr. Duggan, the Grogans, and the other non-participating shareholders for the fair value of their shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In October 2012, Mr. Hays, on behalf of Athlon, sent the dissenting shareholders a fair value payment check for $.10 per share plus interest. Mr. Duggan and the Grogans, rejected the offer and demanded $6.18 per share.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2048-23-209\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 48-23-209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). Their demand was rejected. After reaching an impasse, Athlon filed the instant lawsuit against Mr. Duggan and the Grogans\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   for judicial appraisal of \"the fair value of the shares and accrued interest\" as of the date of the merger pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 48-23-301 (2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The matter was tried before the Honorable Ellen Hobbs Lyle over the course of six days in August and September 2015. The only issue at trial was the fair value of Athlon stock at the time of the August 2012 merger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The trial court heard testimony from several lay witnesses on Athlon's operations and the events leading up to the merger. The witnesses included Mr. Allen and Ms. Vanderkooi, as well as Mr. Duggan and the Grogans. In connection with the witnesses' testimony, about 160 exhibits were submitted. The primary evidence, however, was the testimony of the parties' competing experts. They testified extensively on the fair value of Athlon stock at the time of the merger, and presented detailed reports and exhibits as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The valuation expert hired by Athlon in advance of the merger, Mr. Collins, gave expert testimony on behalf of Athlon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his Trial Report and his testimony, Mr. Collins explained the methodologies he employed, the evidence he considered, and the assumptions he made in forming his expert opinion on the fair value of Athlon stock. He relied to a great extent on the valuation he performed for Athlon in February 2012, updated to the time of the August 2012 merger. Regarding the valuation methodologies used, Mr. Collins' Trial Report stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I have employed the Delaware Block Method of valuation compliant with the requirements of TENNESSEE CODE ANNOTATED Title 48 Corporations and Associations For-Profit Business Corporations Chapter 23 Dissenters' Rights and relevant Tennessee court precedents. Plaintiff's counsel assisted my familiarization with the applicable law, regulation[s], rules, and other relevant legal principles....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   In conducting my work, I have applied the Delaware Block Method as required; and have also separately considered (and applied where I determined them to be applicable and their results reasonable without resorting to undue speculation) multiple techniques or methods that are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and appraisal profession considering all relevant factors. I present these multiple approaches in order to best inform the [Trier] of Fact and to serve as a reasonableness cross check of my calculations and opinions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mr. Collins' Trial Report also included a disclaimer about the Delaware Block method of valuation: \"Generally accepted appraisal practice, as well as Delaware and other courts, reject the Delaware Block [method] as unreliable and not in accordance with modern valuation science.\" It noted the \"recognized shortcoming\" of the Delaware Block method, namely, that it looks to a company's historical operating results and then uses simple mathematical averaging formulas that \"can yield highly misleading results,\" oftentimes a lower valuation for the dissenting shareholder. Modern methods of valuation such as the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach, Mr. Collins' Trial Report stated, \"place more emphasis on a company's future prospects to the extent that they can be reasonably forecasted without resorting to undue speculation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this case, Mr. Collins concluded that the fair value of Athlon stock at the time of the merger was zero or \"$NIL\" under either the Delaware Block method or alternate, forward-looking, valuation methods. Mr. Collins explained that, at the time of the merger, \"Athlon was insolvent or at the minimum operating in the Zone of Insolvency with unreasonably small capital. Athlon's liabilities were highly likely to exceed its assets and thus the interest of creditors as well as the equity interests would be impaired.\" He further opined that, \"absent the external funding provided by the [merger], it would not be possible for Athlon to achieve the liquidity necessary to compensate a Dissenter.\" Mr. Collins felt that the DCF valuation method was \"not practical, useful, or reliable when projections of future results cannot be made without resorting to undue speculation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Expert witness Jaime C. d'Almeida testified on behalf of the dissenting shareholders about the value of their stock.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. d'Almeida also used the Delaware Block method based on Tennessee law, even while describing that method as \"not currently a common valuation method.\" Because the Delaware Block method is not commonly used, Mr. d'Almeida used two other valuation methods-the guideline companies method and the DCF method-to benchmark his Delaware Block method appraisal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Under the Delaware Block method, Mr. d'Almeida valued the fair value of the dissenting shareholders' stock at $6.48 per share.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Using the guideline companies method, under which Athlon was compared to publicly-traded companies in similar lines of business, Mr. d'Almeida determined that the fair value of Athlon stock would be in the range of $4.55 to $9.58 per share. Under the DCF method of valuation based on Athlon's February 2012 projections, Mr. d'Almeida valued the stock at $6.48 per share. Finally, using the DCF method based on the projections included in the CIM, Mr. d'Almeida placed the fair value at $22.32 per share.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Collins submitted a Rebuttal Report in which he challenged the assumptions and methods Mr. d'Almeida used. Mr. Collins' Rebuttal Report described Mr. d'Almeida's valuation as \"speculative, based on conjecture and fail[ing] to adequately support the Defendant dissenters' claim for Fair Value[,] ... and contain[ing] numerous fundamental flaws.\" The Rebuttal Report detailed Mr. Collins' criticisms of Mr.\n   d'Almeida's report and his deposition testimony in a line-by-line fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After closely considering the evidence, in October 2015, the trial court entered a final order in which it concluded that the fair value of the dissenting shareholders' stock at the time of the merger was \"no greater than the $0.10 per share amount paid by [Athlon].\" At the outset, the trial court stated, \"As well explained in the trial briefs of each attorney in this case, Tennessee uses the Delaware Block method to determine fair value for dissenters.\"\n   <em>\n    Athlon Sports Commc's, Inc. v. Duggan\n   </em>\n   , No. M2015-02222-COA-R3-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206087667\">\n    2016 WL 6087667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Tenn.

It explained: \"While there is this [Delaware Block] formula under Tennessee law, the ultimate value of the stock is not formulaic. The [Delaware Block] formula is a tool to assist [in] rendering a judgment of share value customized to the unique features and facts of individual companies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206087667\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting trial court decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The trial court specifically credited the testimony of Mr. Collins and discredited the testimony of Mr. d'Almeida.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6-9. The trial court then outlined its reasons for finding that the fair value of the Athlon shares was no more than $.10 per share:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The reason the Court finds the value to be $0.10 and not the zero determined by Mr. Collins is that the evidence established that Athlon's trade name had existed for 44 years and had obtained recognition. The evidence established that while this recognition was not of such an extent that it could be used as collateral or be sold for an appreciable amount or had a trademark value, it had some very, very minimal value as an intangible asset. Also, the $9 million [sic] in circulation of the Sports Insert (discussed in more detail below), the Court finds, had some very, very minimal asset value. Given the great disparity between advertising revenue, which was still insufficient, and circulation, and absence of Company assets and earnings, there was great uncertainty and risk as of the August 2012 Merger date. The Court finds there was not just a liquidity or cash flow problem; the Company was hovering around the zone of insolvency. Thus, the Court finds that the recognition of the Athlon name or brand and the [ ]9 million in circulation, while very, very minimal, provide a $0.10 per share value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. The dissenting shareholders appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In the Court of Appeals, the dissenting shareholders argued that the trial court erred in relying exclusively on the Delaware Block method for determining the value of their Athlon shares. The appellate court identified the dissenting shareholders' \"chief objection to the Delaware Block Method\" as \"their claim that [the method's] focus on past rather than prospective performance is particularly unreliable for a company embarking upon a new venture like Athlon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. Alternatively, the dissenting shareholders argued that, even if the Delaware Block method were the proper valuation method for the shares of Athlon stock, the trial court erred in how it applied that method under the facts and circumstances of this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court of Appeals rejected both of those arguments. As to the first issue, the appellate court held that \"[t]he Trial Court correctly followed Tennessee case precedent in utilizing the Delaware Block Method\n   for valuation,\" referring to this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Blasingame v.

Based on\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   , the intermediate appellate court approved of the trial court's adherence to the Delaware Block valuation method, even though Delaware itself has \"long since departed from a strict application of\" that valuation method.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. The Court of Appeals added that, \"[i]f the holding of\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   ... is to be reversed or modified by a Tennessee Court, it is the Tennessee Supreme Court that will have to do it and not this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court of Appeals also rejected the dissenting shareholders' challenge to how the trial court's applied the Delaware Block method.

They argue that\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   did not hold that the Delaware Block method was the exclusive method for valuing shares in all dissenters' rights cases; rather, it approved that method of valuation for the specific circumstances presented in that case. If\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   did hold that the Delaware Block method was the exclusive method for valuation, the dissenting shareholders argue, it should be overruled and trial courts should be permitted to allow such valuations by any generally accepted method. Under the\n   facts of this case, they claim, a valuation method that takes into account future profits would have led to a more fair valuation. Alternatively, if the Delaware Block method was appropriate in this case, they contend that the trial court applied it in an erroneous manner by disregarding evidence of anticipated profitability at the time of the merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In response, Athlon does not disagree that trial courts should not be restricted to the Delaware Block method as the only valuation method for determining fair value. Rather, it argues that any forward-looking method of valuation would yield the same result in this case, because projections of Athlon's future profits at the time of the merger were speculative and should not be considered. Therefore, Athlon maintains, under any valuation method, the fair value of its stock at the time of the merger was zero, and the trial court's decision should be affirmed in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Keller v.

In determining what figure represents this true or intrinsic value, the appraiser and the courts must take into consideration all factors and elements which reasonably might enter into the fixing of value. Thus, market value, asset value, dividends, earning prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which were known or which could be ascertained as of the date of merger and which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation are not only pertinent to an inquiry as to the value of the dissenting stockholders' interest, but must be considered by the agency fixing the value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   The rule as stated requires that certain obvious conclusions be drawn. Thus, since intrinsic or true value is to be ascertained, the problem will not be settled by the acceptance as the sole measure of only one element entering into\n   value without considering other elements.

Applying the wrong standard affected how the parties to the litigation discovered evidence, how the parties' respective experts prepared their reports, and how the parties offered testimony to the Trial Court.\" Appellants' Brief at 32. In addition, they argue that \"applying the wrong standard fundamentally altered how the Trial Court evaluated the evidence submitted by the parties.\" By using the \"backwards-looking lens\" of the Delaware Block method, the dissenting shareholders contend, the trial court \"failed to account for the single best evidence of the value of Athlon's stock-its management's February 2012 forecast of profitability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7989484\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/457/701/#p712\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For this reason, they ask us to either (1) reverse the trial court and value their stock at $6.48 per share, as opined by their expert Mr. d'Almeida, or (2) vacate the trial court's order and remand for further proceedings or for a new trial based on modern valuation techniques.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In response, Athlon argues that a remand is not necessary because \"[t]he Trial Court did not reject Dissenters' expert's DCF calculations because of some mistaken belief that it was required to mechanically apply the Delaware Block method.\" Rather, Athlon maintains, the trial court rejected Mr. d'Almeida's analysis under both the Delaware Block method and the more forward-looking methods because his comparisons were flawed and the projections on which he relied were speculative. They insist that the dissenting shareholders were not limited in their discovery\n   efforts and that the trial court did not over-rely on the Delaware Block method. Under these circumstances, Athlon argues that we should conclude that the trial court correctly credited the testimony of its expert Mr. Collins, discredited the testimony of Mr. d'Almeida, and properly valued the fair value of the dissenting shareholders' stock at $.10 per share.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   To determine whether a remand is necessary, we have closely reviewed the record in this case. At the outset, the trial court's remarks indicate that it viewed\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   as having designated the Delaware Block method as the only method appropriate for use in Tennessee to determine the fair value of the dissenting shareholders' stock.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Athlon Sports\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206087667\">\n    2016 WL 6087667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (\"Tennessee uses the Delaware Block method to determine fair value for dissenters.\") (quoting the trial court, which cited\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   ). The trial court then explained how the Delaware Block valuation method works to combine and weigh the three underlying approaches, the market value approach, the asset value approach, and the earnings value approach.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206087667\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   After this general description of the Delaware Block method, the trial court emphasized that Tennessee law and Delaware Block required it to \"take[ ] into account the individual circumstances of the company being valued.\" The trial court then went on to carefully evaluate the opinions proffered by both parties' experts. As noted above, both experts framed their opinions in part based on the Delaware Block method based on the language in\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   . However, both experts' testimony\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   included alternate opinions based on forward-looking valuation methods. The trial court closely considered the experts' assertions and underlying assumptions under the Delaware Block method and under the alternate methods as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   After a detailed review of the evidence, the trial court decided to credit the opinion of Athlon expert Mr. Collins and reject the opinion of the dissenting shareholders' expert Mr. d'Almeida. The trial court offered an \"inexhaustive but sufficient\" list of the reasons for its credibility assessment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-9. As explained below, in its list of reasons, the trial court in effect dismantled the individual components of Mr. d'Almeida's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The trial court first found that the evidence in the record did not support Mr. d'Almeida's valuation of the company's assets, particularly the amounts assigned to distributor relationships and trademark value.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8. Importantly, the trial court found that Mr. d'Almeida had erred in counting Althon's net operating loss (NOL) carryovers as an asset, because the value of NOLs \"is contingent upon generating future profits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. To this point, the trial court observed: \"Based upon the evidence of the Company's history of significant losses, its further deteriorating financial condition from 2010-2012, and the evidence of the macro decline in the publishing and print media industry, the Court finds it is speculative to assume or conclude future profits of the Company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For a variety of reasons, the trial court also found that Mr. d'Almeida's earnings and market valuations were either erroneous or unsupported by the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Portions of the trial court's assessment indicate that it rejected Mr. d'Almeida's forward-looking valuations based on the speculative nature of the evidence of future profits. The trial court first turned to the CIM and Mr. d'Almeida's valuation using the CIM contained under his Trial Report headnote \"DCF Using Confidential Information Memorandum Projections.\" In deeming the CIM an unreliable basis for informing share value, the trial court accredited\n   the trial testimony of Athlon experts Mr. Allen and Mrs. Vanderkooi, who described the statements in the CIM as \"aspirational\" and intended to attract potential investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. The trial court explained, \"[T]he CIM is not accorded weight by the Court because its hope for future profits was not in keeping with the macro conditions of the industry and the track record of the Company. The CIM was, at most, puffery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Noting that Mr. Duggan prepared the CIM, the trial court found the CIM to be an unreliable marker of Athlon's value and declined to view it as \"some sort of concession of value by the Company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The trial court also rejected Mr. d'Almeida's valuation set forth under the headnote \"DCF Using February 2012 Projections.\" This valuation was based primarily on Athlon's February 2012 projections and a statement Athlon gave to Mr. Collins in response to a questionnaire submitted to Athlon during the February 2012 valuation of the company. In response to the questionnaire, Athlon stated that the \"most probable outcome\" of profitability would be in 2013. This statement was supported by a February 2012 \"Five Year Forecast with Four year History,\" in which it was projected that Athlon would become profitable by 2013. The trial court characterized Athlon's statement of the \"most probable outcome\" as \"an outlier,\" an \"isolated statement\" that was \"an exception to the greater weight and preponderance of the evidence,\" and concluded that it did not substantially detract from the court's other findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   On one hand, these findings seem to indicate that the trial court evaluated the evidence without regard to the method of valuation. On the other hand, the trial court cited\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"Tennessee uses the Delaware Block method to determine fair value for dissenters.\"\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   , 654 S.W.3d at 667 (cited at p. 7 of trial court's order). Indeed, throughout its order, the trial court repeatedly referred to the Delaware Block method and its three component valuation methods. These references may indicate that the trial court felt constrained under\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   to apply the Delaware Block method and, importantly, that it may have evaluated the evidence on valuation through this prism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since we cannot exclude this possibility based on this record, the more prudent course is to vacate the trial court's order and remand to permit the trial court to reevaluate its decision on\n   valuation in light of our ruling on\n   <em>\n    Blasingame\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   From our careful review of the record, we see no indication that either Athlon or the dissenting shareholders were hindered from conducting discovery or from proffering expert testimony based on valuation methodologies other than the Delaware Block method. However, like the trial court, the parties may have been operating under the assumption that Delaware Block was the only valuation method available to them. On remand, the trial court is not required to permit the parties to conduct additional discovery or to allow the parties to put on additional proof, but it may choose to do so. Concomitantly, the trial court may decide, in its discretion, to reevaluate the question of valuation based on the evidence in the record as it now stands. We leave these decisions to the sound discretion of the trial court on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In sum, we overrule\n   <em>\n    Blasingame v.

Asset value, of course, is one of the three components of the Delaware Block method of valuation. As to earnings value (another component of the Delaware Block method), the trial court, on page 20, criticized Mr. d'Almeida's Report because it \"does not actually apply the requirement of the Delaware Block Method that three to five years of earnings is the predictor of future earnings.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
