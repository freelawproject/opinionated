The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Howard County Ambulance District is a political subdivision organized under the Chapter 190, RSMo, to provide ambulance services within Howard County. The City of Fayette is a class four municipality organized under Chapter 79, RSMo, and located in Howard County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 15, 2011, Officer Matt Jones, a reserve police officer for the City of Fayette, was dispatched on a report of a prowler and came into contact Lance Brown. After a short foot pursuit, Officer Jones took Brown into custody and placed him in handcuffs. The officer discovered that Brown was seventeen years old and very intoxicated. Concerned for his health and well-being, the officer summoned the EMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Ambulance District dispatched personnel to the scene including Paramedic Frank Flaspohler. Paramedic Flaspohler initially assessed Brown, who was sitting in the police car handcuffed, with an altered level of consciousness, nauseated, and vomiting. He suspected alcohol intoxication but also knew a number of other things could cause his condition. The paramedic determined that Brown required medical attention and recommended that he be transported to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At some point, Officer Jones called Brown's mother, Janice Brown, and told her the situation. He explained that Brown needed to be transported to the hospital and asked if she consented and to which hospital she wanted him taken. Brown's mother consented and told the officer to have him taken to Boonville. She never arrived at the scene and never offered to take her son to the hospital. Officer Jones released Brown out of custody and the handcuffs, and Brown was taken in the ambulance to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Jones did not sign anything with the Ambulance District at the scene. The\n   City has agreements with various municipal type entities including a fire district, a rural water district, and a rural electric district. These agreements are in writing and approved by the Board of Alderman. The City does not have a written agreement with the Ambulance District. City police officers do not have authority to bind the City for medical care or ambulance transport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In November 2011, the Ambulance District billed Janice Brown $1,266.01 for the cost of the transport of her son to the hospital. In April 2016, it filed a petition against her seeking payment of the bill. In September 2016, it amended its petition to assert a claim against the City for payment of the ambulance bill. Until the lawsuit, the Ambulance District had not made a demand to the City for the cost of the ambulance service for Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following a bench trial, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the City finding that there was no written agreement between the Ambulance and the City for the ambulance service as required by section 432.070. The trial court entered judgment against Janice Brown in the amount of $1,266.01. This appeal by the Ambulance District followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its two points on appeal, the Ambulance District argues that trial court erred in entering judgment in favor of the City based on the lack of a written agreement between the Ambulance District and the City regarding ambulance services, as required by section 432.070.

Included in those powers is the power \"[t]o fix, charge and collect reasonable fees and compensation for the use of the ambulance service according to the rules and regulations prescribed by the board from time to time.\" \u00a7 190.060.1(4). In January 2007, the Ambulance District enacted an ordinance governing the liability for ambulance services provided to an individual detained by law enforcement. The ordinance provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Whenever an individual has been detained by law enforcement for any reason, whether under arrest or not, and becomes ill or injured and an ambulance is dispatched, the entity at which the individual was detained at the time the ambulance was dispatched shall be liable for all ambulance charges incurred for medical care of the individual....Howard County Ambulance District Ordinance No. 2 shall not preclude the county or city from pursuing collection from the individual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Howard County Ambulance District Ordinance No. 2 (Jan. 11, 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 432.070 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   No county, city, town, village, school township, school district or other municipal corporation shall make any contract, unless the same shall be within the scope of its powers or be expressly authorized by law, nor unless such contract be made upon consideration wholly to be performed or executed subsequent to the making of the contract; and such contract, including the consideration, shall be in writing and dated when made, and shall be subscribed by the parties thereto, or their agents authorized by law and duly appointed and authorized in writing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This state law requires that the contracts made by a city \"must be in writing and duly executed as provided in the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Newsome v.

Section 432.070, however, limits these provisions. It prohibits holding a municipality liable for services performed for it without a written contract. Here, the City did not enter into a written contract with the Ambulance District that complied with section 432.070. And the ordinance itself does not constitute a writing required by section 432.070. It does not contain contract terms, including the cost of the ambulance service.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v. City of Fredericktown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9948283\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/591/723/#p725\">\n    591 S.W.2d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 725 (Mo. App. E.D. 1979) (municipal ordinance providing for reimbursement by the City to developers of water and sewer line expenses was not a contract in itself and could not under any circumstances constitute a writing demanded by section 432.070). At most, Ordinance No. 2 could lead to the preparation of a written contract between the Ambulance District and the City for ambulance services. The Ambulance District was charged with notice of section 432.070, and in order to impose an obligation on the City, it was required to enter a contract that complied with the statute. Because there was no contract between the Ambulance District and the City that complied with section 432.070, the City is not liable for the cost of transport of Brown to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Next, the Ambulance District asserts that an exceptional circumstance exists in this case to relieve the contractual requirement of section 432.070. Specifically, it argues that because both it and the City are public agencies and the City has a constitutional duty to provide medical care reasonably needed by an individual taken into custody, the doctrine of equitable estoppel applies to negate the requirement for a written contract under section 432.070.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While equitable estoppel is not ordinarily applicable to municipal corporations in matters pertaining to governmental functions, the doctrine has been cautiously applied \"in exceptional cases where upon all the circumstances of the case right and justice require it.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

However, as this court recently discussed, \"there is no reasoned authority for the proposition that doctrine of equitable estoppel can be employed to enforce a municipal contract that is void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   pursuant to section 432.070, even in the face of 'exceptional circumstances.' \"\n   <em>\n    The Lamar Co. v.
