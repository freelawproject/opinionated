The question we address is whether the trial court erred by allowing the plaintiff to amend her complaint, after the expiration of the statute of limitations, to substitute as a defendant a health care provider to which the plaintiff had not sent pre-suit notice. The health care provider the plaintiff sought to substitute had knowledge of the claim based on pre-suit notice the plaintiff had mistakenly sent to another potential defendant. We hold that the plaintiff did not comply with the mandatory pre-suit notice provision of Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1) because she did not give written pre-suit notice of the potential claim to the health care provider she later sought to substitute as a defendant after the expiration of the statute of limitations. Although the health care provider learned about the claim based on the pre-suit notice the plaintiff sent to another potential defendant, this form of notification did not comply with the notice requirement of section 29-26-121(a)(1). Because the plaintiff did not comply with Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1), the 120-day filing extension under Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(c) is not applicable. Under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 15.03, the filing date of the proposed amended complaint may relate back to the filing date of the original complaint. The plaintiff, however, filed the original complaint after the expiration of the statute of limitations. As a result, the plaintiff's motion to substitute the health care provider is futile because the amended suit would be subject to dismissal based on the expiration of the one-year statute of limitations. The trial court erred by allowing the plaintiff to amend her complaint. We reverse the trial court and the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 9, 2012, Tiffinne Wendalyn Gail Runions gave birth to a baby at\n   Jackson-Madison County General Hospital at 620 Skyline Drive in Jackson, Tennessee. Ms. Runions' baby died five days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 18, 2013, counsel for Ms. Runions sent pre-suit notice letters, asserting a health care liability claim, to seven entities, including Bolivar General Hospital, Inc. d/b/a Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, Inc.; West Tennessee Healthcare, Inc. d/b/a Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, Inc.; and West Tennessee Healthcare Network d/b/a Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Runions sent the notice letters to these entities by certified mail in care of Currie Higgs, their registered agent, whose address was also 620 Skyline Drive, Jackson, Tennessee. Ms. Higgs also served as general counsel for Jackson-Madison County General Hospital District (\"the District\"). The letters advised that, under Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a), Ms. Runions was asserting a health care liability claim against them. The letters also included a list of the health care providers to which Ms. Runions had sent notice and a HIPAA-compliant medical authorization,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as required by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 25, 2013, Laura Zamata, Director of Risk Management for the District, responded to Ms. Runions' notice of claim by letter stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The District is a governmental entity and has elected to be self-insured, therefore, there is no insurance carrier.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Please be advised that as the Director of Risk Management, I am your designated contact for the above referenced claim and all correspondence and telephone inquiries should be directed to me unless you are notified otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Zamata advised that her mailing address was \"JMCGH, 620 Skyline Drive, Jackson, TN 38301.\" Ms. Zamata's letter was on West Tennessee Healthcare letterhead, which listed at the bottom of the page thirty-five health care-related entities, including Bolivar General Hospital, Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, West Tennessee Healthcare Foundation, West Tennessee OB/GYN Services, and West Tennessee Women's Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 6, 2014, after the expiration of the statute of limitations and within the 120-day filing extension under Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Runions filed a health care liability complaint in the Madison County Circuit Court against Bolivar General Hospital, Inc. d/b/a Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, Inc.; West Tennessee Healthcare,\n   Inc. d/b/a Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, Inc.; and West Tennessee Healthcare Network d/b/a Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, Inc. The complaint alleged that the defendants' negligent conduct while Ms. Runions and her baby were patients at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital caused the baby's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendants answered, asserting, in part, that they were not proper parties because they provided no medical care to Ms. Runions or her baby at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital. Instead, the defendants contended that the District, which was not sued, owned and operated the Jackson-Madison County General Hospital. The defendants also asserted a statute of limitations defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendants moved for summary judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing that they had provided no medical care to Ms. Runions or her baby. Relying on the affidavit of Ms. Higgs, the defendants further explained the status and relationship of the District and the defendants. According to the defendants, the District, a governmental entity, owns and operates Jackson-Madison County General Hospital. West Tennessee Healthcare Network, a governmental entity, is a managed care network that does not do business as Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, Inc.; provided no medical services to Ms. Runions or her baby; and is a subsidiary of the District with the District being its sole member. West Tennessee Healthcare, Inc. is a non-profit organization with no employees or licenses to operate health care facilities. Instead, West Tennessee Healthcare, Inc. is a real estate holding company for the District that provided no medical services to Ms. Runions or her baby and limits its activities to the ownership and leasing of property. Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, Inc. is not an active legal entity and provided no medical treatment to Ms. Runions or her baby. It was organized in 1992 as a non-profit corporation with the District as its sole member. In 1995, Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, Inc. amended its Charter to change its name to Bolivar General Hospital, Inc. and currently operates the Bolivar General Hospital in Hardeman County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Runions responded to the motion, conceding that she had mistakenly sued Bolivar General Hospital, Inc. because it may not have provided health care services to her and her baby. She argued, however, that it was clear from the face of the complaint that she had intended to sue Jackson-Madison County General Hospital at 620 Skyline Drive, Jackson, Tennessee-whatever its name may be. Ms. Runions explained that a search for Jackson-Madison County General Hospital through the Tennessee Secretary of State's information service showed a listing for Bolivar General Hospital, Inc. with the mailing address of 620 Skyline Drive, Jackson, Tennessee, and that Ms. Higgs was Bolivar General Hospital, Inc.'s registered agent at the same Skyline Drive address. The Secretary of State's information service also listed Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, Inc. as the \"old\" name of the facility now known as Bolivar General Hospital, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. Runions asserted that on October 21, 2013, the District received actual notice\n   of the claim through notice sent to its place of business at 620 Skyline Drive, Jackson, Tennessee, within the one-year statute of limitations period. According to Ms. Runions, the District knew or should have known that, but for the mistake in identity of the proper party, she would have sued the District. As for West Tennessee Healthcare, Inc. and West Tennessee Healthcare Network, Ms. Runions disputed whether these entities provided medical care. She contended that the trial court should allow her to proceed with discovery about their activities relating to the medical care she and her baby received at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital. Ms. Runions also argued that the statute of limitations did not bar her action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ms. Runions moved to amend her complaint to substitute the District for Bolivar General Hospital, Inc. d/b/a Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, Inc. with the amendment to relate back to the filing of the original complaint under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 15.03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendants responded that Ms. Runions gave pre-suit notice to Bolivar General Hospital, Inc.; West Tennessee Healthcare, Inc.; and West Tennessee Healthcare Network, but not to the District. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Shockley v. Mental Health Cooperative, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6961196\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/582/\">\n    429 S.W.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. Ct. App. 2013), the defendants argued that Ms. Runions could not cure her failure to comply with the pre-suit notice requirement under Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1) by relying on the relation back provision of Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 15.03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ms. Runions argued that she had complied with Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1) because Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, Inc. and the District received pre-suit notice, as acknowledged by Ms. Zamata's October 25, 2013 letter.

Ct. App. Apr. 29, 2014), Ms. Runions contended that by giving actual notice to the place where she received medical treatment, she satisfied the mandatory pre-suit notice requirements of Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment based on its finding that Ms. Runions sent pre-suit notice to the defendants as evidenced by the pre-suit notices and the letter of acknowledgement from Ms. Zamata on behalf of the District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court allowed Ms. Runions to amend her complaint to substitute the District for Bolivar General Hospital, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court and the Court of Appeals granted the motion of the District, West Tennessee Healthcare Network, and West Tennessee Healthcare, Inc. for an interlocutory appeal. The Court of Appeals considered two issues: whether the trial court erred by denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment based on Ms. Runions' non-compliance with Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121 and the holding in\n   <em>\n    Shockley,\n   </em>\n   and whether the trial court erred by granting Ms. Runions' motion to amend her complaint to substitute\n   the District as a defendant with the amended complaint relating back to the filing date of the original complaint under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 15.03.\n   <em>\n    Runions v.

Ms. Runions filed her original complaint after the expiration of the one-year statute of limitations applicable to health care actions, relying on the 120-day filing extension afforded by Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(c). The 120-day filing extension under Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(c) would apply only if Ms. Runions gave pre-suit notice to the District under Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1). The amended complaint may, under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 15.03, relate back to the filing date of the original complaint, but the filing date of the original complaint was after the expiration of the statute of limitations. If Ms. Runions did not give pre-suit notice to the District, then it would be futile to allow her to file the amended complaint substituting the District because the cause of action would be time-barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   So, we must determine whether Ms. Runions gave pre-suit notice to the District to entitle her to the 120-day extension of the filing date under Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(c). The answer depends on whether Ms. Runions complied with Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1) when the District learned about the claim through the pre-suit notice given to Ms. Higgs, the registered agent for the defendants, who also served as general counsel for the District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The trial court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment, ruling that Ms. Runions gave pre-suit notice to the District. Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Tenn.

Instead, she identified and gave pre-suit notice to Bolivar General Hospital, Inc.; West Tennessee Healthcare, Inc.; and West Tennessee Healthcare Network through their registered agent, Ms. Higgs, who also served as general counsel for the District. The District's Risk Manager acknowledged receipt of the notice and advised that she was the \"designated contact for the above referenced claim.\" Therefore, the District knew of Ms. Runions' claim\n   through pre-suit notice sent to three potential defendants. After the statute of limitations had expired and within the 120-day filing extension, Ms. Runions sued Bolivar General Hospital, Inc., West Tennessee Healthcare, Inc., and West Tennessee Healthcare Network. These defendants answered the complaint and moved for summary judgment asserting that they had provided no health care to Ms. Runions and her baby. Realizing her error, Ms. Runions moved to amend her complaint to substitute the District, which owned and operated Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, Inc. in place of Bolivar General Hospital, Inc. This proposed amendment would be futile if Ms. Runions cannot rely on the 120-day filing extension under Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(c) by showing that she complied with the mandatory pre-suit notice requirement of Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1) for the District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To determine whether a plaintiff complies with the mandatory pre-suit notice provision of Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1) when the plaintiff does not give written notice of a claim to a health care provider, but that provider learns of the claim through pre-suit notice given to a different potential defendant, we review the language of Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1). The operative words are \"Any person ... asserting a potential claim for health care liability\n   <em>\n    shall give written notice\n   </em>\n   of the potential claim\n   <em>\n    to each health care provider\n   </em>\n   that will be a named defendant.\" (emphasis added). This language is clear, unambiguous, and requires strict compliance. The Legislature expressly provided that a plaintiff shall give pre-suit notice to the health care provider that will be a named defendant. This language can only mean that the plaintiff must communicate in writing directed to the potential defendant about the claim. We cannot read the statute to authorize indirect notice-that is, written notice of the claim directed to a potential defendant that another health care provider receives and even, as here, acknowledges receiving. Under the language of Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1), the proper inquiry is whether the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    gave\n   </em>\n   pre-suit notice to the health care provider to be named a defendant, not whether the health care provider knew about the claim based on pre-suit notice of the claim directed to another potential defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We hold that a plaintiff does not comply with the mandatory pre-suit notice provision of Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1) when the plaintiff does not give written pre-suit notice to a health care provider that will be named as a defendant-even though that health care provider has knowledge of the claim based on pre-suit notice the plaintiff sent to another potential defendant. Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1) states that notice is to be given in writing to the health care provider to be named as a defendant at least sixty days before the complaint is filed. We are not free to add language to the statute to create an exception for when a health care provider becomes aware of the claim through some means other than pre-suit notice given to it by the plaintiff. We also cannot vary the language of the statute to allow a plaintiff to avoid compliance with the pre-suit notice statute when she does not correctly identify the potential defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our holding\n   is dictated by the language of section 29-26-121(a)(1), which the Legislature enacted based on public policy considerations.

Our interpretation of Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1) is consistent with Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(2), which requires pre-suit notice to include a HIPAA-compliant medical authorization permitting the health care provider receiving the notice to obtain complete medical records from each other health care provider sent the notice.

The Court of Appeals found that the Foundation was neither a health care provider nor a proper defendant, and pre-suit notice given to a party that is not to be named a defendant is of no effect under Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6961196\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/582/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Shockley\n   </em>\n   court's view, \"the question of whether a plaintiff complied with pre-suit notice does not turn on 'actual or constructive' notice; it turns on whether a plaintiff complied with Section 29-26-121.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6961196\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/582/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6961196\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/582/\">\n    at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even though the Cooperative may\n   have had knowledge of the potential claim because it had the same business address and the same registered agent as the Foundation, this \"constructive\" notice did not satisfy Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, the Court of Appeals reasoned that\n   <em>\n    Shockley\n   </em>\n   was distinguishable because the District acknowledged in writing that it had received notice; the plaintiff, therefore, had complied with Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121. This, however, is a distinction without a difference. The key consideration is whether, under Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1), Ms. Runions gave written pre-suit notice to the District-not whether the District knew about the claim or whether it acknowledged that it had learned about the claim based on the pre-suit notice given to another potential defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Shockley\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff cannot proceed because she failed to give pre-suit notice, but for different reasons. Ms. Shockley filed her original suit within the statute of limitations, and so, the amendment to add the Cooperative was not futile because it related back to the filing date of the original complaint under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 15.03. The complaint was later dismissed because Ms. Shockley did not give pre-suit notice. Ms. Runions filed her original suit after the statute of limitations had expired, relying on the 120-day extension under Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(c). Because she did not give pre-suit notice to the District under Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1), Ms. Runions cannot rely on Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(c) to extend the filing date for her claim against the District by 120 days. Under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 15.03, Ms. Runions' amended complaint could relate back to the filing of the original complaint, but the relation back would not make the amended complaint timely. As a result, Ms. Runions' motion to amend her complaint to substitute the District would be futile because she filed her original suit after the expiration of the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Ms. Runions argues that pre-suit notice to the business address of the facility where she received treatment satisfied the pre-suit notice requirement of Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1), citing\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Samples\n   </em>\n   , No. E2013-00799-COA-R9-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201713773\">\n    2014 WL 1713773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn.

Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2012). Neither the language of Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1) nor the holdings in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hinkle\n   </em>\n   support this argument. Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a) does not authorize pre-suit notice to be sent to the facility but states that when notice is mailed to a health care provider that is a corporation, it must be sent to both the address for the agent for service of process and the health care provider's business address, if different from that of the agent for service of process.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2029-26-121\">\n    Tenn.

In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff asserted a health care liability claim against the University of Tennessee Medical Center and the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine in Knoxville.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201713773\">\n    2014 WL 1713773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.

The plaintiff did not send notice to Kindred Hospital's agent for service of process. The Court of Appeals held that notice was sufficient because there was no objection to the alleged failure of service on the agent for service of process, no confusion about which entity was to be named a defendant, and Kindred Hospital received actual notice.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203799215\">\n    2012 WL 3799215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Unlike this case, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Hinkle\n   </em>\n   directed notice to the defendant, not to another potential defendant. The disputed issue was the plaintiff's method of giving notice, not whether the plaintiff gave pre-suit notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203799215\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We hold that the trial court erred by granting Ms. Runions' motion to amend to substitute the District as a defendant because this amendment would be futile. Ms. Runions did not comply with Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(a)(1) by giving the District written pre-suit notice; thus, she cannot rely on the 120-day filing extension of Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(c). Ms. Runions filed her complaint after the expiration of the statute of limitations, but within the 120-day extension. Although the proposed amendment may, under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 15.03, relate back to the filing of the original complaint, the amended complaint would be barred by the statute of limitations. We reverse the decisions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.
