In his sole point on appeal, Hollings argues the trial court abused its discretion in overruling his motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to allow extrinsic evidence of a witness's racial bias, excluding all questioning and testimony at trial regarding the witness's racial bias, and rejecting and overruling Hollings's offer of proof of the witness's testimony. We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal, and we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion. An extended opinion would have no jurisprudential purpose. We have, however, provided a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision to the parties for their use only. We affirm the judgment pursuant to MO. R. CIV. P. 84.16(b) (2015).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
