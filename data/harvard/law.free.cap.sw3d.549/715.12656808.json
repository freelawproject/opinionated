Alvarez, Justice\n   On July 26, 2017, we issued an opinion and judgment in this appeal. Thereafter, Appellee BJ Corporation d/b/a National Building Service filed a motion for rehearing. Having considered the motion, we deny the motion but, to clarify the bases for our decisions, we withdraw our July 26, 2017 opinion and judgment and substitute this opinion and judgment in their stead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellee BJ Corporation d/b/a National Building Service (NBS) sued Appellants,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brad Simpson, and James V. \"Val\" Cotter\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for breaching NBS's contracts to provide janitorial services to buildings belonging to the Cotter Entities, quantum meruit, and negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation. With regard to the breach of contract claim, Appellants raised the affirmative defense of commercial bribery. In addition, Cotter &amp; Sons asserted claims against Val Cotter and Simpson for breach of fiduciary duty and conspiracy. Based on a jury's findings, the trial court rendered judgment awarding NBS damages for its breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation claims. On appeal, Appellants raise five issues: (1) the evidence is insufficient to support the jury's finding that Appellants breached the contracts, (2) the economic-loss rule bars NBS's negligent misrepresentation damages, (3) no recovery is available under quantum meruit, (4) the trial court erred in making all the defendants jointly and severally liable, and (5) NBS is not entitled to attorney's fees because its breach of contract claim and alter ego theories are not supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellants own ten commercial buildings that are the subject of this suit. Cotter was the principal of, and Val Cotter and Simpson were officers in, Cotter &amp; Sons, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Cotter &amp; Sons became dissatisfied with the janitorial services provided to the buildings of the Cotter Entities. Consequently, Blair Jones, Val Cotter, and Simpson created Premier Facilities Solutions, LLC (Premier) to take over the janitorial services to these buildings. Cotter later had a disagreement with how Premier was operating, and he told the Premier principals that he wanted Premier dissolved. Val Cotter and Simpson began negotiating an agreement with Bruce Ha, president of NBS, whereby NBS would purchase Premier's assets. An Asset Purchase Agreement was executed on February 5, 2010, and included a provision that NBS would be awarded new janitorial contracts to clean the Cotter Buildings (the Contracts). The provision reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\n   5.11 New Janitorial Contracts. The Seller (or its affiliates) is the owner of\n   certain commercial buildings that have been cleaned by Seller, a list of which is contained in Schedule 5.11. As a condition of this Agreement, Seller (or its affiliates) will enter into new janitorial contracts with Purchaser for the cleaning of the buildings listed in Schedule 5.11 and containing terms and conditions substantially the same as those contained in the Janitorial Contract attached as Exhibit \"E\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The same day the parties executed the Asset Purchase Agreement, Val Cotter and Simpson executed new janitorial contracts with NBS on behalf of Cotter &amp; Sons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Cotter &amp; Sons slow paid and underpaid NBS's invoices, NBS terminated the Contracts, sued Cotter &amp; Sons for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and in the alternative, quantum meruit. Cotter &amp; Sons disputed Val Cotter's and Simpson's authority to sign the Contracts on behalf of Cotter &amp; Sons, and sued both men, and the case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Appellants are James F.

From the record before us, it appears the motion for new trial was denied by operation of law and this appeal ensued.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <strong>\n     BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM , BRIBERY DEFENSE\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    For NBS's breach of contract claim and Cotter &amp; Sons's affirmative defense of commercial bribery, the procedural posture constrains the relief Cotter &amp; Sons can obtain on appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Charge Questions on Breach of Contract, Bribery\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <em>\n     1. Question 1: Breach of Contract\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The first question in the jury charge asked whether Cotter &amp; Sons breached the Contracts with NBS. Cotter &amp; Sons did not object to the question. The jury found Cotter &amp; Sons breached the Contracts. Although Cotter &amp; Sons filed a motion for new trial, the motion did not raise a legal sufficiency challenge to the jury's finding; instead, it argued the jury's\n    finding was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <em>\n     2. Question 2: Bribery\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    As an affirmative defense to NBS's breach of contract claim, Cotter &amp; Sons argued the Contracts were unenforceable because they were procured through commercial bribery. The second question in the jury charge asked whether the Contracts were procured by bribery. The terms \"Contracts\" and \"bribery\" were defined in the charge. NBS did not object to the question or the definitions. The jury found that the Contracts were not procured by bribery. In its motion for new trial, Cotter &amp; Sons did not challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's finding of no bribery; it only argued that the jury's finding was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <strong>\n     B.

Ten of the contracts were signed on February 5, 2010, the same day the Asset Purchase Agreement was signed. Question 2 also contained instructions defining the term \"bribery\" as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    Bribery occurs when a person who is a fiduciary intentionally or knowingly solicits, accepts, or agrees to accept any benefit from another party on agreement or understanding that the benefit will influence the conduct of the fiduciary in relation to his principal.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    Bribery also occurs when a party offers, confers, or agrees to confer a benefit on a person who is a fiduciary on the agreement or understanding that the benefit will influence the conduct of the fiduciary in relation to his principal.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The definitions are similar to the definition of commercial bribery in section 32.43 of the Texas Penal Code.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX.

Appellants' Arguments\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Appellants argue the jury's finding that the Contracts were not procured by bribery was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. As previously noted, the jury charge contained two definitions of bribery: one focusing on the actions of the fiduciary, Simpson, and one focusing on the actions of the non-fiduciary, NBS. Appellants argue the jury should have answered that the Contracts were procured by bribery if either Simpson or NBS engaged in bribery as defined in the charge. Appellants rely on evidence that Simpson was a fiduciary of Cotter &amp; Sons, and he agreed to accept-and accepted-a personal benefit in exchange for his agreement that Cotter &amp; Sons would enter into new janitorial contracts with NBS. Appellants further rely on evidence that NBS paid a benefit to Simpson as an owner of Premier on the condition that Cotter &amp; Sons would enter into the new janitorial services contracts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <em>\n     5.

Appellees primarily rely on the testimony of Simpson and Ha that they did not intend to give or receive a bribe.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <em>\n     6. Analysis\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    In order for NBS to have engaged in bribery, the evidence must establish that it had knowledge that Simpson was a fiduciary of Cotter &amp; Sons and the payment of the purchase price would influence Simpson is his capacity as a fiduciary.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ex parte Mattox\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9927828\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/683/93/#p97\">\n     683 S.W.2d 93\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 97 (Tex.

However, there is no evidence that Cotter &amp; Sons had a separate, independent duty outside of the Contracts to pay NBS for equipment NBS purchased to perform the janitorial services, to make monthly payments to NBS, or to continue the janitorial contracts for any period of years.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Based on the record, Cotter &amp; Sons's duties to NBS arise solely from the Contracts, and there is no evidence that Cotter &amp; Sons breached any independent duty to NBS. Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the judgment that awards NBS damages for negligent misrepresentation and render judgment on this claim for Appellants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    <strong>\n     QUANTUM MERUIT\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    In addition to suing Appellants for breach of contract, Appellee also asserted a claim for quantum meruit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. R. CIV. P . 48 (\"Alternative Claims for Relief\"). The jury found damages of $431,716.84 for breach of contract. The jury found the same amount of damages for the alternative claim of quantum meruit. The judgment awarded damages for breach of contract, but it did not award damages in the alternative for quantum meruit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Appellants' Arguments\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Appellants argue this court cannot award damages for quantum meruit for two reasons: the trial court did not award quantum meruit damages in the alternative, and quantum meruit recovery is barred by an illegal contract.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    <strong>\n     B. NBS's Arguments\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    NBS argues there is sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of damages on quantum meruit. NBS prays that if this court reverses the commercial bribery finding, the court will nevertheless render judgment in NBS's favor on its alternative the issue of quantum meruit claim and award damages and attorney's fees without remanding for a new trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

Therefore, we reverse the portion of the trial court's judgment awarding NBS damages on its breach of contract claim. Because Appellants' duty to NBS arose only under the\n    Contracts, and NBS's injuries were not independent of the contracts, we reverse the portion of the trial court's judgment awarding damages to NBS on its negligent misrepresentation claim and render judgment for Appellants that NBS take nothing on its negligent misrepresentation claim. We also reverse the portions of the trial court's judgment awarding all other sums to NBS including attorney's fees, interest on past due debt, prejudgment interest, postjudgment interest, and costs of court. We remand this cause to the trial court for a new trial.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-144\">\n     Texas Penal Code section 32.43 reads as follows:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n     (b) A person who is a fiduciary commits an offense if, without the consent of his beneficiary, he intentionally or knowingly solicits, accepts, or agrees to accept any benefit from another person on agreement or understanding that the benefit will influence the conduct of the fiduciary in relation to the affairs of his beneficiary.\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n     (c) A person commits an offense if he offers, confers, or agrees to confer any benefit the acceptance of which is an offense under Subsection (b).\n    </blockquote>\n    <p id=\"p-147\">\n     Tex.
