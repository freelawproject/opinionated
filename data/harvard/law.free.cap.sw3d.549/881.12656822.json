INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that Relator Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company waived its right to invoke its policy's appraisal provision, and because the policy does not contain a nonwaiver clause, we will deny Allstate's petition for writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Real Party in Interest Deniedra Jackson made two claims under her homeowner's policy with her insurance company, Allstate, for roof damage sustained on April 1, 2015, and on March 17, 2016. Allstate refused to pay monies on either claim, stating in writing that \"[n]o payment was made ... because the covered damage observed by Allstate ... did not exceed the policy's $4,077.68 deductible.\" Jackson filed suit pursuant to the expedited action provisions of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 169.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 169. In accordance with that rule, Jackson affirmatively pleaded that she was seeking recovery of only monetary relief aggregating $100,000 or less.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 169(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to invoking the appraisal provision set forth in Jackson's policy, Allstate had conducted at least six inspections of Jackson's roof;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   had removed the case to federal\n   court-the federal court remanded it to state court three months later;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   had taken Jackson's deposition; had conducted discovery; had agreed to a February 2018 trial setting;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   had sought and had obtained an order from the trial court compelling a seventh inspection of Jackson's roof by a new Allstate expert-specifically representing to the trial court that a seventh inspection was needed for Allstate to prepare for the upcoming jury trial;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and had obtained an extension of time to the expert designation deadline in order to designate the new expert conducting the seventh inspection-Jackson's counsel stated that she had no objection to an extension of Allstate's designation deadline for the new expert \"[a]s long as it doesn't postpone the trial setting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Jackson objected to Allstate's motion to compel a seventh inspection, pointing out that Allstate had already performed six inspections-four by adjusters and two by experts-that it had \"over a thousand photographs,\" that it had \"hundreds of measurements,\" and that \"it will be the seventh inspection.\" She explained that as far as the interior, \"[w]e're talking about two spots [on the ceilings], one in the master bedroom and one in the living room.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jackson's counsel argued at various points in the hearing that Allstate's request for a seventh inspection had \"reached a point of harassment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court nonetheless signed a July 26, 2017 order granting Allstate's motion to compel another inspection of Jackson's roof by another Allstate expert and granting Allstate's counsel's request for an extension of Allstate's deadlines to designate this new expert. On August 10, 2017, Allstate's new expert Gary Boyd conducted a seventh inspection for Allstate of Jackson's roof and home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Four days later, on August 14, 2017, Allstate made a settlement offer. Allstate offered $24,000 to Jackson to settle all her claims against Allstate. Allstate's settlement offer provided,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Allstate offers to pay $24,000 (TWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND AND NO/DOLLARS) in new money in exchange for a complete release of all claims against Defendant Allstate and a dismissal with prejudice of the above referenced suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The offer contained in this letter is made for the sole purpose of amicable resolution and avoiding further expense associated with Plaintiff's lawsuit. The offer is not intended to be and should not be considered by you or your client to be an admission of liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Jackson rejected Allstate's $24,000 settlement offer on August 16, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The next day, on August 17, 2017, Allstate made a written demand for appraisal under the terms of its policy with Jackson. When Jackson refused to participate in the appraisal process, Allstate filed with the trial court motions to compel an appraisal and to abate the case. Jackson filed a response in opposition to Allstate's motion to compel appraisal and abate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court conducted a September 8, 2017 hearing on Allstate's motion to compel an appraisal and motion to abate. Allstate argued that a point of impasse had been reached on August 16, 2017, when Jackson rejected Allstate's $24,000 settlement offer and that, consequently, Allstate's demand the next day, on August 17, 2017, for an appraisal was timely. Jackson argued that Allstate had waived its right of appraisal by conduct inconsistent with that right-including that Allstate had compelled a seventh inspection, that the point of impasse concerning the amount of loss\n   had occurred over two years earlier, and that she would suffer prejudice from Allstate's attempt to invoke the appraisal clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the hearing on Allstate's motion to compel an appraisal, the trial court asked Allstate,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   So why did we have the whole fight on y'all wanting to go out and inspect it again rather than saying we've reached an impasse and we want to invoke the appraisal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [ALLSTATE'S COUNSEL]: We hadn't reached the impasse yet. We were continuing to negotiate the settlement negotiations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: No. You were preparing for trial and complaining that there was no way you could go to trial with the expert that you had and you had to have another expert come out because one fellow was only causation. So you weren't talking settlement. You were doing tactical maneuvering in the lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing on Allstate's motion to compel an appraisal and to abate the lawsuit pending an appraisal, the learned trial court judge stated his ruling on the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   All right. Well, you can't look at it in a vacuum. And I don't think the time in and of itself-and, in fact, I really think it's almost silly the way they claim when an impasse is met because as somebody who's practiced law 30 years, I know that Friday before Monday trials cases that have been at an impasse for years suddenly get resolved because people know that there's a jury waiting on Monday. In fact, we have them settle Monday morning. So I don't know that there's ever an actual impasse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   But I do think that with all the hoops that we have jumped through and because\n   this was filed as an expedited action case, that there was a waiver. I think we should have-we didn't need to go out and inspect the property again if we knew that, that we wanted to have a third-party appraisal done, we should have done it then rather than saying we need this to prepare for trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   So that's-I'm going to find that they waived the right to invoke the appraisal provision and deny the request for the appraisal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After the trial court signed an order memorializing its rulings, Allstate filed this original proceeding. Jackson filed a response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Allstate represented to the trial court that this seventh inspection was needed because \"their [Jackson's] estimator and their contractor is going to have much more credibility in front of the jury if he gets to say, I went there and I looked at it in person, and our contractor didn't.\" Allstate represented to the trial court that this seventh inspection was needed because \"we need a defense of our estimate, so we need someone to look and say, hey, can you see how much in your professional opinion, in your business it would be to make these repairs and whether we did it right.\" Based on these representations, and over Jackson's\n   objections to the \"harassing\" nature of and lack of necessity for this seventh inspection, the trial court granted Allstate's motion. Allstate's counsel then requested an extension of time to designate experts for trial, stating, \"One other thing on this ... I would request that we get an extension for our designations as well.\" The trial court granted Allstate's request for an extension of time to designate its new expert after he had conducted a seventh inspection of Jackson's roof and after Jackson's counsel agreed to the extension \"[a]s long as it doesn't postpone the trial setting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Based on the facts and circumstances outlined above, we hold that it was within the trial court's discretion to determine that Allstate's conduct clearly constituted intentional conduct inconsistent with its right to invoke the contractual right of an appraisal to determine the amount of loss-in fact, Allstate directly verbally expressed to the trial court Allstate's intent to go to trial despite lack of satisfaction of the appraisal clause condition precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Universal Underwriters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318488\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/345/404/#p408\">\n    345 S.W.3d at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that acts constituting waiver by conduct are acts \"reasonably calculated to induce the [insured] to believe that a compliance by him with the terms and requirements of the policy is not desired[ ] or would be of no effect if performed [and] relied on must amount to a denial of liability[ ] or a refusal to pay the loss\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Scottish Union &amp; Nat'l Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20S.W.%20630\">\n    8 S.W. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   632 );\n   <em>\n    Jai Bhole, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2050165\">\n    2014 WL 50165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (explaining that insurer's \"lengthy [three-month] delay in demanding an appraisal is indicative of its intent to waive its right to an appraisal, at least until it seemed strategically wise to assert it to limit Plaintiff's potential recovery\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Concerning the waiver-by-conduct factor of the reasonableness-of-the-delay by Allstate in requesting an appraisal from the \"point of impasse,\" the parties assert differing positions on when the point of impasse was reached. The mandamus record before us establishes that on three different occasions-October 28, 2016, March 20, 2017, and May 9, 2017-Jackson demanded payment from Allstate for $19,350.42 (consisting of $14,850.42 to replace her roof; interior damage of $2,000; plus $2,500 in attorney's fees). Between Jackson's second and third demand, Allstate offered to pay $4,000 to settle Jackson's claims against Allstate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Jackson contends, and we hold, that the point of impasse occurred on May 9, 2017, when Jackson rejected Allstate's $4,000 offer and demanded-for the third time-$19,350.42.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Allstate, on the other hand, argues that the point of impasse concerning the amount of loss occurred on August 16, 2017, when Jackson rejected Allstate's August 14, 2017 settlement offer of $24,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Essentially, Allstate argues that despite its litigation conduct it may nonetheless, at any point in the litigation process, trigger a new point of impasse by simply making a settlement offer that is rejected. The trial court understood that Allstate's motion to compel an appraisal presented this exact situation. When Allstate claimed it had not demanded an appraisal prior to its motion to compel a seventh inspection because an impasse had not yet been reached, the trial court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   No. You were preparing for trial and complaining that there was no way you could go to trial with the expert that you had and you had to have another expert come out because one fellow was only causation.

During Jackson's deposition, Allstate asked her about an inspection by Christopher Cook on May 10, 2015, but Jackson did not remember that inspection.

Here, I believe the point of impasse occurred on July 26, 2017, when the trial court held the hearing on Allstate's motion to compel a seventh inspection of Jackson's property damage. Jackson zealously opposed the motion and argued that the request was a form of harassment. Allstate asserted that its six previous inspections occurred \"when the parties were trying to work it out\" and countered Jackson's harassment allegation by claiming that its requested inspection, which would be the seventh, was necessary for one reason: to prepare its expert witness for trial. At that point, it was clear that both parties knew Allstate was refusing to pay Jackson's claimed loss and was pursuing trial as its single method to dispose of her property-damage claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scottish Union &amp; Nat'l Ins. v.
