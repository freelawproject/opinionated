(\"JCI\") entered into an agreement with the City of Columbia, Missouri, to serve as general contractor on the Hominy Trail Water and Sewer Project. JCI subcontracted certain boring work related to the project to G&amp;G Mechanical Constructors, Inc. (\"G&amp;G\"). A dispute arose over JCI's failure to pay G&amp;G for its work, which resulted in G&amp;G bringing claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and violation of Missouri's Prompt Pay Act against JCI. In addition, a breach of surety bond claim was brought against JCI and its surety, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\"Liberty Mutual\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury returned a verdict against JCI and Liberty Mutual in the amount of $445,408.94.

The trial court heard argument on the issue and denied the motion. On March 20, 2017, JCI and Liberty Mutual filed a Trial Brief on Statutory Interest. The trial court heard from the parties on that day and revisited the issue on March 21, 2017. On March 30,\n   2017, G&amp;G filed a Motion for Award of Pre-Judgment Interest on Jury Verdict and Entry of Judgment along with supporting suggestions. JCI and Liberty Mutual filed a Memorandum in Opposition, and the trial court heard argument on May 15, 2017. On May 18, 2017, the trial court entered Judgment in favor of G&amp;G, which included an award of prejudgment interest at a rate of nine percent. No after-trial motions were filed by JCI or Liberty Mutual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Missouri Supreme Court has held that \"[t]he issue of prejudgment interest was properly presented to the trial court and adequately preserved for appeal\" where, after the jury verdict, \"both parties corresponded with the trial court about prejudgment interest[ ] and the court held two conferences on the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

The interest provision stated: \"Any pay estimate overdue by 60 days shall bear interest at the annual rate of 18% or the highest rate allowed by law, if lower. Retainage shall not be held out of payment.\" Douglas Adrian (\"Adrian\"), on behalf of JCI, struck through the entire provision with a single line, initialed \"DA\", and\n   wrote \"5% Retiange [sic]\" in the margin. The contract was returned to William Dooley (\"Dooley\") of G&amp;G. Near the writings of Adrian, Dooley initialed \"WOD\" and dated \"1/9/12\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

However, where no agreement is made, including where a contract contains a provision concerning interest but the rate is left blank, the creditor is entitled to interest at the rate designated by section 408.020.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 408.020;\n   <em>\n    Bank of Kirksville v.

G&amp;G counters that the striking of the interest provision did nothing more than remove it from the parties' agreement, leaving the final contract silent on the issue of prejudgment interest.

This statement misconstrues section 408.020, which as a matter of law entitles a creditor to statutory interest at a rate of nine percent\n    <em>\n     unless\n    </em>\n    otherwise agreed upon by the parties.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 408.020;\n    <em>\n     Bank of Kirksville\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334234\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/766/770/#p771\">\n     766 S.W.2d at 771\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The burden is thus on the party seeking to avoid application of section 408.020 to establish that the parties agreed to an alternative arrangement. In this case, it was JCI and Liberty Mutual's burden to prove that the parties had agreed that interest would not be paid.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    In support of their argument, JCI and Liberty Mutual state in their briefs \"that the stricken language provided interest to be paid on past due amounts at the rate of 18%\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      or\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    the statutory rate.\" This, however, is a mischaracterization of the provision, which actually provided that G&amp;G would be entitled to \"interest at the annual rate of 18% or the highest rate allowed by law, if lower.\" The nine percent interest rate under section 408.020 is not the highest rate of interest allowed by law. In other words, \"the highest rate of interest allowed by law\" is a different concept than a creditor's entitlement to interest at a rate of nine percent through operation of section 408.020. Thus, striking through that provision did not evidence the parties' agreement that prejudgment interest pursuant to section 408.020 would not be paid.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    JCI and Liberty Mutual quote G&amp;G's statement that \"the intent of the parties is clear from the evidence based upon the contract itself\" to allege that G&amp;G \"unequivocally acknowledged the contract was ambiguous\" by arguing the parties' intent.
