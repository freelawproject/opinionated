In two points on appeal, Cannady argues that the motion court clearly erred in denying her post-conviction motion, contending that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to consistently object to hearsay testimony, and that Cannady was prejudiced thereby. Because the motion court's denial of Cannady's Rule 29.15 motion was not clearly erroneous, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The \"facts,\" for purposes of our review, are derived from the evidence (and reasonable inferences therefrom), when viewed in the light most favorable to the motion court's judgment.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Day v. State\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777509\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/495/773/#p774\">\n    495 S.W.3d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774 (Mo.App. S.D. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Victim had been romantically involved with Lance Hill (\"Hill\") for eight years, and he was the father of her two children. The couple broke up in July 2009, and Hill moved in with his mother. Cannady also had two children by Hill, and was staying at the home of Hill's mother during the 2009 Christmas season. Hill's half-brother, Michael Harris (\"Harris\"), also resided at the household.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 9, 2010, at approximately 2:30 a.m., Victim asked a neighbor to take her to where Hill was living. Upon arrival, Victim went directly upstairs to Hill's room, woke him up, and asked him if he wanted to go back to her house and talk about getting back together. Hill agreed to go with Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As Hill and Victim were leaving the house, they encountered Cannady in the kitchen. Hill and Cannady yelled at each other, then Hill and Victim went outside to the car. Once they were at the car, Hill decided to stay the night with Victim, and they went back in the house to retrieve Hill's clothes. Harris woke up and Victim and Hill ended up having a beer and talking to Harris for almost two hours. After approximately 45 minutes, they began smelling grease from the kitchen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At approximately 5:00 a.m., Victim and Hill decided to leave. Victim began walking down the stairs. As Victim reached the bottom third or fourth stair, Cannady threw a pot of hot grease in Victim's face. Victim started screaming and fell down the rest of the stairs. Cannady then began to beat Victim in the back of the head with the pot while calling her a \"stupid bitch.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While police were being called, Cannady ran out the back door. Responding officers found Cannady hiding underneath mattresses in a detached garage behind the house, where she was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Victim was treated for burns to her face, neck, left ear, chest, back, left arm, and the lower left side of her stomach. Victim later underwent surgery on her left arm requiring skin grafts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cannady was charged by amended information with the class A felony of assault in the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A jury trial commenced on September 26, 2011. Victim testified during the State's case in chief. In her testimony, Victim identified Cannady as the person who threw the hot grease on her. She indicated that she personally knew Cannady, and Cannady and her children had lived with Victim in 2006 and 2008. Victim stated she and Cannady did not have a good relationship, but \"tried to get along.\" She testified she did not see Cannady actually throw the grease in her face as it was dark at the\n   bottom of the stairs. Victim said that after she was hit with the grease, she fell down the remaining stairs and Cannady started beating her in the back of her head with a pot saying, \"You stupid bitch.\" She indicated that she recognized Cannady's voice. Victim's testimony was that Hill then came down the stairs and said, \"Jill, what the fuck did you do?\" Hill grabbed Cannady off Victim and when Victim stood up, she saw Cannady.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Harris testified that a short time after Hill and Victim left his bedroom, he heard Victim yell \"That B burnt me.\" Harris saw Cannady coming up the stairs with splatter marks on her shirt. Cannady told him, \"I go that B, I got that B.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Officer Chad McIntrye (\"McIntrye\"), with the Springfield Police Department, testified he was a major crimes investigator. He responded to a call at 5:20 a.m. at Hill's residence. He met Hill coming out the door. Officer McIntrye testified that as he approached the house, he smelled an odor like burnt grease. The following colloquy then took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [STATE:] Once you approached the house, what did you do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [MCINTRYE:] Mr. Hill was coming outside. I asked him a few questions, if he lived there. He said he did. He said the mother of his child was burned. I asked where it happened at. He said inside.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [DEFENSE:] Objection. Hearsay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [STATE:] I would just use this for subsequent conduct, for getting a consent to search and going into the house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [COURT:] Okay. Have you finished that line of questioning, then, at this point?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [STATE:] I just need to ask a few follow-up questions about how he ended up in the house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [COURT:] None of it's for the truth of it; is that what you're telling me?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [STATE:] Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [COURT:] Objection's overruled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [STATE:] So you spoke with Mr. Hill about the reason you were dispatched there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [MCINTRYE:] Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [STATE:] And after he gave you some information, did he subsequently give you consent to search that house?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [MCINTRYE:] Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [STATE:] And did he do so by a signed form or just verbally?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [MCINTRYE:] Both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [STATE:] Okay. What happened when you went into that house?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [MCINTRYE:] The smell of the grease was stronger, and I just basically did a walk-through. Mr. Hill took me-he told me what had happened. He took me to a stairway and said this is where it happened at, then he took me to a couple other places inside the house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [STATE:] Okay. How did you conduct your investigation, then, as you proceeded through this house?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [MCINTRYE:] At first I just did a walk-through with Mr. Hill, and then I went and got my camera and I just started taking pictures of the interior of the house and the evidence that I found, or thought was evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [STATE:] Okay. What were you looking for as far as items of evidence? You had heard that this was a burn case. Were you looking for specific items that you would believe would be associated with that case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [MCINTRYE:] Mr. Hill had said that somebody threw grease on her; so,\n   obviously, I was looking for an area that had a large amount of grease or any grease at all, clothes, a container that would hold hot grease, that sort of thing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [STATE:] Did you have an occasion to go into the kitchen?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [MCINTRYE:] Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Officer McIntyre found a pot in an upstairs bedroom. The pot had a film of oil on it with black residue in the bottom indicating it had been \"substantially hot.\" Officer McIntyre stated he found grease spatters on both walls of the stairway area, which ran down the wall and pooled on the carpet. The grease spatters contained brown or rust colored food debris. The grease spatters went head high if you were standing on the stairs. He testified that it appeared that a substantial amount of grease had been distributed on the walls, and he found nothing else in the house that looked like it would hold hot grease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Officer Chris Laughlin, (\"Officer Laughlin\") with the Springfield Police Department, testified that when he arrived at the scene, he smelled an odor of cooking oil coming from the house. The following colloquy then took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [STATE:] And do you recall who you and the other officers made contact with first?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [LAUGHLIN:] That would be Lance Hill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [STATE:] Where did you make contact with Lance Hill?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [LAUGHLIN:] He was the occupant that answered the door and met us there in the doorway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [STATE:] Did he grant you consent to enter that house?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [LAUGHLIN:] Yes, sir, he did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [STATE:] And did you enter that house?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [LAUGHLIN:] Yes, sir, we did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [STATE:] Can you just explain to us what you did when you entered the home?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [LAUGHLIN:] We collectively, as a group, sat there, and we asked them if there was an assault that took place there. Mr. Hill said that there was an assault-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [DEFENSE:] Objection. Hearsay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [COURT:] Sustained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [DEFENSE:] Your Honor, any continuing question in that vein would go to the subsequent conduct as to where and what this officer did next. I can move on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [STATE:] You spoke with Mr. Hill?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [LAUGHLIN:] Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [STATE:] And after speaking with Mr. Hill, what did you do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [LAUGHLIN:] Myself and Officer Raby, after there was allegations of an assault, we searched the residence for the alleged suspect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [STATE:] Did you have any particular location in which you were first searching for that suspect?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [LAUGHLIN:] We initially searched inside the main residence of 1363 East Division.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [STATE:] And you said you entered through the front door?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [LAUGHLIN:] Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   [STATE:] She wasn't in the front dining room or living room?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [LAUGHLIN:] No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [STATE:] Where did you go from there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [LAUGHLIN:] We searched the ground level of the house. Mr. Hill had stated the last place in which he'd seen the suspect was through the back of the house, so we continued searching\n   through the bottom level of the house, through the-and exited through the rear of the house, still continuing to search for Ms. Cannady.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Officer Laughlin testified that they located Cannady in a detached garage, hiding underneath a couple of mattresses. Cannady was taken into custody at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Officer Victor Raby (\"Officer Raby\"), with the Springfield Police Department, testified he was dispatched in response to a female that had been burned. He indicated that Officer McIntyre and Officer Laughlin were also at the scene. The following colloquy took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [STATE:] Okay. What did you do to assist in this investigation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   [RABY:] When we got there, we contacted the owner of the residence or the resident of the house. He explained to us he was going to the hospital, that his baby's mamma had been burned with chicken grease by a female named Jillian, and she was last seen exiting the house through the rear door. He said he had followed her, but he wasn't able to locate where she was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [STATE:] Did you assist in processing the interior of the house, or did you go in search of the suspect?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   [RABY:] Myself and Officer Laughlin went out the back, to search the back yard. Was unable to find her in the back yard, so we expanded the search into the detached garage that was north of the house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   [STATE:] Did you go through the house before you got into that back yard area?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [RABY:] No, ma'am. We did not search the house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [STATE:] Okay. Did you pass through-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [RABY:] Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. We went through the front door and exited. We took the same path as she took to go out there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [STATE:] Anything of note as you pass through the kitchen?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [RABY:] He was explaining-Mr. Hill was explaining to the other officers the pan and the grease, but I didn't go into depth on anything like that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [STATE:] That was not your part of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   [RABY:] No, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [STATE:] -this investigation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [RABY:] No, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [STATE:] Okay. Once you went through the house and out the back door, can you describe what you saw out in the back yard?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [RABY:] Back yard is just an open area. It was fenced in with a privacy fence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   [STATE:] And this time of year, January 9th, 2010, was it cold?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   [RABY:] It was snowing, yes, or had snow on the ground.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   [STATE:] Okay. Once you went back into the yard, where did your search proceed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   [RABY:] To the detached garage on the north side.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [STATE:] And what did you observe when you inspected that detached garage?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   [RABY:] As soon as we opened the door, we smelled the strong odor of cigarette smoke, like someone had just been in there smoking. It was full of trash, furniture, had a couple of mattresses to the left side, which would have been the south side. As soon as we started doing a sweep, to make sure anybody was in there, then\n   I noticed Ms. Cannady behind the mattresses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   [STATE:] Okay. Did it appear that anybody was living in this detached garage, or was it a storage area?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   [RABY:] It was definitely a storage area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   [STATE:] What physical observations did you make about her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   [RABY:] She smelled of cooking oil. It was pretty, pretty strong. She had what appeared to be blotches of cooking oil on her, on her shirt. I asked her if she was injured. She said she had a cut on her hand and a scratch on her neck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Officer Raby testified that Cannady refused medical care, that he read Cannady her\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, and that she was transported to the Greene County Jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Cannady testified during the defense's case in chief. She stated she was walking toward the front door with the pot of hot grease in her hands-with the intent to dump it outside the front door-when she heard Victim being loud on the stairs. She testified she walked over to the bottom of the stairs to tell Victim to be quiet, when Victim stumbled down the stairs, hitting the pot of hot grease Cannady was holding, and splattering Cannady with the grease. Cannady further indicated that, in a reflex action, she threw the pot away from herself and it struck Victim. Victim began screaming and Hill came out of the bathroom asking what happened. Victim told Hill that \"the bitch threw grease on me.\" Cannady ran upstairs to get her phone to call 911. Hill followed and began choking her; this had happened in the past. Hill released her to go downstairs to see about Victim. Cannady grabbed her purse and a coat, went outside, and hid from Hill in the garage. Shortly thereafter, police found Cannady and arrested her. Cannady stated she did not intentionally try to hurt Victim, and that it was just a bad accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   After the close of the evidence, the jury found Cannady guilty of assault in the first degree. The trial court sentenced Cannady to fifteen years' imprisonment, as a prior offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   This Court affirmed Cannady's conviction on direct appeal in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v. Cannady\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094703\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/389/306/\">\n    389 S.W.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo.App. S.D. 2013). Mandate issued on February 13, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   On March 12, 2013, Cannady filed a timely\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Rule 29.15 motion. On January 16, 2015, the motion court appointed the public defender to represent Cannady. On January 30, 2015, the motion court granted appointed counsel an additional thirty days to file an amended motion. Appointed counsel filed a timely amended motion on April 15, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In her amended motion, Cannady asserted that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to make consistent objections to \"hearsay statements,\" attributed to Hill, and recited in trial testimony by Officer McIntyre, Officer Laughlin and Officer Raby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   On September 28, 2015, the motion court held an evidentiary hearing at which trial counsel and Hill-whose statements to police form the basis for Cannady's claim in this case-testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Trial counsel stated it was \"[t]rial strategy\" that he did not \"object to other statements attributed to Mr. Hill\" besides the three to which he objected (two successfully, one unsuccessfully). Counsel said his strategy \"depended on what the questions were asked by the State and what statements they were trying to elicit from the officer that were attributable to Mr. Hill.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Trial counsel believed that some of Hill's statements supported defense strategy and some did not. As a \"general practice,\" trial counsel testified that he does not ask for curative instructions to the jury to disregard statements after an objection is sustained, because he does not \"want to call the jury's attention repeatedly to that comment[.]\" Additionally, he indicated that Victim had already testified that Cannady was the person who threw the hot grease on her before any testimony was gleaned from the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Trial counsel stated he \"didn't object every single time officers and other witnesses referred to those statements made by Lance Hill\" for \"the same reason it was overruled at the first time,\" namely that they were admitted for reasons other than the truth of the matter asserted. Trial counsel stated that it was his belief that all of the unobjected-to statements were admissible, for reasons such as explaining subsequent police conduct, and being offered not for the truth of the matter asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In addition, trial counsel stated that the defense in this case was that it was an accident, and it was undisputed that Cannady testified she had a pan of hot grease in her hand and \"that pan of hot grease got thrown onto the [V]ictim out of her hand, or knocked out or however she qualified it[.]\" Trial counsel believed that many of the statements made by the officers had already been made by other witnesses who had testified. It was trial counsel's recollection that he attempted to locate Hill to testify at trial, but was unable to locate him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   On January 27, 2016, the motion court denied the motion and ordered proposed findings to be submitted. On April 25, 2017, the motion court issued \"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment and Order Denying [Cannady's] Amended Motion to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Judgment and Sentence.\" The motion court found that defense counsel's decision to abstain from objecting to certain further questions and pieces of testimony was part of his \"reasonable and competent\" trial strategy, and that Cannady was not prejudiced. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In two points on appeal, Cannady asserts that the motion court clearly erred in denying her Rule 29.15 motion, in that \"competent counsel would have consistently objected to the prejudicial hearsay statements rather than offering intermittent objections[,]\" (Point I) and because Cannady was prejudiced thereby (Point II). Cannady concedes that she must prevail on both points to succeed on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   We will affirm a motion court's denial of post-conviction relief unless its \"findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.

Clearly this is not true regarding any statement offered to explain the officer's subsequent conduct.

There is no prejudice to [Cannady] by the material nature of the details of the offence being admitted through the testimony of Victim. It is doubtful that any prejudice to [Cannady] accrued from the testimony of Officers McIntyre, Laughlin and Raby concerning Hill's statements. To the extent that any prejudice did accrue, it is insufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome, and would not have changed it.
