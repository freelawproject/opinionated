(Dakota) and Gabriel Plascencia (Plascencia) filed a petition for writ of mandamus in this court on January 3, 2018, asking us to direct Respondent, the Honorable John P. Chupp, to set aside his order of November 20, 2017 denying Relators leave to designate a responsible third party. The motion to designate was timely under the circumstances presented here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2033.004\">\n    Tex.

Also traveling southbound on the 300 block of South Beach Street in front of Plascencia was driver Lenard Bundick. Riding with Bundick in his vehicle were Real Parties in Interest Lesli Barwick and Renaldo Cardenas (collectively, Plaintiffs). When Bundick's vehicle slowed in an attempt to make a U-turn, Plascencia's truck collided with the rear of Bundick's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 17, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their original petition suing Relators for negligently causing the accident, a mere three days prior to the running of the two-year statute of limitations for such actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016.003\">\n    Tex.

In their responses to the Requests for Disclosure, Relators identified Bundick as an individual who may be designated as a responsible third party. Thirty days later, on September 21, 2017, Relators filed their Motion for Leave to Designate Responsible Third Party, naming Bundick as a responsible third party for his alleged negligence in causing or contributing to the motor vehicle accident. Plaintiffs objected to Relators' motion to designate on the sole ground that Relators' failed to timely identify Bundick as a potential\n   responsible third party within fifty days in their responses to Plaintiffs' Requests for Disclosure that were served with the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on Plaintiffs' objection to the designation of Bundick on October 26, 2017, and the court denied the designation on the basis that Relators did not timely respond to the Requests for Disclosure. Relators seek this mandamus asserting that they have no adequate remedy by appeal to address the trial court's denial of their designation of Bundick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Relators must demonstrate that the trial court clearly abused its discretion and that they have no adequate remedy through an appeal to prevail on their petition for writ of mandamus.\n   <em>\n    In re H.E.B.

Rather, Plaintiffs argue that that Relators' motion to designate Bundick was untimely because Relators' responses to Plaintiffs' Requests for Disclosure (which identified Bundick as a possible responsible third party), served with Relators' answer, were served approximately 140 days after the service of the lawsuit, making such responses about 90 days late.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We determine that Plaintiffs' objection to the timeliness of Relators' motion to designate Bundick is without merit and strongly hints of an ill-advised attempt to procedurally game Relators out of their statutory right to designate a responsible third party. In support of this determination, we turn to our sister court's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Bustamante\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373430\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/510/732/\">\n    510 S.W.3d 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6(a). To hold as the [plaintiffs] suggest would convert Rule 194.2(l) into a technical trap. A party who fails to timely respond to a request for disclosure of information regarding a person who may be designated as a responsible third party would lose the statutory right to designate responsible third parties.... We do not read [Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code] Section 33.004(d) so narrowly. Instead, we read section 33.004(d) to require a defendant to disclose a potential responsible third party before the expiration of the statute of limitations, if that is possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373430\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/510/732/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373430\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/510/732/\">\n    510 S.W.3d at 736-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We agree with the court of appeals's reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Bustamante\n   </em>\n   , Relators did not fail to comply with their duty to timely\n   disclose Bundick as a potential responsible third party because it was impossible for them to make such a disclosure before the expiration of the statute of limitations: Plaintiffs filed their suit three days before limitations expired and did not serve one Relator until a week later and the other was not served until almost two weeks had passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Further, as he was the driver of the vehicle they were riding in when the accident occurred, it defies all credulity to suggest that Plaintiffs did not know that Bundick was a potential responsible third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   But even if Plaintiffs were somehow unaware that Bundick was a potential responsible third party, Realtors' disclosure of Bundick as a possible third party was made far in advance of any trial date. And, Plaintiffs failed to raise the statutorily permitted objection in Section 33.004(g) because they did not allege that Relators failed to meet the notice pleading requirements under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2033.004\">\n    Tex.

Based on this record, we hold that the trial court clearly abused its discretion by denying the motion to designate Bundick as a responsible third party. Consistent with recent precedent from the Texas Supreme Court, we additionally hold that Relators have no adequate remedy by appeal from the trial court's error, entitling them to mandamus relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coppola\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409032\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/535/506/#p510\">\n    535 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   510 ;\n   <em>\n    United Parcel Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20753503\">\n    2018 WL 753503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CVR Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12183171\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/500/67/#p73\">\n    500 S.W.3d at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (allowing a lawsuit to proceed to trial when there is an erroneous denial of a responsible third party designation \"would 'skew the proceedings, potentially affect the outcome of the litigation, and compromise the presentation of (the relators') defense in ways unlikely to be apparent in the appellate record' \") (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Having determined that Respondent abused his discretion, we conditionally grant the petition for writ of mandamus.
