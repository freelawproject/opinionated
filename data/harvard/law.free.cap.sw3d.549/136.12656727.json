Again, no Rule 204 examination was requested, and only lay testimony was offered regarding the child's disability, self-supportability, and need for care and supervision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court declined to modify the support obligation, but ordered D.C.'s mother to apply for all government services D.C. may qualify for, including Social Security benefits. The court stated that the parties could seek further orders if D.C. began receiving government benefits. The court of appeals affirmed, concluding the trial court did not <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"137\" href=\"#p137\" id=\"p137\">*137</a>abuse its discretion in determining D.C.'s father failed to meet his burden of proving the child's circumstances had \"materially and substantially changed\" since the time of the initial decree or that termination of support would be in the child's best interests.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></attorneys>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"p-22\">Tex.

Guzman Justice, delivered an opinion concurring in the denial of the petition for review.</p><p id=\"p-10\">This appeal challenges an order requiring a parent to pay $820 per month in child support for an adult child, indefinitely. Under Family Code section 154.302, a parent may be required to provide financial support to an adult child for \"an indefinite period\" if the child is incapable of self-support and requires substantial care and personal supervision because of a mental or physical disability existing on or before the child's eighteenth birthday.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute, however, lacks clearly defined standards for making the relevant factual determinations-and revisiting them in modification proceedings. Ill-defined standards lead to inconsistent treatment and, in some cases, injustice. Guidance is necessary because parental support obligations for adult children can result in lifelong financial burdens. In this case, however, I believe procedural impediments prevent the Court from adding sufficient clarity to the matter. Accordingly, I concur in the decision to deny discretionary review and write separately only to highlight some of the legal inquiries that require direction from the Legislature and guidance from the Court.</p><p id=\"p-11\">D.C.'s parents divorced when he was fourteen years old. Relying on lay testimony, the trial court found section 154.032's requirements were satisfied and, on that basis, ordered D.C.'s father to pay a fixed sum of child support indefinitely. The record bears no evidence that either party requested an independent medical examination, as authorized by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 204.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither party appealed the final divorce decree.</p><p id=\"p-13\">The critical issue in the modification proceeding was whether D.C. continues to have a mental or physical disability that satisfies section 154.302's criteria. The Family Code does not define mental or physical disability or specify the type of proof required to meet the statutory standard. But parents need to know what they need to prove and how they need to prove it. Though these issues are percolating in the lower courts, many Texas families are affected; ad hoc adjudication is an inadequate solution. Guidance on a number of threshold matters is essential, including:</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\u2022 What are the criteria for determining whether a child has a mental or physical disability? Is the standard determined by common understanding<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or do we look to other sources such as, the federal Social Security Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> state and federal anti-discrimination laws,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or something else?</p><p id=\"p-15\">\u2022 Is expert testimony required-either through a proffered expert or a Rule 204 medical examination-or is lay testimony from a parent or caregiver sufficient?</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-16\">\u2022 What type of evidence is required to support a finding that a child is incapable of self-support? Must there be evidence that the child has tried and failed to obtain or maintain gainful employment? Is evidence of eligibility for or receipt of government disability benefits necessary? Is it sufficient?</p><p id=\"p-17\">Defining the relevant standards is crucial because once indefinite child support is granted additional evidentiary hurdles come into play and additional questions arise. An order of indefinite child support may be modified or terminated only if the moving party proves by a preponderance of the evidence that \"the circumstances of the child or a person affected by the order have materially and substantially changed.\"<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> What is a material and substantial change in relation to a prior section 154.032 finding? Must a parent show a change in the nature of the disability itself or merely a change in how it impacts the child's everyday existence?</p><p id=\"p-18\">The statute is silent regarding the most basic evidentiary issues, many of which play out to some degree in this case. No expert medical evidence was offered either in the divorce or modification proceedings, <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"138\" href=\"#p138\" id=\"p138\">*138</a>yet it is undisputed that the child has autism. Is that concession sufficient to establish the existence of a disability? After indefinite support was ordered, the child graduated from high school, obtained a bachelor's degree in both psychology and sociology, and enrolled in a master's degree program. He also lived alone during college, but with supervision by friends and family. Is this evidence of a material and substantial change? D.C.'s mother and sister testified about the care and support they and others are providing to help D.C. achieve academic success, as well as the additional expenses required to assist him. Is their testimony sufficient to establish that substantial care and supervision are necessitated by his neurological condition? D.C.'s mother testified she did not apply for Social Security disability benefits on D.C.'s behalf because receiving such benefits could impair his ability to get a job and become self-supporting when and if he completes his master's degree. In determining the amount of adult child support, the Family Code requires the trial court to consider \"other resources or programs available for the support, care, and supervision of the adult child.\"<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> How does a joint or unilateral parental decision to decline other available support factor into the analysis in a modification proceeding?</p><p id=\"p-19\">The lower courts are routinely confronted with these issues.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As discussed in the dissent of a different case, the nature and quantum of proof has varied significantly in adult child-support cases.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This is highly problematic given the financial burden an obligation for lifetime child support imposes. Practitioners and the lower courts should be mindful of these unanswered questions when litigating section 154.302 issues. And, pending a legislative response, this Court should, in an appropriate case, give the lower courts guidance regarding how \"detailed and specific\" the evidence must be to meet section 154.302's standards.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-23\"><em>See</em> Tex.
