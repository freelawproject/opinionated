Reynolds raises three points on appeal, all of which are focused on what he claims is a dearth of evidence demonstrating that any of the structures resulted in harm to County. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Sometime before June 21, 2013, without first obtaining a building permit, Reynolds began construction on a detached garage,\n   measuring approximately forty-by-forty feet, near his home on Creasy Springs Road in Boone County, Missouri. The garage sat approximately eighteen-to-twenty feet off the edge of the paved road. After he had installed the footings and piers for the garage, his builders expressed concern about the location of a nearby power line and its potential interference with continued construction. Consequently, Reynolds contacted Boone Electric to see about having the power line relocated. When a representative from Boone Electric showed up, he advised Reynolds that, in order to obtain a permit to relocate the power line, Reynolds first needed a building permit for the garage. Accordingly, Reynolds contacted County and requested and received a building permit on June 21, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Four days after Reynolds received a building permit, Uriah Mach, a land-use planner for County, sent Reynolds an email, advising Reynolds that the garage was located too close to Creasy Springs Road\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Reynolds would need to apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance before proceeding any further.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mach did not hear back from Reynolds but followed up the email with two letters, dated July 9, 2013, and July 24, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In both letters, Mach advised Reynolds that County was taking issue with the location of his garage and that Reynolds needed to take some action to address it. Reynolds did not immediately respond to County's notifications, instead he proceeded with the completion of the garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sometime in 2015, Reynolds finally applied for a variance for the setback violations with the Board of Adjustment. The Board unanimously declined Reynolds's request. Thereafter, County demanded that Reynolds take action to bring his property into compliance with both the right-of-way and the zoning regulations, but Reynolds refused. Thereafter, County filed a petition for permanent injunction against Reynolds, alleging that Reynolds's property \"denied [County] the access to th[e] right-of-way ..., together with the land-use authority statutorily granted to [County] to establish, promulgate, and enforce zoning regulations, thereby causing [County] irreparable harm,\" and that Reynolds's actions were \"perpetual, and so [County] has no adequate remedy at law.\" County sought a permanent injunction, \"mandating that [Reynolds] comply with Boone County, Missouri zoning regulations, and that he remove the accessory building, the fence, and the satellite dish from ... the right of way area, ... the setback area, ... [and] the area in front of the main building.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, the court received testimony from Mach and a surveyor describing the\n   location of the right-of-way boundaries, the setback boundary, and the various items of Reynolds's property. The court also received testimony from Reynolds indicating that he had not been aware of his need to obtain a permit before constructing the garage, that other nearby properties appeared to be in violation of the same right-of-way and setback requirement, and that it cost Reynolds $30,000-35,000 to construct the garage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After hearing the evidence, the trial court found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Reynolds] has unlawfully constructed and maintains on his property an unlawful accessory building abutting North Creasy Springs Road, together with a fence and a satellite television receiver dish between that building and North Creasy Springs Road, all in violation of plaintiff Boone County's Ordinances and which all unlawfully encroach on the 25-foot setback area established by the Boone County Zoning Regulations and upon the Plaintiff's right of way abutting North Creasy Springs Road in front of that property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court entered a permanent injunction, requiring Reynolds to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   remove in its entirety that building, that fence, and that satellite receiver dish from the Boone County setback area and Boone County's North Creasy Springs Road Right of Way within 60 days of the date of th[e] Judgment and ... permanently restrained and enjoined [Reynolds] from building or maintaining any structures in that setback area or in that right of way in the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Reynolds appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"An action seeking injunction is an action in equity.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Greenwood v.

First, he argues that the trial court's judgment was not supported by substantial competent evidence and misapplied the law insofar as there was no evidence of irreparable injury and County had an adequate remedy at law. Second, he argues that the judgment was not supported by substantial evidence and erroneously applied the law insofar as there was no evidence of harm to County, while there was evidence of harm to Reynolds if required to remove the property; thus, the\n   balancing of equities favored Reynolds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Reynolds argues that there was no substantial evidence of interference with the rights of the public, as is required to support elements of both public nuisance and trespass causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The record supports County's entitlement to a permanent injunction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In his first point, Reynolds claims, essentially, that County failed to prove entitlement to a permanent injunction insofar as the evidence failed to establish the two elements required. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"The elements of a claim for permanent injunction include: (1) irreparable harm, and (2) lack of adequate remedy at law.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Greenwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323105,7323147\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/258/\">\n    311 S.W.3d at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Reynolds claims that County failed to adduce any evidence demonstrating either element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In cases such as this, County makes out a prima facie case for permanent injunction where it \"introduce[s] the ordinance and establishe[s] that [the] respondents' structure was located in violation of that ordinance.\"\n   <em>\n    St. Louis Cty. v. Turpin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9940327\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/672/391/#p392\">\n    672 S.W.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392 (Mo. App. E.D. 1984). By definition, \" 'prima facie evidence' means such evidence which, in law, is sufficient to satisfy the burden of proof to support a verdict in favor of the party by whom it is introduced when not rebutted by other evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

App. 1970). Here, Reynolds does not dispute that County introduced evidence of both the applicable ordinances and the location of his property in violation of those ordinances. In fact, he conceded as much in the stipulations entered as Exhibit 5, wherein he admitted that his property was located in violation of various zoning ordinances and that he refused to remove it. Reynolds never challenged the scope or applicability of any of the ordinances, nor did he challenge any of County's evidence that his property was located in violation of those ordinances or in County's right-of-way. Accordingly, his claim that the judgment granting County a permanent injunction was not based on substantial evidence is, quite simply, without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It appears that Reynolds's real challenge is to the trial court's application of the law insofar as he believes the court was required to find harm to either the public safety or health in order to find irreparable injury and that the existence of potential criminal penalties (imposition of a fine for zoning violations) constituted an adequate remedy at law for County, thus barring its right to a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"While the threat of irreparable harm and lack of an adequate remedy at law must usually be specifically shown for injunctive relief to be granted, '[w]here a trespass is recurring and would involve a multiplicity of suits an injunction will lie to restrain it.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kugler v.

App. W.D. 1995). Thus, Reynolds's claimed lack of knowledge that he needed a permit before constructing the garage is irrelevant. The same is true of his argument that other nearby properties also appeared to be in violation: \"The fact that others may be violating the ordinance\n   is no defense for appellant.\"\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8735001\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/358/681/\">\n    216 S.W.2d at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As for the money he expended constructing the garage, this fact does not tip the scales in favor of Reynolds, as he spent the money with full knowledge that his property was encroaching on the right-of-way and in violation of several zoning ordinances. At a minimum, he knew as early as June 21, 2013, that continued construction of the garage-which, at the time, consisted of only footings and piers-at that location was going to be problematic without first obtaining a variance from the Board of Adjustment. Yet Reynolds did not even seek a variance until sometime in 2015-at least a year and a half later-all the while apparently continuing construction and expending money at his own peril.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Reynolds's argument is essentially that, because County was not using the right-of-way at the time, it did not suffer any harm from the encroachment of his property upon it, while he would suffer great harm if forced to tear it down. But Reynolds's position is untenable. Accepting his theory would allow individuals to appropriate seemingly unused County property, at will, for an unlimited amount of time, rent free, unless and until County indicated a need to use the property. And, at that point, if the individual had expended a large amount of money improving the land, County would be unable to reclaim or assert its rights to the land, unless it could prove a greater harm. We are aware of no authority that would support such a patently unlawful appropriation of public land by private individuals.\n   <em>\n    Contra\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grommet v.
