At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case the defendant made a motion to dismiss the case \u201cfor failure of the state to prove the elements of the offense, namely the age of the defendant.\u201d This motion was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Thereupon the defendant \u201cover objections\u201d took the stand and testified that he was employed at McComb, Ohio, and that he at no time had returned to Findlay where the act was alleged to have occurred at 1:30 p. m. The state then moved to strike this testimony as it was in the nature of an alibi and no notice of alibi had been given. This motion the court sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">Whereupon the defense rested and renewed its motion to dismiss \u2018 \u2018 on the grounds that the state had wholly failed to prove one of the essentia] elements of the offense, namely the age of the defendant.\u201d This motion was again overruled apd the defendant found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Section 2905.30, Revised Code, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\"><em>\u201cNo </em>person eighteen years of age or over shall willfully make an indecent exposure of his person in a public place or in a place where there are other persons to be offended or annoyed thereby, * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Being \u201ceighteen years of age or over\u201d is an essential ingredient of this offense which the state must prove. <em>State </em>v. <em>Latham, </em>120 Ohio App. 176, and <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCamillo, </em>16 Ohio Opinions 2d 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The very recent case of <em>Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Boss, 16 </em>Ohio App. 2d 62, is on all fours with the case with which we are here concerned. In that ease, being a prosecution for indecent exposure, the state failed to prove that the defendant was \u201ceighteen years of age or over.\u201d That case was tried to a judge without the intervention of a jury and it was argued that the judge could observe the defendant and know from his appearance that he was over eighteen years of age. The attorney for the defendant after conviction and in argument said \u201cYour honor, the gentleman is forty-three years old he has no criminal record.\u201d However, the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County reversed and vacated the judgment of conviction and dismissed the defendant, holding that the state had failed to prove one of the essential ingredients or elements of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">In our present case we hold that proving the defendant was \u201ceighteen years of age or over\u201d was an essential part of the state\u2019s case and, the state having failed to sustain this burden, the judgment of the trial court must be reversed and vacated and the defendant ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b184-9\">Guernsey, P.
