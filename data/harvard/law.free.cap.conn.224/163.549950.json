The defendant, James E. Milton, was charged by a substitute information with, inter alia, the crimes of possession of narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a), possession of a sawed-off shotgun in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-211 (a) and possession of a machine gun in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-202 (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following the defendant\u2019s conviction by a jury on those three counts,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court sentenced him to a total effective term of twenty-two years imprisonment. The defendant appealed to the Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>late Court, which affirmed the judgment against him. <em>State </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>26 Conn. App. 698, 603 A.2d 750 (1992). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal to this court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and now affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Neither in the Appellate Court nor in this court has the defendant challenged the validity of any aspect of the trial that led to his conviction on the charges filed against him. His appeal has focused instead on the denial of his motion to dismiss those charges, which was premised on the failure of correctional officers, while he was incarcerated on other charges in correctional facilities at Somers, Enfield, Cheshire or Bridgeport, to notify him of his speedy trial rights under General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The opinion of the Appellate Court recites the facts underlying the defendant's motion to dismiss. The defendant was arrested on the charges underlying the present conviction on July 15, 1989. <em>State </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>supra, 700. He began serving a sentence at Somers on an unrelated charge on December 20, 1989, and was thereafter transferred to other intrastate correctional facilities. Id. He filed the motion to dismiss the present charges on July 25,1990, while he was still serving his earlier sentence. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">When state correctional officials know that a prisoner in their custody is subject to an untried information, \u00a7 54-82c obligates them to notify the prisoner of the pendency of the charges against him and to inform him of his right to request a speedy disposition of those charges. The Appellate Court meticulously examined the relevant statutes, case law and facts, and concluded that the correctional officials had failed to comply with these statutory obligations. Id., 705-12. That conclusion is not at issue in the appeal in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Having determined the existence of a statutory violation, the Appellate Court considered whether the trial court was required to dismiss the charges of which the correctional officials had failed to notify the defendant. The court conscientiously considered the inferences to be drawn from the express provision of a remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>of dismissal for a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-82d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the absence of a similar remedy in \u00a7 54-82c. Id., 712-13. It carefully examined our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 89, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989), in which we held, in similar circumstances, that violation of the notice provisions of the Interstate Detainer Act, General Statutes \u00a7 54-186, did not automatically require a dismissal of the relevant charges. As we did in <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, the Appellate Court applied, by analogy, the balancing principles that the United States Supreme Court established in <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972), as the appropriate remedy for a deprivation of the constitutional right to a speedy trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>supra, 712-13. The Appellate Court then undertook a painstaking examination of the four factors that form the matrix of an analysis under <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>supra, and concluded that, despite the serious violation of the defendant\u2019s statutory rights to notice, the trial court had properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>supra, 713-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In his appeal in this court, the defendant continues to maintain that dismissal of the charges is the only proper remedy for a failure by correctional officials to notify an inmate of criminal charges that are pending against him. If dismissal is not automatically required, he does not, however, challenge the applicability of the <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>analysis that the Appellate Court undertook or the results of that court\u2019s <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>analysis in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>As he did in the Appellate Court, the defendant makes a twofold argument to support his contention that dismissal of the charges is the only available remedy for a serious violation of \u00a7 54-82c. First, he infers that such a remedy is required because of the policy objectives of the Intrastate Detainer Act. Second, he distinguishes our invocation of the <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>test in <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, on the ground that the injury he sustained by not receiving notice is categorically different from the injury inflicted on the defendant in <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, who obtained belated notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Both of these arguments were fully considered and properly resolved against the defendant in the well reasoned opinion of the Appellate Court. Id., 712-13, and see especially n.6. Having examined the record on appeal and studied the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained in the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a) provides: \u201cpenalty for illegal possession.
