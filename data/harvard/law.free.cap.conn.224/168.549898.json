J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqX\">The principal issue in this appeal is the constitutionality of General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-245, now codified as \u00a7 17a-567,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which requires a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>trial judge to follow the presentence report of the Whiting Forensic Institute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Whiting or the institute) advising against commitment of a convicted defendant to the institute. The defendant, Patrick Campbell, was charged with two counts of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Dean, J., </em>accepted his pleas of guilty to both counts under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to sentencing, the defendant successfully moved for a psychiatric examination by the Whiting staff, as provided for in General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-244, now codified as \u00a7 17a-566,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>mine his suitability for treatment at Whiting. The Whiting diagnostic unit\u2019s subsequent report advised against the defendant\u2019s commitment to Whiting and recommended a sentence in accordance with his conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The defendant filed a motion to correct on the ground that the commitment scheme in \u00a7 17-245 violated his constitutional rights. The trial court, <em>Bingham, J., </em>denied the motion, and sentenced the defendant to concurrent terms of imprisonment of forty-five years. The defendant appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to correct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">According to the factual statement made by the state at the time the defendant pleaded guilty, the defendant killed his parents, Kenneth and Anna Mae Campbell, with a sledgehammer at their house in Darien on July 1,1987. After killing them, the defendant took his parents\u2019 bodies to a wooded area behind the house, doused them with gasoline, and set them on fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Whiting undertook a psychiatric examination of the defendant in response to his motion for such an examination pursuant to \u00a7 17-244. In a preliminary diagnostic report, the courts diagnostic clinic of the department of mental health recommended that the examination pursuant to \u00a7 17-244 (a) begin as soon as bed space at Whiting became available. Whiting examined the defendant from November 8, 1988, through January 17, 1989. After comprehensive psychological testing, medical examination, review of reports of previously conducted psychological and psychiatric evaluations, and behavioral observation, Whiting issued its recommendation. Whiting advised the court to sentence the defendant in accordance with his conviction and not to commit him to Whiting because, although he was \u201cdangerous to himself and others,\u201d \u201c[t]here is no evidence of psychosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Before the court acted on Whiting's recommendation, on May 19,1989, the defendant filed a motion to correct, claiming that, insofar as \u00a7 17-245 precluded the trial court from rejecting the recommendation, the statute was unconstitutional and, therefore, \u201cany disposition of the defendant\u2019s case . . . would be illegal.\u201d Specifically, the defendant argued that \u00a7 17-245 violated: (1) the separation of powers provision of the Connecticut constitution; (2) the due process provisions of the Connecticut and United States constitutions; and (3) the equal protection provisions of the Connecticut and United States constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">After an evidentiary hearing, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to challenge the recommendation of the Whiting report and to hold a further hearing to consider the validity of Whiting\u2019s conclusions. The court upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 17-245, and construed that provision to preclude the further hearing sought by the defendant. The court then sentenced the defendant to a term of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In this appeal, the defendant reiterates the constitutional claims that he raised in the trial court. He continues to challenge the validity of \u00a7 17-245 under the constitutional law of separation of powers, due process and equal protection. He does not, however, maintain that he has been deprived of a prisoner\u2019s right to receive mental health treatment. At stake here is solely his contention that he has a constitutional right to a judicial determination of whether, in lieu of incarceration, he should be committed to Whiting upon order of the trial judge at the time of sentencing, contrary to Whiting\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">In ruling on the constitutional challenge to \u00a7 17-245 raised in the defendant\u2019s motion to correct, the trial court interpreted \u00a7 17-245 to preclude a hearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>accuracy of the Whiting report and to prohibit issuance of an order committing the defendant to Whiting in light of the report\u2019s recommendation against such commitment. Our inquiry must begin with whether \u00a7 17-245, properly construed, embodies such a restriction, because only if it does will we need to address the defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to that provision. \u201cEstablished wisdom counsels us to exercise self-restraint so as to eschew unnecessary determinations of constitutional questions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>Beverly Enterprises-Connecticut, Inc., </em>209 Conn. 692, 706, 553 A.2d 596 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The trial court looked to the specific language of \u00a7 17-245 to support its conclusion that the statute prohibits judicial supervision of a Whiting recommendation against commitment for treatment of a convicted criminal defendant. The pertinent statutory language distinguishes sharply between recommendations <em>for </em>commitment to Whiting and recommendations <em>against </em>commitment to Whiting. A recommendation <em>for </em>confinement at Whiting requires a further judicial hearing and authorizes the trial court thereafter either to sentence the defendant in accordance with the conviction or to order him committed to Whiting.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By contrast, a recommendation <em>against </em>confinement at Whiting and for sentencing in accordance with a conviction requires that \u201cthe defendant shall be returned directly to the court for disposition.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-245 (a). Subsection (c) of \u00a7 17-245 provides explicitly that \u201cno court may order [confinement in Whiting] if the report does not recommend confinement at the institute.\u201d In light of these categorical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>legislative directives, we agree with the trial court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 17-245 (a). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>190 Conn. 327, 343, 461 A.2d 947, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 938, 104 S. Ct. 350, 78 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In light of our construction of \u00a7 17-245, we now proceed to the defendant\u2019s constitutional attacks on \u00a7 17-245. A party challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the heavy burden of establishing its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>222 Conn. 799, 810, 611 A.2d 400 (1992); <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 590, 590 A.2d 447 (1991); <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>217 Conn. 671, 675, 587 A.2d 1014 (1991); <em>Zapata </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>207 Conn. 496, 508, 542 A.2d 700 (1988). The court will indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality and, when interpreting a statute, will search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature's underlying intent. <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>supra, 675-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The defendant\u2019s first constitutional challenge alleges that \u00a7 17-245 violates the separation of powers provisions of the constitution of Connecticut, articles second and fifth.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> His separation of powers argument has two components: (1) \u00a7 17-245 impermissibly withholds sentencing discretion from the judiciary, and instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>places that discretion in the executive branch; and (2) \u00a7 17-245 impermissibly delegates a legislative function to the executive branch by vesting Whiting with the authority to determine, without guidelines and without the possibility of review, what it means to \u201crequire custody, care and treatment.\u201d We disagree with both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Because the powers of the three branches of government inevitably overlap, this court has \u201cconsistently held that the doctrine of the separation of powers cannot be applied rigidly\u201d; <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>supra, 676; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>157 Conn. 150, 155, 251 A.2d 49 (1968); and has \u201crefused to find constitutional impropriety in a statute simply because it affects the judicial function . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>supra; <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; Trantolo, </em>190 Conn. 510, 522, 461 A.2d 938 (1983). \u201cA statute violates the constitutional mandate for a separate judicial magistracy only if it represents an effort by the legislature to exercise a power which lies exclusively under the control of the courts . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In accordance with these principles, a two part inquiry has emerged to evaluate the constitutionality of a statute that is alleged to violate separation of powers principles by impermissibly infringing on the judicial authority. See <em>University of Connecticut Chapter, AAUP </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>200 Conn. 386, 394-95, 512 A.2d 152 (1986); <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; Trantolo, </em>supra, 522; <em>State </em>v. <em>Darden, </em>171 Conn. 677, 679, 372 A.2d 99 (1976). A statute will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>held unconstitutional on those grounds if: (1) it governs subject matter that not only falls within the judicial power, but also lies exclusively within judicial control; or (2) it significantly interferes with the orderly functioning of the Superior Court\u2019s judicial role. <em>University of Connecticut Chapter, AAUP </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>supra, 394-95; <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; Trantolo, </em>supra, 522-23; <em>State </em>v. <em>Darden, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Although the defendant makes no claim that \u00a7 17-245 interferes with the orderly functioning of the Superior Court, he does claim that \u00a7 17-245 involves a subject, the sentencing of criminal defendants, that lies exclusively within the judicial power. Although the judiciary unquestionably has power over criminal sentencing, the defendant\u2019s claim fails because the judiciary does not have exclusive authority in that area. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Darden, </em>supra, 680, this court sustained the legislature\u2019s creation of mandatory minimum sentences, holding that sentencing is not within the exclusive control of the judiciary and that there is no constitutional requirement that courts be given discretion in imposing sentences. Moreover, we have held it proper to construe broadly a remedial statute designed to curb the \u201cill effects stemming from wide judicial discretion in sentencing prisoners for similar offenses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>220 Conn. 400, 404, 599 A.2d 738 (1991).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The defendant also contends that \u00a7 17-245 violates separation of powers principles because it unconstitutionally delegates sentencing authority to Whiting, an administrative agency. The defendant argues that \u00a7 17-245 is unconstitutionally vague and improperly authorizes an administrative body to devise the standards by which to determine who \u201crequire[s] custody, care and treatment at the institute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s delegation claim with the proposition that \u201cit is inherent in this separation [of powers], since the law-making function is vested exclusively in the legislative department, that the Legislature cannot delegate the law-making power to any other department or agency.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>126 Conn. 623, 627, 13 A.2d 586 (1940). We have held, however, that the legislature may expressly authorize an administrative agency to \u201cfill up the details\u201d of a law. Id., 628. \u201cIn order to render admissible such delegation of legislative power, however, it is necessary that the statute declare a legislative policy, establish primary standards for carrying it out, or lay down an intelligible principle to which the administrative officer or body must conform . . . .\u2019\u2019Id.; see also <em>Bottone </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>209 Conn. 652, 659, 553 A.2d 576 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim that \u00a7 17-245 contains constitutionally inadequate standards to guide Whiting\u2019s determination of whether a defendant is a suitable candidate for commitment to the institute at the time of sentencing, that statutory provision is accompanied by guidelines to advise the Whiting staff of what it must consider in making its determination. Section 17-244 (d) (3) requires that the Whiting report contain, inter alia, \u201can opinion as to whether the diag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>nosis and prognosis demonstrate clearly that the defendant is actually dangerous to himself or others and requires custody, care and treatment at the institute.\u201d By focusing on the \u201cdiagnosis and prognosis,\u201d this provision directs the Whiting staff to base its recommendation on medical data and on its medical expertise. The provision also advises that the underlying medical information must \u201cdemonstrate clearly\u201d that the defendant should be committed, giving the Whiting staff a standard by which it must measure the certainty of its conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The test for constitutionally sufficient standards to govern the exercise of delegated powers requires only that the standards be \u201cas definit[e] as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>University of Connecticut Chapter, AAUP </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>supra, 398. In that case, we rejected an argument that General Statutes \u00a7 4-85 (b), which authorized the governor to reduce budgetary allotments when there was \u201ca change of circumstances\u201d or when he \u201cdeems necessary,\u201d contained constitutionally deficient standards to guide the governor\u2019s exercise of delegated power. See also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Connecticut Product Development Corporation, </em>167 Conn. 111, 120, 355 A.2d 72 (1974). We recognized the risk that excessive judicial insistence on specificity could \u201champer the flexibility needed\u201d for the governor to fulfill his duties. <em>University of Connecticut Chapter, AAUP </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>supra, 399. Applying the test in this case, we hold that the statutory standards contained in \u00a7\u00a7 17-244 and 17-245 are as definite as is reasonably practicable and are, therefore, constitutionally sufficient to guide Whiting\u2019s exercise of its delegated power. Because the exercise of discretion by Whiting involves medical diagnoses, it was reasonable for the legislature to set out in \u00a7\u00a7 17-244 and 17-245 merely general guidelines to govern Whiting\u2019s determination of a defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ant\u2019s need for care, custody and treatment at the institute. We, therefore, reject the defendant\u2019s separation of powers claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The defendant argues, in his second constitutional claim, that \u00a7 17-245 violates his right to due process under the state<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and federal constitutions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant urges reconsideration of <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, where we held that, under federal due process principles, \u201cno constitutionally protected liberty interest was implicated by the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant the defendant\u2019s request for a hearing on the report filed by the Whiting Forensic Institute.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., 341. Moreover, the defendant maintains that \u00a7 17-245<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> unconstitutionally deprives him of the right to submit information to correct or contest presentence material submitted to the trial court by the state. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Due process analysis begins with the identification of the life, liberty or property interest at stake. In this case, the defendant has alleged that he has a liberty interest that entitles him to a judicial determination of his need for mental health treatment at Whiting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>lieu of incarceration. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 336.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To determine whether \u00a7 17-245 unconstitutionally deprives him of that interest, we must decide whether the defendant has established that: (1) the liberty interest falls within the protection of the due process clause; (2) he has been deprived of that interest; and (3) the deprivation has occurred without due process of law. <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>222 Conn. 233, 241, 610 A.2d 574 (1992); see <em>also Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 336-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u201cLiberty interests protected by the Fourteenth Amendment may arise from two sources\u2014the Due Process Clause itself and the laws of the States.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 337. We first consider whether the defendant has a constitutionally protected liberty interest derived from the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">As a general matter, \u201cgiven a valid conviction, the criminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of his liberty to the extent that the State may confine him ... so long as the conditions of confinement do not otherwise violate the Constitution.\u201d <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 224, 96 S. Ct. 2532, 49 L. Ed. 2d 451, reh. denied, 429 U.S. 873, 97 S. Ct. 191, 50 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1976). As long as the confinement is otherwise constitutional, therefore, a defendant has no due process right to be sentenced to a particular type of facility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The defendant maintains, however, that his confinement in prison does \u201cotherwise violate the constitution\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>because it violates the eighth amendment<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> guarantee of \u201creasonable medical treatment, including psychiatric care.\u201d This argument cannot succeed, however, because it assumes that access to psychiatric care requires immediate commitment to Whiting rather than incarceration. Inmates committed to the commissioner of correction may avail themselves of voluntary commitment for psychiatric treatment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-513. As the defendant conceded at oral argument, if the defendant were improperly denied such treatment, he could seek relief in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The defendant\u2019s incarceration, therefore, accords with eighth amendment requirements and does not \u201cotherwise violate the Constitution.\u201d Mea<em>chum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>supra, 224. Accordingly, he has no liberty interest derived from the due process clause in obtaining treatment at Whiting instead of being incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s contention that state law creates such a liberty interest. In order to prevail, the defendant must show that the state statute creates a right to treatment at Whiting instead of imprisonment or creates a justifiable expectation that such treatment will be afforded to him. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 340. Section 17-245 authorizes the Whiting officials who issue the report to recommend any one of four options: commitment to Whiting; sentencing in accordance with the conviction; probation; or probation conditioned on receipt of outpatient psychiatric treatment. The trial court thereafter has discretion to reject or accept the Whiting recommendation, unless it advises against commitment, in which case the recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>tion is binding.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In light of the number and variety of these courses of action that may be taken by the Whiting staff and the trial court, we hold that \u00a7 17-245 does not create either a right to treatment at Whiting in lieu of incarceration or a justifiable expectation of receiving such treatment. This holding comports with our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, where we determined that \u00a7\u00a7 17-244 and 17-245 neither create a right to be placed either in outpatient therapy or in Whiting nor give rise to a justifiable expectation that one of these two options will be chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Because the defendant has no liberty interest in obtaining mental health treatment at Whiting in lieu of imprisonment, we conclude that his due process claim has no merit.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We hold, therefore, that although the legislature may choose, as a matter of policy, to afford a hearing to those excluded from Whiting at the presentence stage, such a hearing is not constitutionally required.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Finally, the defendant claims that \u00a7 17-245 violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> because it arbitrarily treats convicted defendants who have not yet been sentenced differently from civilians and sentenced defendants regarding mental health treatment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u201cThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, which is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985); <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>211 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>591, 596, 560 A.2d 444 (1989); <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>210 Conn. 462, 473, 556 A.2d 145 (1989). Social and economic legislation will generally be held to violate the equal protection clause only if the classification drawn by the statute is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. See <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>supra, 439-40. The general rule gives way if a state law affects fundamental rights guaranteed by the federal constitution, or invidiously discriminates against a suspect class, and courts will sustain such laws only if they are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. See id., 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The defendant argues that strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard under which to review the subject classification because \u00a7 17-245 affects his fundamental rights to medical and psychiatric care under the eighth amendment, to life under the due process clause, and to a judicial determination of mental illness.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We have rejected, supra, the defendant\u2019s contention that he possesses the latter two rights, and they, therefore, cannot serve as the basis for undertaking strict scrutiny review of the allegedly unconstitutional classification drawn by \u00a7 17-245. Moreover, we decline to address the defendant\u2019s argument that the alleged fundamental eighth amendment right to psychiatric care entitles him to a strict scrutiny review of the classification because we conclude that, regardless of the standard of review, the defendant\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">First, the defendant claims that, under \u00a7 17-245 and General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-251, now codified as \u00a7 17a-570,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> convicts who have not yet been sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tenced, the class<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> of which he is a member, have the opportunity to be committed to Whiting in lieu of incarceration and, upon release from the institute, to be returned to the community regardless of the original sentence. By contrast, under General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-194e, now codified as \u00a7 17a-515,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> prisoners who are committed to a mental health center after sentencing must be returned to the custody of the commissioner of correction upon release from commitment. Although these provisions afford different treatment to different classes of individuals, the defendant, as a convict who has not yet been sentenced, is a member of the advantaged class. Because he is not aggrieved by this disparity in treatment, he has no standing to challenge it. See <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Horwitch, </em>215 Conn. 469, 473, 576 A.2d 1280 (1990) (requiring claimant to make a \u201ccolorable claim of direct injury he has suffered or is likely to suffer, in an individual or representative capacity\u201d); <em>Shaskan </em>v. <em>Waltham Industries Corporation, </em>168 Conn. 43, 49, 357 A.2d 472 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Second, the defendant compares civilians subject to commitment under General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7\u00a7 17-177 and 17-178, now codified as \u00a7\u00a7 17a-497 and 17a-498, with sentenced prisoners seeking voluntary-commitment under General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-194c, now codified as \u00a7 17a-513. Because the defendant is not a member of either of these classes of persons, however, he has no standing to challenge any disparity in their treatment. <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Horwitch, </em>supra; cf. <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>493 U.S. 474, 476-77, 110 S.

We understand this as an argument that \u00a7 17-245 unconstitutionally affords different treatment to the class of those for whom Whiting recommends in favor of commitment as compared to the class of those for whom Whiting recommends against commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim because the two groups are not similarly situated, as is required in an equal protection claim. <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>supra, 473. When Whiting recommends in favor of commitment of a defendant, the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected liberty interests are implicated because an involuntary commitment works \u201c \u2018a \u201cmajor change in the conditions of confinement\u201d amounting to a \u201cgrievous loss\u201d. . . .\u2019 \u201d See <em>Vitek </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>445 U.S. 480, 492, 100 S.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 341. This fundamental distinction between the two groups makes the defendant\u2019s equal protection claim unsustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In this opinion Borden, Norcott and Santaniello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-245, now recodified as \u00a7 17a-567, provides: \u201c(a) If the report recommends that the defendant be sentenced in accordance with the conviction, placed on probation by the court or placed on probation by the court with the requirement, as a condition of such probation, that he receive outpatient psychiatric treatment, the defendant shall be returned directly to the court for disposition.

The defendant has cited <em>People </em>v. <em>Navarro, </em>7 Cal. 3d 248, 497 P.2d 481, 102 Cal. Rptr. 137 (1972); <em>Esteybar </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>5 Cal. 3d 119, 485 P.2d 1140, 95 Cal. Rptr. 524 (1971); <em>People </em>v. <em>Tenorio, </em>3 Cal. 3d 89, 473 P.2d 993, 89 Cal. Rptr. 249 (1970). Of these, only <em>People </em>v. <em>Navarro, </em>supra, involved a separation of powers claim relating to sentencing. In that case, the California court determined that a state statute violated the state constitution because it conferred initial discretion on a court to sentence a defendant to a drug rehabilitation program, yet authorized the prosecutor thereafter to disapprove such a commitment. Id., 259. The California statute thus conditioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>an otherwise broad grant of discretion to the judiciary on approval by a person who is not only a member of the executive branch, but also an adversary.

The defendant has not alleged in this court or elsewhere that his receipt of treatment at Whiting in lieu of incarceration is necessary for his very survival. Accordingly, his interest, as was the defendant\u2019s interest in <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>190 Conn. 327, 336, 461 A.2d 947, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 938, 104 S. Ct. 350, 78 L.

Although the federal constitution does guarantee certain limited procedural safeguards against receiving a sentence based on material misinformation; A. Spinella, Connecticut Criminal Procedure (1985) p. 748; that guarantee is inapplicable here because the Whiting recommendation against commitment in lieu of incarceration is not a sentence. We therefore read this claim as, in effect, a claim that he has a right to a hearing on the WTiiting report. Because we hold that the defendant has no liberty interest in obtaining mental health treatment at Whiting in lieu of incarceration and, therefore, is entitled to no process before being denied such treatment, we reject his contention that he is constitutionally entitled to an opportunity to present evidence at a hearing to contest the report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b206-8\"> The defendant\u2019s due process argument reflects a misunderstanding of the line of cases on which he relies for the proposition that he is entitled to a hearing on the Wanting report.

Ct. 1254, 63 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1980), which held that due process requires a hearing before state officials may involuntarily transfer a prisoner from a prison to a state mental hospital. That holding, however, was driven by the perceived stigma associated with mental health treatment. Indeed, although involuntary transfer from one prison to another prison implicates no liberty interest; <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 225, 96 S. Ct. 2532, 49 L.

The Whiting report is a \u201csentencing aid to the court\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 341; that plays an important role in the sentencing of defendants like Patrick Campbell. Accordingly, the defendant is entitled to a hearing before the trial court for the determination of whether he meets Whiting\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Relying on <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>supra, this court holds that the Whiting report does not implicate a liberty interest protected by the due process clause.

The conviction has sufficiently extinguished the defendant\u2019s liberty interest to empower the State to confine him in any of its prisons.\u201d The court\u2019s reliance on <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>supra, however, is misplaced because the defendant in that case had already been sentenced and imprisoned; he sought only to require a hearing before the state moved him from one institution to another.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a later case, <em>Vitek </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>v. <em>Jones, </em>445 U.S. 480, 493, 100 S. Ct. 1254, 63 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1980), Justice White, who also wrote the majority opinion in <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>supra, clarified that it is \u201ca valid criminal conviction <em>and prison sentence </em>[that] extinguish a defendant\u2019s right to freedom from confinement. . . . Such a conviction <em>and sentence </em>sufficiently extinguish a defendant\u2019s liberty to \u2018empower the State to confine him in any of its prisons.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Whiting\u2019s report and recommendation are an important part of the sentencing process itself, a process to which due process protections apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">I also believe that a liberty interest arises under the state statutory scheme authorizing Whiting. Section 17a-561 provides in part: \u201cThe Whiting Forensic Institute shall exist for the care and treatment of . . . persons convicted of any offense enumerated in section 17a-566 who, after examination by the staff of the diagnostic unit of the institute as herein provided, are determined to be mentally ill and dangerous to themselves or others and to require custody, care and treatment at the institute . . . .\u201d Murder, \u201can offense for which the penalty may be imprisonment in the Connecticut Correctional Institution at Somers\u201d is among the offenses enumerated in \u00a7 17a-566. Under the statutory scheme, a defendant who is found to be mentally ill and dangerous to himself or others, meets the Whiting criteria and should be sentenced to Whiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The legislative history of the Whiting statutory scheme, which establishes Whiting as a sentencing alternative, reinforces the expectation that a defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>ant who meets the criteria will be sentenced to Whiting. \u201cStrong support for a hospital to treat mentally ill persons who commit crimes . . . was demonstrated before the legislature. Among those who appeared before the legislature in 1957 to urge the adoption of legislation to establish Whiting was former Chief Justice William M. Maltbie, who urged that there be a hospital for a person \u2018who has committed a crime because of some mental weakness perhaps, because of some emotional disturbance or because there is in his mind some fence which the ordinary practices of cure of the criminal cannot by any possibility reach.\u2019 Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, 1957 Sess., Pt. 2, p. 511.\u201d <em>In re Michael B., </em>41 Conn. Sup. 229, 242, 566 A.2d 446 (1989).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Under the statutory scheme of Whiting, a defendant who is <em>mentally ill and dangerous </em>has a justifiable expectation of confinement at Whiting and therefore a liberty interest protected by the due process clause.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Section 17a-561 furnishes a strong basis for believing that the Whiting staff will recommend commitment if a defendant meets the criteria listed above. Nevertheless, the statute does not provide a hearing for the defendant to test the conclusions of Whiting. The fact that the statutory scheme does not provide adequate procedural protections to ensure that the Whiting staff follow the purpose of \u00a7 17a-561 does not make the defendant\u2019s expectation of due process unjustifiable. Due process rights created by statute may not be defined by, or conditioned on, the legislature\u2019s choice of procedures for their deprivation. <em>Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 541, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L.

According to the Court, a liberty interest may \u2018originate in the Constitution\u2019 . . . or it may have \u2018its roots in state law.\u2019 . . . Apart from those two possible origins, the Court is unable to find that a person has a constitutionally protected interest in liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">\u201cIf a man were a creature of the state, the analysis would be correct. But neither the Bill of Rights nor the laws of sovereign States create the liberty which the Due Process Clause protects. The relevant constitutional provisions are limitations on the power of the sovereign to infringe on the liberty of the citizen. The relevant state laws either create property rights, or they curtail the freedom of the citizen who must live in an ordered society. Of course, law is essential to the exercise and enjoyment of individual liberty in a complex society. But it is not the source of liberty, and surely not the exclusive source.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">\u201cI had thought it self-evident that all men were endowed by their Creator with liberty as one of the cardinal unalienable rights.

The sentencing alternative could have made a significant difference in this case, in which the defendant was sentenced to two concurrent terms of forty-five years. If the report had recommended that the defendant be confined to Whiting, a hearing would have been held pursuant to \u00a7 17a-567 (b). If, as a result of the hearing, the defendant was found \u201cmentally ill and dangerous to himself or others and to require custody, care and treatment\u201d at Whiting, the trial court would have been mandated to sentence him according to his conviction <em>and </em>to order confinement at Whiting. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-567 (c). Once confined to Whiting for treatment, a defendant\u2019s institutional confinement becomes subject to the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-569 and 17a-570. Section 17a-569 provides in pertinent part: \u201cNot less than once every six months the staff of the institute shall give a complete psychiatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>examination to every patient confined in the institute. . . . The record of the examination may include a recommendation for transfer of the patient or change in confinement status.\u201d Section 17a-570 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) As soon as is practicable the director shall act upon the examination reports of his staff. Upon review of each report and upon consideration of what is for the benefit of the patient and for the benefit of society, the director shall determine that such patient: (1) Remain in the institute for further treatment or be transferred to some other facility ... or (2), if such patient is under commitment, be granted a leave of absence or extended visit or (3) has sufficiently improved to warrant his discharge from the institute . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">In the present case, the majority holds that notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s substantial offer of proof of his mental illness, he was not entitled to be heard before the court and confinement in Whiting was foreclosed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b217-12\"> \u201cIn <em>Vitek </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>445 U.S. 480, 491 [100 S. Ct. 1254, 63 L. Ed. 2d 552] (1980), we pointed out that \u2018minimum [procedural] requirements [are] a matter of federal law, they are not diminished by the fact that the State may have specified its own procedures that it may deem adequate for determining the preconditions to adverse official action.\u2019 This conclusion was reiterated in <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 432 [102 S. Ct. 1148, 71 L.

If a clearer holding is needed, we provide it today. The point is straightforward: the Due Process Clause provides that certain substantive rights\u2014life, liberty, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>property\u2014cannot be deprived except pursuant to constitutionally adequate procedures.
