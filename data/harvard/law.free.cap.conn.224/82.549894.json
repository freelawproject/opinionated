The commission had denied Upjohn\u2019s applications seeking an excavation permit, a fill permit and two site plan approvals, in connection with its plan for permanent storage and closure of a solid sludge hazardous waste pile located on Upjohn\u2019s property on Sackett Point Road in North Haven. Upjohn claims that the trial court improperly: (1) determined that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that Upjohn\u2019s storage of the waste was not an accessory use permitted by the town\u2019s zoning regulations; and (2) concluded that federal law did not preempt the commission from denying Upjohn\u2019s applications. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">This appeal comes to us after related federal litigation between the same parties involving some of the same issues. <em>See North Haven Planning &amp; Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co., </em>753 F. Sup. 423 (D. Conn.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>(North Haven I), </em>aff\u2019d, 921 F.2d 27 (2d Cir. 1990) <em>(North Haven </em>II), cert. denied, U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 2016, 114 L. Ed. 2d 102 (1991). In light of the record in this case and the facts found in the federal court, the following facts are undisputed for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In 1962, Upjohn began to produce synthetic organic chemicals at its manufacturing site located on the banks of the Quinnipiac River in North Haven. Wastewater is a byproduct of this manufacturing process. In 1968, Upjohn began to channel the wastewater through a series of l\u00e1goons in order to permit solids to settle before the water was discharged into the river. Upjohn dredged the solid waste material, known as sludge, that had accumulated in the lagoons and, in 1973, began to place this solid waste material on its property near a lagoon that contained an aeration device. The resulting sludge pile, which is the subject of this litigation, consists of a number of chemical materials that are classified as hazardous waste under the Federal Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901 et seq. By 1977, the sludge pile covered approximately 4.25 acres, and by 1985 it stood approximately forty feet high and contained approximately 83,000 cubic yards of sludge.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Some time during the late 1970s, the commission became aware of the manner in which Upjohn was disposing of its sludge. Numerous communications between the parties followed regarding Upjohn\u2019s waste-water treatment and disposal system. In 1983, the commission granted Upjohn\u2019s application for permits to improve its wastewater treatment system, subject to numerous conditions, one of which was that Upjohn submit a plan and timetable for the removal of all existing sludge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>After a partial collapse of the pile in April, 1985, Upjohn removed approximately 27,000 tons of the sludge off-site, implemented a treatment system that significantly reduced the amount of waste material produced, and stopped placing additional sludge on the pile. Thereafter, Upjohn hired Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. (Pirnie), an environmental consulting firm, to evaluate the various ways of addressing the environmental issues posed by the sludge pile. Pirnie developed a plan for capping the pile in two stages: adding six inches of gravel; and then replacing the gravel layer with two feet of vegetated cover soil and a synthetic membrane.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under this plan, the capped sludge pile and the subsurface groundwater were to be monitored for hazardous waste leachate for thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In 1989, the commission and its zoning enforcement officer sued Upjohn in the Superior Court to enjoin Upjohn from implementing the plan to cap the sludge pile, and to require Upjohn to remove the sludge. Upjohn removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, and counterclaimed to enjoin the commission from enforcing any local regulations prohibiting Upjohn from implementing its plan and its new wastewater treatment system. After a full trial, the federal court, <em>Daly, J., </em>granted in part the relief sought by the commission by enjoining Upjohn \u201cfrom implementing its temporary or final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>closure plan of the . . . sludge pile until such time as it has obtained the necessary permits from the [commission,\u201d and denied the relief sought by Upjohn. <em>North Haven I, </em>supra, 432. Upjohn appealed, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>North Haven II, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Thereafter, Upjohn filed the applications involved in this case. The applications sought to implement Upjohn\u2019s plan to install a permanent cap on the sludge pile and to close it in a manner that would leave it permanently on the property. After a full public hearing, the commission denied the applications for the stated reason that the sludge pile constituted an ongoing zoning violation. Upjohn appealed to the trial court, which dismissed the appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Upjohn first claims that the trial court improperly concluded that there was sufficient evidence in the record from which the commission could have determined that the permanent on-site storage of solid sludge hazardous waste was not an accessory use permitted under North Haven\u2019s zoning regulations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">This claim arises in the following procedural context. Upjohn\u2019s property is located in an industrial IG-80 zone. Chemical manufacturing is a permitted use in that zone. The sole basis of Upjohn\u2019s applications to the commission, and the sole basis upon which it argued to the commission in support of its applications, was that the use contemplated by the applications, namely, the permanent on-site storage of the sludge pile, was a permitted use under \u00a7 3.27.2.24 of the zoning regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Upjohn did not claim before the commission that the sludge pile was an accessory use incidental to its permitted use of chemical manufacturing in an industrial IG-80 zone, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 6.1 and 6.1.71 of the zoning regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the commission had no occasion to consider whether the sludge pile constituted such an accessory use.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On appeal to the trial court, however, Upjohn claimed, among other things, that the commission had acted arbitrarily, capriciously and in excess of its statutory powers because the maintenance of the sludge pile was an accessory use incidental to Upjohn\u2019s permitted use of chemical manufacturing in an industrial IG-80 zone. Upjohn argued that the pile therefore did not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>stitute a zoning violation as claimed by the commission. In response, the trial court found that \u201cUpjohn was well aware . . . that the Commission considered the sludge pile a use not authorized by the zoning regulations. Upjohn had ample opportunity to present any evidence to establish that the use was in fact a permitted accessory use but did not do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The trial court also concluded that the \u201cevidence on the record supports the determination that the maintenance of a four-acre sludge pile does not constitute an accessory use pursuant to \u00a7 6.1.71 of the regulations, which permits \u2018accessory uses customarily incidental to a permitted use on the same premises.\u2019 \u201d Upjohn seizes on this second, alternative holding of the trial court as the basis of its claim in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Upjohn argues that the trial court\u2019s judgment must be reversed because there is no evidence in the administrative record to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201crecord supports the determination that the maintenance of . . . [the] sludge pile does not constitute an accessory use\u201d under the regulations. Upjohn\u2019s argument, however, turns an applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">We first note that the trial court concluded that \u201c[cjontrary to Upjohn\u2019s argument, the fact that North Haven permits some waste storage upon prior application and approval pursuant to \u00a7 3.27.2.24 of its zoning regulations does not entitle Upjohn to approval of its decision to create and to make permanent a pile of waste for which approval was neither sought nor granted.\u201d The trial court rejected on its merits, therefore, the only basis for maintenance of the sludge pile that Upjohn had presented to the commission, namely, that the pile was permitted under \u00a7 3.27.2.24. Upjohn has not challenged that conclusion in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>In general terms, an accessory use is a use that is customary and incidental to a permitted primary use. It is dependent on or pertains to the primary use. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 509, 511-12, 264 A.2d 552 (1969). Whether a particular use qualifies as an accessory use is ordinarily a question of fact for the zoning authority, to be determined by it \u201cwith a liberal discretion.\u201d Id., 513-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Upjohn was the applicant before the commission and therefore had the burden of persuading the commission that it was entitled to the permits that it sought. See <em>Garibaldi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>163 Conn. 235, 239, 303 A.2d 743 (1972). If Upjohn wished to claim that it was entitled to approval of its applications because its sludge pile was an accessory use, it was obligated to present that claim with supporting evidence to the commission, to whom the factual question was committed. It did not do so. Therefore, it is not entitled to appellate review of that claim. See <em>Finkenstein </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>192 Conn. 104, 112, 470 A.2d 1196 (1984) (appellant not entitled to review of specific issue not properly raised before administrative agency). Upjohn\u2019s argument would require the bizarre result of reversing the commission\u2019s decision for lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support a factual finding on which Upjohn declined to offer evidence, despite its burden of persuasion thereon. We refuse to impose such an impractical rule. Indeed, to hold otherwise would require a zoning board, faced with a request for a permit on one specific basis, to insulate its decision from reversal on appeal only by searching, sua sponte, through the zoning regulations for some other unspecified, possible basis for the permit so as to adduce evidence to reject that other basis. Upjohn cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Upjohn next claims that the trial court improperly rejected its contention that the approval of Upjohn\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>capping and closure plan, by the United States environmental protection agency (EPA) and by the Connecticut department <em>of </em>environmental protection (DEP), preempted the commission from denying Upjohn\u2019s applications. The commission responds that (1) Upjohn is collaterally estopped from relitigating the preemption issue because that issue was decided adversely to Upjohn in the federal litigation, and (2) in any event, the trial court was correct in its analysis of the merits of the preemption issue. We agree with the commission that Upjohn is collaterally estopped from relitigating this issue. We therefore need not reach its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">This claim arises in the following procedural context. Under the RCRA and the applicable federal regulations, Upjohn was required to submit its capping and closure plan for approval by the EPA and DEP.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By a joint letter dated September 29,1989, both agencies approved the plan. They stated that \u201cthe plan complies with the closure requirements pursuant to Section 22a-449 (c)-29 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, and with Title 40 Part 265 Subparts G and N of the Code of Federal Regulations. Both Agencies hereby approve the plan,\u201d subject to certain conditions not relevant to this case. They also stated, however, that \u201c[tjhis Approval does not relieve the facility of the obligation to obtain any other authorizations as may be required by other provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes, Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, Code of Federal Regulations, or Federal Statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>In the litigation in the United States District Court, Upjohn \u201cclaimed . . . that federal law preempts the local [zoning] requirements, and . . . filed a counterclaim seeking to restrain the [commission] from enforcing the [zoning] regulations so as to prevent Upjohn from implementing the plan . . . .\u201d <em>North Haven I, </em>supra, 428. The District Court, therefore, considered that it \u201cneeds to resolve whether RCRA and the EPA/DEP Approval preempts the local zoning regulations and the Commission in these respects.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The District Court thoroughly analyzed Upjohn\u2019s preemption claim. It first noted that \u201cCongress . . . neither expressly preempted nor impliedly occupied the entire field of hazardous waste regulation through RCRA. ... In fact, one of RCRA\u2019s express objectives is to establish a cooperative effort among the federal, state, and local governments and private enterprise to carry out the purposes of the Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6902 (a) (7).\u201d Id., 429. The court also noted that the Act\u2019s savings clause permits states and municipalities to impose requirements more stringent than those imposed by the Act. Id.; see footnote 6. After consideration of the case law upon which Upjohn relied for its preemption claim, and consideration of \u201cthe federal law and local law allegedly in conflict in this case,\u201d the court concluded that \u201c[i]t is clear from the text of the Act that closure can be accomplished through any means approved by the EPA, including the removal of hazardous materials.\u201d Id., 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Furthermore, the District Court, after considering the zoning regulations, as interpreted by the commission and its zoning enforcement officer, concluded that the case did not present either a direct or an indirect conflict with federal authority. Id., 431. After noting that \u201cthe Commission requires [Upjohn] to remove the materials, rather than conduct the federally approved activities on its own property,\u201d the court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201c[rjather than conflicting with RCRA, this would seem to be the exact sort of site selection process, or application of more stringent standards, envisioned by the savings clause. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6929.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The District Court was not persuaded by Upjohn\u2019s argument that \u201cthe Approval constitutes an EPA determination that Upjohn\u2019s plan represents the most sound environmental action, and therefore any obstacle to its implementation is an obstacle to congressional goals . . . .\u201d Id., 431-32. The court noted that \u201c[tjhere are many methods in which a hazardous waste site might be closed in accordance with RCRA, including removal.\u201d Id., 432. It rejected Upjohn\u2019s contention that the agency approval had determined that Upjohn\u2019s plan was the <em>\u201cmost </em>environmentally protective.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. The court found significant that the EPA and the DEP had issued an approval, rather than an order, and the court refused to draw any conclusion \u201cfrom the fact that the agencies issued the Approval with knowledge that the Commission considered the presence of the unclosed pile a zoning violation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id. Finally, the court noted that \u201cthe language of the Approval itself includes that it does not relieve Upjohn from obtaining any further authorizations required by the Connecticut General Statutes, which provide for the enactment of local zoning regulations. . . . For all of the foregoing reasons, and in light of the RCRA savings clause providing for a role for local government, the Court finds that the Approval does not preempt the Commission\u2019s actions or the local zoning requirements.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>On appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, Upjohn contended \u201cthat the district court erred in concluding that RCRA does not preempt the Town\u2019s zoning regulations . . . <em>North Haven II, </em>supra, 27. In a per curiam opinion, the Circuit Court \u201cconsidered all of Upjohn\u2019s arguments on this appeal and . . . found them to be without merit.\u201d Id. Specifically, the court cited the RCRA savings clause, and further noted that \u201cthe approval given by EPA and DEP to Upjohn\u2019s plan to cap its sludge pile stated that the approval did. not relieve Upjohn from its obligation \u2018to obtain any other authorizations [that] may be required by other provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes,\u201d including local zoning regulations. Id., 27-28. Finally, the court recognized that, \u201c[consistent with the view that the approval was thus not intended to preempt local zoning regulations, EPA and DEP responded to public comments and questions by stating that if the Connecticut courts upheld a ruling that Upjohn\u2019s current plan would violate zoning regulations, Upjohn would have to submit to EPA and DEP a new plan for review and approval.\u201d Id. The court, therefore, saw \u201cno error in the rulings of the district court that federal law and regulatory actions have not preempted the Town\u2019s zoning regulations,\u201d and affirmed the judgment \u201csubstantially for the reasons stated in the Memorandum of Decision of Judge Daly dated May 31, 1990, published at 753 F. Sup. 423 (1990).\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, provides that if \u201can issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the same parties, whether on the same or a different claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Saporoso </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty </em>Co., 221 Conn. 356, 367, 603 A.2d 1160 (1992). In order for collateral estoppel to apply, however, there must be an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>identity of issues, that is, the prior litigation must have resolved the same legal or factual issue that is present in the second litigation. <em>P.X. Restaurant, Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>189 Conn. 153, 161, 454 A.2d 1258 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The opinions of both the United States District Court and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals make it quite clear that those courts fully considered and determined, adversely to Upjohn, the issue of whether the commission was preempted by federal law and the EPA and DEP approval from enforcing the zoning regulations so as to bar Upjohn\u2019s capping and closure plan. This is the same issue that Upjohn attempts to litigate in these state proceedings. Collateral estoppel bars Upjohn from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Upjohn argues, however, that there is no identity of issues in the present appeal because \u201c[t]he Federal District Court holding was limited to the validity of a facial preemption challenge to the Commission\u2019s regulations and did not involve a preemption challenge to the Commission\u2019s interpretation and application of those regulations in a specific factual setting and in the face of an EPA/DEP approval of the closure plan pursuant to RCRA.\u201d Upjohn contends that the District Court, in itsMay 31,1990 decision, held only that \u201c(1) the . . . zoning regulations ... do not on their face conflict with RCRA and thus are not . . . preempted, and (2) Upjohn had not yet applied to the Commission for said permits and approval.\u201d This appeal, Upjohn argues, involves the different issue of whether the commission\u2019s decision, dated September 10,1990, after the EPA and DEP approval, creates a direct conflict between the environmental approval and the zoning regulations and enforcement. The record does not support Upjohn\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">First, neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals confined its preemption analysis to the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>of whether there was simply a facial conflict between the environmental approval and the regulations. This conclusion is compelled, not only by a thorough reading of both fact based opinions, but by their explicit language as well. The District Court concluded \u201cthat the Approval does not preempt <em>the Commission's actions or the heal zoning requirements.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>North Haven I, </em>supra, 432. The Court of Appeals noted the recognition by EPA and DEP that, if the commission\u2019s contention of a zoning violation were upheld by our courts, Upjohn would be required to reapply for approval. That court also affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment \u201csubstantially for the reasons stated\u201d in the District Court\u2019s opinion. <em>North Haven II, </em>supra, 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Indeed, those courts were required to go beyond a claim of facial conflict because Upjohn\u2019s preemption claim required the courts \u201cto consider the relationship between state and federal laws as they are interpreted and applied, not merely as they are written.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 526, 97 S. Ct. 1305, 51 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1977). Upjohn\u2019s argument would have us read the opinions of both federal courts as having overlooked this fundamental tenet of preemption analysis. We cannot do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Second, it is immaterial that, when the District Court decided the preemption issue, Upjohn had not yet applied to the commission for the permits involved in this case. The EPA and DEP approval preceded the entire federal litigation, at both the trial and appellate levels. The federal courts\u2019 preemption analysis focused, on one hand, entirely on the alleged conflict between that approval, and, on the other hand, on the zoning regulations and the commission\u2019s claim that Upjohn was in violation thereof. Inherent in that analysis was both the assumption that Upjohn was in violation of the zoning regulations, and the recognition that the EPA and DEP approval was contingent upon compli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>anee with such regulations. The District Court explicitly-adopted as a premise of its decision that Upjohn was in violation of the zoning regulations; see footnote 7; <em>North Haven I, </em>supra, 527; and the Circuit Court did so implicitly by recognizing that Upjohn would have to reapply for approval if the state courts upheld a ruling that Upjohn\u2019s plan constituted a zoning violation. Thus, the subsequent decision of the commission denying the applications on the ground of the existence of a zoning violation had been fully anticipated by the federal courts in their preemption analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\"> Following the Appellate Court\u2019s grant of the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, the plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-7\"> The enforceability of this condition is the subject of one of the companion appeals in this court.

There was evidence produced in the federal trial between the same parties that some chemical manufacturers remove their waste off-site, others recycle and reuse it, others incinerate it, and still others use combinations of methods of on-site disposal similar to the method proposed by Upjohn.
