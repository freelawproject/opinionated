The plaintiffs, Louise Lowrey and Sebastiana Scionti, appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court denying their application to vacate a compulsory arbitration award that denied them underinsured motorists coverage under a policy issued by the defendant, Valley Forge Insurance Company. The plaintiffs claim that: (1) the applicable regulation does not validate the policy exclusion that appears in the underinsured motorist poliey issued by the defendant; and (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>validity of the policy exclusion must be determined not by the regulation but by a statute, and the applicable statute does not authorize the exclusion. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The facts are undisputed. In June, 1989, the plaintiffs were passengers in a car owned and operated by Alfreda Kozlowski, and suffered injuries as a result of a one car accident. Neither plaintiff was a resident of Kozlowski\u2019s household. The defendant had issued an automobile insurance policy to Kozlowski covering the car and another car owned by her. The policy provided single-limit liability coverage for each car in the amount of $100,000, and underinsured motorist coverage for each car in the amount of $100,000. The defendant paid each plaintiff $50,000, thereby exhausting the liability coverage under the policy. The defendant, however, refused to pay the plaintiffs\u2019 underinsured motorist claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The plaintiffs requested arbitration of their underinsured motorist coverage claims against the defendant. The arbitration panel, by a two to one vote, denied the claims. The trial court, in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 application to vacate the award, held that the exclusion in Kozlowski\u2019s policy was authorized by a state regulation and was therefore valid. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The policy exclusion at issue in this case provides in pertinent part: \u201cHowever, \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 does not include any vehicle or equipment: 1. Owned by or furnished or available for your regular use.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>regulation at issue provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe insurer\u2019s obligations to pay may be made inapplicable ... (2) if the uninsured motor vehicle is owned by (A) the named insured or any relative who is a resident of the same household or is furnished for the regular use of any of the foregoing.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 38-175a-6 (c) (2) (A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The plain language of the policy exclusion makes it clear that the exclusion applied to the Kozlowski vehicle. The vehicle involved in the accident was owned by Kozlowski, who was the named insured under the policy issued by the defendant. Thus, the vehicle was not an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">A comparison of the exclusion with the regulation makes it equally clear that the exclusion was authorized by the regulation and is therefore valid. \u201cWhen an insurer seeks to limit its liability for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage based on [a] regulation issued pursuant to [General Statutes (Rev. to 1989)] \u00a7 38-175c [now \u00a7 38a-336], it may do so only to the extent that the regulation expressly authorizes. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ferrante, </em>[201 Conn. 478, 483, 518 A.2d 373 (1986)]; see also <em>Nicolletta v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>211 Conn. 640, 647-48, 560 A.2d 964 (1989). Similarly, where an insurer seeks to limit its liability based on the statute itself, rather than on the regulation, it should only be permitted to do so to the extent that the statute expressly authorizes. In order for a policy exclusion to be expressly authorized by [a] statute [or regulation], there must be substantial congruence between the statutory [or regulatory] provision and the policy provision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 674, 591 A.2d 101 (1991). That congruence is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The <em>regulation </em>expressly permits an exclusion from underinsured motorist coverage for a vehicle that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>owned by the named insured or by any resident relative of the named insured, or that is furnished for the regular use of the named insured or any such relative. The <em>policy exclusion </em>tracks the regulation by excluding such coverage for any vehicle that is owned by the named insured or by any resident relative of the named insured, or that is furnished or available for the regular use of the named insured or any such relative. We can perceive no incongruence between the regulation and the policy exclusion that would suggest that the policy exclusion was not authorized by the regulation. Compare <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 674-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Both the policy exclusion and the regulation on which it is based are fully consistent with the underlying rationale of underinsured motorist coverage, and with the difference between that coverage and liability coverage. In this connection, we agree with the reasoning of the Minnesota Supreme Court in two cases in which passengers in one car accidents unsuccessfully sought to recover underinsured motorists benefits from the carrier providing both liability and uninsured motorists coverage for the car involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u201cLiability insurance is purchased by an owner of a vehicle to protect passengers in that vehicle from the negligent driving of the owner or another driving the vehicle. Underinsured coverage, however, is intended to protect against a different type of risk, the risk that a negligent driver of another vehicle will have failed to purchase adequate liability insurance; that is, it is intended \u2018to protect the named insured and other additional insureds from suffering an inadequately compensated injury caused by an accident with an inadequately insured automobile.\u2019 <em>Myers </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>336 N.W.2d 288, 291 (Minn. 1983). An insured wishing to provide greater protection from his own negligence for himself and his passengers should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>purchase additional liability insurance coverage; allowing underinsured coverage in the instant case would, in essence, be allowing an individual to increase liability coverage by purchasing less expensive underinsured coverage.\u201d <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Illinois Farmers Ins. Group, </em>371 N.W.2d 535, 537 (Minn. 1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u201cUnderinsured motorist coverage is first-party coverage and, in that sense, the coverage follows the person not the vehicle. Here, however, the [plaintiffs] have already collected under the liability coverage of the insurer of the [Kozlowski] car. To now collect further under the same insurer\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage would be to convert the underinsured motorist coverage into third-party insurance, treating it essentially the same as third-party liability coverage. The policy definition defining an \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 to exclude a vehicle owned by or regularly furnished or available to the named insured properly prevents this conversion of first-party coverage into third-party coverage.\u201d <em>Myers </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Even if the regulation contained in \u00a7 38-175a-6 would validate the policy exclusion, the plaintiffs contend that the regulation does not govern this case because the policy exclusion in the insurance contract does not conform to the terms of,the exclusion authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1) (A), formerly \u00a7 38-175c. The statute provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo insurer shall be required to provide uninsured motorist coverage to (A) a named insured or relatives residing in his household when occupying, or struck as a pedestrian by, an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>motorcycle that is owned by the named insured. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Contending that this language provides the sole basis for the defendant\u2019s policy exclusion, the plaintiffs argue that the policy exclusion is invalid because neither of the plaintiffs was a named insured or a relative residing in the named insured\u2019s household. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The statute has its origins in <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 449 A.2d 157 (1982), in which we held invalid a policy provision that would have excluded uninsured motorist coverage to the plaintiff because he had been driving an uninsured vehicle that was owned by his father. In <em>Harvey, </em>we acknowledged that our interpretation of the governing regulatory principles as requiring uninsured motorist coverage in such circumstances could be criticized because \u201csuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>a public policy discourages persons from obtaining liability insurance coverage and increases the risk of injury by uninsured motorists.\u201d Id., 252-53. We responded: \u201cBut that plea should be directed to the legislature.\u201d Id., 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The legislature, in turn, responded to such a plea in the next legislative session by enacting Public Acts 1983, No. 83-461, codified as \u00a7 38-175c (a) (1) (A) and (B), now \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1) (A) and (B). We have recently recognized that this legislation was enacted \u201cto limit to some extent the broad sweep of <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>[supra, 248].\u201d <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kulla, </em>216 Conn. 390, 400 n.7, 579 A.2d 525 (1990); see also 26 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1983 Sess., p. 3055, remarks of Senator Wayne Baker; Conn. Joint Standing Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>mittee Hearings, Insurance and Real Estate, 1983 Sess., February 28, 1983, p. 59, testimony of Michael P. Meotti. It is clear, therefore, that \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1) (A) and (B) was not intended to address the circumstances of a case sueh as this where, unlike <em>Harvey, </em>the plaintiffs were not occupying an uninsured vehicle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We know of no rule that the validation of one type of policy exclusion by a statute automatically disallows the validation of a different type of policy exclusion by a regulation. This case is governed not by General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 but by \u00a7 38-175a-6 (c) (2) (A) of the regulations. See footnote 4. That regulation was promulgated, not under the statutory authority of \u00a7 38a-336, formerly \u00a7 38-175c, but under the general regulatory authority of the insurance commissioner pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-334 (a), formerly \u00a7 38-175a. Section 38a-334 (a) provides in pertinent part that the \u201cinsurance commissioner shall adopt regulations with respect to minimum provisions to be included in automobile liability insurance policies.... Such regulations shall relate to the insuring agreements, <em>exclusions, </em>conditions and other terms applicable to the bodily injury liability, property damage liability, medical payments and uninsured motorists coverages under such policies . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Furthermore, \u00a7 38-175a-6 (c) (2) of the regulations, having been originally promulgated in 1975, long antedates the enactment in 1983 of \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1) (A) and (B) and, indeed, was repromulgated after legislative review in 1986. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument would in effect have us read the 1983 legislation as having impliedly repealed the preexisting regulation, despite our \u201crule disfavoring . . . the implied repeal of a regulation by a statute, especially where, as in the present case, the regulation at issue has been approved by the legislative regulation review committee.\u201d <em>Dugas </em>v. <em>Lumbermans Mutual Casualty Co., </em>217 Conn. 631, 641, 587 A.2d 415 (1991). We decline to invalidate the regulation that specifically authorizes the policy exclusion at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-10\"> The defendant\u2019s policy also provided uninsured motorists coverage. Under our law the statutes and regulations applicable to uninsured motorist coverage also apply to underinsured motorist coverage. <em>McGlinchey </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>224 Conn. 133, 134-35, 617 A.2d 445 (1992); <em>Hotkowski v. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>224 Conn. 145, 151, 617 A.2d 451 (1992); <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>220 Conn. 30, 31 n.3, 594 A.2d 977 (1991). Because this case involves a claim for underinsured motorist coverage, we refer herein to that coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-11\"> The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b176-8\"> The amendment to the policy provides in pertinent part: \u2018 \u2018Part C [Uninsured Motorists Coverage] is amended as follows . . .

The limit of the insurer\u2019s liability may not be less than the applicable limits for bodily injury liability specified in subsection (a) of section 14-112 of the general statutes, except that the policy may provide for the reduction of limits to the extent that damages have been \u201c(1) paid by or on behalf of any person responsible for the injury,</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">\u201c(2) paid or are payable under any workers\u2019 compensation or disability benefits law, or</p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">\u201c(3) paid under the policy in settlement of a liability claim. The policy may also provide that any direct indemnity for medical expense paid or payable under the policy or any amount of any basic reparations benefits paid or payable under the policy will reduce the damages which the insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>may recover under this coverage and any payment under these coverages shall reduce the company\u2019s obligation under the bodily injury liability coverage to the extent of the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u201c(e) recovery over. The insurer may require the insured to hold in trust all rights against third parties or to exercise such rights after the insurer has paid any claim, provided that the insurer shall not acquire by assignment, prior to settlement or judgment, its insured\u2019s right of action to recover for bodily injury from any third party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\"> Indeed, the defendant\u2019s policy in this case discloses a premium of $156 to $174 per car for $100,000 of liability coverage, and a premium of $29 to $33 for $100,000 of uninsured coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b181-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336, formerly \u00a7 38-175c, provides: \u201cuninsured motorist coverage, (a) (1) Each automobile liability insurance policy shall provide insurance, herein called uninsured motorist coverage, in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section 38a-334, with limits for bodily injury or death not less than those specified in subsection (a) of section 14-112, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles and underinsured motor vehicles and insured motor vehicles, the insurer of which becomes insolvent prior to payment of such damages, because of bodily injury, including death resulting therefrom.
