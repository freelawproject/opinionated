The defendant, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, appeals from the judgment of the trial court modifying an award by an arbitration panel. The panel had credited the defendant insurer with an amount equal to the value of the unrealized workers\u2019 compensation claim for which the plaintiff, Roy Rydingsword, had not yet applied. The trial court vacated the setoff to the defendant and modified the award in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly found that: (1) the prospective recovery by the plaintiff of a workers\u2019 compensation specific indemnity award for a lumbar spine disability did not constitute an amount \u201cpayable\u201d for the purposes of the defendant\u2019s underinsured motorist policy exclusion clause; (2) the arbitrators lacked any factual basis for determining the amount of the prospective compensation award; and (3) no compensation award becomes payable until the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner makes findings and renders an award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>that the arbitrators had the authority to award a setoff upon the presentation of substantial evidence on which to base their determination of the amount of this prospective award where the claimant had chosen to bypass the workers\u2019 compensation forum. We therefore conclude that the defendant insurer is entitled to a setoff for the prospective indemnity. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The parties stipulated to the underlying facts. The plaintiff, while in the course of his employment, was injured in an automobile accident caused solely by the negligence of a third party. The plaintiff suffered lacerations to his forehead that resulted in permanent scarring. He also sustained injuries to his lower back that resulted in a 20 percent permanent partial disability of the lumbar spine. The plaintiff recovered $20,000 from the liability insurer of the negligent driver, thereby exhausting the coverage limits of the policy of the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was covered by a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy. The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the fourth district approved the plaintiff\u2019s claims for medical expenses in the amount of $2274.36, and for lost wages in the amount of $5775.77. The commissioner subsequently approved the plaintiff\u2019s claim of permanent scarring of his forehead and awarded him $7044.51<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff did not pursue a workers\u2019 compensation claim for specific indemnity for the 20 percent disability of the lumbar spine as provided in \u00a7 31-308 (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff, however, did not terminate his workers\u2019 compensation rights and his workers\u2019 compensation case remained open throughout the course of the proceedings below.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">At the time of the accident, the defendant had issued an automobile insurance policy to the plaintiff wherein it agreed to pay all sums that the insured would be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner of an uninsured or underinsured vehicle because of injuries sustained by the insured as a result of an accident arising out of the use of such uninsured or underinsured vehicle. The policy provided uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage in the amount of $300,000. The policy provided further, however, that the limit of liability for uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>would be reduced, inter alia, by all sums \u201cpaid or payable . . . under . . . workers\u2019 compensation law <em>77</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Pursuant to provisions of the policy, the plaintiff demanded that the defendant proceed with arbitration. The arbitration panel found that the plaintiff had sustained damages in-the amount of $98,050.13. The panel also found that the defendant was entitled to a credit of $20,000, representing exhaustion of the third party tortfeasor\u2019s policy, and a credit of $7044.51, representing the workers\u2019 compensation scarring award. These credits are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">A majority of the panel also agreed that the lumbar spine disability was work related and compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation policy coverage held by the plaintiff\u2019s employer. Using the formula set forth in \u00a7 31-308 (b), the majority determined that the plaintiff would be entitled to a workers\u2019 compensation specific indemnity award of $66,602.64.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority then calculated the present value of the indemnity to be $60,603.22.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The majority found that the prospective specific indemnity award was payable under the workers\u2019 compensation coverage and therefore allowed a credit in this amount to the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The trial court concluded, however, that the defendant was not entitled to a setoff against the underinsured motorist award equal to the calculated value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the prospective workers\u2019 compensation specific indemnity award.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court determined that the use of the words \u201csums\u201d and \u201cpayable\u201d in the exclusion clause of the uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage endorsement to the automobile insurance policy connoted the existence of specific obligations payable at present or in the future. The trial court concluded, therefore, that the exclusion did not apply to the specific indemnity that had not yet been awarded by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner. Consequently, the trial court found that the determination of a specific value for the indemnity by the arbitration panel lacked a factual basis. The trial court vacated the credit for the value of the specific indemnity to the defendant and modified the award in favor of the plaintiff accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the predicted recovery by the plaintiff of a workers\u2019 compensation specific indemnity award for a lumbar spine disability did not constitute an amount payable for the purposes of the exclusion clause contained in the underinsured motorist endorsement to the automobile insurance policy. The policy provided that \u201c[t]he limit of liability shall be reduced by all sums . . . <em>paid or payable </em>because of the bodily injury under any of the following or similar law: (a) workers\u2019 compensation law . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This wording parallels the language of \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which provides in part \u201cthat the policy may provide for the reduction of limits to the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>damages have been . . . paid or are <em>payable </em>under any workers\u2019 compensation or disability benefits law . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">We have recently held that \u201c[i]f damages are <em>paid </em>pursuant to the workers\u2019 compensation law, the uninsured motorist coverage may be reduced accordingly. General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c contains no mandate that uninsured motorist coverage benefits may not be reduced.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 532, 538, 569 A.2d 40, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 814, 111 S. Ct. 52, 112 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1990).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-334 (formerly \u00a7 38-175a) explicitly authorizes the insurance commissioner to adopt regulations relating to exclusions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">To counter the defendant\u2019s reliance on the language in the contract and the regulations, the plaintiff contends that the meaning of the phrase \u201csums . . . paid or payable\u201d in the insurance policy is ambiguous and that therefore the phrase must be construed in favor of the insured. The general rule that \u201c[w]hen the words of an insurance contract are, without violence, suscep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>tibie of two interpretations, that which will sustain the claim and cover the loss must, in preference, be adopted\u201d; <em>Raffel </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>141 Conn. 389, 392, 106 A.2d 716 (1954); does not apply in this case because the contract is not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The Connecticut rule of construction of insurance policies is well settled. \u201cIf the terms of an insurance policy are of doubtful meaning, that permissible construction which is most favorable to the insured is to be adopted; but if they are plain and unambiguous the established rules for the construction of contracts apply, the language, from which the intention of the parties is to be deduced, must be accorded its natural and ordinary meaning, and the courts cannot indulge in a forced construction ignoring provisions or so distorting them as to accord a meaning other than that evidently intended by the parties.\u201d <em>Porto </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>120 Conn. 196, 200, 180 A. 289 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">We have previously defined \u201csum\u201d and \u201cpayable\u201d in the context of an exclusion of benefits clause in an insurance policy. \u201c \u2018Sum\u2019 is defined as \u2018an indefinite or specified amount of money . . . .\u2019 Webster, Third New International Dictionary.\u201d <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Union Labor Life Ins. Co., </em>186 Conn. 507, 515 n.4, 442 A.2d 920 (1982). Accordingly, we reject the assertion that the word \u201csums\u201d as used in the insurance policy must only mean a specified sum of money. The plaintiff notes without further explication that the policy uses the word \u201csums\u201d while the regulation uses the word \u201cdamages.\u201d Section 38-175a-3 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies does not require the use of any particular talismanic words.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We discern no dispar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>ity between the exclusion allowed by \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) and the exclusion contained in the policy of insurance issued by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The plaintiff also contends that the words \u201cpaid or payable\u201d constitute a unitary term. The defendant argues that the words \u201cpaid\u201d and \u201cpayable\u201d within the phrase \u201cpaid or payable\u201d have different meanings. We agree with the defendant. No word or phrase in a statute is to be rendered mere surplusage. <em>Jutkowitz </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>220 Conn. 86, 104, 596 A.2d 374 (1991). The same presumption applies to regulations promulgated by the agency charged with the implementation of the statute. \u201c[WJithin their scope the [insurance] regulations have the force of statutes. ... In the construction of statutes, great deference is to be accorded to the construction given the statute by the agency charged with its enforcement.\u201d <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>171 Conn. 463, 473, 370 A.2d 1011 (1976). Accordingly, the use by the insurance commissioner of the two words in the regulation must be viewed as intentional. Moreover, the policy language tracks the regulation and the words must be construed similarly.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u201cThe word \u2018payable\u2019 clearly connotes that something need only be capable of being paid. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Union Labor Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 517. The trial court construed the word \u201cpayable\u201d to connote only an amount of money previously awarded by the commissioner but not yet collected by the claimant. We reject as unduly restrictive a construction that would allow the exclusion only if the claimant has already secured an award from the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner but has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>not yet received actual payment in a fixed and determined amount at the time of the underinsured motorist arbitration hearing.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">We conclude that the phrase \"sums . . . payable\u201d is not ambiguous but plainly means an ascertained amount of money that is capable of being paid. The clear language of the exclusion clause of the policy must be read to include a workers\u2019 compensation specific indemnity award that may at some future time be paid or payable to a claimant who has chosen to bypass the workers\u2019 compensation forum and to proceed first to demand arbitration of a claim pursuant to underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s second argument in support of the trial court\u2019s construction of \"sums . . . payable\u201d is a Dickensian claim. He contends that he has the right to a final determination of an award by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner before his underinsured motorist coverage carrier can receive a credit for such award even though he chooses not to submit his claim to the commissioner. The defendant\u2019s construction of the phrase \u201csums . . . payable\u201d is, however, congruent with the underlying intent of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-334<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the implementing regulations promul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>gated by the insurance commissioner.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cThe public policy established by the uninsured motorist statute is that every insured is entitled to recover for the damages he or she would have been able to recover if the uninsured motorist had maintained a policy of liability insurance.\u201d <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 249, 449 A.2d 157 (1982); <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 197, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). It is a \u201ctime-honored rule that an injured party is entitled to full recovery only once for the harm suffered.\u201d <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 70 n.19, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). \u201c[A]n insured may not recover double payment of damages under overlapping insurance coverage.\u201d <em>Pecker </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>171 Conn. 443, 452, 370 A.2d 1006 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Similarly, \u201cthe policy underlying [General Statutes] \u00a7 31-293 (a) of our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act . . . prohibits double recovery.\u201d <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 567, 590 A.2d 914 (1991). \u201cOne of the purposes of the workers\u2019 compensation statute is \u2018the avoidance of two independent compensations for the injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Enquist v. General Datacom, </em>218 Conn. 19, 26, 587 A.2d 1029 (1991); see generally J. Asselin, Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Manual (1985) p. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The trial court relied solely upon dicta in a New Jersey case referred to in <em>Englehardt </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Ins. Group, </em>36 Conn. Sup. 256, 258, 417 A.2d 366 (1980), to support its public policy rationale for narrowly construing the exclusion clause.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>Englehardt </em>also stated that \u201c[r]egardless of how persuasive the public policy stated by the New Jersey court may be, this court cannot premise a decision on public policy in defiance of state statutes or valid administrative regulations.\u201d Id., 259. The court concluded that \u201cthe insurance policy provision providing for the deductibility of workmen\u2019s compensation awards from uninsured motorist coverage is valid and enforceable in Connecticut.\u201d Id., 260. Moreover, we discern no cogent public policy reason why the insurance commissioner would intend to prevent double recovery in tort but to allow it in workers\u2019 compensation. We read the word \u201cpayable\u201d in the regulation to avoid this disparate result.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">We recently addressed the issue of whether an employer was entitled to be reimbursed for the estimated value of a specific indemnity that the employee might be entitled to recover. <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>supra. The plaintiff in <em>Gurliacci </em>never made a claim for a specific award for permanent partial incapacity nor was there a determination of such a claim by the workers\u2019 compensation commission. Id., 566. Although we decided that, under the circumstances of that case, the trial court correctly refused to reimburse the employer for the present value of the specific award, we also concluded that the employer would be entitled to reimbursement should the plaintiff recover a third party award on retrial. Id., 569. Pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a), the employer could intervene in a subsequent action against a third party and thus become entitled to reimbursement from the net proceeds for benefits paid and the present value of probable future benefits.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Enquist v. General Datacom, </em>supra; <em>Love </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>v. <em>J. P. Stevens &amp; Co., </em>218 Conn. 46, 50, 587 A.2d 1042 (1991). Workers\u2019 compensation awards, however, are exempt from attachment and execution and there is no provision for third party intervenors in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. General Statutes \u00a7 31-320. The underinsured motorist insurance carrier is thus unable to place a lien for reimbursement upon any future workers\u2019 compensation benefits awarded. Under current practices, the uninsured/underinsured motor vehicle insurance carrier must claim a credit of a workers\u2019 compensation award during the underinsured arbitration process, or not at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The plaintiff asserts that the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner must make a finding about the amount of a compensation award before an insurer can seek a credit in the underinsured arbitration. The plaintiff also claims, however, that he can choose to bypass the commissioner until a point of time subsequent to his recovery of underinsured motorist benefits. His argument thus renders the credit for workers\u2019 compensation recovery illusory. A claimant cannot elect to postpone a proceeding in the workers\u2019 compensation forum in favor of first making a demand for arbitration on the underinsured motorist insurance carrier and then argue that the value of the workers\u2019 compensation specific indemnity is speculative and therefore not a sum payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act delegates responsibility to the commissioner to calculate credit for unknown future benefits. <em>Love </em>v. <em>J. P. Stevens &amp; Co., </em>supra, 50. Section 31-293 (a) does not explicitly provide that such a determination must be made by the commissioner. See also <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>supra, 571. If the claimant deprives the underinsured motorist carrier of the benefit of a finding by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner and the value of the unrealized claim is determined in the arbitration forum on the basis of substantial evidence, the claimant cannot be heard to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the arbitration panel had no factual basis for determining the value of the plaintiff\u2019s specific indemnity and that such a determination was speculative. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Section 31-308 (b) (13) provides the formula to calculate the value of the specific indemnity for a back injury.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The calculation depends upon only two variables: (1) the claimant\u2019s weekly compensation rate; and (2) the proportion of disability of the claimant\u2019s back.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Factual findings of an arbitration panel considering underinsured motorist coverage are subject to de novo review by the courts using a substantial evidence standard of judicial review. <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 660-61, 591 A.2d 101 (1991). The parties stipulated in the trial court that there was substantial evidence in the record to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the findings of certain basic facts by the arbitration panel: that the plaintiff had suffered his injuries while in the course of his employment; that the plaintiff had suffered a permanent partial 20 percent disability of the back; that the plaintiff was covered by a policy of workers\u2019 compensation insurance; that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff were compensable under the terms of the workers\u2019 compensation policy; that his weekly compensation rate was $640.41; and that the computation of the present value of the special indemnity was mathematically correct.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The trial court disagreed, however, that the arbitrators\u2019 determination of the value of the specific indemnity was a reasonable conclusion drawn from these basic facts. Instead, it held that the determination of the amount of a specific indemnity lies solely within the province of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner. We disagree. The plaintiff chose not to pursue his claim for a workers\u2019 compensation specific indemnity award. He thus avoided the only forum that he claims had the authority to value the specific indemnity. Consequently, the arbitration panel carried out its responsibilities and in the process assigned a value to the unrealized specific indemnity in order to assign a value to the credit to which the insurer was entitled. That value was based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to grant the application to confirm the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-8\"> In his brief on appeal, the plaintiff claimed, in the alternative, that any offset for a prospective workers\u2019 compensation recovery would serve to reduce only the $300,000 coverage limit of the policy, and not the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>of his damages. This claim was never raised below.
