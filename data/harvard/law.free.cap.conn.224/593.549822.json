General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41a through 54-41t. The defendants, Mary McVeigh and William McVeigh, appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgments of conviction, following the denial of their motions to suppress and following their conditional pleas of nolo contendere pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of possession of cocaine with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a), and possession of marihuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The defendants claim that the trial court improperly-concluded that their conversations over a cordless telephone in their home were: (1) not protected by the provisions of the wiretap act because they were not wire communications within the meaning of the act; and (2) not protected by the fourth amendment to the United States constitution or by article first, \u00a7 7 of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Without reaching the constitutional issues, we conclude that the communications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>at issue were \u201c[w]ire communication^]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 54-41a (1), and that the trial court, therefore, should have granted the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">In the trial court, the defendants moved to suppress the contents of their communications made over their cordless telephone, and all the evidence derived therefrom. The bases of the motions were that the electronic interception by the police of the defendants\u2019 cordless telephone conversations: (1) violated the wiretap act; and (2) violated their constitutional rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7 of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The trial court found the following facts: The defendants lived at a condominium complex in Cromwell. On February 22, 1990, the Cromwell police department began to investigate the defendants as a result of information furnished to the police by a neighbor of the defendants. The neighbor told the police that, by means of a device known as a \u201cscanner,\u201d he had overheard cordless telephone conversations of the defendants that indicated they were involved in drug dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">As a result of this information, the police decided to monitor the incoming and outgoing cordless telephone calls of the defendants by means of a \u201cBearcat Scanner\u201d and a voice activated tape recorder, stationed within the neighbor\u2019s apartment. The tape recorder was connected to the scanner, so that whenever a voice came over the scanner it would be automatically tape-recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Between February 23 and March 3,1990, the police, without having secured a judicial order pursuant to the wiretap act, monitored and tape-recorded the defendants\u2019 cordless telephone conversations, using the scan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>ner and the tape recorder. In addition, the police conducted visual surveillance of the defendants\u2019 condominium. On March 2, 1990, the police, using information gained from their monitoring of the defendants\u2019 cordless telephone conversations, stopped a Chevrolet van being driven by William McVeigh from the condominium complex, arrested him and seized drugs from his person. Thereafter, the police secured a search and seizure warrant for the defendants\u2019 condominium and for a certain automobile. Execution of this warrant yielded more drugs from the condominium and from the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The trial court also found the following undisputed facts regarding the operation of cordless telephones. A cordless telephone operates as an FM<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> two-way radio. The handset transmits an FM radio signal to the base unit, and the base unit transmits an FM radio signal to the handset. Both the handset and the base unit have antennae. Transmission of the human voice occurs through these FM radio waves. When a telephone call is initiated from the handset of a cordless telephone, it travels from the handset to the base unit via radio waves; from the base unit it travels through the telephone lines. Thus, the telephone lines are used only after a message leaves the base unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Although the trial court did not specifically make findings regarding incoming telephone calls, the same physical principles apply to such calls. If a telephone call is made to a number serviced by a cordless telephone and the cordless telephone is used to receive that call, the message travels through the telephone lines to the base unit; from there it travels via FM radio waves to the handset.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>It is also undisputed that, except for the transmission between the base unit and the handset, a cordless telephone operates essentially like an ordinary wired telephone.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The base unit is connected to the telephone line by a wire that runs from the base unit and plugs into an ordinary telephone jack. That wire usually is furnished with the purchase of the cordless telephone. A person initiating a telephone call on a cordless telephone dials (or, more accurately, enters) a telephone number, either on the handset or the base unit; the message travels from the handset to the base unit, from the base unit to the telephone jack through the wire connecting the base unit and the jack, and from there through the telephone lines. Similarly, if a person calls a telephone number that is serviced, in whole or in part, by a cordless telephone, the message travels from the calling telephone through the telephone lines to the jack, from the jack to the base unit through the wire connected to the base unit, and from there to the handset via radio waves. Thus, whereas in an ordinary wired telephone set the message travels between the base unit and the handset by way of the wire that connects the two, in a cordless telephone set the message travels between the base unit and the handset by way of FM radio waves.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The trial court found that FM radio waves travel at various frequencies ranging from forty-six to forty-nine megahertz.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cordless telephones are preset by their manufacturers to given frequencies within this range, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>and are also equipped with digital security codes in order to allow an owner to alter the frequency slightly so as to avoid the frequency being received by a nearby cordless telephone that is set to the same frequency.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court also found that a cordless telephone has a maximum range of approximately 1000 feet.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The trial court further found that any person with an FM receiver tuned to the same frequency as a particular cordless telephone can overhear telephone calls going out or coming in over that cordless telephone if the receiver is within the range of that telephone. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\u201cBearcat Scanner,\u201d which was used by the police in this case, is an FM radio that can be programmed to receive almost any FM frequency. Anyone can purchase such a scanner.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The interception of a cordless telephone conversation by such a scanner occurs during the radio wave transmission portion of the conversation, and does not involve that portion of the transmission that travels over the telephone line.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Cordless telephones are stamped with a warning on the bottom of the base unit. The warning on the bottom of the defendants\u2019 base unit stated: \u201cThis cordless telephone operates under part 15 of the [Federal Communications Commission] Rules.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Privacy of communications may not be insured when using this phone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Finally, although there was no specific evidence produced in this regard, there is no dispute that cordless telephones are in widespread use today. The defendants bring to our attention, without contradiction by the state, that approximately forty-three million cord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>less telephones were sold between 1988 and 1991, that the industry estimated sales of nearly sixteen million units in 1992, and that it also estimates that 41 percent of the approximately ninety-five million households in the nation have cordless telephones.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The trial court ruled that the interception of the defendants\u2019 conversations over their cordless telephone: (1) did not constitute interceptions of wire communications within the meaning of \u00a7 54-41a (1) and, therefore, the defendants\u2019 communications had not been \u201cunlawfully intercepted\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and (2) did not violate the defendants\u2019 constitutional rights. Accordingly, the court denied the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress. Following the defendants\u2019 conditional pleas of nolo contendere, the court rendered judgments of conviction in both cases. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The defendants claim, inter alia, that the trial court improperly denied their motions to suppress because the monitoring and tape-recording of their cordless tel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ephone conversations, without a judicial wiretap order, was an unlawful interception under our wiretap act. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We begin our analysis with some brief history. In 1967, the United States Supreme Court extended the protection of the fourth amendment to electronic eavesdropping of oral conversations. <em>Berger </em>v. <em>New York, </em>388 U.S. 41, 87 S. Ct. 1873, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1040 (1967). Later the same year, the court held that government activity \u201cin electronically listening to and recording [a defendant\u2019s] words violated the privacy upon which he justifiably relied while [making a telephone call from a] telephone booth and thus constituted a \u2018search and seizure\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 353, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In response, the Congress enacted title III, entitled \u201cWiretapping and Electronic Surveillance,\u201d of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510 through 2520; which permitted, under judicial supervision, interception of both \u201cwire communication\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and \u201coral communication.\u201d<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number><footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1968), reprinted in 1968 U.S. Code Congressional &amp; Administrative News 2112, 2113. Thereafter, in 1971, our legislature enacted our wiretap act. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41a through 54-41t.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Our wiretap act is modeled on the federal act, although in many respects it is more restrictive than the federal act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Levine, </em>5 Conn. App. 207, 210, 497 A.2d 774, cert. denied, 197 Conn. 816, 500 A.2d 1337 (1985); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>194 Conn. 447, 463, 481 A.2d 730 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In general terms, our wiretap act provides that, based upon certain specified findings, a panel of three Superior Court judges may issue an order authorizing \u201cthe interception of wire communications<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> within the state of Connecticut. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-41d.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>these purposes, \u201c \u2018[ijntercept\u2019 means the intentional overhearing or recording of a wire communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical or other device.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a (2).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The wiretap act also provides that if any wire communication \u201cwas unlawfully intercepted under the provisions of\u201d the wiretap act, the \u201ccontents\u201d of that unlawfully intercepted wire communication, as well as any \u201cevidence derived therefrom,\u201d must be suppressed upon the motion of any \u201c[ajggrieved person.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The state concedes that the police intentionally overheard and recorded the defendants\u2019 cordless telephone conversations through the use of electronic devices, namely, the Bearcat Scanner and tape recorder. It is undisputed that the police had no judicial wiretap order authorizing that conduct. It is also undisputed that, if the wiretap act applies, the defendants would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>aggrieved persons. The issue, therefore, is whether the radio wave portion of the defendants\u2019 conversations over their cordless telephone constituted a \u201c[wjire communication\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 54-41a (1). If that portion of the defendants\u2019 conversations constituted a \u201c[w]ire communication,\u201d the conduct of the police constituted an unlawful interception and the contents, and any derivative evidence, should have been suppressed. If, however, that portion of the defendants\u2019 conversations did not constitute a \u201c[wjire communication,\u201d the statute did not require suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\u201c[Tjhe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 512, 613 A.2d 748 (1992). \u201cIn seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation . . . .\u2019\u2019(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 460, 600 A.2d 310 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We turn first to the language of the statute. \u201c \u2018Wire communication\u2019 means any communication made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of telephone or telegraph between the point of origin and the point of reception furnished or operated by any person engaged as a common carrier in providing or operating such facilities for the transmission of intrastate, interstate or foreign communications.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The defendants argue, first, that the language of the statute is so clear and unambiguous that we need not go beyond the text. Emphasizing the phrases \u201cin whole or in part\u201d and \u201cfacilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of telephone,\u201d the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>contend that <em>\u201c[t]he reach of the statute is defined by the communications system being utilized, not the technology employed to access that </em>system.\u201d According to the defendants, \u201c[t]he inquiry is not whether the transmission is carried over wires, radio waves, fiber optics, or by some other means. The test is whether the call is, [in any part,] carried through the nation\u2019s telephone system.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Thus, the defendants argue, because their conversations ultimately traveled in part through the telephone lines, those conversations were wire communications within the meaning of the act, and it is irrelevant that those conversations were intercepted, not as they traveled through those lines, but as they were broadcast over FM radio waves.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The state, also relying on the \u201cplain language\u201d of the statute, responds that this interpretation renders superfluous what the state regards as limiting language following the phrase \u201cby the aid of telephone or telegraph.\u201d Focusing on the language, \u201cbetween the point of origin and the point of reception furnished or operated by any person engaged as a common carrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>in providing or operating [communications facilities],\u201d the state argues that the wiretap act \u201cprotects telephone conversations only \u2018between the point of origin and the point of reception furnished or operated by\u2019 a telephone common carrier. Section 54-41a (1) protects the telephone system only to the extent that it is furnished or operated by the phone company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Under the state\u2019s interpretation, the purpose of the limiting language is to delineate the physical boundaries of the protection afforded by the act: \u201cTelephonic communications are not protected in their entirety, but are protected only \u2018between the point of origin and the point of reception furnished or operated by\u2019 a telephone utility.\u201d Thus, the state argues, \u201c[w]ire communication\u201d encompasses only that portion of a cordless telephone conversation that is \u201ctransmitted through the facilities of a telephone utility.\u201d The state contends further that the scope of a \u201c[w]ire communication\u201d is defined, not simply by the communication system employed, but by the point of interception. Therefore, the state argues, the defendants\u2019 conversations were not wire communications because they were intercepted, not within the points of origin and reception furnished or operated by the telephone company, the telephone wires, but over the radio waves.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We are not persuaded by either the defendants\u2019 or the state\u2019s argument that the language of \u00a7 54-41a (1), as applied to the facts of this case, is unambiguous. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>488 F.2d 193, 196 (9th Cir. 1973) (\u201c[t]he definition of wire communication [in the 1968 federal wiretap legislation] is not free from ambiguity\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We acknowledge that both the defendants\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the state\u2019s interpretations are plausible, that they pose a close question, and that there could be problematic results whichever way the question is answered. Faced with two plausible constructions of the wiretap act, we are led by several considerations to the conclusion that \u201c[wjire communication\u201d includes the radio wave portion of conversations over a cordless telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">First, the focus of the defendants\u2019 interpretation is more in keeping with the language of \u00a7 54-41a. That focus is protection of communication that travels \u201cin whole or in part\u201d over the telephone lines. The defendants emphasize that, within the limits of the statutory language, it is \u201ccommunications\u201d that, on one hand, are authorized to be invaded under judicial supervision, and, on the other hand, are given significant protection. Furthermore, we agree with the defendants\u2019 contention that the language\u2014\u201cbetween the point of origin and the point of reception furnished or operated by any person engaged as a common carrier in providing or operating such facilities for the transmission of intrastate, interstate or foreign communications\u201d\u2014is simply part of the definition of what immediately precedes it, namely, \u201ctelephone or telegraph,\u201d and therefore, contrary to the state\u2019s characterization of the defendants\u2019 interpretation, is not surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The focus of the state\u2019s contrary interpretation is on the protection of the communications involved only as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>they travel over the telephone lines. This interpretation is difficult to reconcile with the statutory reference to \u201cany communication made in whole or in part through\u201d the telephone system. Thus, the defendants\u2019 interpretation creates a closer fit with the language of the definition of \u201c[w]ire communication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Second, the legislative history and subsequent judicial gloss placed on the statute counsel strongly for an interpretation that favors protection for cordless telephone conversations. Although the legislative history of the act indicates that the act was intended as a necessary tool for law enforcement, that history also \u201cis replete with strong declarations of legislative intent that it be strictly construed, and that its carefully and narrowly drawn provisions reflect a delicate balancing of interests which placed great weight on safeguards to protect individual liberties. See 14 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., pp. 844, 849, 856, 869, 870, 870A, 900, 911. . . . It is clear, therefore, that the legislative mind was acutely aware that the act impinged on the \u2018right to be let alone\u2014the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men\u2019; <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>United States, </em>277 U.S. 438, 478, 48 S. Ct. 564, 72 L. Ed. 944 (1928) (Brand\u00e9is, J., dissenting); and sought to limit that process as much as legitimately possible.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Formica, </em>3 Conn. App. 477, 482, 489 A.2d 1060, cert. denied, 196 Conn 806, 494 A.2d 903 (1985). We have examined the legislative history afresh, and have found nothing to cast doubt on this reading of it. See 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., pp. 846, 850, 870a, 871, 876, 888, 910, 920, 922, 924, and Pt. 3, p. 1323; 14 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., pp. 849, 868, 869, 899, 900, 910, 911, 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Furthermore, the judicial gloss on the wiretap act has been generally applied consistently with this legislative history, and consistently with the notion that legitimate questions over the meaning of the act should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>resolved by requiring strict adherence to its provisions by law enforcement authorities so as to limit carefully the invasion of privacy that the act necessarily entails. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>194 Conn. 447, 459, 481 A.2d 730 (1984) (\u201cexamination of the plain language of General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a et seq. . . . makes it abundantly clear that the legislature sought to limit carefully such intrusions\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>191 Conn. 360, 372, 464 A.2d 799 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1006, 104 S. Ct. 999, 79 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1984) (noting \u201ca strict approach on the part of our legislature with respect to the minimization question\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>180 Conn. 345, 349, 429 A.2d 900 (1980) (\u201cauthority to wiretap that is contained in General Statutes \u00a7 54-41c [8] requires strict compliance\u201d with the statutory requirements); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 26 n.3, 404 A.2d 873 (1978) (\u201c[t]hese and other comparisons reveal a clear intent on the part of the legislature to minimize reliance on electronic surveillance, strictly limiting its use to only those situations statutorily set forth in the fashion prescribed by the act\u201d); compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Calash, </em>212 Conn. 485, 563 A.2d 660 (1989) (absence of written finding of probable cause of special need under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41d and 54-41e not fatal if wiretap panel in fact has probable cause of special need).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Third, reading the wiretap act so as to exclude from its scope conversations over cordless telephones would necessarily exclude from its scope the statutory protections afforded by the act to innocent third parties who are at the other end of the conversations and who may have no way of knowing that, although they are speaking over traditional wired telephones, their conversations are unprotected.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The act\u2019s definition of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u201caggrieved person\u201d is expansive and includes not only the person or persons named in an order, or the person against whom the interception is directed, but also any \u201cperson who was a party to any intercepted wire communication.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a (10). Such a person has all the protections afforded by the act against unlawful invasions of his privacy, including minimization of the degree of interception; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-41e; footnote 26, infra; prompt notice that his conversations had been intercepted; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-41k<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>; a copy of his intercepted communications and the evidence derived therefrom; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m; footnote 13; suppression of any unlawful interception of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>his conversations in any judicial or administrative proceeding; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m; limits on the disclosure of the contents of any wire communication; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-41p<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>; and a civil action for damages for unlawful interception, disclosure or use of his unlawfully intercepted conversations. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-41r.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We do not believe that the legislative intent behind the wiretap act was to leave such unknowing third parties unprotected simply because the telephonic technology in such widespread use today was not available in 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Fourth, as the state acknowledged at oral argument, its interpretation of \u00a7 54-41a (1) necessarily limits the statute to situations in which the interception occurs at a point that is part of the \u201cfacilities . . . furnished or operated by\u201d a telephone utility. Under this interpretation, an interception of a wire communication occurs only as a result of a device that is attached to or otherwise draws on the telephone lines themselves, other facilities furnished or operated by the utility (such as a switching station or the microwave portion of toll calls), or a telephone that is furnished by the telephone utility. According to the state, therefore, even if the police were to place an intercepting device anywhere directly in a traditional, <em>wired telephone </em>that was not owned by the telephone company but had, for example, been manufactured and sold by an electronics manufacturer through an electronics store, \u00a7 54-41a (1) would not apply to any intercepted conversations over that telephone because those conversations would not have been intercepted \u201cbetween the point of origin and the point of reception <em>furnished, or operated by\u201d </em>the telephone common carrier. (Emphasis added.) Indeed, presumably the same reasoning would exclude from the ambit of the act interceptions resulting from a listening device placed in a traditional, wired telephone sold, rather than rented, to the user by the telephone utility itself, because a telephone that is owned by the user and not by the utility would not be \u201cfurnished or operated by\u201d the telephone utility in the sense suggested by the state. A fortiori, that reasoning would also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>exclude an intercepting device attached to either the base unit or the wire connecting that base unit to the wall jack.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The state\u2019s interpretation limiting the definition of \u201c[w]ire communication\u201d solely to the utility\u2019s communication system would conflict with the explicit recognition in the act that there are instances in which the issuing panel may, upon proper showing, authorize a \u201csecret entry onto private premises to install any device.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-41e (10).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Although the legislative history of the act indicates that the primary purpose of this provision was to enable the police to enter a building and place an intercepting device at some place in that building other than the wiretap target\u2019s specific premises; see, e.g., 14 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., p. 828; we do not believe that it was intended to exclude a secret entry to place an intercepting device directly in the target\u2019s telephone. In the latter scenario, the state\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 54-41a (1) would make the applicability of the statute turn on whether the telephone tapped was rented to the user, and thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>\u201cfurnished\u201d by the telephone company or was, instead, owned by the user, and thereby not furnished by the telephone company. Furthermore, because the only legal basis to make such a secret entry is found in the wiretap act, under the state\u2019s interpretation the authority of law enforcement officials to install such a device in a target\u2019s telephone would also turn on the same question of title to the telephone. We do not think that the legislature meant the two principal concerns of the wiretap act\u2014the necessities of law enforcement and the privacy of individuals\u2014to rise or fall on such a nicety of personalty law.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In this regard, we note that, although until the late 1960s the Federal Communications Commission tariffs of regulated telephone companies prohibited the attachment to the telephone network of any telephone that had not been supplied by the telephone utility, by the early 1970s that restriction had been relaxed and users could purchase and connect to the telephone system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>telephones and other equipment that had not been furnished by the utility company. See R. Crandall, After The Breakup, U.S. Telecommunications in a More Competitive Era (1991) p. 11; A. Stone, Wrong Number, The Breakup of AT&amp;T (1989) pp. 151-52. It is common knowledge that, for many years now, both business and residential users have owned telephones purchased from vendors other than the telephone utilities. Thus, to the extent that the state\u2019s argument requires the intercepting device to attach only to the telephone utility\u2019s equipment, it would mean that almost from the passage of the wiretap act in 1971, the act did not apply to devices installed directly in privately owned telephones. We decline to read the act so as to have created such a dead zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We do not think that our wiretap act should be read so narrowly. Just as the United States Supreme Court recognized a legitimate expectation of privacy in the words spoken into a telephone in a public telephone booth, because \u201c[t]o read the Constitution more narrowly is to ignore the vital role that the public telephone has come to play in private communication\u201d; <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 352; we decline to read our wiretap act so as to ignore the vital role that the cordless telephone has come to play in private communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Indeed, as the state recognized at oral argument, its interpretation is premised on the proposition that the act has been overtaken by modem technology. We disagree. Our definition of a \u201c[w]ire communication\u201d is based on the original federal definition. As one group of commentators has noted: \u201cWhen Congress passed the Wiretap Act in 1968, telephone calls were usually transmitted as they always had been\u2014by wire. Other technologies, however, were already appearing on the horizon. Implicitly recognizing the inevitable advance of these technologies, Congress extended protection under the Wiretap Act to telephone calls carried \u2018in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>whole or in part over wire.\u2019 Today, only a minority of telephone calls are made through wire alone; the majority make use of a combination of wire and some form of radio technology, usually microwave.\u201d R. Kastenmeier, D. Leavy &amp; D. Beier, \u201cCommunications Privacy: A Legislative Perspective,\u201d 1989 Wis. L. Rev. 715, 721-22; see also note, \u201cThe Admissibility of Evidence Obtained by Eavesdropping on Cordless Telephone Conversations,\u201d 86 Colum. L. Rev. 323 (1986) (arguing that cordless telephone conversations are within the original federal definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d); note, \u201cTitle III Protection for Wireless Telephones,\u201d 1985 Ill.

Rev. 1087 (1986) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The state argues that recent statutory amendments and the legislative rejection of other, proposed amendments indicate a legislative intent that the radio wave portion of cordless telephone conversations are not \u201cwire communications.\u201d The state contends that the amendment in 1989; see Public Acts 1989, No. 89-103; of the definition of \u201cwiretapping,\u201d for purposes of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-187 (a) and 53a-189,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>include <em>\u201ca </em>communication made by a cellular radio telephone\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>; demonstrates the legislature\u2019s awareness of the difference between cellular telephones and cordless telephones. The state also suggests that in 1991 the legislature, in response to this case, rejected House Bill No. 5718. That bill as originally proposed sought to amend the definition of \u201c[wjiretapping\u201d in \u00a7 53a-187 (a) to include communications over both cordless and cellular telephones. On the floor of the House of Representatives, an amendment to the bill was offered that would have also amended \u00a7 54-41a (1) to include explicitly both cellular and cordless telephone conversations within the definition of wire communications. Both the amendment and the bill were rejected by the House.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Relying on this history, including the attending legislative debate, the state would have us draw the inference \u201cthat \u00a7 54-41a (1) was never intended to protect radio-telephone transmissions and does not protect them now.\u201d That history, the state argues, demonstrates that (1) the legislature knows about modern communications technology, (2) the legislature knew how to provide expressly for the application of specific technology, and (3) the 1989 amendment to \u00a7 53a-187 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>supports the state\u2019s argument that \u201ctelephone,\u201d as used in \u00a7 54-41a (1), does not include the radio waves broadcast by a cordless telephone. We cannot give this history the weight that the state assigns to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Although we have on occasion and under limited circumstances looked to subsequent enactments in order to illuminate legislative intent with respect to prior legislation; see, e.g., <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 524, 613 A.2d 748 (1992); we are not persuaded that the legislative activity in 1989 and 1991 illuminates the meaning of \u00a7 54-41a (1) enacted by the 1971 legislature. The 1989 legislation concerned a different statutory scheme, namely, the crime of eavesdropping, which by specific statutory mandate does \u201cnot apply to wiretapping by criminal law enforcement officials in the lawful performance of their duties.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-187 (b); see footnote 27. Furthermore, the intervention of eighteen years casts serious doubt on the validity of any firm inference regarding the legislative intent in 1971. Moreover, although the 1991 legislative debate did relate in part at least to a proposed amendment of \u00a7 54-41a (1), both the twenty year time span and the fact that the proposed legislation also related to other statutes and to cellular telephones counsel strongly against any persuasive inference regarding the meaning of \u201c[w]ire communication\u201d as enacted in 1971. Finally, when we have drawn on legislative rejection of proposed statutory amendments as the basis for an inference of legislative intent, ordinarily \u201cwe have viewed those failures as indicative of legislative approval of an existing interpretation of substantive law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 158, 579 A.2d 58 (1990).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> There is no authoritative prior judicial inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>pretation with respect to which the legislature could have been expressing its approval in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The state also argues that the defendants\u2019 interpretation of \u201c[w]ire communication\u201d as including any communication that travels in part through the telephone lines should be eschewed because it would lead to a host of absurd results. The state contends that the police would be required to secure a judicial wiretap order to listen to cordless telephone conversations that are readily receivable by such commonplace items as ordinary television sets, baby monitors and other cordless telephones. The state also posits that, under the defendants\u2019 construction, such an order would be required: (1) to listen to someone shouting into a telephone; (2) to listen to the tape in a telephone answering machine; (3) to listen to marine radio communications; or (4) to permit an off-duty police officer who, using his own scanner, innocently intercepts a cordless telephone conversation indicating planned criminal activity. We need not go so far in the context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">As we indicated above, we do not decide today that the literal language of \u00a7 54-41a (1), as the defendants would have us read it, necessarily controls all cases. Furthermore, there is serious doubt that, as the cordless telephone technology currently exists, the ease of interception envisioned by the state still obtains. See footnote 11. Finally, as we have acknowledged, a literal reading of \u00a7 54-41a (1) as construed by the state also poses problematic results. We can only say that, if problematic cases arise, we will be required to engage in the same process of a reasoned search for the intent of the legislature that we have employed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">We recognize that this decision runs counter to the numerical weight of authority in other jurisdictions where courts have interpreted either the original federal definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d or similar defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>nitions in their own states.

Although, as we have noted, the applicability of \u00a7 54-41a (1) to cordless telephone technology poses a difficult question, we are not persuaded by the reasoning of the cases reaching a result contrary to our conclusion in this case. Furthermore, in none of those cases was the court presented with the specific legislative history and judicial gloss that inform our interpretation of \u00a7 54-41a (1). We therefore conclude, contrary to those cases, that \u201c[wjire communication\u201d as defined in \u00a7 54-41a (1) includes the radio wave portion of a cordless telephone conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to grant the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>In this opinion Peters, C.

Thus, the defendants argue that, although the federal act served as a model for our act, ours is a purely \u201csystem-based\u201d act, as opposed to the federal act, which was, until its amendment in 1986, \u2018 \u2018hardware-based. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">We are not persuaded that this linguistic difference has the significance that the defendants attach to it. The Senate Report on the 1968 federal wiretap legislation indicates that \u201c[paragraph (1) defines \u2018wire communication\u2019 to include all communications carried by a common carrier, in whole or in part, through our Nation\u2019s communications network. The coverage is intended to be comprehensive.\u201d S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1968), reprinted in 1968 U.S. Code Congressional &amp; Administrative News 2112, 2178. Thus, although the original federal legislation was couched in language that sounds \u201chardware-based,\u201d this report evidences an intent that the legislation be no less \u201csystem-based\u201d than our statute. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>488 F.2d 193, 197 (9th Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\"> Nor are we persuaded by the defendants\u2019 contention that General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a (1) would necessarily govern the radio portion of any communication that travels in part through the telephone lines, irrespective of the degree of publicity of that radio transmission and the degree of attenuation between the radio sending or receiving mechanism and the telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>line. Thus, we do not decide today whether the definition of wire communication found in \u00a7 54-41a (1) necessarily includes the radio portion of a ship-to-shore radio telephone message that is freely available to the Coast Guard and to any other ship within radio range, but that eventually enters the communications system of the telephone utility company. It is certainly arguable that such a communication would not be a wire communication, despite the literal language of \u00a7 54-41a (1), because the purpose of the statutory scheme requiring judicial wiretap orders is to protect privacy rights. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>223 Conn. 731, 613 A.2d 804 (1992) (tape recording of 911 telephone call not a \u201cstatement\u201d despite literal language of Practice Book \u00a7 749 [2]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b634-6\"> The state responds to this concern by arguing that a third party, using a wired telephone, who converses with someone over the telephone lines has only a hope, rather than an expectation, of privacy, because there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>always the risk that the other party may share that conversation with others. Thus, the state contends, such a third party who speaks with someone using a cordless telephone is in no worse position by virtue of excluding cordless telephone conversations from the ambit of General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a (1). The difference, however, is that when an individual converses over the telephone, although he certainly runs the risk that <em>the other </em>party may publicize his conversation, he ordinarily does not expect that others are also listening without the consent of either party to the conversation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b635-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-41k provides: \u201cservice of notice of interception; INSPECTION OF INTERCEPTED COMMUNICATIONS, APPLICATIONS and orders; postponement of service.

In that unusual circumstance, however, the rejection was accompanied by a simultaneous enactment of legislation that covered the same subject matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b646-5\">Callahan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6B\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. I do not believe that the broadcast of radio waves into public airspace constitutes a \u201cwire communication\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">I agree with the majority that in attempting to discover the intent of the legislature \u201c \u2018we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation. . . \u201d <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 460, 600 A.2d 310 (1991). I do not detect from any of those factors, however, that the 1971 legislature intended, when it enacted the wiretap statutes, that the radio wave segment of cordless telephone communications would constitute wire communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">I disagree with the majority that the portion of \u00a7 54-41a (1) that states that \u201cany communication made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications\u201d determines that the wiretap statutes cover all communications that, at some point, are carried over telephone lines. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Delaurier, </em>488 A.2d 688, 693 (R.I. 1985). I believe that the majority imposes a strained and overly broad reading on the definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d that ignores critical limitations in its scope. By disregarding those limitations the majority has come to a conclusion contrary to the majority of jurisdictions nationwide. Most of the courts that have considered the issue of cordless telephone communications have held that such communications, prior to entering the facilities of a common carrier, are not wire communications. See, e.g., <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Berodt, </em>877 F.2d 705 (8th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1022, 110 S. Ct. 723, 107 L. Ed. 2d 743 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>235 Kan. 236, 679 P.2d 197 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delaurier, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>149 Wis. 2d 89, 438 N.W.2d 571 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In order to arrive at the result that it does, the majority neutralizes the phrase in the definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d that indicates that the wiretap statutes are to apply only to \u201cfacilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of telephone or telegraph between the point of origin and the point of reception furnished or operated by any person engaged as a common carrier in providing or operating such facilities.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a (1). I believe that phrase manifests a legislative intent that the protection afforded telephonic communications exists only within the parameters of communications systems furnished or operated by a common carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In downplaying the importance of the limiting language in the definition, the majority has contravened an elementary canon of statutory construction that requires that \u201cno part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant or unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 274, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 86, 110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 20, 404 A.2d 873 (1978). The majority has, consequently, misconstrued the intent of the legislature and has applied the wiretap statutes to radio waves in the public airspace. I find it hard to imagine that the statutes regulating wiretaps were ever intended to have any such application. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 102-103. The majority has, I believe, with the best of intentions, expanded the definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d to bring about what it perceives to be a desirable end.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>The 1991 legislature, however, when faced with the very question raised by this case, defeated a bill expressly calculated to bring the wireless, radio wave segment of communications via cordless telephone under the protective wing of the wiretap statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It seems a bit incongruous that the 1991 legislature, which undoubtedly had knowledge of and information available concerning cordless telephone technology, rejected an opportunity to include cordless communications within the protection of the wiretap statutes while the 1971 legislature, which would have had little or no knowledge of such technology, intended that the radio wave component of such communications be protected. I believe that the majority, in the guise of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>interpretation, has legislated on a matter of public policy. That is not the function of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-5\"> Representative William Wollenberg, in addressing this proposed legislation on the floor of the House of Representatives in the 1991 legislative session, stated, inter alia: \u201cLadies and gentlemen of this Chamber, if we want law and order in our streets, let\u2019s start some place.

It\u2019s no good. We\u2019re going too far to protect the criminal rights in doing these kinds of things.
