The plaintiff, J. Blaine Lewis, filed an administrative appeal in the Superior Court from a decision terminating the plaintiff\u2019s employment with the defendant division of special revenue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Superior Court, <em>Norko, J., </em>dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s administrative appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiff appealed from the court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant state depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ment of revenue services in its division of special revenue (division). For nine years, until 1989, the plaintiff served as the head of the lottery unit of the division. The division works in cooperation with the defendant gaming policy board (board) to implement and administer all Connecticut lottery games. The plaintiffs immediate supervisor was the defendant William V. Hickey, executive director of the division.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">On May 16, 1989, the executive director informed the plaintiff that the division was changing one of the lottery games, LOTTO, from a game consisting of forty numbers to one consisting of forty-four numbers. The executive director ordered the plaintiff to design and implement the changed format and to prepare a favorable presentation of the changed format to the board. The plaintiff refused to comply with the executive director\u2019s order and requested that the executive director withdraw the order. The executive director thereupon placed the plaintiff on paid leave of absence. On May 22, 1989, the plaintiff was notified that a \u201cpre-disciplinary decision hearing\u201d would be conducted before the executive director on May 24, 1989, pursuant to the division\u2019s personnel procedure No. 1, to discuss the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to comply with the executive director\u2019s order. The executive director himself presided at the \u201cpredisciplinary decision hearing\u201d and terminated the plaintiff\u2019s employment for disobeying his order.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Thereafter, the executive director requested that the board add the matter of his decision to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s employment to its agenda for its next executive session. At an executive session of the board on May 26, 1989, the plaintiff appeared, accompanied by counsel, to testify on his own behalf. At the conclusion of a summary proceeding, the board voted in favor of a resolution to approve the executive director\u2019s decision to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>On August 17,1989, the plaintiff appealed the order of termination to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a) of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs action based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that the plaintiff had not appealed from a \u201ccontested case\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4-166 (2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Freed, J., </em>denied the defendants\u2019 motion. The defendants then filed an answer to the plaintiffs complaint in which they alleged as a special defense that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s appeal was assigned to Judge Raymond R. Norko, who heard argument on both the merits of, and the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over, the appeal. The court, <em>Norko, J., </em>dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, concluding that the court was without subject matter jurisdiction because the proceedings surrounding the plaintiff\u2019s termination from the division did not involve a \u201ccontested case\u201d as required under the UAPA. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The plaintiff argues on appeal to this court that the trial court, <em>Norko, J., </em>improperly: (1) reviewed and reversed a decision of a coordinate court; (2) concluded that the proceedings surrounding the plaintiffs termination from employment with the division did not constitute a contested case under \u00a7 4-166 (2) from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>he had a right to appeal; and (3) failed to address whether the plaintiffs right to employment as secured by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-51m and 31-51q was sufficient to qualify the termination proceedings for \u201ccontested case\u201d status. We conclude that Judge Norko properly reviewed the prior ruling by a coordinate judge on the issue of the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs appeal and the court properly dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal because the appeal had not been taken from a decision in a contested case.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The plaintiff first claims that Judge Norko improperly reviewed and reversed the decision of Judge Freed on the issue of whether the proceedings terminating the plaintiff\u2019s employment with the division constituted a contested case. The plaintiff argues that, under the doctrine of the law of the case, the previous ruling was binding on Judge Norko and there was no cause for review or reversal of that ruling. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">\u201cThe law of the case . . . expresses the practice of judges generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided and it is not a limitation on their power. . . . Where a matter has previously been ruled upon interlocutorily, the court in a subsequent proceeding in the case may treat that decision as the law of the case, if it is of the opinion that the issue was correctly decided . . . .\u201d <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>186 Conn. 86, 99, 439 A.2d 1066 (1982). \u201cNevertheless, if the case comes before [a subsequent judge] regularly and he becomes convinced that the view of the law previously applied by his coordinate predecessor was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice if followed, he may apply his own judgment.\u201d Id., 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">On November 29, 1990, Judge Freed addressed the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s appeal pursuant to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>and concluded that the plaintiffs appeal presented a contested case under \u00a7 4-166 (2). Thereafter, Judge Norko, on November 14, 1991, again addressed the same issue after it had been reasserted as a special defense in the defendants\u2019 answer to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Judge Norko recognized that, although the law of the case doctrine ordinarily restrains a judge\u2019s review of a prior ruling in the same case by a coordinate judge, the doctrine did not prevent him from revisiting the issue of the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">It is a fundamental rule that a court may raise and review the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any time. <em>Sasso </em>v. <em>Aleshin, </em>197 Conn. 87, 89, 495 A.2d 1066 (1985). Practice Book \u00a7 145 provides: \u201cAny claim of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter cannot be waived; and whenever it is found after the suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 11.\u201d <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>202 Conn. 93, 101, 520 A.2d 155 (1987). \u201c \u2018[A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction . . . <em>Neyland v. Board of Education, </em>195 Conn. 174, 181, 487 A.2d 181 (1985), quoting <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 379, 101 S. Ct. 669, 66 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1981). \u201cThe objection of want of jurisdiction may be made at any time . . . [a]nd the court or tribunal may act on its own motion, and should do so when the lack of jurisdiction is called to its attention.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>204 Conn. 17, 35, 526 A.2d 1318 (1987); <em>Woodmont Assn. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>85 Conn. 517, 524, 84 A. 307 (1912). \u201cThe requirement of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived by any party and can be raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>at any stage in the proceedings. . . . If at any point, it becomes apparent to the court that such jurisdiction is lacking, the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d <em>Laurel Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>194 Conn. 677, 679 n.1, 485 A.2d 1272 (1984); see also Practice Book \u00a7 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The obligation of Judge Norko to revisit a claim of lack of jurisdiction made in the defendants\u2019 answer to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint tempers the application of the doctrine of the law of the case. Although Judge Norko\u2019s review of the first ruling was not predicated on the existence of new evidence or a change in the law since the first ruling, it revealed a conviction on his part that the prior decision was clearly erroneous. <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>supra, 100. Furthermore, because we determine herein that the initial ruling on the issue of the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction was in fact incorrect, the plaintiff\u2019s first claim is without merit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the termination proceedings before the administrative agency did not constitute a \u201ccontested case\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2), and, as a consequence, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">There is no absolute right of appeal to the courts from a decision of an administrative agency. See <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>202 Conn. 150, 154, 520 A.2d 186 (1987). \u201cThe UAPA grants the Superior Court jurisdiction over appeals of agency decisions only in certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>limited and well delineated circumstances.\u201d <em>New England Dairies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Agriculture, </em>221 Conn. 422, 427, 604 A.2d 810 (1992). Judicial review of an administrative decision is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a) of the UAPA, which provides that \u201c[a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies . . . and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the superior court . . . .\u201d A final decision is defined in \u00a7 4-166 (3) (A) as \u201cthe agency determination in a <em>contested case . . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">A \u201ccontested case\u201d is defined in \u00a7 4-166 (2) as \u201ca proceeding ... in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required <em>by statute </em>to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added). Not every matter or issue determined by an agency qualifies for contested case status. See, e.g., <em>New England Dairies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Agriculture, </em>supra. \u201c[W]e have determined that even in a case where a hearing is \u2018in fact held,\u2019 in order to constitute a contested case, a party to that hearing must have enjoyed a statutory right to have his \u2018legal rights, duties or privileges\u2019 determined by that agency holding the hearing. ... In the instance where no party to a hearing enjoys such a right, the Superior Court is without jurisdiction over any appeal from that agency\u2019s determination.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The plaintiff asserts that he possessed a legal right or privilege in his continued employment with the division and that the defendants were required by statute <em>or regulation </em>to determine that legal right or privilege only after providing an opportunity for a meaningful hearing. Even if the plaintiff did have a legal right or privilege in continued employment with the division, and even if that right or privilege was terminated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>a deficient proceeding before the executive director and the board, the plaintiff still cannot prevail unless the defendants were <em>statutorily </em>required to determine the plaintiffs legal right or privilege to his continued employment in a hearing. See, e.g., <em>New England Dairies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Agriculture, </em>supra, 429 (commissioner of agriculture was not required by statute to determine a milk dealer\u2019s right to a license after an opportunity for a hearing); <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 471, 378 A.2d 547 (1977) (commission was not required by statute to provide an opportunity for a hearing prior to denying a state employee\u2019s written request to change retirement plans); <em>Taylor v. Robinson, </em>171 Conn. 691, 697, 372 A.2d 102 (1976) (parole board had no statutory obligation to determine if a prisoner should be released from parole).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">To ascertain whether a statute requires an agency to determine the legal rights, privileges or duties of a party, we need to examine all the statutory provisions that govern the activities of the particular agency or agencies in question. <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>supra, 471. Chapter 226 of the General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 12-557 through 12-578, controls the activities of the division of special revenue and the gaming policy board. The division works in cooperation with the board to implement and administer all legalized gambling in Connecticut. General Statutes \u00a7 12-557e. The executive director of the division, under General Statutes \u00a7 12-562 (a), \u201cshall have power generally to do whatever is reasonably necessary for the carrying out of the intent of this chapter . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Before both Judges Freed and Norko, the plaintiff asserted that the statutory requirement obligating the defendants to determine the plaintiff\u2019s legal right or privilege in his continued employment is found in General Statutes \u00a7 12-559, which provides in relevant part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>that \u201cthe executive director shall, with the advice and consent of the board, appoint unit heads for each of the units created within the division, who shall be exempt from classified service.\u201d The plaintiff reasoned that, because \u00a7 12-559 requires that the executive director appoint unit heads with the advice and consent of the board, it implies that the executive director, with the advice and consent of the board, must determine whether to continue to employ the plaintiff as a unit head. Judge Freed agreed with the plaintiff\u2019s construction of \u00a7 12-559. Judge Norko, however, found that the text of \u00a7 12-559 neither states nor suggests that the statutory right to appoint unit heads creates a corresponding <em>statutory </em>duty to determine, in any type of proceeding, the right or privilege of a unit head to continue state employment. Judge Norko concluded that if the legislature had intended that the defendants were to be statutorily obligated to determine a unit head\u2019s legal right or privilege in continued employment in a hearing, it would have so provided. We agree with this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The statutes applicable to this case imply, if anything, that the legislature intended that the executive director <em>not </em>be required to determine the legal rights or privileges of unit heads in their continued employment after an opportunity for a hearing. Section 12-562 vests in the executive director \u201cpower generally to do whatever is reasonably necessary for the carrying out of the intent of this chapter . . . .\u201d Moreover, unit heads in the division of special revenue, as appointed officials, serve \u201cat the pleasure of\u201d the executive director. General Statutes \u00a7 4-la.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fact that the plaintiff served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>\u201cat the pleasure of\u201d the executive director indicates that the executive director was not statutorily required to determine the plaintiffs legal right or privilege in continued employment after providing an opportunity for a hearing. Consequently, in the absence of an express statutory requirement obligating the defendants to determine the plaintiffs legal right or privilege to continued employment, the plaintiffs claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The plaintiff also argues that the termination by the defendants of his employment with the division qualified as a contested case because an agency personnel policy required that the defendants determine the plaintiffs legal right or privilege in continued employment subsequent to his having had a meaningful opportunity to be heard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In support of his argument, the plaintiff suggests that the test for determining whether a proceeding is a contested case was expanded in <em>All Brand Importers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>213 Conn. 184, 212, 567 A.2d 1156 (1989), wherein the court stated that \u201c[t]o qualify a proceeding as a \u2018contested case\u2019 under \u00a7 4-166 (2) and, thus, to be entitled to a \u2018hearing,\u2019 a party must have a statutory or <em>regulatory </em>right to be heard by the agency.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The plaintiff misconstrues AM <em>Brand Importers, Inc. </em>The court, in <em>All Brand Importers, Inc., cited Herman </em>v. <em>Division of Special Revenue, </em>193 Conn. 379, 477 A.2d 119 (1984), in support of the above proposition. In <em>Herman, </em>we stated: \u201cIn order for a proceeding to qualify as a \u2018hearing\u2019 for the purposes of [a contested case], the party must have a statutory or <em>regulatory </em>right to be heard by the agency.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 383. In <em>Herman, </em>the division of special revenue granted a hearing at the request of a plaintiff who wished to be reinstated as a jai alai patron after he had been ejected from the Milford Jai Alai Fronton. The division stated that, although it would provide a hearing, it was not required to do so by statute or regulation. Id., 380. At the hearing, the plaintiff asked that he be reinstated, and his request was denied. On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claimed that the hearing regarding his reinstatement was a \u201ccontested case\u201d under \u00a7 4-166 (2) because it was a hearing that was in fact held before the division. In reviewing this claim, the court in <em>Herman </em>found that a \u201chearing\u201d had taken place; it then addressed the issue of whether the fact that a hearing had actually been held established the proceedings as a contested case under the UAPA. We concluded that because the division was not <em>\u201cstatutorily required </em>to determine the eligibility for reinstatement of an ejected patron . . . there was no contested case to which the provisions of the UAPA might apply.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 386-87. The reference in <em>Herman, </em>therefore, to a regulatory requirement for a hearing was dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In light of <em>Herman, </em>whether a hearing qualifies for contested case status under \u00a7 4-166 (2) is a different inquiry from whether a hearing is required by a regulation to be held. Although an agency rule, policy or regulation may require a hearing, that hearing will not qualify the proceedings as a contested case unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>agency is <em>statutorily </em>required to determine the legal rights or privileges of the party aggrieved in that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Neither <em>Herman </em>nor <em>All Brand Importers, Inc., </em>stands for the proposition that a regulation simply requiring an agency to hold a hearing will qualify a proceeding for \u201ccontested case\u201d status under \u00a7 4-166 (2). In <em>Herman, </em>upon which <em>All Brand Importers, Inc., </em>is based, we stated: \u201cThe test for determining contested case status has been well established and requires an inquiry into three criteria, to wit: (1) whether a legal right, duty or privilege is at issue, (2) and is <em>statutorily </em>required to be determined by the agency, (3) through an opportunity for [a] hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Division of Special Revenue, </em>supra, 382. Under this test, although agency regulations, rules or policies may require the agency to hold a hearing, that does not constitute a matter as a \u201ccontested case\u201d under \u00a7 4-166 (2) unless the plaintiffs rights or privileges are \u201cstatutorily\u201d required to be determined by the agency. If the plaintiffs rights or privileges are not \u201cstatutorily\u201d required to be determined by the agency, a \u201ccontested case\u201d does not exist and a plaintiff would have no right to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The plaintiff asserts that in <em>All Brand Importers, Inc., </em>we implied that a regulation requiring an agency to hold a hearing is sufficient to qualify the proceeding for \u201ccontested case\u201d status under \u00a7 4-166 (2). We find nothing in <em>All Brand Importers, Inc., </em>that justifies interpreting the clear language of \u00a7 4-166 (2) to include agency regulations necessitating a hearing as a source of authority for requiring that an agency must statutorily determine a party\u2019s legal rights or privileges. Even where a hearing was in fact held we have found that the proceeding did not constitute a \u201ccontested case\u201d because there was no <em>statutory </em>mandate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>that rights or privileges be determined. <em>New England Dairies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Agriculture, </em>supra, 427. \u201c[W]hen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). \u201cThe intent of the legislature, as this court has repeatedly observed, is to be found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>184 Conn. 317, 325, 439 A.2d 1008 (1981); <em>Federal Aviation Administration </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>196 Conn. 546, 549-50, 494 A.2d 564 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The \u201crequired by statute\u201d language in \u00a7 4-166 (2), if construed according to its commonly approved usage, can only mean that before a proceeding qualifies as a contested case, an agency must be obligated by an act promulgated by the legislature to determine the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-1. A proceeding in which only an agency rule, regulation or policy requires a determination of rights after a hearing will not qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Not only the text, but also the legislative history of \u00a7 4-166 (2) supports our reading of the statute. When first enacted in 1973, \u00a7 4-166 (2) contained the language \u201crequired by law\u201d rather than \u201crequired by statute.\u201d The phrase \u201crequired by law\u201d is found in the 1961 Model State Administrative Procedure Act, and is also found in the statutes of most other jurisdictions that have adopted the model act. Model State Administrative Procedure Act (1961) \u00a7 1 (2), 14 Uniform Laws Annotated (1980) 357; 1F. Cooper, State Administrative Law (1965) p. 120. The term \u201claw\u201d as contained in the contested case provisions in other jurisdictions has a broader meaning than the term \u201cstatute,\u201d and has been interpreted in other jurisdictions to refer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>generically to any species of law, including constitutional provisions, and agency rules, regulations and policies. See, e.g., <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Softich, </em>167 Mont. 70, 77, 535 P.2d 178 (1975) (interpreting the \u201crequired by law\u201d language in the contested case provision in Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 82-4202 [3] [1975] to include an agency rule). In 1973, the Connecticut legislature amended \u00a7 4-166 (2) and replaced the \u201crequired by law\u201d language with \u201crequired by statute.\u201d Public Acts 1973, No. 73-620, \u00a7 2. By amending \u00a7 4-166 (2) to replace the phrase, \u201crequired by law,\u201d with the phrase, \u201crequired by statute,\u201d the legislature clearly manifested an intent that only a determination of rights, duties and privileges required by statute would constitute a basis for a \u201ccontested case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The interpretation ascribed to the \u201crequired by statute\u201d language contained in other state and federal administrative procedure provisions similar to \u00a7 4-166 (2) is consistent with our reading of Connecticut\u2019s contested case provision. For example, Iowa\u2019s contested case provision states that a \u201c \u2018[contested case\u2019 means a proceeding ... in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by Constitution or <em>statute </em>to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7 17A.2 (2) (1989). The Iowa Supreme Court has consistently followed the analysis of Iowa\u2019s contested case provision set forth in Professor Arthur E. Bonfield\u2019s article, \u201cThe Definition of Formal Agency Adjudication Under the Iowa Administrative Procedure Act,\u201d 63 Iowa L. Rev. 285 (1977). See, e.g., <em>Allegre </em>v. <em>State Board of Regents, </em>349 N.W.2d 112, 114 (Iowa 1984); <em>Polk County </em>v. <em>State Appeal Board, </em>330 N.W.2d 267, 276 (Iowa 1983). In his article, Professor Bonfield wrote that in order to be a \u201ccontested case\u201d the rights and privileges of a party must be required, under the Iowa Code, to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>determined by \u201cConstitution or statute,\u201d and that a right or privilege conferred by agency rule or policy would not suffice. A. Bonfield, supra, 308. He based his conclusion on the plain meaning of the specific language used, and on the fact that the language was purposely chosen to accomplish that result.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Professor Bonfield, a recognized authority on state administrative law and the author of the treatise, State Administrative Rule Making (1986), had recommended to a subcommittee of the Iowa General Assembly studying the state administrative procedure act that the phrase \u201crequired by Constitution or statute\u201d replace the \u201crequired by law\u201d language contained in the 1961 Model State Administrative Procedure Act from which the Iowa Administrative Procedure Act had originally drawn its language. The effect of this recommendation was to exclude agency rules, regulations or policies as sources of law sufficient to render a proceeding a contested case. A. Bonfield, supra, 63 Iowa L. Rev. 304-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Moreover, the federal Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s provision regarding formal adjudications; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554 (a) (1992); contains language similar to the \u201crequired by statute\u201d language in \u00a7 4-166 (2) and has been interpreted to exclude those adjudications that are required only by agency rule. The federal statute states that the provisions pertaining to formal adjudication apply \u201cin every case of adjudication <em>required by statute </em>to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554 (a) (1992). The United States Supreme Court has stated: \u201cWe think that the limitation to hearings \u2018required by statute\u2019in . . . the Administrative Procedure Act exempts from that section\u2019s application only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>those hearings which administrative agencies may hold by regulation, rule, custom, or special dispensation; not those held by compulsion. We . . . think the limiting words . . . exempt hearings of less than statutory authority . . . .\u201d <em>Wong Yang Sung </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>339 U.S. 33, 50, 70 S. Ct. 445, 94 L. Ed. 616, modified, 339 U.S. 908, 70 S. Ct. 564, 94 L. Ed. 1336 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Although \u00a7 4-166 (2) excludes a large class of agency decision-making from contested case status, it nonetheless provides that the legislature, rather than the agencies, has the primary and continuing role in deciding which class of proceedings should enjoy the full panoply of procedural protections afforded by the UAPA to contested cases, including the right to appellate review by the judiciary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Deciding which class of cases qualifies for contested case status reflects an important matter of public policy and \u201cthe primary responsibility for formulating public policy must remain with the legislature.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whiteman, </em>204 Conn. 98, 103, 526 A.2d 869 (1987); see <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 491, 313 A.2d 53 (1972), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">On the basis of a plain reading of \u00a7 4-166 (2), which clearly manifests a legislative intention to limit contested case status to a proceeding in which an agency is statutorily required to determine a party\u2019s legal rights or privileges, we conclude that the proceeding terminating the plaintiff\u2019s employment was not a contested case. Consequently, Judge Norko properly dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s administrative appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Finally, the plaintiff claims that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-51m and 31-51q serve as statutory authority for the purpose of the definition of \u201ccontested case\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2). The plaintiff argues that \u00a7\u00a7 31-51m and 31-51q require that the agency determine the plaintiffs legal interest in continued employment with the division after an opportunity for a meaningful hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The record below does not indicate that the plaintiff ever advanced such a claim to either Judge Norko or Judge Freed and neither mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>orandum of decision addresses this claim. The complaint filed by the plaintiff merely cited \u00a7 31-51q and stated that the termination proceedings were in violation of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Even if we were to review this final claim, it is clear that the plaintiffs reliance on these statutes to mandate an administrative appeal is misplaced. Sections 31-51m and 31-51q create causes of action enforceable in Superior Court to protect employees from illegal retaliatory action. See, e.g., <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>211 Conn. 370, 559 A.2d 701 (1989). There is nothing in either statute that suggests that an agency is required to determine a party\u2019s legal right or privilege to public employment after an opportunity for an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The judgment of the trial court, <em>Norko, </em>Jis affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\"> The defendants are the state gaming policy board, the state department of revenue services and its division of special revenue, and William V.
