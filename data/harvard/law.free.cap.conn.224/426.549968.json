J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABS\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether a New York corporation having its primary place of business in Connecticut has engaged in sufficient activity in New York to satisfy the \u201cconducts business\u201d requirement of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 12-218,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thereby qualifying the corporation for an apportionment of its taxable income between Connecticut and New York. The plaintiff, Altray Company, Inc. (taxpayer), sought to amend three previously filed tax returns, upon which it had paid Connecticut corporation income taxes, because it claimed the right to appor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>tion income to New York. The defendant, the commissioner of revenue services (commissioner), denied the amended returns and the corresponding request for refund of a portion of the taxes previously paid. The taxpayer sought review in the Superior Court of the commissioner\u2019s final decision denying the refund request. The trial court dismissed the appeal. The taxpayer appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The parties stipulated to the following facts. The taxpayer is a New York corporation with its principal place of business in Greenwich, Connecticut. It is engaged in the import business and primarily acts as an agent facilitating domestic purchases of candies and confectioneries from foreign vendors. In the course of this business, the taxpayer purchases and resells the candies, and arranges to have them shipped from foreign vendors and delivered to subsequent purchasers\u2019 warehouses located in states other than Connecticut and New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">During 1983,1984 and 1985, the taxpayer augmented the business conducted at its Connecticut office through its president\u2019s numerous, repeated and regular meetings with foreign vendors at his residential apartment in New York City. These meetings averaged in number approximately three per month. At these meetings, held in New York for the convenience of visiting overseas suppliers, the taxpayer placed orders with the foreign vendors.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Because of its incorporation in New York, the taxpayer was subject to that state\u2019s corporation franchise tax. For the relevant income years it paid the statutory minimum tax due to New York. The taxpayer also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>paid taxes to Connecticut for the privilege of carrying on business in this state, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 12-214.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its original returns, filed in 1983, 1984 and 1985, the taxpayer paid the Connecticut tax measured by its entire net income. In 1986, however, the taxpayer filed amended returns for the three prior years that apportioned its net income between Connecticut and New York. Pursuant to this apportionment, the taxpayer recalculated its previously paid Connecticut corporation taxes due. Because this recalculation resulted in a claimed reduction of its tax liability, the taxpayer requested a refund of excess taxes paid, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The commissioner denied the amended returns, determining that the taxpayer \u201cdoes not conduct business without the State of Connecticut.\u201d The taxpayer protested this denial, and requested a hearing before the commissioner so that it could present additional evidence regarding its right to apportion its income between Connecticut and New York. After the hearing, the commissioner issued a final order denying the taxpayer\u2019s protest. It concluded that \u201c[t]his company has not established that it conducts business outside of Connecticut .... The audit assessment is found to be correct and lawful.\u201d The commissioner neither decided nor addressed the merits of the taxpayer\u2019s position regarding the amount of the claimed refund or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>figures offered to support the refund amount in the event that apportionment should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The taxpayer appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 12-237,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> complaining that it was entitled to apportion its income. Specifically, the taxpayer maintained that its activity in New York amounted to conducting business for the purpose of \u00a7 12-218. The taxpayer also maintained that, even if its activity was not sufficient to allow apportionment, the commissioner was estopped in this case from denying the claim for a refund. Finally, the taxpayer sought a judgment awarding it the full amount of its requested refund instead of a remand to the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The trial court, following a de novo review of the taxpayer\u2019s claim, dismissed the appeal. The trial court determined that \u00a7 12-218 was a tax exemption statute that should be construed against the taxpayer. The trial court also determined that the proper meaning of the \u00a7 12-218 \u201cconducts business\u201d requirement was \u201ccarrying on business\u201d as defined in related tax provisions and that, pursuant to that standard, the taxpayer had not conducted business in New York. The trial court dismissed the taxpayer\u2019s estoppel argument on the grounds that the commissioner\u2019s response was neither binding on the commissioner nor had it been relied upon by the taxpayer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>On appeal, the taxpayer challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that it did not conduct business in New York during the income years 1983, 1984 and 1985. The taxpayer claims that: (1) the trial court improperly determined that \u00a7 12-218 is a tax statute that provides an exemption rather than one that imposes a tax; (2) the trial court improperly interpreted the \u201cconducts business\u201d requirement in \u00a7 12-218 in disregard of the commissioner\u2019s pretrial discovery statement adopting a standard that would give legal effect to the taxpayer\u2019s incorporation in New York; (3) the trial court, under any reasonable construction of the \u201cconducts business\u201d requirement of \u00a7 12-218, misapplied that requirement in light of the taxpayer\u2019s stipulated New York activities; and (4) if this court sustains its appeal, it has established its entitlement to a refund in the amount requested. Our review of these claims is plenary; see <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>222 Conn. 49, 53, 607 A.2d 424 (1992); and we will reverse the trial court if its conclusions are legally or logically incorrect or find no support in the facts that appear in the record. Id.; <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 752, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). Because we agree with the taxpayer, first, that the apportionment provision is an imposition statute, and, second, that the taxpayer satisfies even the commissioner\u2019s standard for \u201cconducts business,\u201d the appeal must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">As a preliminary matter, the taxpayer asks us to review the trial court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 12-218 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>properly considered a tax exemption statute, and not a tax imposition statute. If a statute that imposes a tax is ambiguous either on its face or in its application, a taxpayer is entitled to a construction in its favor; conversely, a statute providing for a tax exemption must be construed in favor of the state. <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>supra, 54; <em>The B. F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>196 Conn. 1, 6, 490 A.2d 991 (1985); <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. v. Sullivan, </em>161 Conn. 145, 154, 285 A. 2d 352 (1971). We agree with the taxpayer that \u00a7 12-218 involves the imposition of a tax, and, therefore, that any ambiguity must be resolved in its favor and against the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>202 Conn. 412, 423, 521 A.2d 569 (1987), which addressed the construction of the apportionment formulae provisions of \u00a7 12-218, we resolved ambiguities in the statute in favor of the taxpayer. See also <em>The B. F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra. Although our decision did not turn on an explicit determination that \u00a7 12-218 was an imposition statute, we now hold that this is the proper characterization and rule of construction to apply in cases involving disputes over any provision of \u00a7 12-218.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The apportionment statute, although itself not a taxing statute, provides the criteria and formulae for determining net income subject to the state\u2019s corporation tax. Section 12-214, which imposes the corporation tax,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides that the tax is \u201cto be measured by the entire net income . . . from business <em>transacted within the state </em>during the income year.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Significantly, \u00a7 12-214 does not provide any guidance to determine the measure of \u201cbusiness trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>acted within the state.\u201d Such guidance is found, however, in \u00a7 12-218. That section states that a taxpayer is to apply the formula \u201cprovided in this section\u201d to calculate net income taxable within this state. Because \u00a7 12-218 is an integral component of this state\u2019s tax imposition scheme; see also <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>202 Conn. 583, 594, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); it cannot properly be characterized as a statute providing a taxpayer exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The commissioner resists this characterization on the ground that apportionment of net income under \u00a7 12-218 operates to exclude from taxation a portion of corporate income otherwise subject to \u00a7 12-214. Emphasizing that qualification for apportionment is a separate inquiry from application of the various apportioning formulae, the commissioner argues that cases such as <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, do not control the resolution of this appeal because, in those cases, neither the multistate nature of the corporation nor the resulting qualification to apportion income was at issue. Conceding that the application of apportionment formulae is an imposition of taxing authority; id., 423; the commissioner asserts nonetheless that the taxpayer\u2019s prerequisite showing that it qualifies for the right to apportion its net income requires the conclusion that \u00a7 12-218 operates as an exemption provision for such purposes. In effect, the commissioner asks us to bifurcate the characterization of the apportionment statute. An analysis of whether a corporation qualifies to apportion income would proceed under \u00a7 12-218 as a tax exemption statute; an analysis of questions regarding the application of apportionment formulae would proceed as if the statute imposed a tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">We decline to adopt the commissioner\u2019s bifurcated analysis for two reasons. As a statutory matter, the commissioner\u2019s argument cannot be reconciled with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>language of \u00a7 12:214, which limits the reach of the corporation tax to that income from business \u201ctransacted <em>within </em>the state.\u201d This statutory limitation mirrors the second difficulty with the commissioner\u2019s position, which is that it ignores established federal constitutional constraints on state taxation of interstate corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Well established federal law limits the taxing power of a state in accordance with the provisions of the commerce and due process clauses of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>430 U.S. 274, 279, 97 S. Ct. 1076, 51 L. Ed. 2d 326, reh. denied, 430 U.S. 976, 97 S. Ct. 1669, 52 L. Ed. 2d 371 (1977) (commerce clause); <em>Mobil Oil Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes of Vermont, </em>445 U.S. 425, 436-37, 100 S. Ct. 1223, 63 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1980) (due process clause). Without apportionment, the state\u2019s corporation tax would be constitutionally suspect. Cf. <em>Underwood Typewriter Co. </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>254 U.S. 113, 41 S. Ct. 45, 65 L. Ed. 165 (1920). Because the state does not have the power to tax that portion of income attributable to activity outside its borders, the apportionment provisions necessarily operate to determine the extent of the state\u2019s power to impose a tax. Accordingly, the state cannot assert a right to impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>a tax on a corporation\u2019s entire net income, regardless of its origin, and then characterize as an exemption the corporation\u2019s claim that the state lacked the authority to tax in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We conclude, therefore, that in cases involving the right to apportion income under \u00a7 12-218, as in other cases involving the imposition of a tax, the applicable principles of construction favor the taxpayer rather than the commissioner. <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>supra. In case of ambiguity in the governing statute, it must be construed in favor of the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Viewing \u00a7 12-218 as a statute that imposes a tax, we now turn to the substantive issue of the application of its apportionment requirement to the taxpayer in this case. We must decide how to construe the provision in \u00a7 12-218 that \u201c[f]or purposes of apportionment of income under this section, a taxpayer is taxable in another state if in such state such taxpayer conducts business,\u201d and then apply the statute to the stipulated facts concerning the taxpayer\u2019s commercial conduct in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The phrase \u201cconducts business\u201d is not defined either by statute or by a properly promulgated tax regulation. The commissioner proposes that we construe \u201cconducts business\u201d to be the equivalent of \u201ccarrying on business,\u201d as that phrase is used in other provisions of the corporation tax statutes and regulations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The taxpayer counters, however, that the commissioner has elsewhere embraced a broader rule encompassing not only \u201ccarrying on business,\u201d but also \u201cthe right to carry on business.\u201d The taxpayer relies, for this contention, on the commissioner\u2019s answer to a pretrial interrogatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>that explicitly stated this broader test for the measure of \u201cconducts business.\u201d The commissioner responds that the taxpayer has misconstrued its reply to the interrogatory, and continues to advance \u201ccarrying on business\u201d as the proper test for \u201cconducts business.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The taxpayer has assigned as a separate claim of error the trial court\u2019s alleged failure to give appropriate weight to the commissioner\u2019s reply to its interrogatory. We need not address that contention, however, because we conclude that the taxpayer\u2019s right to apportionment can be sustained even if we apply the commissioner\u2019s construction of \u201cconducts business.\u201d Furthermore, an agency\u2019s construction of the statutes entrusted to it for enforcement is generally persuasive, even if it is not dispositive. See <em>Phelps Dodge Copper </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>204 Conn. 122, 128-30, 527 A.2d 672 (1987); <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The commissioner\u2019s test equating \u201cconducts business\u201d with \u201ccarrying on business\u201d refers us to the definition of \u201ccarrying on business\u201d that appears in related corporate tax statutes and regulations. General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 12-213 defines \u201ccarrying on or doing business\u201d as \u201cmean[ing] and includ[ing] each and every act, power or privilege exercised or enjoyed in this state, as an incident to, or by virtue of, the powers and privileges acquired by the nature of any [corporate] organization.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This statutory definition is effectively narrowed, according to the commissioner, by the definition of \u201ccarrying on business\u201d contained in \u00a7 12-214-1 (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. The regulation states that \u201c[a] company is \u2018carrying on business in this state\u2019 if, within this state, it engages in one or more of the following activities, <em>including but not limited to: </em>[e.g.] ... (2) maintaining an office ... (3) selling tangible personal property (as opposed to soliciting orders therefor) ... (7) having an employee, wherever based . . . coordinate the delivery of merchandise.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>The taxpayer maintains that its meetings in New York meet the statutory definition of \u201ccarrying on business.\u201d During the period of years in issue in this case, the taxpayer had a regular practice of using New York, the state in which it was incorporated, for the negotiation and placement of orders from foreign vendors. These activities, the taxpayer insists, represent the essence of its business as an agent dealing in tangible goods and therefore manifest \u201ceach and every act, power or privilege exercised ... as an incident to, or by virtue of\u201d its incorporation in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The commissioner, emphasizing his narrower regulation, maintains that the taxpayer was not \u201ccarrying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>on business\u201d in New York because the taxpayer had no property or place of business, no payroll, and no sales in that state,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and furthermore, that the taxpayer did not conduct there any of the activities listed in \u00a7 12-214-1 (a). Even if we accept the commissioner\u2019s incorporation by reference of the terms of \u00a7 12-214-1 (a), we are not persuaded that the regulation supports his argument. Although the activities representative of the taxpayer\u2019s business are not explicitly recognized in the regulation, \u00a7 12-214-1 (a) unequivocally provides that the list \u201cinclud[es], but [is] not limited to\u201d the activities identified therein. The taxpayer claims that it negotiated for and made purchases of candies and confectioneries from foreign vendors. These meetings and purchases are virtually identical to the conduct of its business in Connecticut, and lie at the heart of its corporate purpose. Furthermore, this type of purchasing activity is not explicitly excluded from \u201ccarrying on business,\u201d as, for instance, is the mere solicitation of orders for tangible personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Viewing the statute at issue as a statute imposing a tax and therefore construing any ambiguity in favor of the taxpayer, we agree with the taxpayer that it was \u201cconducting business\u201d because it was \u201ccarrying on business\u201d under either \u00a7 12-213 or \u00a7 12-214-1 (a). In <em>Northeastern Pharmaceutical &amp; Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>179 Conn. 363, 367-70, 426 A.2d 769 (1979), we held that a corporation was required to apportion <em>losses </em>out of state because another state could have imposed a franchise tax on the corporation, and the corporation\u2019s \u201cactivity\u201d was only accrued losses on the sale of machinery and equipment as it was winding up its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>operation in that state. It is as appropriate to recognize that the taxpayer here may apportion its <em>income </em>out of state, although this may entail a loss of revenue for the state, as it was to require the corporation in <em>Northeastern Pharmaceutical &amp; Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>supra, to apportion its losses out of state, thereby increasing this state\u2019s revenue. The commissioner must permit apportionment of income in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Anticipating the possibility that the judgment of the trial court might be reversed, and the taxpayer\u2019s appeal sustained, the parties have addressed the framing of a proper remand. Although the taxpayer urges us to direct the entry of a judgment for a refund in the amount to which it claims to be entitled, we agree with the commissioner that such an order would be inappropriate. The record reflects that there has been no administrative determination of the validity or accuracy of the amount of the taxpayer\u2019s claimed refund. The parties stipulated to many of the relevant facts, but they did not stipulate to the amount of any refund. Further, the commissioner in his pleadings in the trial court denied the taxpayer\u2019s allegation that an uncontested refund amount was due. The plenary review that the statutes authorize for tax appeals; <em>Kimberly-Clark Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 144-45, 527 A.2d 679 (1987); presupposes an underlying administrative determination of fact. A remand to the commissioner is the appropriate course in the absence of such an administrative determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to remand the case to the commissioner for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 12-218 provides in relevant part: \u201capportionment of net income. Any taxpayer which is taxable both within and without this state shall apportion its net income as provided in this section. For purposes of apportionment of income under this section, a taxpayer is taxable in another state if in such state such taxpayer conducts business and is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business, or a corporate stock tax, or if such state has jurisdiction to subject such taxpayer to such a tax, regardless of whether such state does, in fact, impose such a tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Section 12-218 also provides a variety of formulae to determine the apportionment percentage for purposes of calculating a taxpayer\u2019s net income subject to Connecticut\u2019s corporation tax. Only the taxpayer\u2019s qualification to apportion its income, and not the application of any of \u00a7 12-218\u2019s formulae, is at issue in this appeal. Furthermore, the parties agree that, regarding the taxpayer\u2019s qualification for apportionment, the issue in this appeal involves only the application of the \u201cconducts business\u201d portion of \u00a7 12-218. The parties do not question New York\u2019s authority to tax the taxpayer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 12-214 provides in relevant part: \u201cimposition of tax.

Ed. 2d 510 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b457-9\"> Chapter 208, entitled \u201cCorporation Business Tax,\u201d of the General Statutes, \u00a7 12-213 et seq., and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto; see General Statutes \u00a7 12-2; provide for the corporation tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b458-6\"> The discussion in the trial court regarding the commissioner\u2019s actual rule in use took the following form. In response to an interrogatory in which the taxpayer asked for the department of revenue services\u2019 rule for interpreting \u201cconducts business,\u201d the commissioner stated that \u201cif a company is \u2018carrying on or [has] the right to carry on business\u2019 as those words are used in Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-214-1 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, in a state other than Connecticut, then that company \u2018conducts business\u2019 within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-218.\u201d Following the taxpayer\u2019s argument to the trial court that, because it has a \u201cright to carry on business\u201d in another state by virtue of its incorporation in New York, it satisfies this interpretation of \u00a7 12-218, the commissioner argued that \u201c[w]hile the Commissioner\u2019s interrogatory response might have been clearer, it is easy enough to see that his use of the words \u2018carrying on or [has] the right to carry on business\u2019 is drawn from the language of Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-214 and the title of \u00a7 12-214-1 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. In fact, the \u2018conducts business\u2019 requirement of \u00a7 12-218 is coextensive with the \u2018carrying on\u2019 portion of \u00a7 12-214 and subsection (a) only of the Regulation, that is the \u2018carrying on business in this state\u2019 part of \u00a7 12-214-1.\u201d In its memorandum of decision, the trial court determined that \u201c[t]he [commissioner] further maintains that the \u2018conducts business\u2019 requirement of section 12-218 is coextensive with the \u2018carrying on\u2019 business portion of Conn. Dept. Reg. section 12-214-1 (a) only, not section 12-214-1 (b) as the [taxpayer] argues. The court agrees with the [commissioner]. Section 12-214-[1] (b) is inapplicable to this case.\u201d The parties have continued this debate in their briefs and oral arguments on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b459-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 12-213 provides in relevant part: \u201cdefinitions. . . . \u2018[C]arrying on or doing business\u2019 means and includes each and every act, power or privilege exercised or enjoyed in this state, as an incident to, or by virtue of, the powers and privileges acquired by the nature of any organization whether the form of existence is corporate, associate, joint stock company or fiduciary . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b459-7\"> Section 12-214-1 (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides: \u201ccarrying on, or having the right to carry on, business</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\u201c(a) A company is \u2018carrying on business in this state\u2019 if, within this state, it engages in one or more of the following activities, including but not limited to:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">\u201c(1) owning or leasing (as lessee) real property;</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">\u201c(2) maintaining an office, or compensating its employee for the use of his home if such employee works from such home; if its property, including product samples, brochures and advertising materials, and instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>on product usage, is stored in such home; and if the address or telephone number of such home is listed in its advertisements and public announcements;</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u201c(3) selling tangible personal property (as opposed to soliciting orders therefor);</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\u201c(4) performing or soliciting orders for services;</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">\u201c(5) selling or soliciting orders for real property;</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">\u201c(6) maintaining a stock of inventory in a public warehouse;</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">\u201c(7) having an employee, wherever based: engage in managerial or research activities; make collections on regular or delinquent accounts; offer technical assistance and training to its customer or user of its product after the sale; repair or replace faulty or damaged goods; install or assemble its product; visit its customer or user of its product to determine customer or user satisfaction; pick up returned merchandise from its customer or user of its product; rectify or assist in rectifying any product, credit, shipping or similar complaint arising from the purchase or use of its product; verify the destruction of damaged merchandise; coordinate the delivery of merchandise, whether or not special promotions are involved; distribute replacement parts; inspect the installation of its product by its customer or user of its product; or conduct credit investigations or arrange for credit and financing for its customer or user of its product;</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">\u201c(8) delivering merchandise inventory on consignment to its distributors or dealers;</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">\u201c(9) owning or leasing (as lessee) personal property which is not related to solicitation of orders; and</p>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">\u201c(10) participating in the approval of servicing distributors and dealers where its customer or user of its product can have such product serviced or repaired.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\"> The commissioner\u2019s emphasis on the taxpayer\u2019s lack of property, payroll, and sales in New York is explicitly relevant to the formulae contained in General Statutes \u00a7 12-218 that determine the taxpayer\u2019s apportionment percentage, which arguably may be zero. The determination of the apportionment percentage is not, however, an issue before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
