Co., </em>224 Conn. 758, 621 A.2d 258 (1993), presents the following issues: (1) whether the trial court properly allowed the defendant, American Universal Insurance Company (American), which provided underinsured motorist coverage, to limit its liability to the insured by taking credit for a liability payment made to another claimant; (2) whether the trial court abused its discretion by awarding the insured statutory interest on the arbitration award from the date of the award; (3) whether the trial court properly ruled that the plaintiff, Debra Buell, had exhausted all applicable bodily injury policies, thereby entitling her to underinsured motorist coverage; and (4) whether the trial court properly ruled that American was not entitled to take credit for a $2500 settlement payment made to Buell.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The following facts are undisputed. On April 9,1986, Buell was operating her automobile on Route 1 in East Haven. She was accompanied by a passenger, Pearly Nivens. Buell\u2019s automobile was stopped at a traffic light in front of an automobile operated by Joan Lozier, when a third vehicle, operated by Patricia Vorio, collided with Lozier\u2019s vehicle. Lozier\u2019s vehicle, in turn, collided with Buell\u2019s vehicle. Buell, who was injured in the accident, brought suit against Lozier and Vorio, alleging that both were negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Vorio was insured by Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna) under a policy that provided $50,000 single limit liability coverage. The coverage available under the Aetna policy was divided between Buell, who received $29,000, and Nivens, who received $21,000. Lozier was insured by American under a policy that provided $100,000 liability coverage. Buell received $2500 and Nivens received $3500 under Lozier\u2019s policy with American.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Buell, who was also insured by American, made a demand for arbitration under the terms of her policy, which provided a total of $100,000 underinsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The arbitration panel concluded that Vorio\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the accident, and that no credible evidence had been introduced to show that Lozier had been negligent. The majority of the arbitrators found that Buell had suffered $78,000 in damages. They reduced that amount by the $29,000 payment made by Aetna and by the $2500 payment made by American, arriving at a total award of $46,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">American sought to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Buell in turn sought to confirm the arbitration award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and filed a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>an award of interest under General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from the date of the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The trial court modified the award, holding that it should be further reduced by the $21,000 payment made to Nivens. The court also held, however, that the award should not be reduced by the $2500 payment made to Buell under Lozier\u2019s policy. As modified, the total award amounted to $28,000. In addition, the court awarded interest on the award from the date of the arbitration. Buell appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court and American filed a cross appeal. We transferred the appeal and cross appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">We first address Buell\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly determined that American\u2019s policy permitted it to reduce the amount of her award by taking credit for the $21,000 payment made to Nivens by Aetna. \u201cIn reviewing compulsory arbitration cases, this court must conduct a de novo review of the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation and application of the law. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 191, 530 A.2d 171 (1987).\u201d <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>223 Conn. 22, 26, 610 A.2d 1292 (1992). In assessing the merits of this claim, we are guided by our holding in the companion case, <em>Stephan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>supra, which presented the very same issue. The policy language in this case is similar to the policy language in <em>Stephan </em>and provides: \u201cThe limit of liability shall be reduced by all sums: (1) Paid because of the \u2018bodily injury\u2019 by or on behalf of persons or organizations who may be legally responsible. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>This includes all sums paid under Part A . . . .\u201d Here, as in <em>Stephan, </em>the policy provides that the insurer may limit its liability by payments made because of <em>\u201cthe </em>bodily injury,\u201d not \u201ca bodily injury\u201d or \u201cany bodily injury.\u201d We conclude that this phrase refers only to the claimant\u2019s bodily injury and not to the bodily injuries of others. Accordingly, the policy did not permit American to reduce the damages owed to Buell by taking credit for the payment to Nivens. Moreover, because the policy does not permit the insurer to take credit for this payment, we need not go further to determine whether General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (b) or \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies would permit the credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">In its cross appeal, American claims that the trial court improperly awarded interest to Buell from the date of the arbitration award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As we noted in <em>Stephan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>supra, 765, \u201c[wjhether interest should be allowed as an element of damages is primarily an equitable determination and a matter within the discretion of the trial court. . . <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>218 Conn. 681, 701-702, 590 A.2d 957 (1991).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In determining whether to award interest, the trial court must determine whether the money involved is \u201cpayable\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a; see <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation, </em>217 Conn. 281, 302, 585 A.2d 1199 (1991); and whether the money was \u201cwrongfully\u201d withheld. <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation, </em>supra. Only upon a showing of a clear abuse of discretion will we overturn the trial court\u2019s award of interest. <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 676, 591 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>101 (1991). American argues that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding interest in this case because American was placed into receivership on the date that the arbitration award was made. This fact and others were before the court when it exercised its discretion to allow interest on the award. American has not demonstrated that the trial court abused its discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Because this decision increases the net award to Buell by reinstating the arbitrators\u2019 original award of $46,500 in place of the trial court\u2019s award of $28,000, and because the award of interest is a matter of discretion to be decided by the trial court, we remand this case to the trial court to determine the amount upon which interest should run. <em>Stephan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In its cross appeal, American also claims that the trial court improperly ruled that Buell had exhausted all applicable bodily injury policies so as to be entitled to underinsured motorist coverage. We recently decided this issue in <em>General Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>221 Conn. 206, 603 A.2d 385 (1992). There, we held that under the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (b) and (d), an insured is required to exhaust the \u201cliability bond or insurance policies\u201d of only one tortfeasor in order to be eligible to pursue underinsured motorist benefits. Id., 214. In the present case, it is undisputed that Vorio\u2019s policy with Aetna had been exhausted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following our reasoning in <em>General Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>supra, we conclude that the trial court correctly held that Buell had exhausted all applicable bodily injury policies, thereby entitling her to underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">American\u2019s final claim in its cross appeal is that the trial court improperly ruled that it was not entitled to take credit for the $2500 payment that Buell received under Lozier\u2019s policy with American. We conclude that American was entitled to deduct the $2500 payment from the total damages owed to Buell.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The policy at issue in this case specifically provided that \u201cno one will be entitled to receive duplicate payments for the same elements of loss.\u201d In this case the \u201celement of loss\u201d is Buell\u2019s bodily injury from the accident. The $2500 payment, which was made in settlement of Buell\u2019s suit against Lozier, served two purposes\u2014to avoid litigation of the claim against Lozier and to compensate Buell for her bodily injuries. As a result, if American were not permitted to deduct the $2500 payment made by Lozier\u2019s insurer, Buell would receive duplicate payments for her bodily injury. Accordingly, the plain language of the policy permits American to deduct the $2500 payment to prevent duplicate recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Buell argues that even if the policy permits the reduction, it is not permitted by General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (b)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> because it is not a payment made \u201cby or on behalf of any person responsible for the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>We have previously held that \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) (1) permits an insurer who provides underinsured motorist coverage to limit its liability by taking credit for a personal payment made by a tortfeasor to the insured. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>supra, 30. The trial court in this case concluded, however, that because the arbitrators had determined that Lozier was not at fault in causing the accident, the $2500 payment made by American on behalf of Lozier could not be deducted because it was not made \u201cby or on behalf of any person responsible for the injury.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">As noted above, the payment in this case settled the lawsuit between Lozier and Buell. Although the arbitrators determined that Lozier was not at fault for purposes of arbitration, the issue of Lozier\u2019s liability was never formally litigated. Lozier was not a party to the arbitration. At issue, then, is whether a settlement payment constitutes a payment made \u201cby or on behalf of any person responsible for the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">We have previously held that the plain words of \u00a7 38a-336 (b) \u201csimply require that each policy provide a minimum level of uninsured [underinsured] motorist coverage for the protection of persons insured thereunder.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 532, 538, 569 A.2d 40, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 814, 111 S. Ct. 52, 112 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1990). \u201cThe public policy established by the uninsured [underinsured] motorist statute is that every insured is entitled to recover for the damages he or she would have been able to recover if the uninsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>[underinsured] motorist had maintained a policy of liability insurance. <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 249, 449 A.2d 157 (1982); <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>supra, 197. It is a time-honored rule that an injured party is entitled to full recovery only once for the harm suffered. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 70 n.19, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). An insured may not recover double payment of damages under overlapping insurance coverage. <em>Pecker </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>171 Conn. 443, 452, 370 A.2d 1006 (1976).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 8, 18, 615 A.2d 1032 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">With this background in mind, we consider whether \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) (1), which permits an insurer to limit its liability by deducting amounts \u201cpaid by or on behalf of any party responsible for the injury,\u201d allows an insurer to deduct a settlement payment from the damages owed to its insured. In light of the legislative intent to provide a certain minimum level of protection, but to prevent double recovery on the part of the insured, we conclude that an insurer may limit its liability by deducting a settlement payment from the damages owed to its insured. To hold otherwise would provide the insured a windfall by permitting duplicate payments for the same injury. The arbitrators properly determined that American was entitled to limit its liability by taking credit for the $2500 payment to Buell.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to modify the judgment by reinstating the arbitrators\u2019 award of $46,500 and to determine the amount upon which interest should run.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-6\"> Buell was insured under the American policy for both of her automobiles, each of which had underinsured motorist limits of $50,000. She therefore had a total of $100,000 underinsured motorist coverage under the American policy. <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982). We have often held that statutes and regulations that apply to uninsured motorist coverage equally apply to underinsured motorist coverage. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>223 Conn. 22, 28 n.9, 610 A.2d 1292 (1992); <em>General Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>221 Conn. 206, 210-11, 603 A.2d 385 (1992); <em>Nationwide Ins.
