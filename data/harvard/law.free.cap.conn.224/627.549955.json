The state charged the defendant, Paul DeFusco, by substitute information with possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the trial court accepted his conditional plea of nolo contendere.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>27 Conn. App. 248, 606 A.2d 1 (1992). We subsequently granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>222 Conn. 910, 608 A.2d 692 (1992). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The relevant facts are as follows. On October 12, 1990, the Hamden police department executed a search warrant for 19 Building Brook Road, the defendant\u2019s residence. The warrant had been issued on the basis of an affidavit signed by two Hamden police officers experienced in narcotics investigations. The affidavit recited information provided by a confidential informant and described items obtained during several September, 1990 \u201cgarbage pulls\u201d by Hamden police officers from garbage placed for collection at the curb in front of the defendant\u2019s house.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the course of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>search of the defendant\u2019s home, the police seized narcotics, drug paraphernalia, weapons and cash. The police arrested the defendant and charged him with various narcotics offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized from his home during the search.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He argued that the warrantless garbage pulls violated article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution and, therefore, that the items taken from the garbage should not have been relied on in the warrant affidavit. Without reference to the items taken from the garbage, the defendant claimed, the affidavit failed to establish probable cause. He also claimed, in the alternative, that the information contained in the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause even if the items obtained in the garbage pulls were properly considered. Relying on the defendant\u2019s diminished expectation of privacy in the garbage that he had voluntarily placed curbside, the trial court determined that the garbage pulls had been constitutionally valid. The trial court concluded, therefore, that the affidavit had properly included reference to items obtained in those garbage pulls and had established probable cause. Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The trial court subsequently accepted the defendant\u2019s plea of nolo contendere, and sentenced him to an eight year term of imprisonment, execution suspended after two years and probation for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">. The defendant appealed his conviction to the Appellate Court; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>supra, 27 Conn. App. 248; claiming that the trial court had improperly determined that (1) the garbage searches and seizures had not violated article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution, and (2) the affidavit, which properly included reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>to the items seized in the garbage searches, had established probable cause. The Appellate Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In this appeal, the defendant reiterates the claims that he raised in the Appellate Court. Specifically, he argues that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s determinations that (1) the search and seizure of the defendant\u2019s garbage had been permissible under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution and (2) the affidavit, containing information obtained in the garbage searches, had established probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The defendant\u2019s principal claim is that the Hamden police department\u2019s warrantless searches and seizures of his garbage violated article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Although the United States Supreme Court has expressly held that the fourth amendment to the federal constitution<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> does not protect against warrantless police searches and seizures of garbage placed at the curb for collection; <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>35, 37, 108 S. Ct. 1625, 100 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1988); we may find greater protection of individual rights under our state constitution than that provided by the federal constitution. \u201cIt is well established that federal constitutional and statutory law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 649, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992). Moreover, we have held that \u201c[i]n the area of fundamental civil liberties\u2014which includes all protections of the declaration of rights contained in article first of the Connecticut constitution\u2014we sit as a court of last resort .... In such constitutional adjudication, our first referent is Connecticut law and the full panoply of rights Connecticut citizens have come to expect as their due. Accordingly, decisions of the United States Supreme Court defining fundamental rights are persuasive authority to be afforded respectful consideration, but they are to be followed by Connecticut courts only when they provide no less individual protection than is guaranteed by Connecticut law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 160, 579 A.2d 58 (1990). Recognizing that our state constitution \u201cis an instrument of progress ... is intended to stand for a great length of time and should not be interpreted too narrowly or too literally\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>supra, 649; we have concluded in several cases that the state constitution provides broader protection of individual rights than does the federal constitution. See, e.g., id., 652; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 171; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 112, 547 A.2d 10 (1988), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>In this case, we must decide whether article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution affords greater protection than does federal law against warrantless searches of garbage placed at the curb for collection. For present purposes, we assume that our determination of whether garbage placed at the curb for collection falls within the protection of article first, \u00a7 7, is governed by the two-part standard that is used under the federal constitution and many other states\u2019 constitutions: (1) has the owner or custodian of the garbage manifested a subjective expectation of privacy with respect to it?; and (2) is that expectation one that society would consider reasonable? <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring); see, e.g., <em>Californian. Greenwood, </em>supra, 39; <em>Commonwealth v. Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 660, 555 N.E.2d 559 (1990); but see <em>State v. Hempele, </em>120 N.J. 182, 198, 576 A.2d 793 (1990). Although we have never addressed the proper standard for determining the applicability of article first, \u00a7 7, neither party contests the appropriateness of using the <em>Katz </em>test in this case. Rather, the parties\u2019 primary disagreement concerns the second part of the standard, namely, whether an expectation of privacy in garbage placed at the curb for collection is one that Connecticut citizens would recognize as reasonable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Because the focus of our inquiry, therefore, is the objective reasonableness of a person\u2019s expectation of privacy in garbage placed curbside for collection,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>is useful, at the outset, to identify several other issues, addressed by the parties, that are unnecessary to our decision. First, whether the defendant effected a property law abandonment of his garbage by placing it at the curb for collection is not determinative of the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim. As we have recently held, property law abandonment and constitutional abandonment are independent concepts. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. 85, 106-107, 588 A.2d 145, cert. denied, U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 330, 116 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1991).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Second, our respect for the sanctity of the home is not a factor in the circumstances of this case because article first, \u00a7 7, covers not only a person\u2019s home but also his \u201cpapers\u201d and \u201cpossessions.\u201d Whether or not the garbage was located on the defendant\u2019s property when searched; see footnote 5, supra; therefore, is not dispositive of the constitutional protection afforded by \u00a7 7. Accordingly, the state\u2019s citation to several of our previous cases in which we emphasized that \u00a7 7 affords the highest protection against state invasion into the home; e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 687-90, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992); is unavailing insofar as the language of \u00a7 7 dispels the notion that \u00a7 7 protects <em>only </em>the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Third, our decision does not rely on the textual difference between the fourth amendment and article first, \u00a7 7. At oral argument before this court, the state argued that, because the fourth amendment protects, inter alia, \u201ceffects,\u201d whereas \u00a7 7 protects, inter alia, the narrower category of \u201cpossessions,\u201d the state constitution cannot be interpreted to provide more pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>tection than does the federal constitution. Because this particular issue was neither briefed by the parties nor raised below, we decline to determine in this case the significance of the use of different words by the two provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Finally, our decision in this case does not rely on the arguable lack of a historical foundation for the claim that article first, \u00a7 7, was intended to protect against warrantless searches of garbage placed at the curb for collection. Although we have, on occasion, employed a historical analysis of state constitutional provisions to aid in our determination of their content; see, e.g., <em>Stater. Oquendo, </em>supra, 650-52 (\u201cseizure\u201d under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9); <em>State v. Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 538 n.4, 594 A.2d 917 (1991) (\u201cprobable cause\u201d under article first, \u00a7 7); see also, e.g., <em>State v. Miller, </em>29 Conn. App. 207, 217-19, 614 A.2d 1229, cert. granted, 224 Conn. 914, 915, 614 A.2d 170 (1992) (warrant requirement under article first, \u00a7 7); the arguments of both the defendant and the state emphasized the discussion of what Connecticut citizens would consider reasonable in the present day. Indeed, the reasonable expectation of privacy analysis is peculiarly focused on current conditions and requires a factual inquiry into all the relevant circumstances of the search. See <em>State v. Pittman, </em>209 Conn. 596, 601, 553 A.2d 155 (1989). In this case, therefore, we confine our inquiry to contemporary considerations without reliance on the historical circumstances surrounding the adoption of article first, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">We now address the primary issue on which the defendant\u2019s state constitutional argument turns: whether the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy in garbage placed at the curb for collection was objectively reasonable under the circumstances. Because we conclude that such an expectation was not reasonable, we are persuaded that article first, \u00a7 7, did not prohibit the garbage pulls conducted by the Hamden police.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>When the defendant placed his garbage at the curb in front of his house for collection by the garbage collector, a myriad of intruders, purposeful or errant, could legally have sorted through his garbage. For instance, garbage collectors in Connecticut have a statutory duty to assist municipal authorities in identifying recycling violators.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-220c (a). This required assistance necessarily entails the authority to inspect the contents of garbage placed for collection.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, the owner or operator of a solid waste facility<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or a resources recovery facility<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> has the statutory obligation to conduct periodic unannounced inspections of loads delivered to the facility to assist municipalities and the commissioner of environmental protection in assessing recycling compliance.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-220c (b). It is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>a matter of common knowledge that garbage placed at the curb is subject to intrusion by a variety of people, with a variety of purposes, including bottle and coupon collecting, antique hunting, food searching and snooping. See also <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>supra, 40. Finally, we regard it to be common knowledge among citizens of this state that dogs, raccoons, or other creatures may intrude upon and expose the contents of garbage that has been placed for collection in an accessible area.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">In light of our recognition of these potential intrusions on garbage placed at the curb for collection, the defendant\u2019s argument for state constitutional protection against police searches of his garbage devolves into an argument that a person may harbor different expectations of privacy, all of which are reasonable, as to different classes of intruders. We cannot countenance such a rule. A person\u2019s reasonable expectations as to a particular object cannot be compartmentalized so as to restrain the police from acting as others in society are permitted or suffered to act. We have impliedly rejected such illogical linedrawing, and our Appellate Court has expressly done so. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>198 Conn. 348, 357, 503 A.2d 566 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Liptak, </em>21 Conn. App. 248, 255, 573 A.2d 323, cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>215 Conn. 809, 576 A.2d 540 (1990). Most federal and state courts agree. See, e.g., <em>California </em>v. <em>Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 213-14, 214 n.2, 106 S. Ct. 1809, 90 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>435 N.W.2d 394, 396 (Iowa 1988); <em>State v. Trahan, </em>229 Neb. 683, 688-89, 428 N.W.2d 619 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Byrne, </em>149 Vt. 224, 228, 542 A.2d 276 (1988).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A person either has an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>objectively reasonable expectation of privacy or does not; what is objectively reasonable cannot, logically, depend on the source of the intrusion on his or her privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the garbage he placed at the curb for collection. Accordingly, its search and seizure by the police did not violate article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that, even if the affidavit in support of the search and seizure warrant properly included reference to the items obtained during the garbage pulls, the information contained in the affidavit was not sufficiently specific or informative to establish probable cause. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. The affidavit stated that, on August 15, 1990, a \u201cknown and reliable\u201d informant, whom the Hamden police had utilized numerous times in narcotics cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>had told Hamden police investigator Charles Grady that the defendant was selling one ounce quantities of cocaine from his Hamden residence. The affidavit further stated that the informant had told Grady that the defendant, a construction or carpentry foreman who supplemented his income by selling cocaine, sold approximately one half kilo of cocaine every two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">According to the affidavit, the affiants obtained from the informant a description of the defendant\u2019s vehicles, a description and name of the person from whom the defendant received his cocaine supply and a description of that person\u2019s vehicle and town of residence. The affiants were also given information regarding the persons from whom the defendant\u2019s supplier obtained cocaine. The affiants related that they had confirmed the information regarding both the defendant\u2019s cars and the defendant\u2019s supplier\u2019s cars and residence. The affidavit further stated that the informant had told the Hamden police that the defendant had a longtime heroin addiction and used heroin daily.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Moreover, the affidavit related that, during September, 1990, Hamden police officers had conducted several \u201cgarbage pulls\u201d from garbage at the defendant\u2019s residence. As a result of a garbage pull on September 5, 1990, Grady found two prescription bottles bearing the defendant\u2019s name and three small glassine baggies that were the type used to package cocaine and heroin. One baggie was labeled \u201cBad Med.\u201d The affidavit also stated that, as a result of a garbage pull on September 26,1990, Grady had recovered a prescription bottle bearing the defendant\u2019s name, several short cut straws, and two glassine baggies that were the type used to package cocaine and heroin.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Finally, the affidavit stated that, in 1988, the Hamden police had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>received an anonymous complaint that the defendant was selling one ounce quantities of cocaine from the same residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Our determination of whether the affidavit established probable cause pursuant to article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution is governed by the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 544, 594 A.2d 917 (1991).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See also <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 230-32, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527, reh. denied, 463 U.S. 1237, 104 S. Ct. 33, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1453 (1983). This test requires the issuing judge to make \u201ca practical, nontechnical decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the warrant affidavit, including the veracity and the basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>223 Conn. 127, 135, 613 A.2d 211 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">\u201cWhen an affidavit indicates that the police have relied on information from a confidential informant, the magistrate should examine the affidavit to determine whether it adequately describes both the factual basis of the informant\u2019s knowledge and the basis on which the police have determined that the information is reliable. If the warrant affidavit fails to state in specific terms how the informant gained his knowledge or why the police believe the information to be trustworthy, however, the magistrate can also consider all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit to determine whether, despite these deficiencies, other objective indicia of reliability reasonably establish that probable cause to search exists. In making this deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>mination, the magistrate is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the facts presented.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>219 Conn. 557, 563, 594 A.2d 933 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">In our review of the defendant\u2019s claim, we will uphold \"the validity of [the] warrant ... [if] the affidavit at issue presented a substantial factual basis for the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that probable cause existed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Duntz, </em>223 Conn. 207, 215, 613 A.2d 224 (1992). \"In a doubtful or marginal case . . . our constitutional preference for a judicial determination of probable cause leads us to afford deference to the magistrate\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 565. With these principles in mind, we now consider whether there was a substantial factual basis for the issuing judge\u2019s conclusion that the affidavit established probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">We consider first the information provided by the informant. \u201cAlthough, under [the totality of the circumstances] standard, we no longer rigidly apply the two-pronged . . . test [pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 496 A.2d 298 (1985)], the determination of an informant\u2019s veracity or reliability and basis of knowledge remains highly relevant. ...\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Duntz, </em>supra, 216-17; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 552. The affidavit in this case did not expressly state the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, there was no indication whether the informant had personally observed the defendant\u2019s drug use and sales or had learned the information from another source. Indeed, nothing in the affidavit would have entitled the issuing judge reasonably to infer that the informant was reporting information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>of which he had any basis of knowledge. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Duntz, </em>supra, 217-18. This deficiency in the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge does not necessarily require us to disregard the informant\u2019s information, however, because the deficiency in the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge \u201cmay be overcome by a strong showing of the informant\u2019s reliability.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 141; see also <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 233; <em>State </em>v. <em>Duntz, </em>supra, 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Accordingly, we turn to the informant\u2019s reliability. The affiants\u2019 assertion that the informant was reliable does not itself give the issuing judge a basis upon which to infer reliability.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Telesca, </em>199 Conn. 591, 603, 508 A.2d 1367 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tulli, </em>14 Conn. App. 356, 358, 541 A.2d 515, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 809, 545 A.2d 1105 (1988). We note also that the informant\u2019s association with criminal activity, evidenced by his reportedly numerous proffers of information to the police, detracts from his reliability. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Telesca, </em>supra (reliability of informant who regularly supplies information to police is suspect because he is likely to be involved in criminal activity or to associate with criminals); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 141 and n.11 (police not obligated to establish reliability of citizen informants).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Despite these indicia of unreliability, the issuing judge nevertheless was entitled to determine that the informant was reliable. First, the affiants stated that the informant had been used \u201cnumerous times in the past for various narcotic[s] cases.\u201d The issuing judge could reasonably have inferred from this statement that the informant had given trustworthy information in the past and, therefore, was reliable. Although this inference would have been better supported by an affirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>tive statement by the affiants that this informant\u2019s information had, in the past, led to arrests and convictions; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 136 (affidavit stated that informant has \u201calso given information in prior cases <em>that . . . led to arrests arid convictions\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); we do not require affiants to invoke \u201cformulaic phrases\u201d in a search warrant affidavit. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 549. In addition, the issuing judge reasonably could have concluded that the glassine baggies and short cut straws recovered during the garbage pulls corroborated the informant\u2019s allegations that the defendant was selling one ounce quantities of cocaine from his home and was a heroin user. Such corroboration would be a proper ground on which to base an inference of reliability. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 136-37. Finally, the issuing judge could properly have inferred the informant\u2019s reliability from the fact that \u201cthe informant was not anonymous, but known [by the police,] and therefore risked both loss of credibility with the police and possible prosecution for falsely reporting an incident under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-180 had his information proved to be fabricated.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 564.

The relevant items gathered from the defendant\u2019s garbage were five glassine baggies and several short cut straws, which the affiants, who were experienced narcotics investigators, identified as drug paraphernalia.

In light of the information provided by the informant, which the issuing judge could reasonably have credited as reliable, and the items gathered by police investigation, which the issuing judge could reasonably have concluded were indicia of drug activity, we hold that the issuing judge had a substantial factual basis upon which to conclude that probable cause existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">In this opinion Callahan and Norcott, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\"> Article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution provides: \u201cThe people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions from unreasonable searches or seizures; and no warrant to search any place, or to seize any person or things, shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause supported by oath or affirmation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, or a narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years and may be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars or be both fined and imprisoned; and for a second offense shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than one hundred thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned; and for each subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\"> The defendant\u2019s plea of nolo contendere was conditioned on his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.

DeFusco, </em>27 Conn. App. 248, 255, 606 A.2d 1 (1992). Because neither party has raised an issue regarding the precise location of the garbage when it was searched and seized by the police, it is not necessary to resolve that question of fact here. We decline to delve into the possible factual scenarios that are outside the scope of the certified question and that may arise in future cases, such as garbage left for collection inside a closed garage; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>123 Wis. 2d 303, 314, 367 N.W.2d 788 (1985); and garbage placed for collection in a container in an indoor garbage room of an apartment building.

For purposes of this decision, we refer to the location of the defendant\u2019s garbage as \u201cat the curb\u201d or \u201ccurbside\u201d because the certified question and both parties\u2019 briefs use one or both of these neutral descriptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\"> The defendant also filed a motion to dismiss that raised, inter alia, the same claims.

Those statutes are useful in our determination of whether the defendant\u2019s state constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures was violated, because that determination turns, in this case, on whether the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy in curbside garbage was one that Connecticut citizens would recognize as reasonable. We do not, as the dissent suggests, rely on the recycling statute to define the scope of the important rights guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. We, therefore, disagree with the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s view, which the dissent in this case appears to share, that \u201c[government regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>becomes relevant only once it has been determined that constitutional protections do apply.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hempele, </em>120 N.J. 182, 211, 576 A.2d 793 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\"> Our conclusion that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in garbage placed at the curb for collection is not undermined by the fact that the legislature has authorized municipalities to prohibit the scavenging of solid waste. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-220a (h). This authorization does not itself support the existence of a reasonable expectation of privacy. In any case, however, Hamden\u2019s solid waste disposal ordinance prohibits only the scavenging of solid waste at the <em>landfill, </em>not the scavenging of solid waste placed at the curb for collection. See Hamden Town Code of Ordinances \u00a7 94.40 (H) (1990); cf. <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 52, 108 S. Ct. 1625, 100 L.

The other state courts that have held that their state constitutions afford protection against warrantless police searches of curbside garbage have recognized impliedly that a person may have different expectations of privacy in garbage, all of which are reasonable, as to different people. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Krivda, </em>supra, 367 (\u201cdefendants had a reasonable expectation that their trash would not be rummaged through and picked over by police officers acting without a search warrant\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tanaka, </em>supra, 662 (\u201c[p]eople reasonably believe that police will not indiscriminately rummage through their trash bags to discover their personal effects\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boland, </em>supra, 581 (\u201c[w]hile a person must reasonably expect a licensed trash collector will remove the contents of his trash can, this expectation does not also infer an expectation of governmental intrusion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Despite careful consideration of each of these cases, we are persuaded that, in the circumstances of this case, article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution did not prohibit the search and seizure of the defendant\u2019s garbage conducted by the Hamden police. Some of these cases involved the interpretation of unique state constitutional provisions; <em>State </em>v. <em>Boland, </em>supra, 577 (article 1, \u00a7 7 of the Washington constitution provides: \u201cNo person shall be disturbed in his private affairs, or his home invaded, without authority of law\u201d); or particular fact patterns; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tanaka, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>659-60 (police trespassed on defendants\u2019 property to seize the garbage). Finally, the authority of the California case, <em>People </em>v. <em>Krivda, </em>supra, has' been rendered suspect by an amendment to the California constitution that limits a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures to the protection afforded under the federal constitution.

Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 550-51, 594 A.2d 917 (1991).

Today the majority concludes that the citizens of Connecticut have no reasonable expectation of privacy in their garbage when that garbage has been placed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>sealed, opaque bags at the curb. They hold that article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution affords no protection against systematic police searches of those bags. The majority does not exclusively rely upon <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 37, 108 S. Ct. 1625, 100 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1988) (fourth amendment to the federal constitution does not protect garbage placed at curb for collection against warrantless police searches and seizures),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but instead relies upon statutes as well as the existence of unwelcome intruders to hold that it is not reasonable for Connecticut citizens to have an expectation of privacy in their garbage.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Both the majority and this dissent address only the second prong<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the two-part standard that has traditionally been used under the federal constitution to assess whether a warrantless search and seizure of property has violated a person\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring). The issue is whether, in Connecticut, the owners or custodians of garbage placed at the curb have an expectation of privacy that the citizens of Connecticut would consider reasonable. I believe they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>The determination that a particular place<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is shielded by the Connecticut constitution requires that the place be one that society is prepared to give deference to because of \u201cits code of values and its notions of custom and civility . . . .\u201d <em>United States v. Taborda, </em>635 F.2d 131, 138 (2d Cir. 1980) (applying this test where fourth amendment is under consideration). Whether an expectation of privacy is legitimate under the Connecticut constitution depends on whether it is one recognized and permitted by the citizens of Connecticut. A constitutional expectation of privacy does not require an \u201cuntrammeled power to admit and exclude\u201d; <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>495 U.S. 91, 99, 110 S. Ct. 1684, 109 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1990); and it does not require that the area involved be hidden from the public eye. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. 85, 110-11, 588 A.2d 145, cert. denied, U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 330, 116 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1991). That the area involved was public is a relevant consideration, but does not mechanistically close the door upon the inquiry. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ruckman, </em>806 F.2d 1471, 1476 (10th Cir. 1986) (McKay, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The tension between the immediate reaction to the word garbage and the reality of what we place in our opaque, sealed trash bag is not easily resolved. I believe that although the defendant\u2019s property may have been abandoned, his reasonable expectation of privacy therein was not. Nearly \u201c \u2018every human activity ultimately manifests itself in waste products. . . .\u2019Asingle bag of trash testifies eloquently to the eating, reading, and recreational habits of the person who produced it. A search of trash, like a search of the bed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>room, can relate intimate details about sexual practices, health, and personal hygiene. Like rifling through desk drawers or intercepting phone calls, rummaging through trash can divulge the target\u2019s financial and professional status, political affiliations and inclinations, private thoughts, personal relationships, and romantic interests.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>supra, 50 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Indeed, the contents of a sealed, opaque trash bag may be more private, and thus should deserve as much protection, as many other containers whose contents have been protected. <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>442 U.S. 753, 762 n.9, 99 S. Ct. 2586, 61 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1979) (\u201ccomparatively small, unlocked suitcase\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>supra, 89 (duffel bag and cardboard box).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Even the majority recognizes that an examination of garbage may reveal highly personal information. It then lists categories of such material that \u201cwe think it reasonable for Connecticut residents to wish to maintain as confidential.\u201d See majority opinion, footnote 19. The majority suggests, however, that it is also reasonable for society to expect citizens to take affirmative steps\u2014such as shredding or destroying\u2014to hide garbage that they wish to keep private. How many of us, as Connecticut residents, feel the need to shred or destroy personal information before discarding it in order to protect its confidentiality?<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The very fact that Connecticut residents customarily discard highly personal and typically confidential information into their garbage without first shredding or destroying it, is a strong indication that they expect these items to remain private. Although the majority believes that much of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>what we discard is highly personal and that it is reasonable for people to want to maintain a privacy interest in such material, the majority, nevertheless, has concluded that our expectation of such privacy is unreasonable. This is where the majority and this dissent part company.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The majority first reasons that because we can assume that garbage left at the curb is readily accessible to animals, children, scavengers, snoops and other similar intruders, we lose an expectation of privacy in such garbage from the intentional and deliberate canvassing by the police. It further rejects totally that a person\u2019s expectation of privacy can differ with regard to different classes of people. The problem with these positions is that they allow garbage-pickers to dictate how we as a society choose to live and what values we choose to protect. The accessibility of garbage to outsiders is not dispositive unless we choose to condone, endorse and ratify such conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, the mere fact that we recognize the possibility that an unwelcome scavenger may rummage through our garbage, is not the same as wholesale acceptance of detailed, systematic inspection by law enforcement. Merely because we are aware that leaving garbage for disposal may involve risks to our privacy interests does not mean that we need to add constitutionally to those risks through unrestrained scrutiny by police.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Amsterdam, \u201cPerspectives on the Fourth Amendment,\u201d 58 Minn.

The possibility that an unwelcome intruder may scavenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>through our garbage is not the foundation upon which this court should test what is reasonable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The public has characterized this conduct as \u201c \u2018a disgusting invasion of personal privacy,\u2019 Flieger, Investigative Trash, U.S. News <em>&amp; </em>World Report, July 28, 1975, p. 72 (editor\u2019s page); \u2018indefensible ... as civilized behavior,\u2019 Washington Post, July 10, 1975, p.

It must be acknowledged that the state has the authority to regulate the disposal of garbage. \u201cWere it not for such regulations, people who want to maintain the privacy of their garbage could either bury it in their backyards or burn it. They would need not then fear that the garbage might be disturbed by animals, children, scavengers, snoops, and other members of the public ... or by unreasonable police searches. . . . [I]f pursuant to that authority it compels people to alter their conduct, it may not then contend that that conduct no longer deserves constitutional protection.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hempele, </em>120 N.J. 182, 212, 576 A.2d 793 (1990). General social norms help define what expectations of privacy will be tolerated. <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>California, </em>453 U.S. 420, 428, 101 S. Ct. 2841, 69 L. Ed. 2d 744 (1981). The social norm is to place garbage in opaque bags at curbside locations as in this case. If the defendant\u2019s privacy has been compromised, it is as a result of a law that controls the method by which he disposes of his personal effects in a manner that offers no protection from government scrutiny. See Hamden Town Code of Ordinances \u00a7\u00a7 94.39 (A) and 94.22 (A) (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The majority relies heavily on the recycling statutes for the position that because garbage collectors have a statutory duty to assist municipal authorities in identifying recycling violators, which duty must necessarily entail the authority to inspect the contents of garbage placed for collection; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 22a-220c; the citizens of Connecticut, therefore, have a greatly diminished expectation of privacy. There are several reasons why such legislation is not a legitimate basis upon which to determine a constitutional right. The first is the existence of other legislation that could be relied upon to demonstrate that we do pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>sume that the protections of article first, \u00a7 7, apply to garbage. Many local ordinances prohibit garbage picking at the curb. See footnote 9 of this dissent. While these regulations may have been enacted to protect the exclusive right of a city or its authorized agent to collect trash or to promote sanitation and cleanliness, they may also have been based upon the recognition that people do have an expectation of privacy in their trash that we want to respect and protect. If we also assume people know of these regulations, then their perception that their garbage will not be violated by outsiders becomes reasonable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hempele, </em>supra, 208-209.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">More importantly, the majority violates the most basic tenets of jurisprudence when it holds that our constitutional right to privacy is circumscribed by recycling legislation. The landmark case of <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 176-78 (1803), established: \u201cThe powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written. To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing, if these limits may, at any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained? . . . It is a proposition too plain to be contested, that the constitution controls any legislative act repugnant to it; or, that the legislature may alter the constitution by an ordinary act.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">\u201cBetween these alternatives there is no middle ground. The constitution is either a superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other acts, is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">\u00a1i\u00ab * *</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">\u201cIf an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void, does it, notwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts, and oblige them to give it effect? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>... It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">\u201cSo if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Government regulations become relevant only after it has been determined that constitutional protections apply. See, e.g., <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor Executives' Assn., </em>489 U.S. 602, 109 S. Ct. 1402, 103 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1989). Although the majority insists that it is not directly relying on the recycling statutes to determine that the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his garbage, it in fact relies on these statutes to inform Connecticut residents what to expect. The court is saying, in effect, to Connecticut citizens, that since these statutes exist, you can reasonably infer from them that your garbage is not private and, therefore, any expectation of privacy is unreasonable. How is this not reliance by the majority? I cannot condone the majority\u2019s use of state statutes to define the contours of our right to privacy under the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Another reason that the recycling statutes should not be relied upon in the context of the case before us comes from the legislation itself. These recycling statutes were enacted based upon environmental considerations. See 33 H.R. Proc., Pt. 18, 1990 Sess., pp. 6098-99. Thus, the legislation that permits recycling collectors to examine an individual\u2019s garbage to determine compliance with the recycling laws does not ultimately determine a person\u2019s legitimate expectation of privacy. \u201cA deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>mination of the standard of reasonableness applicable to a particular class of searches requires \u2018balancing] the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 703 [103 S. Ct. 2637, 77 L. Ed. 2d 110] (1983); <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>[387 U.S. 523, 536-37, 87 S. Ct. 1727, 18 L. Ed. 2d 930 (1967)].\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Ortega, </em>480 U.S. 709, 719, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1987). In <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Ortega, </em>supra, 719-20, the court held that in the case of a search by a public employer, the employee\u2019s legitimate expectations of privacy must be balanced against the government\u2019s need for supervision and efficiency. The court stated that in order for the search to be reasonable, it must be work related. Id., 725-26. If it is not work related or if the search is for evidence of criminal misconduct, a warrant is required. See id., 721. Any compromise to our legitimate expectations of privacy can only be to advance the ultimate goal to which the search could contribute. <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., </em>469 U.S. 325, 357-58, 105 S. Ct. 733, 83 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1985) (Brennan, J., concurring). Therefore, even if we assume the constitutionality of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-220c, which is not before us today, such legislation allows only for a very limited search by a refuse collector to determine if recyclable items are contained within an individual\u2019s garbage and did not contemplate a wholesale, systematic exploration by the police.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, the statute provides for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>inspection based solely upon \u201creason.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-220c (a). Even if \u201creason\u201d means only \u201creasonable articulable suspicion,\u201d it connotes at least a limited privacy right.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In this case, the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his trash bags and should be able to claim the protection of article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. Without the reference to the items seized in the search of the defendant\u2019s trash, the warrant affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the case to allow the defendant to withdraw his conditional plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\"> This opinion is not based upon the textual difference between the two constitutional provisions, which is only one of several tools of analyses that should be employed in construing the contours of our state constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992). As this court has previously recognized, the language of article first, \u00a7 7, of our state constitution; see majority opinion, footnote 1, supra; and the fourth amendment to the United States constitution; see majority opinion, footnote 8, supra; are \u201cquite similar.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 159, 216 A.2d 58 (1990). Moreover, I agree with the majority that the state\u2019s attempt to draw a distinction between the words \u201ceffects\u201d in the federal constitution and what the state claims is the narrower \u201cpossessions\u201d in article first, \u00a7 7, is not persuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\"> The state has briefly raised the question of the defendant\u2019s failure to meet the subjective prong of the <em>Katz </em>test. Neither the trial court, nor the Appellate Court relied upon or even suggested that the first prong had not been satisfied. Therefore, I will not make that assumption either.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\"> As this court has stated, the relevant inquiry in deciding whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy involves an examination into the particular place invaded. When the search is of a closed container, however, the particular \u201cplace\u201d is the interior of the container. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. 85, 103-104, 588 A.2d 145, cert. denied, U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 330, 116 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b670-6\"> Moreover, the majority\u2019s suggestion that we shred our garbage is not sufficient to impede the prying eyes of determined government agents. E.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>975 F.2d 927 (1st cir. 1992) (Internal Revenue Service agents seized and pieced together shredded documents reduced to 5/32 inch strips from the defendant\u2019s garbage).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b671-6\"> \u201cThe mere <em>possibility </em>that unwelcome meddlers <em>might </em>open and rummage through the containers does not negate the expectation of privacy in their contents any more than the possibility of a burglary negates an expectation of privacy in the home; or the possibility of a private intrusion negates an expectation of privacy in an unopened package; or the possibility that an operator will listen in on a telephone conversation negates an expectation of privacy in the words spoken on the telephone.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 54, 108 S. Ct. 1625, 100 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1988) (Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\"> The majority maintains that we cannot have different expectations of privacy as to different people. To support its position against this distinc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>tion based on status, the court cites to <em>State </em>v. <em>Liptak, </em>21 Conn. App. 248, 255, 573 A.2d 323, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 809, 576 A.2d 540 (1990), wherein the Appellate Court stated that \u201c[i]f one has a reasonable expectation that various members of society may enter the property in their personal or business pursuits, he should find it equally likely that the police will do so.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) That opinion relied in part on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>198 Conn. 348, 357, 503 A.2d 566 (1986), wherein we recognized a diminished expectation of privacy in common areas of a multifamily dwelling. Implicit in both these cases is that the areas in question have been exposed to at least some members of the public with the owner\u2019s permission. In this case, the defendant did not allow exposure of his garbage. All he allowed to be exposed to the public were the exteriors of opaque, sealed containers. Until the bags were opened by the police, the contents of the defendant\u2019s garbage bag were hidden from the public\u2019s view.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b672-11\"> There are several other instances of people turning containers over to a third party without compromising their privacy interest in the contents. \u201c \u2018Were it otherwise, a letter or package would lose all Fourth Amendment protection when placed in a mail box or other depository with the \u201cexpress purpose\u201d of entrusting it to the postal officer or a private carrier; those bailees are just as likely as trash collectors (and certainly have greater incentive) to \u201csor[t] through\u201d the personal effects entrusted to them, \u201cor permi[t] others, such as police to do so.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hempele, </em>120 N. J. 182, 208, 576 A.2d 793 (1990), quoting <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 55, 108 S. Ct. 1630, 100 L. Ed. 2d 46 (1988) (Brennan, J., dissenting). The difference between these examples and the case of trash is that with a letter or package the sender expects to lose his privacy once it is in the hands of the person to whom it is addressed, whereas with trash, the person depositing it expects that it will be destroyed without first being examined. Only when it has been \u2018 \u2018physically exposed\u201d by the person depositing it with a third party can it be said that that person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in its contents. Note, \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2014Leading Cases,\u201d 102 Harv. L. Rev. 143, 195 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b673-6\"> Additionally, the majority\u2019s reliance on the aerial view cases is misplaced. People can observe areas in which one might have a subjective privacy expectation by engaging in normal, everyday flying in airplanes or helicopters. Therefore, courts have held that any such subjective expectation of privacy would not be reasonable. <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>488 U.S. 445, 451-52, 109 S. Ct. 693, 102 L. Ed. 2d 835 (1989); <em>California </em>v. <em>Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 215, 106 S. Ct. 1809, 90 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1986). Moreover, the Federal Aviation Administration would be most distressed to learn that flying, a highly regulated activity used for pleasure, business and war-related enterprise, can be placed alongside garbage picking as a reason to defeat a person\u2019s expectation of privacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\"> E.g., New London City Code of Ordinances \u00a7 11-59 (1989), entitled \u201cPrivate Scavenging\u201d; Enfield Town Code \u00a7 8B-6 (a), (b) (1991), entitled in part \u201cProhibition against Removing Recyclable Materials from Designated Disposal Site\u201d; see also Branford Town Code \u00a7 213-20 (A) (1991), entitled \u201cScavenging Prohibited\u201d; Stratford Town Code \u00a7 108-20 (1988), entitled \u201cScavenging in Town Dump Prohibited.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b677-5\"> Several lines of cases teach us that under some circumstances the purpose of a search is deemed relevant in deciding the degree of protection afforded by the fourth amendment.
