After the denial of her pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>trial motion to suppress wiretap evidence, a jury convicted her of the crime charged and the trial court sentenced her to a ten year term of imprisonment. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Novoa, </em>27 Conn. App. 596, 607 A.2d 900 (1992). Because the governing statute, General Statutes \u00a7 54-41b,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> allows the use of wiretap evidence in prosecutions under General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 without expressly referring to General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278, we granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal the validity of the use of the wiretap evidence in the criminal proceeding in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we have concluded that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted. The issues have been fully considered in the opinion of the Appellate Court; <em>State </em>v. <em>Novoa, </em>supra, 597-601; and it would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained.
