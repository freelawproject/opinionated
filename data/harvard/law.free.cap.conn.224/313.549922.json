J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aje\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether the terms of a fire insurance policy providing coverage for the cost of replacement of a building destroyed by a fire unambiguously limit that coverage to a replacement on the premises on which the fire occurred. The plaintiffs, S and S Tobacco and Candy Company, Inc., and Stanley Seligson,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed an amended complaint charging the defendant, Greater New York Mutual Insurance Company, with a breach of contract for its refusal to pay the totality of the plaintiffs\u2019 unpaid claim under the \u201creplacement cost (without deduction for depreciation)\u201d endorsement to a multiperil insurance policy issued by the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant denied liability, alleging that the plaintiffs had failed fully to comply with the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. After a trial to the court, the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The facts are undisputed. The plaintiffs owned a 15,000 square foot building, located on their property at 59 Connecticut Avenue in Norwalk, that they used as a storage warehouse. On July 15, 1985, they purchased from the defendant a multiperil insurance policy covering this building. On September 10, 1985, a fire totally destroyed the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>After the fire, the plaintiffs decided that the property on Connecticut Avenue could profitably be put to a use higher than a warehouse. To replace the building destroyed by the fire, they acquired a site on Wilson Avenue in South Norwalk and there erected a larger storage warehouse of approximately 36,000 square feet. The replacement warehouse was ready for occupancy on September 1, 1990, about four and one-half years after the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The multiperil insurance policy covering the original warehouse established $280,000 as the limit of the defendant\u2019s liability. Ordinarily, the measure of the benefits payable under fire insurance coverage is the actual cash value of the damaged or destroyed property. As a result of the plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of a replacement cost coverage endorsement to the policy, for an additional premium, the defendant undertook to compensate the plaintiffs, in the event of a fire, for replacement costs without regard to any depreciation in the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The plaintiffs promptly filed all required notices and claims of loss with the defendant. The defendant paid the plaintiffs $256,080, the amount of the actual cash value of their claim, but refused to pay the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for depreciation in the amount of $23,920. The defendant did not contest the mathematical accuracy of the plaintiffs\u2019 calculation of their depreciation claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>The defendant based its refusal to pay the depreciation claim on the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged noncompliance with the requirement of the replacement cost coverage endorsement that \u201cthe damaged or destroyed property [must] actually [be] repaired or replaced by the insured with due diligence and dispatch.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant maintained that the plaintiffs had neither \u201cactually . . . replaced\u201d the destroyed property nor undertaken the requisite replacement \u201cwith due diligence and dispatch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The trial court determined that the plaintiffs had fully complied with the requirements of the replacement cost coverage endorsement and, therefore, rendered a judgment in their favor. The trial court construed the relevant provisions in the insurance policy as including coverage for a replacement building constructed on a site other than that of the building destroyed by fire. The trial court found that the plaintiffs had proceeded with due diligence and dispatch in constructing the replacement building and readying it for occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">On appeal, the defendant raises the same issues that it pursued in the trial court. It contends that the trial court misconstrued the insurance policy and mistakenly found that the plaintiffs had acted with due diligence. We disagree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The proper construction of the endorsement permitting an insured to recover its replacement cost without deduction for depreciation, in the event of a fire, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>turns on two paragraphs of the endorsement. The parties agree that, to trigger the contract\u2019s coverage, the plaintiffs must comply with paragraph 3 of the endorsement, which provides that the defendant \u201cshall not be liable ... for any loss unless and until the damaged or destroyed property is <em>actually </em>repaired or replaced . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) They disagree about the relationship between this paragraph and paragraph 5 of the endorsement. Pursuant to paragraph 5, the defendant\u2019s \u201cliability for loss on a replacement cost basis shall not exceed the smallest of the following amounts: (a) the amount of this policy applicable to the damaged or destroyed property; (b) the replacement cost of the property or any part thereof identical with such property on the same premises and intended for the same occupancy and use; or (c) the amount actually and necessarily expended in repairing or replacing said property or any part thereof.\u201d The trial court held subparagraph 5 (c) rather than subparagraph 5 (b) to be applicable in the circumstances of this case and concluded that subparagraph 5 (c) validated the plaintiffs\u2019 depreciation claim for the amount they had actually expended in replacing their destroyed storage warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The defendant maintains, to the contrary, that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim must be measured by a conjoint reading of paragraphs 3 and 5 (b). Focusing on the subparagraph 5 (b) requirement of replacement \u201con the same premises,\u201d the defendant contends that the plaintiffs, having rebuilt elsewhere, have not complied with paragraph 3. The defendant asserts that its construction of the replacement cost endorsement is mandatory for three reasons: (1) the parties stipulated, in the trial court, that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim would be measured by paragraphs 3 and 5 (b); (2) the trial court could not consider the applicability of subparagraph 5 (c) because the plaintiffs offered no evidence about the costs of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>struction of the new warehouse in South Norwalk; and (3) the prefatory language to paragraph 5 limited the defendant\u2019s liability to \u201cthe smallest of the . . . amounts\u201d specified in its three subparagraphs. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">We can dispose quickly of the defendant\u2019s first two contentions. With respeet to the first contention, the record discloses nothing by way of a formal or informal stipulation that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim would be measured by subparagraph 5 (b). Although the parties directed the court\u2019s attention to that subparagraph as being an issue between them, the court, without objection, stated the question to be \u201cwhether the term replacement is construed as rebuilding on [the] same site or may it be interpreted as meaning erecting a new building on a different site so long as it is devoted to the same use.\u201d With respect to the second contention, the trial court record regarding construction costs does not support the defendant\u2019s position on appeal. At trial, the parties agreed about the monetary amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and the defendant successfully objected to an offer by the plaintiffs of documentary evidence to prove their actual expenditures for the replacement building.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs have, therefore, not relinquished their asserted right to have their replacement cost claim measured by subparagraph 5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The defendant\u2019s final argument hinges on its understanding of the internal logic of paragraph 5. It focuses on the prefatory language to that paragraph, which states that the defendant\u2019s liability \u201cshall not exceed the smallest of the following amounts,\u201d i.e., the policy limit, the cost of replacement on the same premises, or the amount actually and necessarily expended for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>repair or replacement. The defendant maintains that the plaintiffs cannot rely on subparagraph 5 (c) because their actual expenditures for replacement exceeded both the policy limit and the cost of replacement of the old building on the original premises. It concludes that, on this theory, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim can be sustained only under subparagraph 5 (b) and is defeated by their conceded failure to rebuild on the same premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Although the defendant\u2019s construction of the replacement cost endorsement is not implausible, an alternate construction is equally plausible. Paragraph 3, which defines the coverage provided by the endorsement, limits that coverage to instances in which \u201cthe damaged or destroyed property is actually repaired or replaced,\u201d but does not expressly require a replacement on the same premises. In its common usage, the term \u201creplaced\u201d includes \u201csubstituted.\u201d See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary; see also <em>Piazza </em>v. <em>Clackamas Water District, </em>21 Ore. App. 469, 535 P.2d 554, 557 (1975). Under paragraph 3, a substituted building, as the trial court held, may be located on a different site.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The provisions of paragraph 5 do not compel a different result. First, paragraph 5 by its own terms addresses the amount of the defendant\u2019s liability rather than the conditions that the plaintiffs must meet to establish their entitlement to coverage. Second, paragraph 5\u2019s principal rule limiting the defendant\u2019s liability to the smallest amount payable under any of its three subsections can be read consistently with paragraph 3 to permit the insured to recover costs incurred for replacement at another site. Under subparagraph 5 (a), the defendant\u2019s liability can never exceed \u201cthe amount . . . applicable to the damaged or destroyed property,\u201d i.e., the policy limit of $280,000. The plaintiffs would not, however, have been entitled to recover this amount if their replacement costs actually and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>necessarily expended, on the same premises or at another site, had been less than $280,000. Finally, for replacement costs of less than $280,000, the plaintiffs would not have been able to measure their recovery by actual replacement costs at another site if those costs had exceeded \u201cthe replacement cost ... on the same premises.\u201d These theoretical limitations on the plaintiffs' recovery are, however, irrelevant in the circumstances of this case, in which the plaintiffs\u2019 replacement costs, by any measure, substantially exceeded the policy amount of $280,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">At the very least, the replacement cost coverage endorsement does not unambiguously limit fire insurance coverage, in all instances, to the costs of an actual replacement on the same premises. Because it is the insurance company that has drafted the terms of the insurance policy, any ambiguity contained therein is traditionally construed against the insurer and in favor of insurance coverage. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Figueiredo, </em>223 Conn. 31, 36-37, 610 A.2d 1296 (1992); <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>219 Conn. 371, 375, 593 A.2d 498 (1991); <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>205 Conn. 246, 250, 532 A.2d 1297 (1987); <em>LaBonte </em>v. <em>Federal Mutual Ins. Co., </em>159 Conn. 252, 256, 268 A.2d 663 (1970). Although the parties\u2019 advocacy of different meanings of the replacement cost coverage endorsement \u201cdoes not necessitate a conclusion that the language is ambiguous\u201d; <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Bulaong, </em>218 Conn. 51, 60, 588 A.2d 138 (1991); <em>Marcolini </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>160 Conn. 280, 284, 278 A.2d 796 (1971); when alternate readings of a clause in an insurance clause are equally plausible, the language in the policy is ambiguous. <em>See Beach </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">As the trial court observed, courts in other jurisdictions have construed similar replacement cost coverage endorsements to include coverage for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>replacement on another site. See, e.g., <em>Huggins </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., </em>423 So. 2d 147, 150 (Ala. 1982); <em>Boudreau </em>v. <em>Manufacturers &amp; Merchants Mutual Ins. Co., </em>588 A.2d 286, 287 n.5 (Me. 1991); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Michigan Basic Property Ins. Assn., </em>441 Mich. 181, 490 N.W.2d 864 (1992); <em>Ruter </em>v. <em>Northwestern Fire &amp; Marine, </em>72 N.J. Super. 467, 471-73, 178 A.2d 640 (1962); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>127 Misc. 2d 749, 751-52, 487 N.Y.S.2d 285 (1985). The defendant has cited no case supporting its more restricted view, and we have found none. The defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court misconstrued the insurance contract cannot, therefore, be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The defendant\u2019s alternate contention is that the plaintiffs are barred from recovery because they did not erect the replacement building with due diligence and dispatch. On this issue, having heard evidence about the circumstances of the new construction, the trial court ruled as follows: \u201cThe defendant did question why it took the plaintiffs so long to build the new building, but its main argument is that the terms repair or replace do not encompass the construction of a new building at a new and different location. I am satisfied that the \u2018due diligence and dispatch\u2019 condition was fulfilled by the plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Whether the plaintiffs acted with due diligence and dispatch was a question of fact for the trial court. The defendant did not avail itself of the opportunity to seek from the trial court an articulation of the factual basis for its finding. See Practice Book \u00a7 4051. As the appellant, it was the defendant\u2019s responsibility to present a record adequate for appellate review of its claim of error. <em>DiBella </em>v. <em>Widlitz, </em>207 Conn. 194, 203-204, 541 A.2d 91 (1988); <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>190 Conn. 491, 493, 460 A.2d 1302 (1983). In the absence of such a record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>we presume that the trial court, in rendering its judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, undertook the proper analysis of the law and the facts. <em>DiBella </em>v. <em>Widlitz, </em>supra; <em>Timm </em>v. <em>Timm, </em>195 Conn. 202, 206, 487 A.2d 191 (1985). The trial court\u2019s finding must, therefore, stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\"> Stanley M. Seligson was the president of S and S Tobacco and Candy Company, Inc., at the relevant time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-8\"> In addition to the count for breach of contract, the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint included a second count charging the defendant with wilful misconduct and lack of good faith. The second count was not pressed before the trial court and we, therefore, deem it to have been abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b337-6\"> The replacement cost coverage endorsement provides: \u201c1. Replacement Cost Clause: The provisions of Section 1 of this policy applicable to the property described as covered on a replacement cost basis are amended to substitute the term \u2018replacement cost (without deduction for depreciation)\u2019 for the term \u2018actual cash value\u2019 wherever it appears in this policy, and the Coinsurance Clause of this endorsement supersedes and replaces all other Coinsurance Clauses otherwise applicable, subject in all other respects to the provisions of this endorsement and of Section 1 of this policy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\"> As the insurance statement regarding the full cost of repair or replacement demonstrates, the amount of $23,920 is less than the plaintiffs\u2019 total depreciation claim. The amount in suit reflects the fact that $280,000 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the full amount of the insurance applicable to the property that was destroyed by fire. Because the plaintiffs\u2019 actual cash value claim was $256,080, only $23,920 remained for the depreciation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\"> The replacement cost coverage endorsement provides: \u201c3.
