CPL 700.70 is strictly a procedural mechanism to facilitate proceedings under CPL article 255. <em>(Berger v New York, </em>388 US 41; <em>Katz v United States, </em>389 US 347; <em>People v Basilicato, </em>64 NY2d 103; <em>People v Gallina, </em>66 NY2d 52.) II. Respondent\u2019s actual knowledge of the existence of the wiretap evidence constitutes good cause for the noncompliance with CPL 700.70. <em>(People v Basilicato, </em>64 NY2d 103; <em>People v Greer, </em>42 NY2d 170; <em>People v Briggs, </em>38 NY2d 319; <em>People v Michel, </em>56 NY2d 1014, 57 NY2d 775; <em>People v Costello, </em>101 AD2d 244; <em>People v Wilson, </em>86 AD2d 957; <em>People v Thornton, </em>87 AD2d 991; <em>Matter of Jorge R., </em>120 Misc 2d 348.) III. Actual knowledge aside, the People sustained a finding of good cause. <em>(People v Spruill, </em>47 NY2d 869; <em>People v Eisenoff, </em>121 Misc 2d 222.) IV. Noncompliance with CPL 700.70 or 710.30 can be excused when the goals of the statute have otherwise been met. <em>(People v Mark, </em>68 AD2d 315; <em>People v Anderson, </em>80 AD2d 33; <em>People v Taylor, </em>102 AD2d 944; <em>People v Brown, </em>83 AD2d 699; <em>People v Brown, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>92 AD2d 939; <em>People v Magazine, </em>106 AD2d 473; <em>People v Swanton, </em>107 AD2d 829; <em>People v Merced, </em>119 Misc 2d 238; <em>People v Huntley, </em>15 NY2d 72.) V. The defense motion to suppress was untimely and no good cause for the tardiness was alleged or shown. <em>(People v Coleman, </em>114 Misc 2d 685; <em>People v Key, </em>45 NY2d 111; <em>People v Selby, </em>53 AD2d 878, 43 NY2d 791.) VI. The issue was not properly preserved for appeal. <em>(People v Rivera, </em>53 NY2d 1005; <em>People v Clark, </em>41 NY2d 612; <em>People v Ross, </em>21 NY2d 258; <em>People v Rullo, </em>31 NY2d 894; <em>People v Weis, </em>32 AD2d 856; <em>People v Clayborn, </em>50 AD2d 952; <em>People v Webb, </em>97 AD2d 779.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-5\"><em>J. Kevin Laumer </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-Y\">I. Law office failure and confusion do not establish good cause to excuse untimely compliance with GPL 700.70 when suppression is otherwise mandated. <em>(People v Basilicato, </em>64 NY2d 103; <em>People v Gallina, </em>66 NY2d 52; <em>People v Washington, </em>46 NY2d 116; <em>People v Sher, </em>38 NY2d 600; <em>People v Briggs, </em>38 NY2d 319; <em>People v Spruill, </em>47 NY2d 869; <em>People v Greer, </em>42 NY2d 170.) II. The conduct of the prosecutor in arguing in summation, absent evidence, that defendant had fled from the jurisdiction; the blatant attempt to vouch for the credibility of the People\u2019s witness; and the comments about losing an argument of law on a critical issue were prejudicial errors which denied defendant a fair trial. <em>(People v Libbett, </em>101 AD2d 705, 63 NY2d 763; <em>People v Connette, </em>101 AD2d 699; <em>People v Grice, </em>100 AD2d 419; <em>People v Mott, </em>94 AD2d 415; <em>People v Teiper, </em>186 App Div 830; <em>People v La Cava, </em>75 AD2d 997, <em>appeal dismissed sub nom. Matter of La Cava, </em>57 NY2d 670; <em>People v Fielding, </em>158 NY 542; <em>People v Arce, </em>42 NY2d 179; <em>People v Ashwal, </em>39 NY2d 105; <em>People v Alicea, </em>37 NY2d 601.) III. The proof at trial was insufficient to convict as a matter of law and fact. <em>(People v Hudson, </em>51 NY2d 233; <em>People v Daniels, </em>37 NY2d 624; <em>People v Kress, </em>284 NY 452; <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230.) IV. It was error to allow the District Attorney to impeach his own witness by using the witness\u2019s Grand Jury testimony and out-of-court statements. <em>(People v Fitzpatrick, </em>40 NY2d 44; <em>People v Gilbert, </em>99 AD2d 657; <em>People v Dann, </em>100 AD2d 909; <em>People v Burke, </em>96 AD2d 971.) V. The trial court should have suppressed the evidence secured through the phonetap. <em>(People v Brenes, </em>53 AD2d 78, 42 NY2d 41; <em>United States v Hinton, </em>543 F2d 1002; <em>United States v Martinez, </em>588 F2d 1227; <em>United States v DiMuro, </em>540 F2d 503; <em>United States v Lilia, </em>699 F2d 99; <em>People v Romney, </em>77 AD2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>482.) VI. The phonetap tape recordings should not have been admitted absent a proper legal foundation. <em>(People v Arena, </em>65 AD2d 182, 48 NY2d 944; <em>People v McGee, </em>49 NY2d 48; <em>People v Rodriguez, </em>78 AD2d 769; <em>Epstein v Epstein, </em>285 App Div 593; <em>People v Rogers, </em>48 NY2d 167.) VII. The pen register evidence should not have been admitted because of a lack of foundation, especially in light of the pen register breakdown. <em>(United States v Fuentes, </em>563 F2d 527, <em>cert denied sub nom. Sansone v United States, </em>434 US 959; <em>People v McGee, </em>49 NY2d 48; <em>People v Donaldson, </em>36 AD2d 37.) VIII. The sentence imposed in this case was unduly harsh and severe and, therefore, should be modified in the interest of justice. <em>(People v Farrar, </em>52 NY2d 302; <em>People v McConnell, </em>49 NY2d 340; <em>People v Notey, </em>72 AD2d 279; <em>People v Burghardt, </em>17 AD2d 912; <em>People v Cotter, </em>25 AD2d 609; <em>People v Mosher, </em>24 AD2d 47; <em>Williams v New York, </em>337 US 241; <em>People v Silver, </em>10 AD2d 274.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b209-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b209-6\">Alexander, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Evidence derived from an intercepted communication must be suppressed where there has been a failure to comply with the notice provision of CPL 700.70, and where there has been neither an application for an extension of time within the 15 days provided in that statute nor a showing of good cause for noncompliance and lack of prejudice to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">In March of 1981, the Chautauqua County Drug Task Force began investigating the drug trafficking activities of Gary Hemphill and in connection therewith an undercover police officer made two purchases of LSD from Hemphill. In an effort to gain access to Hemphill\u2019s supplier, the undercover police officer made arrangements with Hemphill to purchase a large quantity of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">In furtherance of the investigation, the Chautauqua County District Attorney applied for and was issued an eavesdropping warrant on Hemphill\u2019s telephone. Conversations between Hemphill and defendant pertaining to drugs were recorded and on September 18, 1981, Hemphill sold the undercover police officer 10,000 \"hits\u201d of LSD that he had purchased from defendant in Cattaraugus County. Hemphill was arrested, and as part of a plea agreement gave testimony before a Cattaraugus County Grand Jury that implicated defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Defendant was subsequently indicted by the Cattaraugus County Grand Jury for criminal sale of a controlled substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7220.41 [4]) and was arraigned on September 22, 1982. Copies of the eavesdropping application and warrant were not served on defendant until November 23, 1982, 61 days after defendant was arraigned. On February 8, 1983, defendant moved to suppress the tapes, for, among other things, failure to comply with CPL 700.70.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In opposing the motion the People contended that there was \u201cgood cause\u201d for the delay in that they had been erroneously informed by the Chautauqua County Task Force that the application and warrant had been served on defendant and when the error was discovered, service was promptly made. Moreover, they argued that defendant was not prejudiced by the delay because he had been aware at all times of the existence of the tapes and knew that the wiretap evidence would be introduced against him. The motion to suppress was denied following a hearing and defendant was thereafter convicted, upon a jury verdict, and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">On appeal from the judgment of conviction, the Appellate Division reversed the conviction on the law, granted the motion to suppress and ordered a new trial. The People have appealed by leave of a judge of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">We begin our discussion by reaffirming that there must be strict compliance with the provisions of New York\u2019s eavesdropping statute (CPL art 700) and that the burden of establishing such compliance rests with the prosecution <em>(People v Gallina, </em>66 NY2d 52, 57; <em>People v Basilicato, </em>64 NY2d 103; <em>People v Washington, </em>46 NY2d 116, 121-122; <em>People v Sher, </em>38 NY2d 600, 603-605; <em>People v Mark, </em>68 AD2d 315, 318). As we observed in <em>People v Washington </em>(46 NY2d, at pp 121-122, <em>supra) </em>\u201d[o]ur interpretation of article 700 must be sensitive to the constitutional guarantees against search and seizure that the statute seeks to protect. The insidiousness of electronic surveillance threatens the right to be free from unjustifiable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>governmental intrusion into one\u2019s individual privacy to a far greater extent than the writs of assistance and general warrants so dreaded by those who successfully battled for the adoption of the Bill of Rights <em>(Olmstead v United States, </em>277 US 438, 476, 478 [Brandeis, J., dissenting])\u201d. It is imperative, therefore, that \"article 700 and all its integral parts [not] be treated lightly or with cavalier disregard\u201d <em>(People v Mark, </em>68 AD2d 315, 318, <em>supra) </em>and that law enforcement officials be sensitive to the fact that there must be meticulous adherence to the terms of the warrant and the statute pursuant to which it issued <em>(see, People v Washington, </em>46 NY2d, at p 124, <em>supra). </em>In sum, \"the requirements of article 700 * * * must be strictly complied with [and i]n the absence of compliance, the State officials lack authority to wiretap, and any interceptions they make are unlawful, and any evidence derived from the wiretap is inadmissible\u201d <em>(People v Sher, </em>38 NY2d, at p 604, <em>supra). </em>The failure of the People here to comply with CPL 700.70 requires suppression of the evidence obtained through the wiretap. Therefore, there should be an affirmance of the Appellate Division order.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">CPL 700.70 prohibits the receipt in evidence or the disclosure otherwise upon the trial of a defendant of the \"contents of any intercepted communication, or evidence derived therefrom * * * unless the people, within fifteen days after arraignment and before the commencement of the trial, furnish the defendant with a copy of the eavesdropping warrant, and accompanying application, under which interception was authorized or approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">It is undisputed that defendant was not furnished with a copy of the eavesdropping warrant and application until 61 days following his arraignment. Nevertheless, the People contend that there was \"substantial\u201d compliance with the statute, and in reliance upon the last sentence of CPL 700.70, which provides that the \"fifteen day period may be extended by the trial court upon good cause shown if it finds that the defendant will not be prejudiced by the delay in receiving such papers\u201d, argue that they have made a sufficient demonstration of \u201cgood cause\u201d to warrant extension of the 15-day period. They argue moreover, that since the purpose of CPL 700.70 is to notify a defendant that his conversations obtained pursuant to an eavesdropping warrant are to be used against him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>to afford him an opportunity to move to suppress them, here, where defendant clearly was aware of the taped conversations and had ample opportunity to move for their suppression, he was not prejudiced by the delay and therefore, exclusion is not warranted. The People urge that the \"good cause\u201d requirement of CPL 700.70 should be analogized to the \"good cause\u201d requirement of CPL 710.30, where it has been held that the defendant\u2019s actual knowledge of the information that is the subject of the notice requirement constitutes good cause to excuse untimely service. They offer as the reason for the delay here the fact that the police agency of another jurisdiction which had conducted the investigation erroneously advised that the documents had been served. We reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We reject the contention that good cause, such as would warrant an extension of the 15-day period, has been demonstrated. We note that the People did not move for an extension of time prior to the expiration of the 15-day period, nor did they affirmatively seek to excuse their failure to comply with the statute. It has been suggested that \"[t]he better procedure, where compliance cannot be satisfied, is for the prosecutor to seek an extension of time prior to the expiration of the statutorily authorized fifteen days\u201d (Bellacosa, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11 A, CPL 700.70). The language of CPL 700.70 provides that the \"fifteen day period may be extended\u201d (emphasis supplied) and thus contemplates that an application be made prior to the expiration of the statutory period. This is made clear when that language is compared to the different language used in CPL 710.30 (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where the court is authorized to \"permit the people to serve such notice <em>thereafter\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The fact that the Legislature has seen fit to use markedly different language in the two provisions clearly indicates an intent that the two statutes be interpreted differently.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And while it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>be \"that the notice requirements of CPL 700.70 and CPL 710.30 serve the same purpose of alerting criminal defendants to the existence of evidence that could be introduced against them at trial so that a timely decision may be made about whether to file a motion to suppress such evidence [that fact does not] warrant altering the plain language of CPL 700.70\u201d <em>(People v Basilicato, </em>64 NY2d 103, 118, <em>supra). </em>Indeed, to import the provisions of 710.30 wholesale into 700.70 would render the 15-day \"timeliness requirement a nullity, in violation of accepted canons of statutory construction\u201d <em>(People v Gallina, </em>66 NY2d 52, 56, <em>supra; see, </em>McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 231).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The justification belatedly offered by the People for their delay in serving the documents is insufficient as a matter of law to excuse their noncompliance with the provisions of CPL 700.70. The fact that the documents were in the custody of law enforcement officials in another county and that those officials had incorrectly advised the People that the wiretap documentation had been timely served upon defendant cannot constitute \"good cause\u201d for failure to comply with CPL 700.70. A \"prosecutor\u2019s office * * * is the spokesman for the Government\u201d <em>(Giglio v United States, </em>405 US 150, 154) and the left hand should be aware of what the right hand has or has not done <em>(Santobello v New York, </em>404 US 257, 262). What was served upon defendant by the Chautauqua County District Attorney apparently was the notice required by CPL 700.50 and since more than a year had elapsed between the discontinuance of the wiretap on Hemphill\u2019s phone and defendant\u2019s indictment and arraignment, there was more than ample time for the People to ascertain the accurate facts had they made diligent inquiry. Thus, the misinformation conveyed by the officials of a neighboring county cannot reasonably be held to excuse the People\u2019s noncompliance with CPL 700.70.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Finally, the fact that defendant had actual knowledge of the wiretap, standing alone, is insufficient to excuse noncompli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>anee with the unambiguous requirements of CPL 700.70. As we recently noted in <em>People v Basilicato </em>(64 NY2d 103, 117, <em>supra), </em>\"[CPL 700.70] require[s] a showing <em>o\u00ed both </em>lack of prejudice and good cause for the delay\u201d. Even if defendant\u2019s knowledge could establish lack of prejudice, it does not satisfy the \"good cause\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Meyer, Simons, Kaye and Titone concur; Judge Hancock, Jr., taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\">. CPL 700.70 provides: \"The contents of any intercepted communication, or evidence derived therefrom, may not be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed upon a trial of a defendant unless the people, within fifteen days after arraignment and before the commencement of the trial, furnish the defendant with a copy of the eavesdropping warrant, and accompanying application, under which interception was authorized or approved. This fifteen day period may be extended by the trial court upon good cause shown if it finds that the defendant will not be prejudiced by the delay in receiving such papers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-6\">. CPL 710.30 provides for notice within 15 days of arraignment of statements or identification evidence that the People intend to offer at trial. Subdivision 2 states: \"Such notice must be served within fifteen days after arraignment and before trial, and upon such service the defendant must be accorded reasonable opportunity to move before trial, pursuant to subdivision one of section 710.40, to suppress the specified evidence. For good cause shown, however, the court may permit the people to serve such notice thereafter and in such case it must accord the defendant reasonable opportunity thereafter to make a suppression motion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\">. We note that both statutes were amended contemporaneously by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Legislature in 1976 (L 1976, ch 194, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3) and conclude that the use of different language was purposeful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\">. The People\u2019s argument that defendant\u2019s suppression motion was untimely pursuant to CPL 255.20 is without merit. That section provides that pretrial motions in an action in which an eavesdropping warrant and application have been furnished shall be served or filed within 45 days after the date of service of the eavesdropping documentation. In the instant case, the People expressly agreed to defendant\u2019s request for an adjournment, and thereby waived any objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\">. We note that the prosecutor has conceded that several of his remarks in summation were better left unsaid. We trust therefore that they will not be repeated, should there be a retrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
