The trial court erred in allowing introduction of alleged uncharged cocaine sales and drug-related activities by appellant during cross-examination and rebuttal. <em>(People v Molineux, </em>168 NY 264; <em>United States v O\u2019Connor, </em>580 F2d 38; <em>People v Robinson, </em>36 NY2d 224; <em>People v Henson, </em>33 NY2d 63; <em>People v Caprio, </em>47 AD2d 1; <em>People v Fiore, </em>34 NY2d 81; <em>People v McKinney, </em>24 NY2d 180; <em>People v Beam, </em>57 NY2d 241; <em>People v Aponte, </em>69 AD2d 204; <em>People v Pavao, </em>59 NY2d 282.) II. The trial court erred in allowing testimony concerning appellant\u2019s alleged uncharged cocaine sales occurring prior to and subsequent to the charged sale since such testimony was not inextricably intertwined with testimony pertaining to the charged sale. <em>(People v Ventimiglia, </em>52 NY2d 350; <em>People v Jones, </em>62 AD2d 356; <em>People v Bronte, </em>47 AD2d 561; <em>People v Sossa, </em>70 AD2d 814.) III. The trial court erred in eliciting testimony regarding alleged uncharged cocaine sales and other drug-related activities by appellant. <em>(People v Yut Wai Tom, </em>53 NY2d 44; <em>People v Moulton, </em>43 NY2d 944; <em>People v Cooper, </em>96 AD2d 866; <em>People v Iskandar, </em>74 AD2d 880; <em>People v McCann, </em>90 AD2d 554.) IV. The trial court erred in its <em>Sandoval </em>ruling because it failed to properly balance the prejudicial impact against the probative value. <em>(People v Williams, </em>56 NY2d 236; <em>People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371; <em>People v Coe, </em>95 AD2d 685; <em>People v Patterson, 88 </em>AD2d 694.) V. The trial court erred in failing to give the jury cautionary instructions limiting the use of evidence relating to appellant\u2019s prior convictions and alleged uncharged cocaine sales and other drug-related activities to the issue of credibility. <em>(People v Moorer, </em>77 AD2d 575; <em>People v Reyes, </em>64 AD2d 657; <em>People v Boone, </em>56 AD2d 892; <em>People v Harris, </em>52 AD2d 560; <em>People v Range, </em>49 AD2d 832.) VI. The People\u2019s failure to make timely disclosure of materials requested by appellant in his pretrial discovery motion, and the trial court\u2019s failure to request their disclosure, denied appellant his right to due process and a fair trial and constitutes reversible error. <em>(People v Jones, </em>85 AD2d 50; <em>People v Andre W., </em>44 NY2d 179; <em>People v Geaslen, </em>54 NY2d 510; <em>People v Rosario, </em>9 NY2d 286; <em>People v Copicotto, </em>50 NY2d 222; <em>People v Simmons, </em>36 NY2d 126; <em>Giglio v United States, </em>405 US 150; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>People v Di Matteo, </em>80 Misc 2d 1029; <em>People v Testa, </em>40 NY2d 1018; <em>People v Poole, </em>48 NY2d 144.) VII. The trial court erred in charging the jury that appellant was an interested witness and in not charging that the police were interested witnesses. <em>(People v Brabham, </em>77 AD2d 626.) VIII. The trial court erred in allowing the jury to consider bolstering testimony pertaining to the photographs. <em>(People v Harris, </em>52 AD2d 560; <em>People v Kenny, </em>36 AD2d 477; <em>People v Mann, </em>43 Misc 2d 786; <em>People v Williams, </em>29 AD2d 780.) IX. Appellant was improperly sentenced because the trial court based sentencing on uncharged crimes. <em>(People v Hall, </em>46 NY2d 873.) X. The conviction must be reversed because appellant was denied his right to a fair trial and because the errors committed were harmful. <em>(People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-5\"><em>Sol Greenberg, District Attorney (John P.

The evidence in the People\u2019s direct case of an uncharged drug sale was inextricably intertwined with the crime charged. <em>(People v Vails, </em>43 NY2d 364; <em>People v Mitchell, </em>40 AD2d 117; <em>People v Ventimiglia, </em>52 NY2d 350; <em>People v Ward, </em>62 NY2d 816; <em>People v Robinson, </em>36 NY2d 224.) II. The uncharged crimes introduced on rebuttal were properly admitted and cautionary instructions were not required. <em>(People v Lam Lek Chong, </em>45 NY2d 64; <em>People v Roche, </em>45 NY2d 78; <em>People v McCann, </em>90 AD2d 554; <em>People v Molineux, </em>168 NY 264; <em>People v Ricchiuti, </em>93 AD2d 842; <em>People v Calvano, </em>30 NY2d 199; <em>People v Mann, </em>31 NY2d 253; <em>People v Harris, </em>57 NY2d 335; <em>People v Ventimiglia, </em>52 NY2d 350; <em>People v Landor, </em>92 AD2d 625.) III. The trial court\u2019s involvement in questioning witnesses was not reversible error. <em>(People v Yut Wai Tom, </em>53 NY2d 44; <em>People v Melendez, </em>55 NY2d 445; <em>People v Buchanan, </em>145 NY 1; <em>People v Hinton, </em>31 NY2d 71; <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230; <em>People v Jamison, </em>47 NY2d 882.) IV. The trial court\u2019s <em>Sandoval </em>ruling was not error. <em>(People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371; <em>People v Santarelli, </em>49 NY2d 241; <em>People v Shields, </em>46 NY2d 764; <em>People v Duffy, </em>36 NY2d 258, 423 US 861; <em>People v Bennette, </em>56 NY2d 142; <em>People v Mackey, </em>49 NY2d 274; <em>People v Mayrant, </em>43 NY2d 236; <em>People v Wood, </em>94 AD2d 814; <em>People v Rawlins, </em>105 AD2d 552; <em>People v Moore, </em>42 AD2d 268.) V. Defendant\u2019s claims of nondisclosure are meritless. <em>(People v Tutt, </em>38 NY2d 1011.) VI. There was no error in charging that defendant was an interested witness. <em>(People v Barr, </em>75 AD2d 14; <em>People v Bell, </em>38 NY2d 116; <em>People v Gadsden, </em>80 AD2d 508; <em>People v Brabham, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>77 AD2d 626; <em>People v Sbru, </em>51 AD2d 978.) VII. There was no improper bolstering in this case. VIII. Defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon the conviction for the crime charged. <em>(People v Hall, </em>46 NY2d 873.) IX. Defendant received a fair trial. <em>(People v Arce, </em>42 NY2d 179; <em>People v Brown, </em>48 NY2d 921; <em>People v Kennedy, </em>47 NY2d 196; <em>People v Benzinger, </em>36 NY2d 29; <em>People v Cummings, </em>90 AD2d 622; <em>People v Barnes, </em>50 NY2d 375; <em>People v Bracey, </em>41 NY2d 296.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b176-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b176-6\">Meyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Evidence concerning sales of narcotics other than that for which defendant is on trial is improperly admitted as \"inextricably intertwined\u201d when it can be readily redacted and is not essential to proof of the crime in issue. Nor does a defendant \"open the door\u201d to admission of other crime evidence in rebuttal by his testimony that he made no sale of narcotics, that he knew the person to whom he is alleged to have made the sale for which he is on trial to be an undercover officer and had assisted him until asked to engage in an illegal act, after which the officer and several of his colleagues threatened him with arrest, such rebuttal testimony being relevant only to defendant\u2019s criminal character and not to any element of the crime charged or in refutation of any affirmative fact proved by defendant. The order of the Appellate Division should, therefore, be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Defendant was charged with the criminal sale of a controlled substance to an undercover officer on September 26, 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to commencement of the trial defendant\u2019s attorney sought a ruling <em>(see, People v Ventimiglia, </em>52 NY2d 350, 362) that the undercover officer not be permitted to testify, because suggestive of a prior sale, that at the time of the September 26th transaction, the officer handed defendant $300, after which defendant put the cocaine which was the subject of the indictment on the seat of the officer\u2019s car and said, \"Here\u2019s <em>another </em>seven for you. It\u2019s on the front seat. Don\u2019t let it melt. That\u2019s $650. See you later\u201d (emphasis added). Notwithstanding defense counsel\u2019s argument that mention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the $300 was probative of nothing except to suggest an earlier transaction, the Trial Judge, although excluding earlier conversation concerning whether defendant was owed $250 or $300, ruled the quoted conversation admissible because \"[t]hese are the actual words of the parties\u201d and because \"to take it out * * * would one, confuse the witness and two, confuse the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">A further preliminary ruling was requested by defense counsel during trial in order to exclude testimony covering a later meeting of defendant and the undercover officer on the same afternoon, September 26, 1983, at a bar. Told by the officer that he had \"$650 for you,\u201d defendant, according to the officer, directed that they meet in the men\u2019s room, where, according to the officer, the following conversation occurred: \"He [defendant] said, T got another quarter.\u2019 He said, 'This is good-quality rock.\u2019 He says, T got to get 700 for it,\u2019 he says, 'but it\u2019s really good rock.\u2019 I said, 'I only got about 700 on me. I already owe you 650 from the earlier deal today.\u2019 He said, 'Well,\u2019 he said, 'give me the 700. I\u2019ll give you the rock and you can owe me the 650,\u2019 \u201d after which defendant gave the officer seven grams of cocaine. Once again the Trial Judge ruled the testimony admissible because \"for him to testify he paid him $650 is for the witness to lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Thereafter defendant took the stand and denied ever giving or selling any narcotics to the undercover officer. His version of their relationship was that he had known the officer for about six weeks prior to September 26th so as to call him friend and had seen him around for about a year before that; that after the officer said he would lose his job with the State Police if he was convicted of driving while intoxicated and reckless driving charges for which he had been given summonses, defendant loaned the officer $500 and introduced him to an attorney; that the officer had thereafter asked him to plant a bug in the attorney\u2019s office and to steal some papers from the attorney\u2019s office concerning the State Police, had become incensed when defendant refused to do so and with several of his fellow officers had threatened defendant with imprisonment if he went to the FBI. On cross-examination, defendant was asked about his sale of drugs to the officer on September 8th, 16th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd and the second sale on the 26th, all of which were ruled admissible under <em>People v Molineux </em>(168 NY 264), and all of which defendant denied ever occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>On rebuttal, the People were permitted, based upon the Trial Judge\u2019s ruling that the defense was \"that of a setup, which in my judgment, comes under that <em>[Molineux] </em>category of accident and/or mistake,\u201d to introduce the testimony of the undercover officer and three other such officers concerning the seven sales defendant had been cross-examined about as well as the laboratory test reports of the drugs allegedly sold by him in those transactions and the evidence receipt log showing when the substances received had been taken to the State Crime Laboratory for testing. Because the judge\u2019s charge to the jury made no specific reference to the other crimes proof, defendant\u2019s attorney requested that the jury be instructed that the proof of uncharged crimes could be considered only as to defendant\u2019s credibility and not as evidence of the crime charged. That request was denied, the Trial Judge offering instead to charge that the proof went to rebuttal of the claim of conspiracy and/or frameup, an offer which defendant\u2019s attorney declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Convicted and sentenced to <em>8 Vs </em>to 25 years, defendant appealed to the Appellate Division, which, with one Justice dissenting, modified by remitting to the trial court for resentencing, but otherwise affirmed. The dissenting Justice did not disagree with admission of the evidence of uncharged crimes, but would have reversed for denial of the requested charge that that evidence could be considered only on defendant\u2019s credibility. We conclude that the other crimes evidence presented on the People\u2019s direct case and on rebuttal was inadmissible and that although cross-examination as to other sales was permissible for purposes of impeachment, cross-examinatian as to the number of transactions allowed was excessive and improper. We, therefore, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">As we were at pains to point out in <em>People v Ventimiglia (supra), </em>the \"inextricably interwoven\u201d exception for other crimes evidence recognized in <em>People v Vails </em>(43 NY2d 364) \"does not make evidence admissible simply because it is part of conversation other parts of which are admissible. To be inextricably interwoven in the <em>Vails </em>sense the evidence must be explanatory of the acts done or words used in the otherwise admissible part of the evidence\u201d (52 NY2d, at p 361). As <em>Vails </em>put it, it must be \"evidence relating directly to the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>charged\u201d such that \"the value of the evidence clearly outweighs any possible prejudice\u201d (43 NY2d, at p 369).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Here, the payment of $300 for a prior transaction was not necessary to comprehension of defendant\u2019s statement with respect to the sale covered by the indictment <em>(People v Ward, </em>62 NY2d 816, 818), and the prejudicial word \"another\u201d in the conversation which occurred as that sale was being made could have been redacted \"without distortion of its meaning\u201d <em>(People v Ventimiglia, </em>52 NY2d, at p 362, <em>supra). </em>Nor was the men\u2019s room conversation concerning the second September 26th sale probative of anything with respect to the earlier sale, except the fact that the $650 due from the earlier sale had been paid. To establish that fact, however, required nothing more than a question concerning whether the $650 referred to in the earlier conversation had been paid to defendant and the response that it had in fact been paid to him later the same afternoon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">It was, therefore, error to deny defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s request for the exclusionary rulings he sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">It was also error to allow cross-examination and rebuttal testimony concerning the seven other transactions listed above. Here, as in <em>People v Rahming </em>(26 NY2d 411), defendant confined his direct testimony to a denial that he had sold any drugs to the undercover officer and his version of his relationship with the officer. Nothing in that testimony involved the seven sales concerning which defendant was cross-examined. \"Thus, it was error for the prosecutor on cross-examination to have ranged beyond the defendant\u2019s direct examination 'in order to lay a foundation for the tainted evidence on rebuttal\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Rahming, </em>26 NY2d, at p 418, <em>supra, </em>quoting <em>People v Miles, </em>23 NY2d 527, 543). Nor can cross-examination to the extent permitted be justified as impeachment by evidence of specific acts tending to impair credibility. Although such cross-examination is not precluded by the fact that the acts inquired into are similar to the crime charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>(People v Pavao, </em>59 NY2d 282, 292), the overwhelming prejudice resulting from the number of transactions inquired into <em>(see, People v Santarelli, </em>49 NY2d 241) proscribed allowance of cross-examination on all of them <em>(see, People v Ventimiglia, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In any event, an impeachment purpose could not have justified introduction of the mass of rebuttal evidence introduced,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the cross-examiner is bound by the witness\u2019 answers on such collateral matters <em>(People v Pavao, </em>59 NY2d, at p 288, <em>supra) </em>and, as already noted, defendant denied that any sales had occurred. The other crimes evidence was improper rebuttal for the further reasons that it was neither relevant to an element of the crime with which defendant was charged nor \" 'in denial of some affirmative fact which the answering party ha[d] endeavored to prove\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Harris, </em>57 NY2d 335, 345, quoting <em>Marshall v Davies, </em>78 NY 414, 420). Such evidence becomes admissible when a defendant concedes that an illegal transaction occurred but denies legal capacity <em>(People v Santarelli, </em>49 NY2d 241, <em>supra) </em>or criminal intent <em>(People v Calvano, </em>30 NY2d 199; <em>People v Schwartzman, </em>24 NY2d 241, <em>cert denied </em>396 US 846; <em>People v Dales, </em>309 NY 97), or when a defendant who has previously committed the same crime using a unique <em>modus operandi </em>puts the People to their proof as to identity with respect to the case on trial <em>(People v Allweiss, </em>48 NY2d 40). But such evidence is not admissible when it \"has no bearing other than to show that defendant is of a criminal bent or character\u201d <em>(People v Dales, </em>309 NY, at p 101, <em>supra; see, </em>Proposed New York Code of Evidence \u00a7 404 M).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Here, defendant flatly denies ever having sold narcotics to the undercover officer and there is neither any issue concerning his identity nor anything unique involved in the procedure followed in the other seven sales. Moreover, this is not, as the People argue, a situation like the agency defense involved in <em>People v Lam Lek Chong </em>(45 NY2d 64), where defendant, by his claim that he was acting only as agent rather than seller, himself put in issue his own prior dealings with the purchaser, or like the entrapment defense involved in <em>People v Mann </em>(31 NY2d 253), where defendant\u2019s claim that he was enticed into committing the crime made evidence of his criminal predisposition relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The affirmative facts which defendant sought to prove had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>nothing to do with the selling of drugs. His claim was that he had rejected the undercover officer\u2019s request that he spy upon the attorney to whom he had sent the officer and that he had been apprehended and threatened by the officer and his colleagues as a result. The refutation of that claim lay in proof that defendant\u2019s story was untrue; in proof, if you will, that the officers\u2019 actions, intent and motives were proper, not of defendant\u2019s criminal predisposition to sell drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Nor, defendant having denied all involvement with drug sales, was there, as the Trial Judge suggested, any claim of accident or mistake on defendant\u2019s part to be negated <em>(cf. People v Henson, </em>33 NY2d 63). To the contrary, here, as in <em>People v Molineux </em>(168 NY 264, 300-305, <em>supra), </em>there being no issue concerning defendant\u2019s intent, mistake or accident cannot furnish a pretext for the admission of evidence of other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Because defendant\u2019s testimony put in issue not his own character or intent but the character and intent of the undercover officers, it was error to allow the cross-examination as to all seven other sales and to allow rebuttal testimony as to any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Kaye, Alexander, Titone and Hancock, Jr., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\">. He was also indicted for criminal possession on September 30, 1983, but the two counts were severed and the sale count was tried first.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\">. Defendant\u2019s attorney argues correctly that because Penal Law \u00a7 220.00 (1) defines \"sell\u201d to include \"give or dispose of to another\u201d it was not necessary to prove payment <em>(see, People v Lam Lek Chong, </em>45 NY2d 64, 72), but payment having in fact been made, the People were entitled to prove the payment as a fact directly related to the sale for which defendant was on trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">. The People\u2019s direct case took 139 pages of transcript; its rebuttal, 294.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
