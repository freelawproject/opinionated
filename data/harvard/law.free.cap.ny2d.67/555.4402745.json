The prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose requested, favorable identification information, failure to preserve relevant photo arrays, and misleading of the defense and the <em>Wade </em>court deprived appellant of his due process right to a fair trial. <em>(Brady v Maryland, </em>373 US 83; <em>United States v Agurs, </em>427 US 97; <em>United States v Menghi, </em>641 F2d 72; <em>People v Geaslen, </em>54 NY2d 510; <em>People v Shea, </em>54 AD2d 722; <em>People v Brown, </em>117 Misc 2d 587; <em>People v Ahmed, </em>20 NY2d 958; <em>People v Simmons, </em>36 NY2d 126; <em>People v Johnson, </em>106 AD2d 469; <em>United States v Wade, </em>388 US 218.) II. Appellant was deprived of due process of law by denial of his motion to reopen the <em>Wade </em>hearing. <em>(People v Martin, </em>35 AD2d 786; <em>People v Fuentes, </em>53 NY2d 892; <em>People v Villani, </em>59 NY2d 781.) III. The trial court erred in admitting, over defense objection, medical testimony which lacks sufficient probative force to be relevant. <em>(Matott v Ward, </em>48 NY2d 455; <em>Matter of Miller v National Cabinet Co., </em>8 NY2d 277; <em>People u Feldman, </em>299 NY 153; <em>People v Nitzberg, </em>287 NY 183; <em>People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b619-10\"><em>Richard J.

No violation pursuant to the authority of <em>Brady v Maryland </em>(373 US 83) occurred in the instant case. Accordingly, a new trial is not warranted. <em>(United States v Agurs, </em>427 US 97; <em>People v Simmons, </em>36 NY2d 126; <em>People v Geaslen, </em>54 NY2d 510.) II. Defendant has waived his right to reopen the <em>Wade </em>hearing; nonetheless, the lower court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion at the time of defendant\u2019s sentence was proper. III. The issue of the admissibility of the opinion evidence of a medical expert, whose qualifications went unchallenged below has not been preserved for this court\u2019s review; nevertheless, the testimony of Dr. James Hassett was properly received. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>(People v Thomas, </em>53 NY2d 983; <em>Tubiola v Baker, </em>225 App Div 420; <em>People v Bethune, </em>105 AD2d 262; <em>Matott v Ward, </em>48 NY2d 455; <em>People v Allweiss, </em>48 NY2d 40; <em>Matter of Miller v National Cabinet Co., </em>8 NY2d 277.) IV. Defendant\u2019s convictions of criminal use of a firearm in the first degree were erroneously dismissed by the court below and should be reinstated by this court. <em>(People v Williams, </em>47 AD2d 262; <em>People v Lopez, </em>79 AD2d 531; <em>People v Gaul, </em>63 AD2d 563; <em>People v Almestica, </em>42 NY2d 222; <em>People v Horne, </em>121 Misc 2d 389.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b620-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b620-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">These cross appeals concern the consequence of the People\u2019s failure to produce photo arrays in response to defendant\u2019s request, the admissibility of expert testimony, and the propriety of separate convictions of robbery in the first degree involving a firearm and criminal use of the same firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">On February 5, 1981, several masked men entered a Buffalo tavern and committed a gunpoint robbery. Five days later, Merrel Sanford, a special police officer who had chanced upon the incident, identified defendant from a photo array as a participant in the robbery. Indicted for robbery, criminal use of a firearm, and unlawful imprisonment, defendant made a demand for production of documents and a <em>Brady </em>request, including a request for \"photos that were used in the photograph identification\u201d. The People responded that there was no <em>Brady </em>material, and offered to make available the District Attorney\u2019s file (other than work product and Grand Jury minutes) for defendant\u2019s inspection. At a <em>Wade </em>hearing, which resulted in denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress any identification evidence, the People displayed the five photographs used when defendant was identified. Moreover, they assured defense counsel (contrary to doubts he had voiced) that there was no photograph of defendant in a first array that had been viewed by Sanford, and that a parole picture of defendant was used because it was the only recent photograph the People had of defendant. In a letter three days later, the People advised defense counsel that the first photo array shown to Sanford was not in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">At a bench trial commencing June 23, 1982 before the same Judge who denied defendant\u2019s suppression motion, Sanford was extensively cross-examined about his prior identification of defendant. He testified that he had viewed at least two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>photo arrays \u2014 the first immediately following the crime, at which defendant\u2019s picture did not appear, and the second five days later, when he was shown more than one picture of defendant. During the cross-examination, in response to defense counsel\u2019s question, the People assured him that the photographs were still available. Defendant made no objection to Sanford\u2019s identification testimony, no effort to reopen the <em>Wade </em>hearing, and no mention of the People\u2019s failure to produce in his comprehensive motion at the close of the People\u2019s case or elsewhere, until after the court had determined that defendant was guilty. The Appellate Division modified the judgment of conviction of seven counts of robbery in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 160.15 [4]), one count of robbery in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 160.15 [2]), and two counts of criminal use of a firearm in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 265.09 [2]) by reversing the two weapons counts, and otherwise affirmed. Both parties appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Defendant urges that the People violated <em>Brady </em>by failing to produce the photographs in response to his requests, and that he was therefore denied a fair trial. Assuming the disputed information is <em>Brady </em>material, we conclude that defendant is entitled neither to a new trial nor to reopen the <em>Wade </em>hearing. While the People unquestionably have a duty to disclose exculpatory material in their control <em>(see, People v Simmons, </em>36 NY2d 126, 131), and failure to respond to a specific, relevant request is seldom, if ever, excusable <em>(see, People v Cwikla, </em>46 NY2d 434, 441), here \u2014 though the prosecutor\u2019s conduct with respect to production is hardly laudable \u2014reversal is not required. The information was known to defense counsel at the latest during his cross-examination of Sanford <em>(cf. People v Ahmed, </em>20 NY2d 958), when the details of the various arrays were elicited and the photographs still available for inspection, yet defendant took no steps to challenge the identification based on that information until after he was found guilty. Defendant cannot claim that he was deprived of due process when he had the opportunity during the bench trial to cross-examine the identifying witness using the allegedly exculpatory evidence <em>(see, People v Smith, </em>63 NY2d 41, 68, <em>cert denied </em>\u2014 US \u2014, 105 S Ct 1226; <em>compare, People v Geaslen, </em>54 NY2d 510). Similarly, in these circumstances the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s posttrial motion to reopen the <em>Wade </em>hearing <em>(see, </em>CPL 710.40 [4]; <em>People v Fuentes, </em>53 NY2d 892).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">'Nor is there merit to defendant\u2019s contention that \u2014 in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>case where the testimony indicated two shots had been fired at the person identified as defendant, and he was seen several hours later with his head and hand bleeding and bandaged\u2014 the expert medical testimony regarding scars found on defendant\u2019s body should have been stricken as speculative. Expert conclusions need not be asserted with certainty, so long as the witness demonstrates a degree of confidence in his conclusions sufficient to satisfy accepted standards of reliability <em>(see, Matter of Anthony M., </em>63 NY2d 270, 280; <em>Matott v Ward, </em>48 NY2d 455, 459). The weight to be accorded such testimony lies within the province of the trier of fact <em>(People v Thomas, </em>53 NY2d 983). Defendant\u2019s objection, made at the close of the doctor\u2019s testimony, was to strike that testimony in its entirety as speculative. The trial court acted within its discretion in concluding that the testimony as a whole was not without some probative value. While the doctor could not fix the dates of defendant\u2019s wounds with any certainty, he was able to identify a scar on defendant\u2019s left hand as an untreated bullet wound at least four months old.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Finally, reaching the People\u2019s cross appeal, the Appellate Division properly concluded that robbery in the first degree could not serve as the predicate crime for the weapons counts. Defendant\u2019s convictions of robbery in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 160.15) and criminal use of a weapon in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 265.09) are \"concurrent counts\u201d because defendant could receive only concurrent sentences (CPL 300.30 [3]; <em>see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.25 [2]). However, neither crime is \"greater\u201d than the other \u2014 each being a class B felony \u2014 and they therefore constitute \"non-inclusory concurrent counts\u201d (CPL 300.30 [4]). Accordingly, the trial court was expressly authorized to consider all counts by CPL 300.40 (3) (a), which provides that, \"[w]ith respect to non-inclusory concurrent counts, the court may in its discretion submit one or more or all thereof\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Although technically proper, defendant\u2019s convictions of both crimes should not stand. Neither crime contains an element which is not also an element of the other crime. The gun first elevated defendant\u2019s robbery conviction to a class B violent felony; the class B felony and possession of that same gun then sustained the conviction for criminal possession of a firearm. When use of or display of a firearm is an element of a class B felony, the use or display of that same firearm cannot also be the predicate for criminal display of a firearm in the first degree. We therefore conclude that the convictions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>both crimes under these circumstances constituted an abuse of discretion <em>(compare, People v Leiva, </em>63 NY2d 288).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Meyer, Simons, Kaye, Alexander, Titone and Hancock, Jr., concur in Per Curiam opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
