The transcript of appellant\u2019s sealed psychiatric proceeding is confidential and its release to the press for unlimited public dissemination is barred by statute and by the New York and United States Constitutions. <em>(Danziger v Hearst Corp., </em>304 NY 244; <em>Taylor v United States, </em>222 F2d 398; <em>United States ex rel.

The transcript at issue here may not be released because such release would present a reasonable likelihood that appellant\u2019s Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>and State constitutional right to a fair trial will be jeopardized. <em>(Sheppard v Maxwell, </em>384 US 333; <em>Matter of Gannett Co. v De Pasquale, </em>43 NY2d 370; <em>Matter of Poughkeepsie Newspapers v Rosenblatt, </em>92 AD2d 232, 61 NY2d 1005.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b536-5\"><em>Frederick A.

It protects them against invasions of their privacy and against professional judgments which tend to lengthen their confinement. Since the statutory scheme assuring confidentiality protects all patient records and information and does not permit public disclosure under any circumstances, it was error to direct disclosure of the transcript in this case, solely on the basis of the public\u2019s interest in what occurred. <em>(Woe v Cuomo, </em>729 F2d 96; <em>People v Mobil Oil Corp., </em>48 NY2d 192; <em>People ex rel.

The confidentiality of retention hearings is not absolute and the news media may have access to those hearings subject to guidelines preserving confidentiality and privacy. II. No legitimate and existing privacy interest of Mary Ventura would be compromised by disclosure of the redacted transcript. <em>(Cynthia B. v New Rochelle Hosp. Med.

Held by bystanders, Ventura was arrested and charged with attempted murder and assault in the first degree and remanded to Bellevue Hospital Center for psychiatric observation. These events were immediately reported in the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In the ensuing days, the newspapers reported that in July 1985 Ventura had been a psychiatric patient in Kings County Hospital, and that she had been released on September 27, 1985 \u2014 only weeks before the assault \u2014 following a judicial proceeding under the Mental Hygiene Law. Her name and photograph, the details of the incident, her hospitalization and her background were widely publicized. Ventura\u2019s mother and her neighbors made public statements about her hospitalization, her release and her past erratic, even violent behavior. Within two days of the incident, a spokesman for appellant Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) announced that the Judge who had presided at Ventura\u2019s retention hearing ordered release over the objection of psychiatrists, and the Judge and his law clerk responded that the psychiatric recommendation had been followed. Controversy immediately erupted over whether procedures for the release of mental patients, designed for the protection of both the patients and the public, were being properly applied \u2014 and if not where the fault lay.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In this factual context, the Special Term Judge, affirmed by the Appellate Division, granted the application of respondent New York News, Inc. (now joined by other media respondents) for release of the court file, to the extent of ordering disclosure of the transcript of Ventura\u2019s retention hearing, redacted so as to reveal solely counsels\u2019 arguments (including the history of Ventura\u2019s hospitalization), the testifying doctor\u2019s recommendation (including some reference to Ventura\u2019s condition), and the court\u2019s determination. This redacted transcript is the focus of the present appeal. Appellants, Ventura and HHC, emphasize the importance of maintaining strict secrecy, while respondents urge that the public interest in proper procedures for release of confined mental patients demands disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The Legislature, sensitive to the strong public interest in maintaining confidentiality of psychiatric information, has enacted a comprehensive scheme to shield records of mental patients from public view. As Governor Cuomo noted in approving legislation clarifying and strengthening that scheme: \"At the very heart of the client-professional relationship in mental health care is its confidentiality. The bills strengthen existing protection against the inappropriate disclosure of mental health records and thereby strengthen the integrity of mental health care\u201d (Memorandum of Governor Cuomo, 1984 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 3654). The confidentiality provisions of the Mental Hygiene Law operate to protect the patient\u2019s interests by preventing private or embarrassing disclosures and also by encouraging unconstrained diagnoses and treatment appropriate to the patient\u2019s condition; they extend not only to patient records on care and treatment but also to clinical information, including information concerning the patient\u2019s admission and legal status and the documents pertinent to those matters (Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 33.13), and to hospitalization and discharge proceedings (Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 9.31). The limited instances when information about a patient or a patient\u2019s proceeding may be disclosed, and to whom it may be disclosed, are strictly prescribed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In the extraordinary circumstances presented, Ventura\u2019s retention hearing has \u2014 in a single narrow respect \u2014 become a matter of public concern, calling into question for the first time whether the press can ever be \"someone properly interested\u201d in the release of papers sealed under the Mental Hygiene Law <em>(see, </em>\u00a7 9.31 [f]). Here, Ventura attracted public interest not merely because of statements of an HHC official or hearing Judge. Rather, her assault, together with the statements of her mother and neighbors, immediately focused attention on her identity and condition, including her hospitalization and discharge only weeks before the incident. Widespread concern naturally centered on the procedure that resulted in her discharge from confinement. To say that, even where a patient\u2019s identity is known and there is a legitimate public concern in disclosure of information, secrecy must be blindly maintained \u2014 that the press can <em>never </em>be \"someone properly interested\u201d <em>(contrast, </em>Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 9.31 [f], <em>with </em>\u00a7 33.13 [d]) \u2014 safeguards no interest sought to be protected by the Legislature and sacrifices a legitimate public interest in information regarding procedures for the release of mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>patients. We therefore agree with both lower courts that some disclosure of information to respondents is appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The first inquiry must of course be whether the public interest in disclosure can be fully satisfied without risk to the public interest in nondisclosure. Here we agree with respondents, in their argument before us, that disclosure can be accomplished in a manner that \"will help the public determine whether current procedures for release of confined mental patients worked properly, without offending the confidentiality provisions of the statute.\u201d But the transcript of the retention hearing, even as carefully redacted below, reveals certain information concerning Ventura\u2019s hospitalization and condition in a situation where the dual public interest can be otherwise fully served. Public concern centers not on details of Ventura\u2019s personal history, condition or treatment but on retention procedures, and particularly the question whether the court ordered her release contrary to or in accordance with the doctor\u2019s medical recommendation. As stated by respondents in their brief to this court: \"The only issue to be determined by releasing the transcript is who, if anyone, has been telling the truth, and who has not. That, in turn, would disclose whether statutory procedures were followed, if not why not, and, if so, whether they should be changed.\u201d Making public that, at the retention hearing (held Sept. 12, 1985) the doctor recommended hospitalization for two weeks, and that the court followed this recommendation and ordered her release after two weeks, thus satisfies the need for information regarding statutory procedures, without revealing information about the patient. The testimony of the doctor and transcript of the retention hearing, in relevant part, read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\"Q. When do you think the patient could be discharged?</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\"A. Two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\"MR. FARMER: I have no further questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">\"THE COURT: The doctor\u2019s recommendation of two week hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">[Off-the-record discussion.]</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">\"THE COURT: Writ sustained. Release in two weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">At all events, disclosure of papers sealed under the Mental Hygiene Law cannot be premised on rule 694.7 (c) of the Appellate Division, Second Department (22 NYCRR 694.7 [c]), which was a basis of the decision below. That rule simply limits media access to hearings relating to the mental condition of a person under the Mental Hygiene Law. It in no way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>sanctions release of papers, as to which there are specific statutory prohibitions. Whether the rule itself comports with the confidentiality requirements of the Mental Hygiene Law is an issue we do not reach on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, by limiting unsealing of the transcript to the above-quoted material, and as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Meyer, Simons, Kaye, Alexander, Titone and Hancock, Jr., concur in Per Curiam opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Order modified, without costs, in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
