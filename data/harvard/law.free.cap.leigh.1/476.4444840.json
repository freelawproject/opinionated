And, on the capias ad respondendum, which was dated the 5th June 1822, and returnable to the ensuing August term, an alderman of the city indorsed an order requiring appearance bail, in the following words: \u2018 \u2018June 6th 1822. Upon proper affidavit made before me, the sergeant will hold the within named M. Homer to bail, in the sum of 150 dollars. \u2019 \u2019 Homer was arrested, and Hawkins became bound as his appearance bail. The process was duly returned. But the affidavit, \u00abpon which the order of the alderman requiring bail, was founded, was not returned or filed; nor did it appear whether the affidavit was in writing or not. Gibson filed his declaration at the October rules 1822; and the defendant failing to appear, judgment by default was entered at the rules, against him and Hawkins as His appearance bail; which, at the November rules, was confirmed, and a writ of inquiry awarded. At the November term ensuing, Homer, without setting aside this office judgment, applied for and obtained a continuance; and the case was continued from term to term, till July term 1824; when Hawkins moved the court to discharge him from his obligation as appearance bail, on the ground, that no sufficient affidavit had been filed in the cause to justify the order requiring bail (Homer being now, not an inhabitant of Virginia). The court refused to discharge the bail. Then Hawkins being allowed to defend the suit for the principal, pleaded the general issue. The jury found a verdict for Gibson, for 112 dollars ; whereupon the court gave ^judgment against Homer and Hawkins his appearance bail. And Hawkins appealed to the circuit court of Henrico.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-11\">The circuit court adjourned the following questions to the general court: 1. Whether, under the statute authorising a judge of the general court, or a justice of the peace, to require bail in actions wherein appearance bail is not demandable of right, it is necessary that the judge or justice should return the affidavit required by the statute, to the court from which the process issues? 2. Whether, if it be necessary to return it, and it be not so returned, the appearance bail can in such case be relieved, and if so, whether he can be discharged on motion? 3. Ought the bail to be discharged, in this case, upon the whole matter appearing in the record?<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQX\">*The general court certified its opinion to the circuit court (not deciding the first two questions adjourned) that \u201cthe bail ought not in this case to be discharged.\u201d Whereupon the circuit court affirmed the judgment: and Hawkins appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-15\">Bacchus, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AER5\">The statute giving a special authority to a judge or justice in vacation, upon proper affidavit, to require bail, it ought to appear that that authority was exactly pursued. 2 Salk. 475, pl. 14; 3 Stark. on Ev. part iv. pp. 1197, 8. The affidavit ought then to be in writing (indeed, the word affidavit imports a written oath) and it ought to be filed; since, unless it be in writing and filed, it cannot be inspected by the court, to ascertain, whether it is a proper affidavit or not; whether it verifies the justice of the action, and shews probable cause to apprehend that the defendant will depart from the jurisdiction of the court, so as to avoid process of execution. Neither is there any alternative but either to require that the affidavit shall be in writing and filed, or to hold that the single justice, who makes the order, is the absolute judge of the propriety of the affidavit on which he founds it, subject to no controul or supervision, and that if a perjury be committed in such an affidavit, however palpable, the offender shall be exempt from prosecution. Our statute does not, indeed, in express terms, require, that the affidavit shall be in writing and filed; yet the very particularity with which the statute prescribes what the affidavit shall contain, in order to justify the justice in ordering bail, evinces, that it was the plain intent of the statute to require both.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-16\">Lyons, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX2\">The english <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>statutes expressly require, that the affidavit on which bail is ordered, shall be returned and filed, and prescribe when this shall be done, by whom, and to whom. 1 Tidd\u2019s Prac. ch. 8. Our statute is silent as to all these particulars; it requires only, that there shall be proper affidavit made to authorise a justice to *order bail, and that when bail has been required by order of a justice, as well as when required by the plaintiff, the sheriff shall return on the writ, the \u00f1am\u00e9 of the bail by him taken, and the bail bond or a copy of it, to the clerk\u2019s office, on the day of appearance. If the court shall hold it necessary to return and file the affidavit, it must go farther, and prescribe when, by whom, and to whom, it shall be returned; which were not to interpret but to make law. But suppose the affidavit ought to be filed: the bail could not be discharged, on motion made at the calling of the cause for trial, without even a notice of the motion: this motion was a surprise on the plaintiff: the proper course was, to have asked a rule on the plaintiff to shew cause why the bail should not be discharged, and thus to have given him an opportunity to produce the affidavit, or shew other cause. Again, the application to discharge the bail in this case, came too late; two years after bail required and entered, after judgment by default and writ of inquiry awarded, and after the defendant was gone, so that if the court discharged the appearance bail, it could not have made any effectual order requiring special bail. Desborough v. Copinger, 8 T. R. 77; 2 Com. Dig. Bail, K. 3, pp. 22-6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-6\">Bacchus, in reply. In our practice, the plaintiff is always in court: wherefore, then, require notice of the motion, or a rule to shew cause? If the motion was unexpected, the court might have obviated the surprise, by giving time to the plaintiff, if he had asked time, to produce the affidavit, or to shew that it was lost, and to prove its contents. This is an objection to form, not to substance. But, in truth, if it was necessary that a proper affidavit should not only be made, but returned and filed, then, no proper affidavit being returned and filed, the case was the same, as if there had been no affidavit; as if, in short, bail had been taken, when it had not been required, or had been unlawfully required. And, in such cases, the bail is taken at the plaintiff\u2019s peril; he is bound to proceed regularly, and not to require bail ^without lawful authority to do so, upon pain of having his suit dismissed with costs, at any time when the fact is shewn to the court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b169-17\">See 1 Rev.

The motion was put, in that court, on the ground, that no sufficient affidavit had been filed in the case, to authorise the alderman\u2019s order requiring bail. It is not necessary to-decide, whether the justice must have a written affidavit to justify his requiring bail? nor, whether that affidavit must be filed? The term affidavit in the statute, imports an oath in writing; but the statute is silent as to the filing. There are two other grounds, on which, I think, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">1. The objection could not be taken on motion ; since it involved matters aliunde and not on the face of the record. It could only be made on a rule to shew cause why the bail should not be discharged, on the return of which the other party might be prepared to shew the affidavit, and that it was a proper one, in the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">2. The objection came too late; being made two years after the writ of inquiry, and (it appears) after the defendant had left the state. In Desborough v. Copinger, the objection to the affidavit was held to be too late after the writ of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">On these grounds the judgment is to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
