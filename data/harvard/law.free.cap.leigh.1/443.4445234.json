Hughes, five slaves, her own *property, in trust, that he should permit the said Erancis an'd Christian, after the marriage should be solemnized, to take and enjoy all the profits and use of the property, during their joint lives; and from and after the death of the said Francis, if he should die first, then upon trust, that the said William should assign the whole property to the said Christian ; and if the said Christian should die before the said Erancis, then in trust for such person or persons, as she should, by will or otherwise, direct and appoint; to the intent, that the subject should not be at the disposal, or subject to the control, debts, forfeitures or engagements, of the said Francis, the intended husband; and, in default of such appointment by the wife, at her death, then in trust for the said Francis, during his life, and after his death, for their offspring. The marriage took place. The deed was duly recorded in the county court of Hanover, on the 27th July 1820, the property being at the time in that county. Pledge the husband, within two months after, removed, and brought the slaves with him, to the city of Richmond; but the deed of marriage settlement, was not recorded, either in the hustings court of Richmond or in the county court of Henrico. And by indenture, dated the 22d January 1821, and duly recorded the same day in the hustings court, Pledge, the husband, conveyed them to Riddle, in trust, to secure a debt he owed to Shippard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-20\">Riddle being about to sell these slaves, under this deed of trust, to satisfy the debt due to Shippard, and having actually advertised them for sale, Hughes, the trustee in the marriage settlement, exhibited his bill in the superiour court of chancery of Richmond, against Pledge the husband, and the trustee Riddle, setting forth the marriage settlement, and the other facts above stated, and praying, that Riddle, the trustee for Shippard, should be enjoined from selling or otherwise interfering with the property. This bill was filed, and an injunction awarded according to the prayer of it, June 12th, 1821. And on the 22d Februry 1822, an amended bill was filed, making Shippard a party defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALD\">*Shippard, in his answer, insisted, 1st, that, though the deed of marriage settlement was duly recorded in the county court of Hanover, in which county the property was at the time, yet Pledge, the husband, having the possession of it, removed, and brought it with him, to Richmond, within less than two months afterwards, and the deed was never recorded there; and, therefore, was void as to him, a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice, according to the provisions of the statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99, g 11, p. 364. And, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>2ndly, that, at least, the interest which Pledge had, or had a right to dispose of, in the property, under the marriage settlement itself, was subject to Shippard\u2019s claim, and ought to be applied toward the satisfaction of it; namely, the use of the property during the joint lives of the husband and wife, and the contingent interest limited to the husband after the wife\u2019s death without making any appointment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-3\">Pending this suit, Shippard on his part exhibited a bill, complaining, that Hughes and Pledge had evinced a design to remove the subject beyond the jurisdiction of the court, and praying an injunction to restrain them from doing so; which was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-4\">The two causes came on together for a final hearing, in June 1826. The chancellor held, that the case stated in Hughes\u2019s bill was not proper for relief in equity, because if he had right, he had a complete remedy at law; founding this opinion against the jurisdiction of the court, upon his understanding of the authority of the case of Bowyer v. Creigh, 3 Rand. 25. And, therefore, he dismissed that bill with costs. As to Shippard\u2019s suit, he held, that the deed of marriage settlement, not having been recorded in Richmond or Henrico, whither the slaves had been brought soon after the marriage, and where they had ever since remained, was void as against Shippard; and, therefore, he perpetuated the injunction he had granted to Shippard, and decreed a sale of the slaves to satisfj' the debt for which they were mortgaged to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\">Hughes appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJ9\">*Scott, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_VR\">upon the question of jurisdiction, raised in the first suit, cited Allen v. Freeland, 3 Rand. 170, Randolph v. Randolph, 6 Rand. 194, Harrison v. Sims, Id. 506, directly in point to sustain the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-7\">As to the omission to have the marriage settlement recorded in Richmond or Henrico, after the subject had been brought there, he said, 1st, That this deed was a conveyance by the wife of her own property only; and whether it had been recorded at all or not, it'was good against the creditors of, or purchasers from, the husband, as he was not the grantor. Pierce v. Turner, 5 Cranch 154; Land v. Jeffries, 5 Rand. 211. 2ndly, That, supposing this the case of a deed respecting the title of personal chattels, which by law ought to be recorded, yet the statute only provided, that in case the person claiming title under the deed, should permit the person in possession of the subject, to remove with it to another county, and should not within 12 months after the removal, have the deed recorded there also, the deed should be void, so long as it should not be so recorded, as to all purchasers without notice and all creditors. Now, Shippard had full notice of this marriage settlement, within the twelve months allowed for recording it in Richmond or Henrico; for the bill of Hughes, the trustee, was exhibited, and the injunction to restrain Shippard\u2019s trustee, Riddle, from selling the property, was awarded, within nine months after it was brought to Richmond.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-9-pl-split\">*Shippard, in his answer, insists, that Pledge, the husband was entitled to an interest in the subject, under the deed of marriage settlement; and that his interest in it, at least, ought to be held liable to his debts, and subject to his disposition. But, to allow any sale or disposition of his interest to interfere with or affect the trust for the joint use of the husband and wife, during their joint lives, would be to defeat the purposes, as well as the express intent, of the settlement.

The question as to the inefficacy of the deed, depends on the construction of the 11th section of the statute of conveyances. That section allows to the person claiming title under the deed, the term of twelve months, to have the deed recorded in the court of that county or corporation, to which the property may be removed. If, therefore, the deed be recorded there, at any time within the twelve months, it will defeat any previous sale which may have been made of the property. And as the main object of recording such deeds, is to afford the means of obtaining information as to the title of the property, it would seem that, as to that object, actual notice of the deed would be as effectual as if it were recorded. *Accordingly, this section of the statute, so far as relates to purchasers, makes notice of the deed equivalent to recording it; for it vacates an unrecorded deed as to such purchasers only, as are purchasers without notice. In the cases before us, it is evident, that Shippard had notice of the deed within twelve months. On this ground alone \u2014 independently of any influence which the case of Band v. Jeffries may have on this; and admitting that the deed of 18th July 1820, in order to be effectual against the creditors of the husband, ought to have been duly recorded, (as it really was) in the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>court of Hanover; and without considering or deciding, whether, if the husband and wife were justly entitled to the possession and use of the slaves in the deed mentioned, and removed and held possession of them in the county of Henrico and city of Richmond, the case can come within that clause of the law, which speaks of the person claiming title permitting \u201cany other person in whose possession such property may be, to remove the same,\u201d &amp;c. or whether, if the wife, for her sole and separate use, was entitled to the possession of the slaves, and her husband had removed them, she could be considered as permitting their removal within the meaning and intention of the act \u2014 without considering any of these points, the court is of opinion to reverse the decrees in both cases; to perpetuate the injunction in the first case, and to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the bill in the second.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
