And a dispute arose between the parties, which should bear the loss? whether Peter had fairly performed the contract of bailment on his part? and whether or no he was bound, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, to account to Butler for the value of the flour, which he had deposited with *him on storage? Hereupon, Butler, finding persons in Virginia indebted to Peter, proceeded by way of foreign attachment in chancery (1 Rev. Code, ch. 123, p. 474,) exhibiting his bill, in the superiour court of chancery of Winchester, against Peter, as an absent debtor, and against his debtors in Virginia as garnishees, praying a decree for the value of the flour, against Peter, and the attachment and application of the moneys due him in Virginia, to satisfy the claim. Peter, besides making strenuous defence upon the merits, objected to the jurisdiction of the court of chancery. The chancellor sustained the jurisdiction ; and, upon\" the merits, decreed Butler the amount of his claim. And Peter appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-15\">The cause was argued here by Heigh for the appellant, and by Wickham and Stanard for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-16\">The facts of the case were much controverted, and several interesting questions of law were discussed, both in the court of chancery, and here: but, in the view of this court, the cause turned wholly on the questions of fact. These the court decided against the appellant, and affirmed the decree.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b104-12\">Carr, J.. did not sit, because he had decided the cause in the court of chancery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b104-13\"> Attachment \u2014 Unliquidated Damages. \u2014 For the proposition that an attachment will lie for unliquidated damages the principal case is cited in Dunlop v. Keith. 1 Leigh 432; Zerega v. McDonald, 30 Fed. Gas. 931. The principal case is also cited in Bank of U. S. v. Merchants\u2019 Bank of Baltimore, 1 Bob. 586.

This court concurred with the chancellor, that a claim, arising on a contract of bailment made out of Virginia, against a nonresident of Virginia, is such a claim for debt, for which the foreign attachment in chancery is a proper remedy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
