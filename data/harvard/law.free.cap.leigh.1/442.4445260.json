The creditor to whom the bond is to be made *payable, is the person entitled to sue out the execution.; the plaintiff on the record. No other person can be known to the officer, or to the court itself, as the creditor. To no other person, then, can the bond be taken. In Downman v. Chinn, 2 Wash. 189, a forthcoming bond made payable to the sheriff, was given up, on all hands, as faulty. The judgment of the circuit court must be reversed, and the forthcoming bond quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
