Philips pleaded that the bond was not the deed of his testator. At the trial, the counsel for Raines proved, \u201cthat the subscribing witness to the bond was dead, and then stated to the court that every inquiry' had been made in the neighbourhood where he resided, to ascertain whether any person was acquainted with his hand Writing, but after the most diligent search, no person who knew it could be found; and then he offered testimony to prove the hand writing of the obligor: but the court decided, that under this statement, Raines could not be allowed to go into evidence of the hand writing of the supposed obligor.\u201d To this opinion Raines excepted.

Chestnut, 4 Leigh 4, citing <em>Raines v. Philips, </em>1 <em>Leigh </em>483; Thompson v. Cumming, 2 Leigh 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-20\">In McDowell v. Crawford, 11 Graft. 398. it is said by Monourb, J.: \u201cTh at when an opinion of an inferior court admitting or excluding evidence, or giving or refnsing an instruction, is excepted to, the court must take care so to state the case in the bill of exceptions as that the appellate court may supervise the opinion. and determine whether it is right or wrong; otherwise, the judgment must be reversed in order that the case may be correctly stated. Therefore, the judgment must always be reversed where the bill of exceptions to an opinion of the court, admitting or excluding evidence, is defective in not setting out the evidence admitted or excluded. The cases of Fowler v. Lee, 4 Munf. 373: Hairston v. Cole, 1 Rand. 461; <em>Raines v. Philips, 1 Leigh </em>483; Bowyer v. Chestnut, 4 Leigh 1, are cases in which exceptions were taken to the admission or exclusion of evidence. Barrett v. Tazewell. 1 Call 315; Beattie v. Tabb, 2 Munf. 254; Brooke v. Young, 3 Rand. 106, are cases in which exceptions were taken to instructions given or refused by the court. In all these cases the judgments were reversed on the ground that the statement of facts in the bill of exceptions was too imperfect to enable the appellate court to determine the question.\" See mono-graphic <em>note </em>on \u201cBills of Exception\u201d appended to Stoneman v. Com., 25 Gratt. 887.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b171-18\">BROOKE, P.,</author>\n<p id=\"Av7R\">delivered the resolution of the court. It is now the settled rule, where the witness to an instrument is dead, and it is impracticable, after all possible diligence has been used, to prove his hand writing, to admit proof of the hand writing of the party himself. (See Gilliam\u2019s adm\u2019r v. Perkinson\u2019s adm\u2019r and the cases there cited.) But upon this bill of exceptions, it is difficult to say on what ground the evidence was rejected by the court. There is a great want of precision in its language. The judge said, that under the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>made by the counsel for Raines (who, it seems, had proved, that the witness was dead) he could not be allowed to go into evidence to prove the hand writing of the supposed obligor. If we are to understand, that he admitted the truth of the statement, if it is to be inferred, from the circumstance that the counsel had proved the death of the witness (it is to be presumed on oath), that he made the statement in question, in like manner (that is, on oath) ; then the judge might be understood as denying the rule before stated. On the contrary, if the fact was, that it was a mere statement not on oath, his objection was, that the facts necessary to entitle the plaintiff to go into evidence of the hand writing of the obligor, were not proved. But, whether he considered the statement as proved, and denied the rule, or admitted the rule, and objected to the statement because it was not proved, is so doubtful, that we think the safest course will be to reverse the judgment, as the court has often done for uncertainty in a bill of exceptions, and send the cause back for a new trial, in which, if the question again occurs, the objection to the admission of proof of the hand writing of the obligor, may be more precisely stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Judgment reversed. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
