Cooke, having been levied on his property, he together with John Cooke, his surety, gave bond for the forthcoming of the property at the day of sale, in the usual form; which was forfeited. A notice was given to the true obligors, of a motion to be made for award of execution on the bond: but it was addressed to John M. Cooke (instead of George M. Cooke) and John Cooke; and it described the bond as the bond of John M. Cooke (instead of George M.), and John Cooke. It was objected at the hearing of the motion, that the notice did not truly describe the bond on which the motion was made, but on the contrary described a bond which did not exist; but, notwithstanding this variance, the circuit court awarded execution on the bond. The defendants applied to this court for a supersedeas, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-12\">Green for the plaintiffs in error, and Briggs for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\">See Peter v.
