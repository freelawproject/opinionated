Tolson sheriff &amp;c. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-7\">Hereupon, Elwes, for whose benefit these two writs had been sued out, gave a notice, in his own name, to Mr. Tolson the sheriff, that he would move the circuit court for judgment against him, for the full amount of the debt, interest and costs, mentioned in the venditioni exponas, with 15 per cent, per ann. interest thereon from the return day thereof until paid, according to the provisions of the statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 134, \u00a7 48, p. 542.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And upon \u2022 the motion *made by Elwes pursuant to this notice, the circuit court gave him judgment, for 180 dollars 83 cents (the amount due on the venditioni exponas) with 15 per cent, per ann. interest thereon from the return day of the writ, and the costs of the motion. From which judgment Tolson appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-13\">The cause was argued here, by Harrison for the appellant, and Patton for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-14\">Several points were discussed at the bar, which the court did not find it necessary to consider or decide. Among these was the question, Whether, as the statute gives this summary remedy by motion, only in case of such returns made by the officer, as entitle the plaintiff to recover against him, in an action of debt, the debt, damages or costs, mentioned in the execution, an action of debt might have been maintained against the officer upon the returns made on the executions in this case? And Carr, J., intimated an impression, but not a decided opinion, that debt would not lie: but the point was not decided, nor did the other judges give any opinion concerning it. The case eventually turned on the question, Whether Elwes, for whose benefit the execution *was sued out, as appeared by the indorsement upon it, could maintain the motion, in his own name?</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-17\">Harrison insisted, that, as the statute giving this summary remedy, at once dispenses with the ordinary course of the common law, and inflicts a heavy penalty in the form of interest allowed on the debt, it ought to be construed strictly. The statute gives the motion to the creditor at whose suit the execution shall issue. Now, Wallack, not Elwes, was that creditor. He alone was the plaintiff on the record: he alone could maintain debt or scire facias on the judgment: and if a forthcoming bond had been taken, tit must have been made payable to him; and he alone could have moved for an award of execution upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>it. That the execution was indorsed \u201cfor the benefit of Elwes,\u201d could not help the case. It did not appear, that that indorsement was made by Wallack or by his direction, and it might have been the act of Elwes himself; and if it was the act of Wallack, it was not an assignment of the judgment or of the execution to Elwes; and indeed, neither of them was by law assignable, nor could a court of law take any notice of such an assignment. If the return afforded any foundation at all for such a motion, there could be no doubt, that Wallack might have made it; and if so, the judgment for Elwes could present no bar to a future motion by Wallack.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-3\">Patton said, that though originally choses in action were held not assignable either in law or equity, yet the broad ground was soon taken, that all such assignments were good in equity; and then it was held at law, that though such assignments do not transfer the legal title, they transfer every thing else; that they authorise the assignee to sue in the name of the assignor, and the assignor cannot control the proceeding; that the assignor\u2019s legal right is merely subservient to the equitable right of the assignee. Garland v. Richeson, 4 Rand. 268. Our statute gives the assignee of a bond or note a right to sue in his own name, but it does not change the nature of his title, for his title is still *not a legal but only an equitable one. Ibid. In the present case, the court must intend, that the indorsement on the execution, that it was for Elwes\u2019s benefit, was made by the clerk; and that, in making it, he was governed by the record, which shewed that the suit had been prosecuted for his benefit; for such is the constant practice and course of business. And then, as Elwes was the creditor in fact, at whose suit the original writ was purchased, so he was the creditor at whose suit the executions issued. Certainly, the sheriff was bound to take notice of the indorsement, and to account to Elwes for the money. If Wallack had a right to control the execution, or to receive the money made upon it, the right of an assignee to proceed in the name of the assignor to recover the debt assigned, is reduced to notning. Elwes was \u2018 \u2018the party to whom the money was payable,\u201d in the strictest sense of the statute in question; the party\" to whom the injury accrued by the failure of the sheriff to make the payment, for which the statute gives the summarj' remedy. Could the statute have been intended to give the remedy, not to the party injured, but to the plaintiff on the record who is not injured? The statute does not give the motion to the plaintiff on the record, but to the creditor at whose suit the execution issues. Let its language be scanned : whenever the return is such as to entitle the plaintiff to an action of debt, then, not the plaintiff, but the creditor at whose suit the execution issues, whoever he may be, may move against the delinquent officer. This motion was not a proceeding to enforce the execution of Wallack\u2019s judgment; the execution was consummate; and the motion was made to recover the money of the sheriff, for his default, by the party to whom the injury accrued.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b155-19\">Executions- -Assignment \u2014 -Right of Assignee to Sue in His Own Name. \u2014 In the principal case it is held that a person for whose benefit an execution is indorsed cannot maintain a. motion in his own name against the sheriff, for the amount levied on flu-execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-21\">In Burnett v.

Also, In Poage v.

Hinchman, 1 Gratt. 157, that an ac tion against a high sheriff and his sureties, upon his official bond, for the misconduct of his deputy in his proceedings on an execution in his hands, must be at the relation of the plaintiff in the execution: and cannot be sustained, at the relation of the parties for whose benefit the execution is issued.

Courts of equity, however, held those assignments good, and enforced them; and, in later times, courts *of law have so far relaxed, as, in some instances, to notice the equitable right. Thus, they will not suffer the assignor, whose name is used by the assignee in suing, to dismiss or in any way control the suit. Again, if the real owner of the debt, though not plaintiff on the record, be indebted to the defendant, the court will allow the defendant to set-off this debt against that for which -he is sued. Thus the law stands in England, where there is no law permitting the assignment of choses in action. But the courts of law have never gone so far as to suffer the assignee to institute a suit in his own name. (I am not speaking of bills of exchange assignable <em>by </em>the law merchant, or of promissory notes made so by the statute of Anne, but of mere choses in action as contradistinguished from commercial paper.) Our statute declares \u201cassignments of bonds, bills and promissory notes, and other writings obligatory whatsoever, valid, and that the assignee may sue in his own name\u201d &amp;c. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 125, \u00a7 5, p. 484. It will be seen at once, that judgments and executions are not embraced by this statute : they, therefore, remain as at common law. And it may be laid down, as a general proposition, that in no proceeding to carry <em>a. </em>judgment or execution into effect, can the name of the transferee be substituted for that of the plaintiff upon the record. But this proposition, deduced from the general principles of law, is still more clearly and strongly established by the particular statute under which this motion is made; by the words of which, the motion is give to. the creditor at whose suit the execution shall issue. This, it seems to me, can mean no other than the plaintiff on the record. I' think, therefore, this motion could not be maintained in the name of Elwes.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">This point being sufficient for the reversal of the judgment, it is not necessary to give an opinion on the other points discussed at the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The other judges concurred, and the judgment was reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
