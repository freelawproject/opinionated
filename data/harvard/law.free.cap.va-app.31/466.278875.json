On appeal, he complains that the trial court erroneously permitted the Commonwealth to prove during the sentencing phase that defendant had previously been found guilty, though not sentenced, for three unrelated criminal offenses, and, additionally, had violated the terms of a probationary sentence. We agree that the jury was improperly permitted to consider the three offenses and, therefore, reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The relevant procedural history is uncontroverted. Immediately preceding the sentencing phase of trial, defendant objected to the introduction into evidence of an order previously entered in an unrelated prosecution finding him guilty for possessing cocaine with intent to distribute, possessing marijuana, and impeding a law enforcement officer. Although these offenses were included as \u201cconvictions\u201d in a notification letter provided defendant by the Commonwealth pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, the court had not imposed attendant sentences. Defendant, therefore, argued that no final order of conviction had been entered on such prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Defendant also objected to the introduction of a second unrelated order which memorialized a prior violation of probation. Although the Commonwealth had properly advised defendant of its intention to introduce evidence of the underlying conviction, the notice made no mention of the subsequent violation order. Defendant contends that such violation was tantamount to a \u201cfelony conviction\u201d and, therefore, likewise subject to notice from the Commonwealth pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">In addition to the prior orders in issue, the Commonwealth presented uncontroverted evidence at sentencing of nine crim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>inal convictions, including two each for grand larceny and possession of cocaine, and one each for possession of a firearm while in possession of cocaine, burglary, breaking and entering, assault and battery and failure to appear. These convictions dated from December, 1987, to the most recent, the failure to appear in March, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe Commonwealth shall present the defendant\u2019s criminal convictions by ... copies of the record of conviction\u201d during the sentencing phase of a bifurcated trial. \u201cThe Commonwealth shall provide to the defendant fourteen days prior to trial notice of its intention to introduce evidence of [such] prior criminal convictions,\u201d including \u201c(i) the date of each conviction, (ii) the name and jurisdiction of the court where each prior conviction was had, and (iii) each offense of which he was convicted.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. \u201cThe language of the statute is clear and its intent plain. As adopted by the legislature, the statute limits the introduction of evidence by the Commonwealth to charges for which a defendant has been convicted.\u201d <em>Byrd v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 371, 374, 517 S.E.2d 243, 244 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>134 Va. 589, 113 S.E. 707 (1922), the Supreme Court of Virginia acknowledged that \u201cconviction\u201d has been \u201cdifferently defined\u201d through the years and instructed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">\u201cwhere the reference is to the ascertainment of guilt in another proceeding, in its bearings upon the status or rights of the individual in a subsequent case, ... a broader meaning attaches to the expressions [conviction or convicted], and a \u2018conviction\u2019 is not established, or a person deemed to have been \u2018convicted\u2019 unless it is shown that a judgment has been pronounced upon the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 598, 113 S.E. at 709 (citation omitted). Recently, in <em>Ramdass v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 518, 450 S.E.2d 360 (1994), the Court revisited the term and, citing <em>Smith </em>with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>approval, concluded that a jury verdict \u201ccannot be considered as a conviction,\u201d absent \u201cjudgment ... entered on [the] verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520, 450 S.E.2d at 361 (guilty verdict was not a conviction rendering defendant ineligible for parole). Guided by <em>Ramdass, </em>we concluded in <em>Batts v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 1, 515 S.E.2d 307 (1999), that a \u201cjury\u2019s verdict ... was not a final conviction -without the entry of the sentencing order[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, 515 S.E.2d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">It is, therefore, now well established in our jurisprudence that a \u201cconviction\u201d ordinarily embraces both an adjudication of guilt and a related sentence, thus concluding a prosecution by final order. Such interpretation is especially compelling in the context of jury sentencing pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, which expressly requires the Commonwealth to provide the jury with a defendant\u2019s \u201crecord of convictions\u201d for consideration in determining an appropriate punishment. \u201c[T]he legislature incorporated the term \u2018record of conviction\u2019 into Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 aware that its meaning includes both conviction and punishment, thereby intending to assist the jury in fashioning a sentence suitable both to [the] defendant and the offense.\u201d <em>Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 524, 465 S.E.2d 592, 595 (1996); <em>see also Brooks v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 523, 532-33, 484 S.E.2d 127, 131 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Thus, the trial court in the instant proceeding erroneously permitted the jury to consider, as convictions for purposes of fixing punishment, three offenses for which defendant had previously been found guilty, but not sentenced, incomplete \u201crecords of conviction\u201d not contemplated by Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, such error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">It is well established that, absent a curative instruction, non-constitutional error is presumed prejudicial, unless \u201c \u2018it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678). \u201cAn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe effect of an error on a verdict varies widely \u2018depending upon the circumstances of the case.\u2019 Each ... must ... be analyzed individually to determine if an error has affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1009, 407 S.E.2d at 913 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Upon review of subject record, we are unable to conclude that it \u201cplainly appears\u201d that the sentences in dispute were unaffected by consideration of the three offenses by the jury. \u201c[T]he bifurcated procedure established in Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 clearly manifests a legislative intent to provide juries with information specific only to sentencing[.]\u201d <em>Gilliam, </em>21 Va.App. at 525, 465 S.E.2d at 595. \u201c[T]he prior criminal convictions of a felon, including previous efforts to rehabilitate, \u2018 \u201cbear upon a tendency to commit offenses, the probabilities of rehabilitation, and similar factors\u201d \u2019 indispensable to the determination of an appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524, 465 S.E.2d at 595 (citations omitted). We cannot at once reason that such considerations promote enlightened sentencing and dismiss as harmless the prejudicial effects of inadmissible, although facially relevant, evidence pertaining to sentencing issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the sentencing order and remand the proceedings to the trial court for resentencing pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 and this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\">. We expressly decline to address the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to provide defendant notice of the probation violation because such issue will not arise upon resentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
