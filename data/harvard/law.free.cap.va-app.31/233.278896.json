Rasmussen appeals his conviction for drank driving (third offense within ten years), contending that the result of a breathalyzer test administered to him following his arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>was improperly admitted at trial. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Upon review, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>See Clifton v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 178, 180, 468 S.E.2d <em>155, 156 </em>(1996) (citing <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975)). On August 3, 1997, Rasmussen was driving a motorcycle at 74 miles-per-hour on Interstate 95 just north of Route 617 in Fairfax, Virginia, in a zone limited to 55 miles-per-hour. Trooper Josh Collins of the Virginia State Police stopped Rasmussen for speeding and detected the odor of alcohol on his breath. Collins administered a series of field sobriety tests on Rasmussen, most of which he failed. Collins then arrested Rasmussen for drunk driving (third offense within ten years), and advised him of the implied consent law, which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">Any person ... who operates a motor vehicle upon a highway ... in this Commonwealth shall be deemed thereby, as a condition of such operation, to have consented to have samples of his blood, breath, or both blood and breath taken for a chemical test to determine the alcohol, drug, or both alcohol and drug content of his blood, if he is arrested for violation of \u00a7 18.2-266 or \u00a7 18.2-266.1____ Any person so arrested ... shall submit to a breath test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">After arresting Rasmussen, Collins took him to the Adult Detention Center, where a breathalyzer test was performed on Rasmussen using an Intoxilyzer 5000 machine (\u201c1-5000\u201d). The machine was operated by Frederick Smith, a certified breath test operator. Smith later testified that the normal operation of the 1-5000 involves having the arrestee breathe twice into the machine, giving two separate breath samples. The machine prints the lower of the blood alcohol levels produced from the two breath samples on a Certificate of Blood Analysis (\u201cCertificate\u201d). It also transmits, via modem, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the results obtained from both samples to the state Department of Forensic Science in Richmond (\u201cDFS\u201d). The 1-5000 determined Rasmussen\u2019s blood alcohol level to be .14%. Over Rasmussen\u2019s objection, the circuit court admitted into evidence the Certificate from the I-5000\u2019s analysis of Rasmussen\u2019s breath. His objection was based on Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-268.2 and 18.2-268.9. By its order of June 11,1998, the circuit court found Rasmussen guilty and sentenced him to twelve months in jail, with all but thirty days suspended for one year. The court also imposed a $500 fine and indefinitely suspended Rasmussen\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Rasmussen relies upon the language of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-268.2 and 18.2-268.9 to argue that for each discrete breath sample taken for testing by a breathalyzer, the Commonwealth is required to give the arrestee the opportunity to view the results as they register on the machine. Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">The accused shall, prior to administration of the test, be advised by the person administering the test that he has the right to observe the process of analysis and to see the blood-alcohol reading on the equipment used to perform the breath test. If the equipment automatically produces a written printout of the breath test result, the printout, or a copy, shall be given to the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">Any individual conducting the breath test ... shall issue a certificate which will indicate that ... the accused was advised of his right to observe the process and see the blood alcohol reading on the equipment used to perform the breath test, the date and time the sample was taken from the accused, the sample\u2019s alcohol content, and the name of the person who examined the sample....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">Rasmussen contends that because the word \u201csample\u201d is used recurrently in Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9, the legislature intended to assure the accused the right to observe the results of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>blood-alcohol analysis for each and every breath sample taken. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u201cThe province of [statutory] construction lies wholly within the domain of ambiguity, and that which is plain needs no interpretation.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 768, 773, 501 S.E.2d 461, 463 (1998). \u201cWords are ambiguous if they admit to being understood in more than one way ... refer to two or more things simultaneously ... are difficult to comprehend, of doubtful import, or lack clearness and definiteness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201c \u2018The plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 522-23, 465 S.E.2d 592, 594 (1996) (quoting <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992)). Legislative intent may also be gleaned by consulting other statutes \u201cusing the same phraseology,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 523, 465 S.E.2d at 594, and \u201cstatutes which relate to the same subject matter should be read, construed and applied together....\u201d <em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 252, 256, 450 S.E.2d 765, 767 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u201c \u201cWhere a statute is unambiguous, the plain meaning is to be accepted without resort to the rules of statutory interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Frazier v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Social Servs., Division of Child Support Enf'ment, ex rel. Susan M. Sandridge, </em>27 Va.App. 131, 134, 497 S.E.2d 879, 880 (1998) (quoting <em>Last v. Virginia State Bd. of Med., </em>14 Va.App. 906, 910, 421 S.E.2d 201, 205 (1992)). \u201cWhen analyzing a statute, we must assume that \u2018the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Frazier, </em>27 Va.App. at 135, 497 S.E.2d at 881 (quoting <em>City of Virginia Beach v. ESG Enters., Inc., </em>243 Va. 149, 153, 413 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1992) (citation omitted)). \u201c \u2018 \u201cCourts are not permitted to rewrite statutes. This is a legislative function. The manifest intention of the legislature, clearly disclosed by its language, must be applied.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Frazier, 21 </em>Va.App. at 135, 497 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>881 (quoting <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Properties, </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We find no ambiguity in the statutes cited by Rasmussen and construe the provisions according to their plain meaning. Each of the statutes refers to \u201cbreath test,\u201d \u201csample\u201d and \u201cblood alcohol reading\u201d in the singular, and nothing in the statutes indicates an intention to give an accused the right to immediately view results of a breath test other than those actually printed out by the equipment used to conduct the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Rasmussen also contends that the term \u201cprocess of analysis\u201d necessarily encompasses the analysis of both samples taken and that, therefore, he was entitled to view the results obtained from each sample. However, when construed in the context of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 in its entirety, we find that the term \u201cprocess of analysis\u201d does not enlarge the scope of what Rasmussen is entitled to review. A distinction must be made between the right to see the steps undertaken to achieve a result (\u201cthe process of analysis,\u201d such as the taking of a sample), the operation of the testing machine and the print-out of the test results, and the right to see the result itself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, the statute clearly limits an arrestee\u2019s right to \u201csee[ing] the blood alcohol reading [printed] on the equipment used to perform the breath test.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Based on our holding in <em>Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 148, 149, 421 S.E.2d 674, 675 (1992), Rasmussen further contends that the failure to provide him the opportunity to review the test result of the other sample deprived him of access to potentially exculpatory breathalyzer evidence. This argument also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The testimony of the breathalyzer operator at trial established that the machine was properly calibrated<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>printed a test result reflecting the lower of the two sample readings. Thus, the only evidence not made immediately available to Rasmussen was evidence of an inculpatory nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">As Rasmussen was afforded the opportunity to view the print-out of the blood-alcohol reading taken by the breathalyzer machine, the requirements of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-268.2 and 18.2-268.9 were met. For these reasons, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\">. Process is defined as a \"method, mode, or operation, whereby a result or effect is produced.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1205 (6th ed. 1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\">. By its requirement that the operator of a breathalyzer machine certify, <em>inter alia, </em>that the machine has been calibrated in conformity with the statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 assures an accused that the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>chine is operating as designed. In the case of the 1-5000, the certification indicates that the machine accurately tested the two breath samples and reported the lower of the two sample analyses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
