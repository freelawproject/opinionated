Bostic argues that he was denied his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him when the trial court denied his request to impeach a Commonwealth\u2019s witness by introducing evidence of the witness\u2019 juvenile guilty adjudications. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In 1996, Bostic, who was twenty-eight years old at the time, met the victim, Christopher Chittum, who was then fifteen years old. They met through their mothers who worked together at the same hospital. Bostic and Chittum developed a friendship, and Chittum would go to Bostic\u2019s home where Bostic would give him cigarettes and liquor. According to Chittum, on one occasion within weeks of their meeting, Bostic \u201cforced\u201d Chittum to perform oral sex on Bostic. Chittum testified that he later voluntarily performed oral sex on Bostic at his home at least seven times. Throughout the course of their relationship, Bostic continued to give Chittum cigarettes and liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Prior to trial, Bostic filed a motion requesting that he be permitted to introduce evidence that Chittum had two juvenile guilty adjudications, one for rape and one for throwing a missile into an unoccupied vehicle. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Bostic argues that he was denied his right to confront the witnesses against him because he was not permitted to use Chittum\u2019s juvenile convictions for impeachment purposes. <em>See </em>U.S. Const. amend. VI; Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8. He acknowledges that the Supreme Court held in <em>Kiracofe v. Commonwealth, </em>198 Va. 833, 97 S.E.2d 14 (1957), that a juvenile adjudication of delinquency \u201cinvolving a felonious offense or one involving larceny\u201d was not admissible to impeach generally a witness\u2019 credibility. He argues, however, that following the <em>Kiracofe </em>decision numerous changes have occurred in the juvenile law which have eroded the privacy protections afforded juveniles and those changes have destroyed the basic concepts upon which the Court based the <em>Kiracofe </em>holding. He argues that because the laws regarding confidentiality of juvenile proceedings have been relaxed since the <em>Kiracofe </em>decision and because the primary focus of juvenile proceedings has changed from rehabilitative to punitive^ the policy inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>ests in protecting the confidentiality of a juvenile offender\u2019s record, which were the basis for the <em>Kiracofe </em>holding, are no longer sound. Significantly, Bostic contends that former Code \u00a7 16.1-179, upon which the <em>Kiracofe </em>Court primarily relied, expressly stated that a juvenile adjudication shall not \u201cbe denominated a conviction.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-179 has since been repealed. Accordingly, Bostic urges that <em>Kiracofe </em>is no longer controlling because the statutes on which it was based are no longer the law. He further urges that we would not be required to overrule <em>Kiracofe </em>in order to find the evidence of prior juvenile adjudications admissible for impeachment; rather, we would be declaring a new policy based upon the revised juvenile statutes, which adopt a policy that juvenile proceedings and their records shall be more open to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The \u201cdefendant\u2019s right of confrontation is paramount to the State\u2019s policy of protecting juvenile offenders, so that the right effectively to cross-examine a witness to show bias, a specific attack on the credibility, outweighs any embarrassment to the witness resulting from a disclosure of his juvenile court record.\u201d <em>Fulcher v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 96, 99, 306 S.E.2d 874, 876 (1983) (citing <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 319-20, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1111-12, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974)). \u201cHowever, a court may refuse the use of juvenile convictions in a general attack on witness credibility.\u201d <em>Moats v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 349, 354, 404 S.E.2d 244, 246 (1991) (citing <em>Kiracofe, </em>198 Va. 833, 97 S.E.2d 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In <em>Kiracofe, </em>the Supreme Court, relying on former Code \u00a7 16.1-179, noted that the protections for ensuring the confidentiality of juvenile proceedings are grounded in the policy interest that juvenile proceedings are corrective rather than punitive. <em>See </em>198 Va. at 844, 97 S.E.2d at 21. And, as Bostic notes, Code \u00a7 16.1-179 has been repealed and several other statutory provisions have relaxed juvenile privacy interests in certain circumstances. Nevertheless, we are constrained by our previous decisions and those of the Supreme Court. <em>See Commonwealth v. Burns, </em>240 Va. 171, 173-74, 395 S.E.2d 456, 457 (1990) (a panel decision of this Court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>established precedent and binding under rules of <em>stare decisis </em>upon subsequent panels); <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 83, 85, 414 S.E.2d 859, 860 (1992) (panels of the Court of Appeals are bound by Supreme Court precedent). If <em>Kiracofe </em>is to be overruled, we believe that it must be expressly overruled by the Supreme Court or by the General Assembly. We are unwilling to hold that the General Assembly, by repealing Code \u00a7 16.1-179 and revising a number of juvenile statutes dealing with privacy, implicitly overruled the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kiracofe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We, therefore, are bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kiracofe </em>and by our decision in <em>Moats. </em>Here, Bostic sought to use Chittum\u2019s juvenile convictions to impeach Chit-tum and to attack Chittum\u2019s credibility, rather than to prove Chittum was biased. The trial court did not err by refusing to permit Bostic to question Chittum regarding his juvenile convictions; accordingly, Bostic was not denied his right to cross-examine witnesses. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
