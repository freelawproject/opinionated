The Mattaponi Indian Tribe, Carl T. Lone Eagle Custalow, Assistant Chief, filed a notice of appeal to the Circuit Court of the City of Newport News on January 14, 1998. The Commonwealth and the City demurred to the Tribe\u2019s appeal, and on August 7, 1998, the circuit court sustained the demurrers on various grounds. A final order dismissing the Tribe\u2019s case was entered on November 30, 1998. The Tribe then noted its appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The Tribe and Chief Custalow (\u201cappellants\u201d) raise\u201d three issues in this appeal. They are 1) whether appellants have standing to challenge the proposed King William Reservoir water supply project (\u201cProject\u201d) under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29; 2) whether appellants sufficiently pled that the Commonwealth breached the 1677 Treaty at Middle Plantation (\u201cTreaty\u201d); and 3) whether appellants sufficiently pled that the Commonwealth has violated Title VI of the federal Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\n<em>BACKGROUND FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">In July, 1993, the City applied to the Board for a Virginia Water Protection Permit (\u201cVWPP\u201d) for its Project. The King <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>William Reservoir project is a regional undertaking sponsored by a coalition of local governments, including Newport News, Williamsburg and York County, for the purpose of identifying and developing a regional water supply to meet projected needs through the year 2040. Once completed, the reservoir will comprise a 1,526 acre impoundment created by a new dam across Cohoke Creek, a small tributary of the Pamunkey River located between the Pamunkey and Mattaponi Rivers in King William County. The project would also entail the construction of a water intake and pumping station to withdraw water from the nearby Mattaponi River and convey it to the reservoir.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Because the dam will be constructed by \u201cthe discharge of dredged or fill material\u201d into Cohoke Creek, \u00a7 404 of the federal Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d) requires the City, as the lead agency of the coalition governments, to obtain a construction permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cCorps\u201d). <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(a),(d). Under \u00a7 401(a) of the CWA, the Corps may not issue a permit for an activity resulting in a discharge into wetlands unless the state where the discharge takes place certifies that the discharge will comply with \u201capplicable provisions\u201d of the CWA or until the state waives such certification. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The Corps may not issue a permit \u201cif certification has been denied by the [sjtate.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, under \u00a7 401(d) of the CWA, \u201cany effluent limitations and other limitations, and monitoring requirements\u201d that are included in the state\u2019s certification \u201cshall become a condition on any Federal license or permit....\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In Virginia, Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5) of the State Water Control Law (\u201cSWCL\u201d) authorizes the Board to issue certificates for the alteration of the physical, chemical or biological properties of state waters. The SWCL further designates the VWPP as \u201cthe certification required under Section 401\u201d of the CWA. Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15:5(A). \u201cThe Board shall issue a [VWPP] for an activity requiring \u00a7 401 certification if it has determined that the proposed activity is consistent with the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the [CWA] and will protect instream beneficial uses.\u201d Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15:5(B). \u201cConditions contained in a [VWPP] .may include, but are not limited to, the volume of water which may be withdrawn as a part of the permitted activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">On December 16, 1997, the Board issued a VWPP to the City. The VWPP contained a number of \u201cSpecial Conditions\u201d establishing various limitations and monitoring requirements for the Project. Thereafter, the City, appellants, and various other petitioners appealed the Board\u2019s decision. Both the Board and the City demurred to appellants\u2019 petition for appeal on grounds substantially similar to those raised before this Court. At the parties\u2019 request, the circuit court heard oral argument on both demurrers at the same time, sustaining the demurrers on August 7, 1998 in a document entitled, \u201cCase Under Advisement.\u201d Without elaborating upon the grounds for its decision, the court wrote that appellants \u201clack standing to maintain [their] suit.\u201d The court entered a final order dismissing appellants\u2019 appeal on September 11, 1998. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\n<em>I. STANDING UNDER CODE \u00a7 62.1-U.29</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">On demurrer, the court need only determine the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and take as true all of the facts alleged by the plaintiff. <em>See Runion v. Helvestine, </em>256 Va. 1, 7, 501 S.E.2d 411, 415 (1998); <em>W.S. Carnes, Inc. v. Bd. of Supervisors of Chesterfield County, </em>252 Va. 377, 384, 478 S.E.2d 295, 300 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Appellants\u2019 claim under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 is governed by our recent decision in <em>Alliance to Save the Mattaponi, et al. v. Commonwealth of Virginia, ex rel. State Water Control Board, et al., </em>30 Va.App. 690, 519 S.E.2d 413 (1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>in <em>Alliance </em>that the appellants there lacked standing to appeal the Board\u2019s issuance of the VWPP because they failed to satisfy the second prong of the statutory test for Article III standing, viz. an injury to a legally protected interest that is fairly traceable to the defendant and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 706-07, 519 S.E.2d at 421. As in <em>Alliance, </em>appellants here cannot establish standing to challenge the Project \u201cbecause the injuries alleged in their petition for appeal will result from the independent action of the [Army Corps of Engineers], a third party not before the circuit court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702, 519 S.E.2d at 419. We find the trial court did not err in sustaining the demurrer on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">II. <em>CLAIM CONCERNING THE TREATY AT MIDDLE PLANTATION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Appellants allege that the Treaty creates a duty on the Commonwealth to protect the Tribe from any encroachments within three miles of the Mattaponi Reservation. Appellants further allege that by the Board\u2019s issuance of the VWPP, the Commonwealth has breached this duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The Treaty language cited by appellants in support of their claim reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">For prevention of ... Injuries and evil consequences ... for time to come; It is hereby Concluded and Established, That no English shall Seat or Plant nearer then [sic] Three miles of any Indian Town; and whosoever hath made, or shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>make any Incroaehment upon their Land shall be removed from thence, and proceeded against as by the former Peace made, when the Honourable Colonel Francis Morison was Governour....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><em>Treaty at Middle Plantation, </em>art. IV (1677), <em>in </em>4 <em>Early American Indian Documents: Treaties and Laws, 1607-1789, </em>82-87 (Alden T. Vaughan and W. Stith Robinson, eds. 1983). Appellants claim that flooding associated with the Project will inundate a portion of the land described in Article IV and that as a result harm will accrue to their interest in the land established in the Treaty. They equate flooding with \u201cmak[ing] any Incroaehment\u201d as stipulated in Article IV. Appellees counter that the land described in Article IV was never conveyed to the Tribe and instead constituted a buffer zone between the formerly warring colonists and the Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We decide this case without resolving the question of whether the Tribe was granted ownership rights to the property in question. As we held in <em>Alliance to Save the Mattaponi, </em>the issuance of the VWPP by the Board does not constitute an imminent threat or danger to anyone, because, unless the Corps issues a \u00a7 404 permit, the Project will never proceed. <em>See Alliance, </em>30 Va.App. at 701, 519 S.E.2d at 419. Thus, if any harm shall accrue to lands in which appellants assert an interest, such harm will arise, if at all, from the acts of a third party at some future time. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we find that appellants have failed to allege an actual violation of property rights, even assuming the claimed rights exist under the Treaty. Accordingly we affirm the trial court\u2019s order sustaining appellees\u2019 demurrer on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">III. <em>APPELLANTS\u2019 CLAIM UNDER TITLE VI</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aet\">Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that \u201c[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. Appellants allege that the Board receives such federal assistance and that, as a result, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Board is bound by Title VI. Further, they allege that the Board discriminated against the Tribe, a racially and culturally distinct people, by failing to adequately consider appellants\u2019 cultural and religious uses of the Mattaponi River and its tributaries and that by its issuance of the VWPP, the Board violated Title VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">We find no merit in appellants\u2019 Title VI claim. A party seeking redress under the auspices of Title VI must meet the Article III requirements of standing, and a failure to do so nullifies his claim. <em>See, e.g., DeKalb County School Dist. v. Schrenko, </em>109 F.3d 680, 689 (11th Cir.1997). As noted earlier, appellants lack Article III standing. <em>See Alliance to Save the Mattaponi </em>30 Va.App. at 701-02, 519 S.E.2d at 418-19. Appellants have thus failed to state a claim in their pleadings that entitles them to redress under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order sustaining appellees\u2019 demurrer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-10\">. In addition to arguing that they have standing pursuant to Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29, appellants also contend that they have standing under the Virginia Administrative Process Act (\"VAPA\u201d). As we noted in <em>Alliance to Save the Mattaponi, </em>30 Va.App. at 701 n. 7, 519 S.E.2d at 418 n. 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>however, the SWCL provides expressly for judicial review of the agency action at issue, and therefore we need not look to the provisions of VAPA in order to determirie whether appellants have standing to challenge the Project. Consequently, that question will not be addressed here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-9\">. In <em>Alliance, </em>we identified the statute\u2019s requirement of harm as 1) an actual or imminent injury which is an invasion of a legally protected interest and which is concrete and particularized; 2) an injury fairly traceable to the defendant; and 3) an injury likely to be redressed by a favorable decision of the court. <em>See id. </em>at 701-02, 519 S.E.2d at 418-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-15\">. Because we have resolved the issues in the appeal on the grounds stated, we do not reach the Commonwealth\u2019s claims of multifariousness and improper pleading of the federal claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
