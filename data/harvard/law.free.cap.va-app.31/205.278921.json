On appeal, defendant complains that the trial court erroneously denied his motion for an order requiring the Commonwealth to provide a qualitative analysis of the offending substance. Defendant also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider the record \u201c \u2018in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. In so doing, we must discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth....\u2019\u201d <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 335, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998) (citation omitted). The credibility of the witnesses, the weight accorded testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters to be determined by the fact finder. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). \u201cWhen weighing the evidence, the fact finder is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>required to accept entirely either the Commonwealth\u2019s or defendant\u2019s account of the facts,\u201d but \u201cmay reject that which it finds implausible, [and] accept other parts which it finds to be believable.\u201d <em>Pugliese v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 82, 92, 428 S.E.2d 16, 24 (1998). The judgment of the trial court will not be set aside unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">At approximately 3:10 p.m. on August 20, 1997, Danville Police Patrolman L.R. Kennedy and Detectives Tommy Merricks and C.D. Evans executed a search warrant for defendant\u2019s apartment. In a nightstand drawer, Evans discovered $105 cash and a \u201csmall black bag like maybe a [sic] electric razor would come in,\u201d \u201cbulged out\u201d \u201cfrom the contents.\u201d A search of the black bag revealed \u201ca little plastic bag of white powder,\u201d \u201clike a sandwich bag,\u201d marijuana wrapped in a paper towel, an additional $517 cash, food stamps, and \u201cflat, electronic type scales.\u201d The certificate of analysis subsequently prepared by the Commonwealth\u2019s Division of Forensic Science identified the \u201cpowder\u201d as \u201ccocaine (Schedule II), 26.2 grams,\u201d and defendant admitted possession for his personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">At trial, Detective Merricks qualified as an expert on the \u201cstreet value\u201d of cocaine and fixed the worth of 26.2 grams at $800 to $1,300. Without objection, Merricks described 26.2 grams as \u201ca large amount to be recovered,\u201d noting that he had \u201cnot encountered anyone that is a user that has had [that quantity] of cocaine at one time,\u201d that the most he had \u201cever seen anyone purchase for personal use ... was a hundred dollars\u2019 worth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Defendant testified that he had been a \u201ccocaine addict\u201d for thirty years and admitted purchasing the subject drugs, a \u201cthree or four day\u201d supply, for $750 several hours prior to the search of his residence. He claimed that he won the purchase money and remaining cash by \u201chitting the lottery,\u201d \u201cthree days in a row,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u201cworking and everything,\u201d and used the scales \u201cto weigh what [drug dealers] sold\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>On cross-examination, defendant explained that he supported his cocaine habit, which consumed seven grams daily, by seasonal employment several months each year at a weekly wage of $175, irregular earnings \u201ccleaning gutters and raking leaves[,] ... stuff like that,\u201d and \u201cshoplifting.\u201d Whenever without funds to purchase cocaine, defendant would \u201cjust chill out and ... use no drugs.\u201d He admitted to \u201csix or seven\u201d prior felony convictions, including robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Defendant first argues that the trial court erroneously denied his motion, made immediately prior to the commencement of trial, that the Commonwealth be required to provide a \u201cquantitative analysis\u201d of the \u201cpowder,\u201d identified simply as \u201ccocaine\u201d in the certificate of analysis, to determine and quantify the composition of the substance. In support of the motion, defendant\u2019s counsel expressed his \u201cbelie[f]\u201d that further analysis would reveal the presence of a \u201ccutting agent,\u201d evidence which may rebut any inference of an intent to distribute cocaine arising from the total quantity of powder. In concluding his argument to the court, counsel acknowledged, \u201cI\u2019m rolling the dice here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has instructed that \u201can indigent defendant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who seeks the appointment of an expert witness, at the Commonwealth\u2019s expense, must demonstrate that the subject which necessitates the assistance of the expert is \u2018likely to be a significant factor in his defense,\u2019 and that he will be prejudiced by the lack of expert assistance!,]\u201d resulting \u201cin a fundamentally unfair trial.\u201d <em>Husske v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 203, 211-12, 476 S.E.2d 920, 925 (1996) (footnote added) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1154, 117 S.Ct. 1092, 137 L.Ed.2d 225 (1997); <em>see also Vinson v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 459, 467, 522 S.E.2d 170, 175-76 (1999). Thus, the <em>Husske </em>Court reasoned that the accused must show a \u201cparticularized need\u201d for such expertise and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018[m]ere hope or suspicion that favorable evidence is available is not enough to require that such help be provided.\u2019 ... The determination ... whether a defendant has made an adequate showing of particularized necessity lies within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Husske, </em>252 Va. at 212, 476 S.E.2d at 925-26 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Here, defendant \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d that a qualitative analysis of the contraband would precisely quantify the cocaine, apart from any cutting agent, evidence which he speculates would negate any inference of an intent to distribute based upon gross weight. However, nothing in the record establishes the relevance of purity either to the distribution of cocaine or a related prosecution for the offense. Perhaps more telling, defendant characterized his motion as \u201crolling the dice.\u201d Thus, the record failed to demonstrate a particularized need for the requested expertise but, rather, defendant\u2019s mere hope that the evidence would promote his defense. Such conjecture, lacking substance, did not implicate defendant\u2019s fundamental right to a fair trial. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Defendant next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the requisite intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u201cIf evidence of intent is wholly circumstantial, \u2018all necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence and exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dukes v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 119, 122, 313 S.E.2d 382, 383 (1984) (citation omitted). \u201cWhen the proof of intent to distribute rests upon circumstantial evidence, the quantity which the defendant possesses is a circumstance to be considered. Indeed, quantity, alone, may be sufficient to establish such intent if it is greater than the supply ordinarily possessed for one\u2019s personal use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he presence of an unusual amount of money, suggesting profit from sales,\u201d <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>(citation omitted), and \u201cthe presence of paraphernalia,\u201d such as scales, are factors supporting a conviction for possession with intent to distribute. <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 728, 733, 406 S.E.2d 922, 925 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Detective Merricks testified that the quantity of cocaine in defendant\u2019s possession was inconsistent with customary personal use. The drugs were found together with a large sum of money, and electronic scales suitable for weighing like contraband in furtherance of distribution. Although defendant offered explanations for the cash, scales and quantity of cocaine to refute an intent to distribute, the court was free to ignore his testimony and \u201cinfer that he lied to conceal ... guilt.\u201d <em>Speight v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 83, 88, 354 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Accordingly, we find the evidence sufficient to support the conviction and affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\">. Defendant also testified that he \"hit the numbers\u201d \u201celeven times\" in 1997, winning in excess of $500 on each occasion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\">.

I agree; therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\u201cTo satisfy the due process requirements of the ... Constitution, the prosecution must bear the burden of proving all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Stokes v. Warden, </em>226 Va. 111, 117, 306 S.E.2d 882, 885 (1983). \u201cIt is elementary that where, as here, an indictment charges an offense Which consists of an act combined with a particular intent, proof of the intent is essential to conviction.... Existence of the intent, however, cannot be based upon surmise or speculation.\u201d <em>Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 698, 699, 213 S.E.2d 752, 753 (1975) (citations omitted). Intent must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Dukes v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 119, 123, 313 S.E.2d 382, 384 (1984); <em>Wells v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 549, 553, 347 S.E.2d 139, 141 (1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>[W]ell established principles apply to testing the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence. In <em>LaPrade v. Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 410, 418, 61 S.E.2d 313, 316 (1950), [the Supreme Court] summarized those principles as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">\u201c... [I]f the proof relied upon by the Commonwealth is wholly circumstantial, as it here is, then to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt all necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence. They must overcome the presumption of innocence and exclude all reasonable conclusions inconsistent with that of guilt. To accomplish that, the chain of necessary circumstances must be unbroken and the evidence as a whole must satisfy the guarded judgment that both the corpus delicti and the criminal agency of the accused have been proved to the exclusion of any other rational hypothesis and to a moral certainty....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">But, circumstances of suspicion, no matter how grave or strong, are not proof of guilt sufficient to support a verdict of guilty. The actual commission of the crime by the accused must be shown by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain his conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\"><em>Clodfelter v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 619, 623, 238 S.E.2d 820, 822 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The detective did not opine that the 26.2 grams of cocaine was inconsistent with personal use. Indeed, he testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">Q: .... Now you have not offered an opinion as to the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">quantity that can be used in personal use today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">A: No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-12\">Q: You have been strictly only as to value of this substance on the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-13\">A: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">Although the detective testified that 26.2 grams was not an amount typically purchased on the street, he testified that in the past eighteen months he had been involved in operations where other individuals made purchases on the streets of Danville of \u201capproximately this quantity\u201d of cocaine. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>testified that the purchase value of that quantity of powder cocaine was $800 to $1,300 and that \u201cpowder has been less and less ... prevalent on the streets of Danville.\u201d The evidence further proved that although one-eighth of an ounce of cocaine, known as an \u201ceight-ball,\u201d is a typical unit of purchase on the street, the amount of cocaine Barksdale possessed (26.2 grams), which is less than an ounce, had been purchased on the streets by the police. In addition, the detective testified that heavily addicted cocaine users would want to have an ounce of cocaine to use if they could \u201cget their hands on it.\u201d In short, this evidence does not establish that the amount of cocaine Barksdale possessed was not for his personal use. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Levy, </em>703 F.2d 791, 792 (4th Cir.1983) (noting that 4.75 ounces of cocaine does not exceed the quantity a user might store for personal use).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Although scales were found in proximity to the cocaine, no evidence tended to prove a use other than that testified to by Barksdale. He testified that he used the scales to weigh the cocaine after he made purchases so as to assure himself that he was not being cheated. Considering the absence of proof that Barksdale possessed any packaging materials or cutting agents or any other circumstance tending to prove intent to distribute, the evidence failed to prove that Barksdale intended to distribute the cocaine which was located in a drawer of a nightstand in his bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">For these reasons, I would reverse the conviction for possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
