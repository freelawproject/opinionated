On appeal, he complains that the trial court erroneously (1) denied a mistrial after a Commonwealth witness referenced defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>invocation of his right to counsel, and (2) refused to permit impeachment of a Commonwealth witness. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">During trial of defendant before a jury on indictments alleging first-degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of such offense, the Commonwealth, on direct examination, inquired of Police Investigator Mike Thompson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>[COMMONWEALTH]: And did you have occasion to see [defendant] that night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">[THOMPSON]: Yes, ma\u2019am. The first time I saw him was in Sheriff Woodley\u2019s patrol vehicle going by me. When I saw him in person face-to-face and spoke to him was at Brunswick County jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">[COMMONWEALTH]: All right. And when you saw [defendant] did he complain of any marks or any injury? [THOMPSON]: After I advised him of his Miranda rights and he invoked his right to counsel, he requested that Deputy Washburn take pictures of his injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Defense counsel immediately moved the court for a mistrial, arguing that mentioning \u201cdefendant [had] invoked his right to an attorney\u201d was \u201cautomatic grounds for a mistrial.\u201d In denying the motion, the trial judge commented, \u201cWhat [Thompson] said was a prelude to the question about any injury. The Court finds the statement to be harmless and not prejudicial to the rights.\u201d Defendant subsequently declined the court\u2019s offer to \u201cadmonish the jury,\u201d and no further comment was made on defendant\u2019s silence or assertion of his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">In <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), the Supreme Court of the United States concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">[t]he warnings mandated by <em>[Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 467-73, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1624-27, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) ], as a prophylactic means of safeguarding Fifth Amendment rights, require that a person taken into custody be advised immediately that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says may be used against him, and that he has a right to retained or appointed counsel before submitting to interrogation---- [W]hile it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 618, 96 S.Ct. at 2245 (citation omitted). Thus, the Court reasoned that \u201cit would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow [an] arrested person\u2019s silence to be <em>used </em>to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Subsequently, in <em>Wainwright v. Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 106 S.Ct. 634, 88 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986), the Court revisited <em>Doyle </em>and, again, condemned a \u201cbreach[ ][of] the implied assurance of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings [as] an affront to Due Process[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, 106 S.Ct. at 639. There, after Greenfield entered a plea of \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity,\u201d the prosecution was permitted to introduce evidence that he had \u201cexercised his right to remain silent and ... expressed a desire to consult counsel before answering any questions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286-87, 106 S.Ct. at 636. Later, in closing argument and over the objection of defense counsel, the prosecutor reminded the jury of Greenfield\u2019s silence and \u201csuggested that [his] repeated refusals to answer questions without first consulting an attorney demonstrated a degree of comprehension ... inconsistent with ... insanity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 106 S.Ct. at 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">In reversing the conviction, the <em>Greenfield </em>Court emphasized, \u201c[t]he point of ... <em>Doyle </em>... is that it is\u00bb... unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be <em>used </em>against him and thereafter ... <em>using </em>the silence to impeach [him]\u201d or otherwise <em>\u201cmake use </em>of the ... exercise of those rights in obtaining his conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, 106 S.Ct. at 639 (emphasis added). Thus, \u201c[w]hat is impermissible is the evidentiary use of an individual\u2019s exercise of his constitutional rights after the ... assurance\u201d of <em>Miranda. Id. </em>at 295, 106 S.Ct. at 640. The Court also noted that, \u201c[w]ith respect to <em>post-Miranda </em>warnings \u2018silence,\u2019 ... silence does not mean only muteness: it includes the statement ... of a desire to remain silent until an attorney has been consulted.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 295 n. 13, 106 S.Ct. at 640 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Within a year of deciding <em>Greenfield, </em>the Court was, once more, confronted with a <em>Doyle </em>issue in <em>Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987), an appeal resulting from a prosecutorial inquiry of a witness which \u201ctouched upon Miller\u2019s postarrest silence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764, 107 S.Ct. at 3108. Unlike in <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Greenfield, </em>however, the trial court sustained Miller\u2019s prompt objection,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> instructed the jury to \u201c \u2018ignore the question,\u2019 \u201d and the record reflected no \u201cfurther questioning or argument with respect to Miller\u2019s silence[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 759, 764, 107 S.Ct. at 3106, 3108. In undertaking the necessary <em>Doyle </em>analysis, the Court deemed it \u201csignificant that in each of the cases in which [the] Court has applied <em>Doyle, </em>the trial court ... permitted specific inquiry or argument respecting the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764, 107 S.Ct. at 3108. Thus, because \u201cMiller\u2019s postarrest silence was not submitted to the jury as evidence from which it was allowed to draw any permissible inference,\u201d the Court determined that \u201cno <em>Doyle </em>violation occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764-65, 765, 107 S.Ct. at 3108-09, 3108.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Guided by the lesson of <em>Greer </em>that \u201cit is the <em>use </em>of an accused\u2019s silence against him at trial by way of specific inquiry or impeachment that forms the basis for a violation of <em>[Doyle </em>],\u201d numerous federal circuits have decided that <em>\u201cDoyle </em>does not impose a prima facie bar against any mention whatsoever of a defendant\u2019s right to request counsel [or remain silent], but, instead, guards against the exploitation of that constitutional right by the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Lindgren v. Lane, 925 </em>F.2d 198, 201, 202 (7th Cir.1991); <em>see also Noland v. French, </em>134 F.3d 208, 216 (4th Cir.1998); <em>Jones v. Stotts, 59 </em>F.3d 143, 146 (10th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Stubbs, </em>944 F.2d 828, 834-35 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The <em>Lindgren </em>Court was confronted with a record that mirrored the instant appeal. A police officer made mention of Lindgren\u2019s request for counsel during direct examination by the prosecutor, and the trial court denied defendant\u2019s result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>ing motion for a mistrial. In affirming, the Court reiterated that a <em>Doyle </em>inquiry \u201ccenter[s] ... around the particular use to which the post-arrest silence is being put[ ]\u201d and, therefore, requires consideration of the particular circumstances of each case. 925 F.2d at 202. Because \u201cthe inadvertent mention of [Lindgren\u2019s] request for counsel was not argued to the jury nor was it ever used to impeach [defendant],\u201d his \u201crequest for counsel was not used against [him]\u201d and \u201cdue process rights were not violated under ... <em>[Greenfield] </em>and <em>Doyle.\u201d Id. </em>at 202-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We are persuaded by the rationale of <em>Lindgren, </em>and, similarly, conclude that defendant\u2019s right to due process was not compromised by Investigator Thompson\u2019s mere mention that defendant had once invoked his right to counsel. The gratuitous comment was not responsive to the question posed to Thompson by the prosecution, and defendant\u2019s prompt mistrial motion avoided any inquiry into the subject. Defendant, thereafter, opted to forego an instruction that the jury ignore the remark, and the prosecutor made no related argument to the jury or otherwise exploit the issue. Thus, the words, though improperly spoken by the witness, were not \u201cused\u201d against defendant in any respect and were without evidentiary value. Moreover, the trial court promptly acted to scrupulously safeguard defendant\u2019s due process rights. Under such circumstances, the trial court correctly found no <em>Doyle </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Defendant\u2019s reliance upon <em>Schrum v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 204, 246 S.E.2d 893 (1978), for a contrary result is misplaced. There, during trial of Schrum before a jury for rape, the prosecutor propounded a series of questions to the investigating detective with respect to \u201can occasion to talk to the defendant in regard to the matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209, 246 S.E.2d at 897. In response, the detective testified that Schrum, then charged with the offense, voluntarily reported to police headquarters, accompanied by counsel. Further inquiry by the Commonwealth into the attendant \u201cinterview\u201d prompted the detective to answer, \u201cAs I said, he was with his attorney and his attorney advised him not to make any statement at this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>time.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s immediate objection and motion for a mistrial were overruled by the court, and the prosecutor was permitted to pursue the incident, concluding with the detective\u2019s acknowledgment that Schrum was advised of \u201chis rights,\u201d \u201cexecute[d] a rights waiver\u201d but provided \u201cno statements.\u201d Thereafter, the trial judge continued the inquiry, remarking to the witness, \u201cthe man has a right to follow his attorney\u2019s advice, or not answer, or the attorney to tell you that he didn\u2019t want his client to make a statement,\u201d adding, \u201cThat\u2019s not unusual, is it?,\u201d prompting the response, \u201cNo sir, that\u2019s not unusual.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In reversing the conviction, the Court reaffirmed the view that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment precludes the prosecution from <em>using </em>an assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination to discredit or convict the person who asserted it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 246 S.E.2d at 898 (emphasis added). Citing <em>Doyle </em>as dispositive, the Court concluded that the Commonwealth\u2019s <em>use </em>against Schrum of his <em>post-Miranda </em>exercise of the rights to silence and counsel offended due process. <em>See id. </em>at 213, 246 S.E.2d at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Thus, in sharp contrast to the instant record, the prosecutor in <em>Schrum </em>was permitted, despite proper objection, to develop evidence detailing Schrum\u2019s exercise of his right to counsel and silence. Moreover, the trial court involved itself in the issue, further developing the related circumstances for the jury, accentuating the constitutional implications and providing insight into the \u201c[Jusual\u201d result when an accused is represented by counsel. Manifestly, therefore, Schrum\u2019s exercise of constitutional safeguards of <em>Miranda </em>was intentionally <em>used </em>against him by the prosecutor and the resulting prejudice was exacerbated by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Defendant next contends that the trial court erroneously declined to allow a defense witness, Sharon Gross, to testify that Commonwealth eyewitness Derrick Bradley was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>\u201chigh\u201d on the date of the offense. Again, defendant\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Gross had seen Bradley on the day of the offense, sometime after she \u201cheard about it.\u201d She initially testified that Bradley was then \u201cglassy-eyed and high,\u201d adding later that he was \u201chigh\u201d and \u201chad gone to get a drink.\u201d At Gross\u2019 first reference to Bradley\u2019s condition, the Commonwealth objected, prompting defendant\u2019s counsel to respond, before the court ruled, \u201cJudge, I\u2019ll move along.\u201d However, the court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection to Gross\u2019 subsequent description of Bradley, noting that, \u201chowever [he] was at the time [Gross] saw him is not necessarily how he was at the time of the event.\u201d Again, counsel assured the court, &lt;cVery well, ... I\u2019ll move along,\u201d and abandoned the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988). Here, circumstances which may have affected Bradley\u2019s ability to observe and recall the offense were relevant, but the defense failed to establish that Gross\u2019 evidence, relating to Bradley\u2019s condition at an unspecified time after the crime, was probative of that issue. Moreover, her initial testimony, describing Bradley as \u201cglassy-eyed and high,\u201d was before the jury for such consideration as it deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Accordingly, the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial and properly limited defendant\u2019s direct examination of Ms. Gross, and we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\">.
