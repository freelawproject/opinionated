On appeal, he complains that the trial court erroneously refused to instruct the jury on the element of malice. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">If any person write or compose and also send or procure the sending of any letter ..., so 'written or composed, ... to any person, containing a threat to kill or do bodily injury to the person to whom such letter or communication was sent or to kill or do bodily injury to any member of his or her family, the person so writing or composing and sending or procuring the sending of such letter or communication shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Accordingly, the court instructed the jury, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am3\">The defendant is charged with the crime of threatening bodily injury to another person. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following elements of that crime: (1) That the defendant wrote or composed a letter or written communication signed or unsigned to [another]; and (2) That the letter or written communication contained a threat to do bodily harm to [such other] or his family; and (3) That the defendant sent such letter or written communication to [him].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Arguing that malice was indispensable to the \u201cunlawful <em>mens rea\u201d </em>implicit in the statutory offense, defendant proffered an instruction which required the Commonwealth to prove that he committed the proscribed acts \u201cwith malice,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>together with a companion instruction defining malice. In refusing both instructions, the court noted that the statute did not \u201ccontain ... the word malicious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u201cA reviewing court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is \u2018to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all the issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019 It is elementary that a jury must be informed as to the essential elements of the offense; a correct statement of the law is one of the \u2018essentials of a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988) (citations omitted). \u201cAn instruction should not be given which incorrectly states the applicable law or which would be confusing or misleading to ... the jury.\u201d <em>Bruce v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 298, 300, 387 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1990) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\"> Malice is \u201cthat state of mind which results in the intentional doing of a wrongful act to another without legal excuse or justification, at a time when the mind of the actor is under the control of reason.\u201d <em>Lynn v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 336, 344-45 n. 1, 499 S.E.2d 1, 5-6 n. 1 (1998); <em>see also </em>1 Virginia Model Jury Instructions \u2014 Criminal 33.220 (1998 repl. ed. with 1999 Supp.). Thus, \u201c[mjalice is evidenced either when the accused acted with a sedate, deliberate mind, and formed design, or committed any purposeful and cruel act without any or without great provocation.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 841, 419 S.E.2d 422, 426 (1992). The legislature has expressly required malice as an element of numerous statutory offenses. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-77, -79, -80, -86, -127, -152.7(B), -212, and -279.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">In contrast, <em>mens rea </em>or <em>scienter </em>is simply the unlawful intent or design necessary to any criminal act that is not a strict liability offense. <em>See Reed v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 467, 424 S.E.2d 718 (1992); 1 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 </em>3.4 (1986); <em>Livingston v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 830, 36 S.E.2d 561 (1946). Thus, although malice is a species of <em>mens rea, see Christian v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 1078, 277 S.E.2d 205 (1981); <em>Berkeley v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 279, 451 S.E.2d 41 (1994), <em>mens rea </em>does not always evince malice. <em>See e.g., Mosby v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 58, 473 S.E.2d 732 (1996) (criminal negligence); <em>Fortune v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 643, 406 S.E.2d 47 (1991) (unlawful behavior). Hence, a wrongful act done intentionally is not always malicious. <em>See Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 339, 373 S.E.2d 603 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Although Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A) makes no mention of malice, defendant, nevertheless, relies on <em>Perkins v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 7, 402 S.E.2d 229 (1991), to infer malice as an element of the offense. In <em>Perkins, </em>the accused challenged Code \u00a7 18.2-83(A)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as unconstitutionally overbroad because it required no <em>mens rea </em>to complete the crime. We disagreed, reasoning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">In <em>Maye v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 48, 189 S.E.2d 350 (1972) the Supreme Court of Virginia stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">A claim that a statute on its face contains no requirement of <em>mens rea </em>or <em>scienter </em>is no ground for holding the statute unconstitutional since such requirement will be read into the statute by the court when it appears the legislature implicitly intended that it must be proved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Y\">213 Va. 48, 49, 189 S.E.2d 350, 351 (1972).... Therefore, \u00a7 18.2-83 can be read as requiring <em>mens rea. </em>Such a narrowing construction of this statute prevents overbreadth. Only an individual who <em>maliciously </em>\u201cmakes and communicates ... any threat\u201d prohibited by the statute will be punished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 15, 402 S.E.2d at 234 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Defendant acknowledges that <em>Perkins </em>clearly instructs that <em>mens rea </em>or <em>scienter </em>\u201cwill be read into a [criminal] statute\u201d to satisfy constitutional imperatives. Additionally, however, he construes dicta in <em>Perkins, </em>\u201c[o]nly an individual who <em>mali</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>ciously\u201d </em>engages in conduct \u201cprohibited by [Code \u00a7 18.2-83(A) ] will be punished,\u201d to also graft the element of malice onto the subject Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A), a statute similar to Code \u00a7 18.2-83(A). <em>Perkins, </em>12 Va.App. at 15, 402 S.E.2d at 234 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We are not persuaded that this Court in <em>Perkins </em>intended to equate <em>mens rea </em>with malice, a concept clearly at odds with well-established jurisprudence, and, therefore, decline defendant\u2019s invitation to imply both <em>mens rea and </em>malice as elements of Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A). \u201cWe may not add to a statute language which the legislature has chosen not to include.\u201d <em>County of Amherst Bd. of Supervisors v. Brockman, </em>224 Va. 391, 397, 297 S.E.2d 805, 808 (1982) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-10\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-83(A) prohibits any person from \u201cmak[ing] or communicat[ing] to another by any means any threat to bomb, burn, destroy or in any manner damage any place of assembly, building or other structure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
