He contends the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a warrantless search of his residence when the police, escorting a known trespasser, entered his apartment to retrieve the trespasser\u2019s jacket. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">The evidence established that Officer Ronald May (May) responded to a report of a trespass in progress at the Shockoe Hill Apartments in the City of Richmond. May knew that the trespasser, identified as April Brown (Brown), had previously been barred from the apartment complex. As he arrived at the scene, May saw Brown \u201c[cjoming from [appellant\u2019s] apartment\u201d wearing a shirt and a pair of shorts that were unbuttoned. Brown saw May and ran. After she was apprehended in the front of the building, Brown said \u201cshe was visiting Vance Robinson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">In the parking lot of the apartment complex, May placed Brown under arrest. At that time, Brown stated she wanted to \u201cget her jacket\u201d from Robinson\u2019s apartment. The officer permitted Brown to retrieve her jacket and with two other officers followed her to appellant\u2019s apartment. Officer May testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">Q. And did there come a time where you entered into Mr. Robinson\u2019s apartment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Q. And who opened the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">A. Ms. Brown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">Q. And where were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">A. Right behind her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">Q. And did you step into the apartment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">Q. Did you knock on the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">A. I didn\u2019t knock. She just went right in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\"># \u2756 * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">Q. ... Did you ask anyone\u2019s permission to enter that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\">apartment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-15\">A. No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-16\">Q. You knew it wasn\u2019t her apartment, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-17\">A. Yes, I did know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-18\">Q. And you knew she wasn\u2019t even supposed to be on that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-19\">property in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-20\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-21\">Q. And you walked your whole full self into the apartment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-22\">is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-23\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-24\">Prior to entering the apartment, the police knew that the apartment did not belong to Brown and that she was banned from the apartment complex by the management.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-25\">When the police first entered, they saw appellant \u201cstanding in the kitchen area.\u201d May also saw a \u201ccrack pipe\u201d in plain view on a nearby table. The table was visible immediately upon entering the front door of the apartment. As a result of seeing the crack pipe, May asked appellant for permission to search the apartment. Appellant cooperated with the police and signed a consent form. As a result of the search, the officers seized a plastic bag containing .038 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-26\">Prior to trial, appellant moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that the warrantless entry into his apartment violated the Fourth Amendment. In denying the motion, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>I think this officer had a good faith exception that he reasonably believed that he had a right to go in and follow the lady that took him in to get her coat. I think he did what anybody would have done under the circumstances and that he had apparent authority to go in. So he didn\u2019t violate [appellant\u2019s] rights. I deny your motion to suppress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agc\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-254, appellant entered a conditional plea of guilty and appealed the denial of his suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In considering the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, the burden is on appellant to show that the court\u2019s ruling constituted reversible error. <em>See McGee v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc). </em>In such cases, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>See Greene v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 606, 608, 440 S.E.2d 138, 139 (1994). Ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause involve questions of both law and fact and are reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>See McGee, 25 </em>Va.App. at 197, 487 S.E.2d at 261. We are bound, however, by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact \u201cunless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 487 S.E.2d at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">A. Warrantless Entry</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The Fourth Amendment protects the \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.... \u201d U.S. Const, amd. IV. By its explicit terms, the Fourth Amendment \u201cprotects the individual\u2019s privacy in a variety of settings. In none is the zone of privacy more clearly defined than when bounded by the unambiguous physical dimensions of an individual\u2019s home----\u201d <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 589, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1381-82, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). \u201c[Physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Amendment is directed,\u201d <em>United States v. United States District Court for E.D. Michigan, </em>407 U.S. 297, 313, 92 S.Ct. 2125, 2134, 32 L.Ed.2d 752 (1972), and \u201c[t]he Fourth Amendment embodies [the] centuries-old principle of respect for the privacy of the home[.]\u201d <em>Wilson v. Layne, </em>526 U.S. 603, 610, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 1697, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999). Thus, under well-established Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, \u201csearches ... inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Payton, </em>445 U.S. at 586, 100 S.Ct. at 1380 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u201cAlthough the Fourth Amendment permits law enforcement officers to make warrantless arrests in public places upon probable cause, warrantless entries into a suspect\u2019s home in order to arrest a suspect violate the Fourth Amendment unless justified by exigent circumstances or consent.\u201d <em>Jefferson v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 1, 14, 497 S.E.2d 474, 480 (1998) (citations omitted). Because warrantless entries are presumed invalid, the Commonwealth has a heavy burden to justify the warrantless entry. <em>See Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 363, 369, 512 S.E.2d 165, 167 (1999). \u201cUnless an exception is shown by the evidence, ... the threshold of one\u2019s home may not be crossed without a warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368, 512 S.E.2d at 167 (citing <em>Payton, </em>445 U.S. at 590, 100 S.Ct. at 1382). <em>See Flippo v. West Virginia, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014,\u2014, 120 S.Ct. 7, 8, 145 L.Ed.2d 16 (1999) (per curiam) (\u201cA warrantless search by the police is invalid unless it falls within one of the narrow and well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">B. Apparent Authority to Consent</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The Commonwealth concedes that when May made his warrantless entry into appellant\u2019s apartment, he had no probable cause for the entry and did not confront exigent circumstances. The Commonwealth also agrees that this case does not involve the \u201chot pursuit\u201d of a fleeing felon. Rather, the Commonwealth first contends that the warrantless entry into appellant\u2019s apartment was valid because the officers\u2019 actions were based upon the reasonable but mistaken belief that Brown had \u201capparent authority\u201d to provide consent. Thus, the narrow issue presented is whether it was reasonable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the police to have believed that Brown, a known trespasser already in police custody, had apparent authority to enter appellant\u2019s apartment and take the police with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">We have held that the reasonableness requirement, which prohibits the warrantless entry of a person\u2019s residence, \u201cdoes not apply ... to situations in which voluntary consent has been obtained, either from the individual whose property is searched, or from a third party who possesses common authority over the premises.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 725, 727, 432 S.E.2d 517, 519 (1993) (citing <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 181, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 2797-98, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990)). Even if the third party does not have authority to consent to the warrantless entry, \u201capparent authority may be sufficient if the facts surrounding the situation would have led a reasonable officer to conclude that the person providing consent had the requisite authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 727-28, 432 S.E.2d at 519 (citing <em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. at 186-88, 110 S.Ct. at 2800-01; <em>Caldwell v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 540, 542, 425 S.E.2d 534, 535-36 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In <em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 110 S.Ct. 2793, the United States Supreme Court considered \u201c[w]hether a warrantless entry is valid when based upon the consent of a third party whom the police, at the time of entry, reasonably believe to possess common authority over the premises, but who in fact does not do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 110 S.Ct. at 2796. The Court noted that common authority rests \u201c \u2018on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes____\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 181, 110 S.Ct. at 2797 (quoting <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. 988, 993 n. 7, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974)). \u201cThe burden of establishing that common authority rests upon the State.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The Court in <em>Rodriguez </em>concluded that a warrantless entry may nonetheless be valid under the Fourth Amendment where the officer proceeds based upon a reasonable but mistaken belief that a third party has apparent authority to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>See id. </em>at 188-89, 110 S.Ct. at 2801.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">As with other factual determinations bearing upon search and seizure, determinations of consent to enter must be judged against an objective standard: would the facts available to the officer at the moment ... warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the consenting party had authority over the premises? If not, then warrantless entry without further inquiry is unlawful unless authority actually exists. But if so, the search is valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 188-89, 110 S.Ct. at 2801 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Applying the foregoing principles to the instant case, we hold that May entered appellant\u2019s apartment in violation of appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights and that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence found as a result of the warrantless entry and subsequent search. Brown, a known trespasser, lacked actual authority to consent to the warrantless entry and the officer\u2019s belief that she had apparent authority to consent was objectively unreasonable. A person of \u201creasonable caution\u201d could not logically conclude that an individual arrested for trespass of a building or residence could maintain, at the same time, authority over the premises and, thus, authority to consent to an entry of those premises. As the Supreme Court cautioned in <em>Rodriguez, </em>\u201cwhat we hold today does not suggest that law enforcement officers may always accept a person\u2019s invitation to enter premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, 110 S.Ct. at 2801 \u201cEven when the invitation is accompanied by an explicit assertion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>person lives there, the surrounding circumstances could conceivably be such that a reasonable person would doubt its truth and not act upon it without further inquiry.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Nevertheless, the Commonwealth contends that the officer\u2019s actions were reasonable under the circumstances because \u201cthere is no evidence that [appellant] questioned Brown\u2019s entry\u201d and \u201cno one protested when the police went inside the apartment with Brown.\u201d However, where the validity of a search rests on consent, the Commonwealth has the burden of proving that the necessary consent was obtained. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 674, 687, 496 S.E.2d 143, 149-50 (1998) (citing <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 497, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1323-24, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (plurality)). The Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cburden ... is not satisfied by showing a mere submission to a claim of lawful authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 497, 103 S.Ct. at 1324); <em>see also Bumper v. North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 548-49, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 1792, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Here, May was responding to a report of a trespass in progress at appellant\u2019s apartment complex when he saw Brown leaving appellant\u2019s apartment. He knew the apartment did not belong to Brown and that she was banned from the apartment building by the management. Brown was already under arrest at the time the officers allowed her to enter the apartment and followed her inside. The officers confronted no emergency that required Brown to re-enter without permission of the owner, a place Brown was legally barred from entering. The officers\u2019 reliance on Brown\u2019s apparent authority to enter was not objectively reasonable, and appellant\u2019s submission to the officer\u2019s claim of lawful authority did not satisfy the Commonwealth\u2019s burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress the evidence. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings if the Commonwealth be so advised.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\">. The Fourth Circuit has held that the good faith exception enunciated in <em>Rodriguez </em>does not \"extend[] even beyond the generally recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement: i.e., beyond consent, or one of the various forms of exigency that have been recognized depending upon the purpose of the search.\u201d <em>United States v. Moss, </em>963 F.2d 673, 677 (4th Cir.1992). Thus, \"the mistaken determinations of police officers that may be excused as good faith, reasonable ones, <em>must yet be related to elements of one of these exceptions.\" Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-9\">. The Commonwealth also contends the events that immediately followed the officers\u2019 entry into appellant\u2019s apartment \"purged any taint\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>such that the evidence was nevertheless admissible. This argument is without merit. The circumstances surrounding the warrantless entry and the subsequent request for consent to search demonstrate that the evidence obtained was the product of the initial illegality, rather than \"by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d <em>Wood v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 21, 31, 497 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998) (citations omitted). \"The officers did not seek [appellant\u2019s] consent until after they had made their illegal foray into the [apartment] and found incriminating evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, appellant\u2019s consent to search was not an independent source of the evidence, but rather was an exploitation of the initial warrantless entry.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
