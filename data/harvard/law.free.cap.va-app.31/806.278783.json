We agree, and reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">On April 21, 1998, the General District Court of Loudoun County adjudged Lowe an habitual offender pursuant to a show cause proceeding under former Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-351.2\u2014 46.2-355.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appealed that decision to the Circuit Court of Loudoun County. The circuit court heard the case on the record from the general district court, which included the Department of Motor Vehicles\u2019 (\u201cDMV\u201d) certification of Lowe\u2019s driving record and copies of pertinent Maryland statutes and cases. No additional evidence was taken or considered by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The circuit court issued a letter opinion, authored by Judge Thomas D. Horne, on August 25,1998, which stated that Lowe was not an habitual offender under the Virginia Habitual Offender Act (\u201cAct\u201d). The Act as it stood at the time of the alleged offenses provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that three or more convictions, within a ten-year period, of driving or operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 rendered the driver in question an habitual offender. Code \u00a7 46.2-351.1(b). The DMV certification established that Lowe had four convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol: the first in Prince William County, Virginia, on July 2, 1985; the second in Loudoun County, Virginia, on April 27, 1990; the third in the State of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Maryland, on March 6, 1991; and the fourth in Loudoun County, on October 23, 1997, the conviction giving rise to the present appeal. Lowe argued below that the Maryland conviction should not be considered by the court, because persons may be convicted under the Maryland statute for driving non-motor vehicles while intoxicated. <em>See </em>Code of Maryland Ann. \u00a7 21-902; Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Lowe cited <em>Richards v. Goff, </em>26 Md.App. 344, 338 A.2d 80 (1975), and <em>Moon v. Weeks, 25 </em>Md.App. 322, 333 A.2d 635 (1975), for the proposition that Maryland courts include within the term \u201cvehicle\u201d such non-motor vehicles as bicycles and children\u2019s sleds. On that ground, Lowe argued that the Maryland drunk driving statute did not \u201csubstantially conform\u201d to the Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-266, pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-351.1, in accordance with the standards outlined in <em>Commonwealth v. Ayers, </em>17 Va.App. 401, 437 S.E.2d 580 (1993) and <em>Honaker v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 682, 454 S.E.2d 29 (1995). Lowe thus contended his Maryland conviction was not a predicate offense under Code \u00a7 46.2-351 and that his conviction as an habitual offender therefore should be reversed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The trial court, citing <em>Cox v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 328, 411 S.E.2d 444 (1991), agreed with Lowe\u2019s reasoning, and concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-6\">[tjhere is nothing in the record to indicate that [when Lowe violated the Maryland drunk driving statute] he was driving a <em>motor </em>vehicle.... When the [c]ourt examines the entire statutory prohibition of the Maryland statute, it is readily apparent that the Maryland statute permits convictions not permitted under Code \u00a7 18.2-266.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">(Emphasis added). The trial court also declined to accept the DMV certification of Lowe\u2019s Maryland conviction as evidence that the specific prohibition of the Maryland statute substantially conformed to Code \u00a7 18.2-266, and held that the predicate offense was not established under Code \u00a7 46.2-351. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>\u25a0Whether the Maryland statute in question fails to conform to the relevant Virginia statutes is a matter of first impression. Maryland\u2019s drunk driving statute refers only to \u201cvehicles,\u201d unlike the Virginia statute, which specifically penalizes operation of <em>motor </em>vehicles by intoxicated persons. Code \u00a7 18.2-266 (\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to drive or operate any motor vehicle ... while such person is under the influence of alcohol.\u201d); <em>cf. </em>Md.Code Ann. \u00a7 21-902 (\u201cA person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while intoxicated.\u201d). According to the Maryland Code, \u201c Vehicle\u2019 means any device in, on, or by which any individual or property is or might be transported or towed on a highway.\u201d Md.Code Ann. \u00a7 11-176. In contrast, the Maryland Code defines \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as \u201ca vehicle that ... [i]s self-propelled or propelled by electric power obtained from overhead electrical wires.\u201d Md.Code Ann. \u00a7 11-135. The Maryland courts first recognized the significance of this statutory distinction in <em>Moon, </em>a civil case in which the Maryland Court of Appeals held that while a child\u2019s sled did not constitute a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d the sled nevertheless was a \u201cvehicle\u201d for the purpose of applying the state\u2019s traffic laws. <em>See Moon, </em>333 A.2d at 641-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Virginia law makes essentially the same distinction, however. Code \u00a7 46.2-100 provides definitions to be applied with respect to the motor vehicle laws. It defines \u201cvehicle\u201d as \u201cevery device in, on, or by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn on a highway, except devices moved by human power....\u201d \u201cMotor vehicle\u201d is defined as \u201cevery vehicle ... which is self-propelled or designed for self-propulsion____\u201d Thus, Virginia, as does Maryland, considers the category of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to be a subset of \u2018Vehicle,\u201d and this distinction has legal significance. <em>See, e.g., Welborn v. Wyatt, </em>175 Va. 163, 168, 7 S.E.2d 99, 101 (1940); Code \u00a7 46.2-341.4 (defining \u201ccommercial motor vehicle\u201d as \u201cevery motor vehicle, vehicle, or combination of vehicles used to transport passengers or property....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The critical difference between Virginia and Maryland law, then, is the fact that the Virginia drunk driving statute refers specifically to <em>motor </em>vehicles, whereas the Maryland statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>refers only to \u201cvehicles.\u201d Despite the opinion of the court below, and the argument Lowe made before that court, no Maryland case law addresses whether operation of a non-motor vehicle by an intoxicated person violates the state\u2019s drunk driving statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">In considering whether the plain meaning of Maryland Code \u00a7 21-902 might permit driving while intoxicated prosecutions of intoxicated persons found operating non-motor vehicles, in contrast to conduct prohibited by Code \u00a7 18.2-266, we are guided by our previous decisions in <em>Cox, </em>13 Va.App. 328, 411 S.E.2d 444, <em>Ayers, </em>17 Va.App. 401, 437 S.E.2d 580, and <em>Honaker, </em>19 Va.App. 682, 454 S.E.2d 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">In <em>Cox, </em>one of the predicate offenses for the appellant\u2019s adjudication as an habitual offender was a conviction under a local ordinance of Lewisburg, West Virginia. Although a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>portion of the ordinance was generally consistent with Code \u00a7 18.2-266 in its prohibition of driving while under the influence of alcohol, it contained additional subsections criminalizing conduct beyond the scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. <em>See Cox, </em>13 Va.App. at 331, 411 S.E.2d at 446; Lewisburg City Code \u00a7 18-85. We held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-5\">[i]f a conviction in another state is based on conduct which is not a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, then to consider it under Code \u00a7 46.2-351 would, without authority, expand the scope of the convictions which could be considered beyond that which the General Assembly specifically authorized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-6\"><em>Cox, </em>13 Va.App. at 331, 411 S.E.2d at 446. We stated that because the record before us in <em>Cox </em>failed to indicate which portion of the ordinance the appellant had violated, we were unable to determine that the West Virginia law under which the appellant had been convicted \u201csubstantially conformed\u201d to Code \u00a7 18.2-266; consequently, it could not stand as a predicate offense under Code \u00a7 46.2-351. <em>See id. </em>However, we cautioned that our holding did</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">not mean that another state\u2019s law regarding driving while under the influence of intoxicants or drugs must substantially conform <em>in every respect </em>to Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Only that portion of the other state\u2019s law under which the person was convicted must substantially conform.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Subsequently, in <em>Ayers, </em>we addressed the appellee\u2019s adjudication as an habitual offender based on three convictions under North Carolina law. Our focus in <em>Ayers </em>was on the North Carolina and Virginia statutes, which we found not to substantially conform on their face. We noted that while Code \u00a7 18.2-266 created a rebuttable presumption that a driver found to have a blood alcohol level (\u201cBAL\u201d) of .10% at the time he was tested had violated the statute, North Carolina\u2019s counterpart, N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-138.1(a)(2), created a conclusive presumption that one found to have BAL of .10% had violated the law. <em>See Ayers, </em>17 Va.App. at 404, 437 S.E.2d at 582. On that ground, we found the North Carolina <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>statute did not substantially conform to Virginia law and that the appellee\u2019s conviction under North Carolina law could not serve as a predicate offense for adjudication as an habitual offender under Code \u00a7 46.2-351.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Finally, in <em>Honaker, </em>we again addressed the conviction of an appellant under West Virginia law in determining whether that conviction could serve to support an habitual offender adjudication. We distinguished <em>Honaker </em>from the facts of <em>Cox, </em>noting that <em>Honaker </em>concerned the appellant\u2019s conviction under W.Va.Code \u00a7 17C-5-2 for \u201cdriving] and operating] a motor vehicle upon a public highway [of] West Virginia while under the influence of alcohol.... \u201d 19 Va.App. at 685, 454 S.E.2d at 31. We noted that, unlike <em>Cox, </em>the record disclosed the specific prohibition under West Virginia law upon which the appellant was convicted, viz. driving and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. We held that the provision of the West Virginia statute under which the appellant had been convicted substantially conformed to Code \u00a7 18.2-266, and therefore it could stand as a predicate offense for an habitual offender adjudication under Code \u00a7 46.2-351. <em>See id. </em>at 685-86, 454 S.E.2d at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Turning to the facts of the present case, we find that Maryland\u2019s statutory law prohibiting driving while intoxicated, as narrowed by the Driver License Compact (\u201cCompact\u201d) which both Maryland and Virginia have adopted, substantially conforms with Code \u00a7 18.2-266. <em>See Tharpe v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 37, 43, 441 S.E.2d 228, 232 (1994) (\u201c \u2018Two statutes which are closely interrelated must be read and construed together and effect given to all of their provisions. They should be construed, if possible, so as to harmonize, and force and effect should be given the provisions of each.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>ACB Trucking, Inc. v. Griffin, </em>5 Va.App. 542, 547-48, 365 S.E.2d 334, 337-38 (1988) (citation omitted))); <em>Nelson v. County of Henrico, </em>10 Va.App. 558, 561, 393 S.E.2d 644, 646 (1990) (\u201cStatutes must be construed consistently with each other and so as to reasonably and logically effectuate their intended purpose.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>The Compact is codified at Code \u00a7 46.2-483, <em>et seq., </em>and at Maryland Code Ann. \u00a7 16-703. The State of Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia have agreed to the terms of the Compact and have incorporated those terms verbatim into their respective bodies of statutory law. Article III of the Compact provides that foreign drunk driving convictions are to be reported to the home state of the person convicted. Article II defines \u201cconviction\u201d as \u201cconviction of any offense related to the use or operation of a <em>motor </em>vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added). The language of the Compact is identical in the codes of the two states. <em>See </em>Maryland Code Ann. \u00a7 16-703; Va.Code. \u00a7 46.2-483, <em>et seq. </em>Thus, any conviction reported from Maryland to DMV must, of necessity, be limited to motor vehicle use while intoxicated, in compliance with Articles II and III of the Compact. We therefore hold that the Maryland statutes governing the offense of driving while intoxicated substantially conform to Virginia law for the purposes of Code \u00a7 46.2-351.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The decision of the trial court is, accordingly, reversed, and this case is remanded for proper and appropriate proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\">. Repealed by Acts of Assembly 1999, cc. 945, 987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b850-8\">. Without the Maryland offense, Lowe did not have three or more drunk driving convictions within a ten-year period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\">. We agree with the Commonwealth that the Maryland case law cited by the trial court does not stand for the propositions claimed by the court. Neither <em>Richards </em>nor <em>Moon </em>is on point, and neither bears upon whether the Maryland drunk driving statute fails to substantially conform to the Virginia statute. Those two cases merely stand for the proposition that such non-motor vehicles as bicycles and sleds nevertheless are \"vehicles\u201d when operated on Maryland roads, just as such devices become vehicles when operated upon Virginia highways, pursuant to the definition in Code \u00a7 46.2-100. The court stated that <em>Richards </em>applied the Maryland drunk driving statute \"to sanction the operation of a child's sled while [the operator was] intoxicated.\u201d However, <em>Richards </em>was a civil tort case involving neither a sled nor a drunk driver; rather, the case concerned a child on a bicycle injured by the sober driver of an automobile. The Maryland court held that because a bicycle was a \"vehicle\u201d within the meaning of Maryland Code, Art. 66 1/2, \u00a7 11-404, the child was contributorily negligent as the driver of a \"vehicle\u201d who failed to yield the right-of-way to on-coming traffic. <em>See Richards, </em>338 A.2d at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">The Commonwealth claims the court cited <em>Moon </em>for a similar proposition. The only Maryland case cited in the trial court\u2019s opinion is <em>Richards, </em>however. Insofar as <em>Moon </em>may assist in the determination of this appeal, <em>Moon </em>also did not involve a drunk driving conviction. Eike <em>Richards, </em>it was a civil tort action concerning a child riding a sled on an icy street who was struck by an automobile. As in <em>Richards, </em>the court in <em>Moon </em>found that the child was the operator of a \u201cvehicle\u201d on a public street, and consequently was subject to consideration of contributory negligence in her collision with the automobile for her failure to yield the right-of-way. <em>See </em>333 A.2d at 641 \u2014 43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b855-7\">. Because we decide the issue on appeal on this ground, we need not reach the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the trial judge erred in declining to find that the certified transcript of Lowe\u2019s driving record presumptively established the predicate offenses, including the Maryland offense. <em>See generally Dicker v. Commonwealth, 22 </em>Va.App. 658, 661, 472 S.E.2d 655, 657 (1996) (Commonwealth establishes a <em>prima facie </em>presumption that driver's adjudication as habitual offender was valid by introducing certified DMV transcript indicating three or more drunk driving convictions within ten-year period); Code \u00a7 46.2-352.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
