On appeal, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions. A panel of this Court found the evidence sufficient to support the felony but reversed the misdemeanor conviction. <em>See DeAmicis v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 751, 514 S.E.2d 788 (1999). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc, </em>and \u201cthe appeal [was] reinstated on the docket of this Court.\u201d Upon such rehearing, we affirm both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider the record \u201c\u2018in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. In so doing, we must discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth____\u2019\u201d <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 335, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998) (citation omitted). The credibility of the witnesses, the weight accorded testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters to be determined by the fact finder. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). \u201cWhen weighing the evidence, the fact finder is not required to accept entirely the Commonwealth\u2019s or defendant\u2019s account of the facts,\u201d but \u201cmay reject that which it finds implausible, [and] accept other parts which it finds to be believable.\u201d <em>Pugliese v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 82, 92, 428 S.E.2d 16, 24 (1993). The judgment of the trial court, finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, will not be set aside unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">In November, 1996, V.S.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was experiencing difficulties with her daughter, E.A., then 16. The teenager \u201cwas having problems\u201d with \u201canxiety attacks,\u201d school attendance, drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>and \u201csexual promiscuity,\u201d and had attempted suicide. Previous counseling had not been helpful, and V.S., acting on the advice of a friend, contacted defendant, a reputed \u201cpsychologist.\u201d Defendant assured V.S. that \u201che was licensed, had been to school,\u201d and, after a brief conversation, agreed to be \u201c[E.A.\u2019s] counselor, ... her psychologist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">V.S. immediately brought E.A. to defendant\u2019s home for an initial conference, but E.A. \u201cinstantly realized that she was there for counseling[,] ... made a scene\u201d and vowed that she \u201cwas not coming back.\u201d \u201c[D]istraught,\u201d V.S. ended the meeting and, later, telephoned defendant for further guidance. During their conversation, defendant commented that he found E.A. \u201cvery bright, very intelligent[,] ... a beautiful child[,] ... a gorgeous child,\u201d and suggested that he \u201ctake and counsel her through modeling, ... then she would not realize that she was being counseled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">After a few days, V.S. and E.A. returned to defendant\u2019s residence, V.S. intending to pursue defendant\u2019s novel approach to counseling E.A. Defendant advised V.S. that \u201c[h]e wanted complete control of [E.A.]---- [V.S.] was never to question [E.A.] ... as to their sessions, that if [she] had any questions, [she] was to go to him, that he needed [E.A.\u2019s] complete confidence in him ... [s]o that he could counsel her and try to help her through this time in her life.\u201d Defendant proposed that the counseling services be without charge, provided he was reimbursed photography expenses and received a percentage of E.A.\u2019s anticipated earnings as a model. V.S. accepted defendant\u2019s terms, and the two agreed that defendant and E.A. would regularly meet, alone, in V.S.\u2019s home, beginning in late 1996. At defendant\u2019s suggestion, V.S. subsequently removed E.A. from public school and undertook home schooling.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">During the ensuing months, V.S. spoke with defendant following each session with E.A. and was assured that E.A. \u201cwas doing wonderful.\u201d When V.S. voiced concern to defendant that E.A. \u201cwas staying in bed,\u201d neglecting her \u201chome study course,\u201d \u201cnot going out, ... wasn\u2019t going anywhere\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u201cgetting progressively worse in her depression,\u201d he \u201ckind of brushed [these issues] off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">E.A. testified that she first believed that defendant was \u201cjust a photographer\u201d but later learned, \u201cwhile he was taking pictures,\u201d that he was also her counselor. She acknowledged that she \u201cwas in a rough state at the time\u201d and agreed to participate in the arrangement with defendant only after V.S. \u201cpushed it on [her].\u201d E.A. recalled that defendant selected and arranged her clothing and pose for each photograph and promised that the \u201cangle\u201d would reveal no nudity. When E.A. asked \u201cwhy he took so many slutty shots,\u201d defendant answered, \u201csex sells.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In the Spring of 1997, E.A. \u201cdisappeared\u201d for several days, and, on the floor of her room, V.S. discovered numerous photographs of E.A, which depicted her sexual and genital areas, inside a \u201cnotebook\u201d that belonged to defendant. V.S. immediately terminated all contact between defendant and E.A. and notified local police of her findings. During the resulting investigation, defendant admitted that he had taken photographs of E.A. which revealed her sexual and genital parts. Meanwhile, E.A. returned to public school and soon evidenced much improved academic performance, motivation, emotional stability, and otherwise positive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Defendant testified that his relationship with V.S. and E.A. began when V.S. contacted him and described E.A.\u2019s \u201cproblems.\u201d During their initial meeting, he \u201cascertained that [E.A.] was interested in modeling,\u201d and advised V.S., \u201cI do photography work.\u201d Defendant admitted that he subsequently agreed to prepare a photographic \u201cportfolio\u201d of E.A. to advance her modeling career, but denied any attendant counseling responsibilities. He first denied photographing E.A.\u2019s sexual or genital parts, but, during cross-examination, identified several photos of E.A., taken by him, which depicted her exposed breasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Defendant first argues that the evidence failed to establish the existence of a custodial or supervisory relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ship between E.A. and himself, an indispensable element to a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 provides, in pertinent part, that [a]ny person eighteen years of age or older who maintains a custodial or supervisory relationship over a child under the age of eighteen, including but not limited to the parent, step-parent, grandparent, step-grandparent, or who stands in loco parentis with respect to such child and is not legally married to such child, and who, with lascivious intent, knowingly and intentionally ... (iv) proposes that any such child expose his or her sexual or genital parts to such person ... shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u201c[T]he Supreme Court has rejected limiting the definition of \u2018custody\u2019 to legal custody,\u201d \u201cdefined generally as \u2018[t]he care and control of a thing or person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Krampen v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 163, 167-68, 510 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1999) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>384 (6th ed.1990)); <em>see Lovisi v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 848, 850, 188 S.E.2d 206, 208 (1972). Thus, the \u201ccustodial or supervisory relationship\u201d contemplated by the statute \u201cis not limited to those situations where legal custody exists.\u201d <em>Krampen, </em>29 Va.App. at 168, 510 S.E.2d at 278. \u201cThe term also includes those individuals eighteen years or older who have a temporary, custodial relationship with a child, such as, \u2018teachers, athletic instructors and baby-sitters.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lovisi, </em>212 Va. at 850, 188 S.E.2d at 208).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Here, the evidence clearly established that V.S. entrusted E.A. to the care, custody, and control of defendant for purposes of professional counseling. At defendant\u2019s suggestion, V.S. agreed to the photography and modeling ruse to gain E.A.\u2019s cooperation in the professional care promised by defendant. Defendant demanded \u201ccomplete control\u201d of E.A., free from question or interference from V.S. During sessions with E.A., he was alone with the child and directed the style and arrangement of her clothing, the pose and setting for each photograph. Both V.S. and E.A. submitted themselves to defendant\u2019s direction until V.S. discovered his misdeeds. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>circumstances clearly created a temporary custodial relationship between defendant and E.A. for the duration of each session, submitting E.A. to defendant\u2019s control within the purview of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Defendant next contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove conduct that \u201ccaused [E.A.] to be in need of services,\u201d one of several disjunctive elements enumerated in Code \u00a7 18.2-371, all of which were charged in the subject indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-371 provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">[a]ny person eighteen years of age or older, including the parent of any child, who (i) willfully contributes to, encourages, or causes any act, omission, or condition which renders a child delinquent, in need of services, or abused and neglected as defined in \u00a7 16.1-228, ... shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-371. Code \u00a7 16.1-228 defines a \u201cchild in need of services\u201d as \u201ca child whose behavior, conduct or condition presents or results in a serious threat to the well-being and physical safety of the child.\u201d The statute further provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1K\">[hjowever, to find that a child falls within these provisions, (i) the conduct complained of must present a clear and substantial danger to the child\u2019s life or health or (ii) the child or his family is in need of treatment, rehabilitation or services not presently being received, and (iii) the intervention of the court is essential to provide the treatment, rehabilitation or services needed by the child or his family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6R\">Code \u00a7 16.1-228.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">Defendant, therefore, posits that conviction for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-371 arising from a child \u201cin need of services\u201d requires a showing that \u201cintervention of the court\u201d is \u201cessential\u201d to the remedy. We need not address this argument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>however, because Code \u00a7 18.2-371 also proscribes conduct \u201cwhich renders a child ... <em>abused and neglected </em>... as defined in Code \u00a7 16.1-228,\u201d an alternate circumstance specifically alleged in the indictment. Code \u00a7 18.2-371 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-228 defines an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d as, <em>inter alia,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfP\">any child:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">1. Whose parents or other person responsible for his care creates or inflicts, threatens to create or inflict, or allows to be created or inflicted upon such child a physical or mental injury by other than accidental means, or creates a substantial risk of death, disfigurement or impairment of bodily or mental functions; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Code \u00a7 16.1-228. Defendant\u2019s felonious conduct with respect to the child clearly \u201ccreate[d]\u201d or \u201cinflict[ed], [or] threaten[ed] to create or inflict ... upon such child a ... mental injury by other than accidental means,\u201d behavior constituting abuse and neglect contemplated by definition of Code \u00a7 16.1-228 and, therefore, violative of Code \u00a7 18.2-371.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Accordingly, the record sufficiently supported convictions for violations of both Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 and -371, and we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-9\">. To avoid unnecessary embarrassment to the victim and her mother, we use pseudonyms for each.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-11\">. The Commonwealth addressed only this issue both before the original panel and <em>en banc.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b487-12\">. After reciting that defendant was \"tried\u201d upon an indictment charging that he \"did unlawfully contribute to, encourage, or cause an act, omission or condition which rendered a minor female child in need of services, <em>abused or </em>neglected,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-371, the subject conviction order \"finds ... defendant guilty\u201d of the alleged offense, without further particularizing the underlying conduct. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b487-10\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A2\">concurring, in part and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">I concur in Part I of the majority opinion and would affirm the conviction for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1. I do not join in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Part II and, for the reasons that follow, I would reverse the conviction for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-371.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The indictment charged that \u201cMichael Joseph DeAmicis, an adult, did unlawfully contribute to, encourage, or cause an act, omission, or condition which rendered a minor female child in need of services, abused, or neglected [in violation of] ... Code \u00a7 18.2-371.\u201d At trial, the prosecutor argued that the evidence proved that the teenage child was rendered in need of services by DeAmicis\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">For the reasons more fully stated in the panel\u2019s opinion, <em>see DeAmicis v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 751, 757-58, 514 S.E.2d 788, 791-92 (1999), I would hold that the evidence failed to prove the teenage child was rendered in need of services. Furthermore, no evidence established that she suffered from a mental injury or any other injury from DeAmicis\u2019 conduct. As the majority notes, before the teenage child met DeAmicis, she.\u201c\u2018was having problems\u2019 with \u2018anxiety attacks,\u2019 school attendance, drugs, \u2018sexual promiscuity,\u2019 and had attempted suicide.\u201d She had also unsuccessfully participated in other counseling sessions. Although DeAmicis violated Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 while photographing the teenage child, no evidence proved the child was rendered in need of services or suffered injuries by his conduct. Rather, the evidence proved that after her \u201ccounseling\u201d with DeAmicis she \u201creturned to public school and soon evidenced much improved academic performance, motivation, ambition, and otherwise constructive behavior.\u201d On this record, the evidence failed to prove the violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-371 alleged by the Commonwealth.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
