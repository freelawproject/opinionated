On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erroneously \u201cdetermined that [his] degree of intoxication by blood alcohol demonstrate^] ... additional conduct so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life\u201d within the intendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(B). Finding no error, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">To convict for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(B), the Commonwealth must prove, <em>inter alia, </em>conduct by an accused \u201cso gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life[.]\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such conduct \u201chas come to be known as \u2018criminal negligence\u2019 \u201d in the context of common law vehicular involuntary manslaughter and requires \u201c \u2018acts of commission or omission of a wanton or willful nature, showing a reckless or indifferent disregard of the rights of others, under circumstances reasonably calculated to produce injury ... and the offender knows or is charged with the knowledge of, the probable results of his acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Keech v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 272, 277, 279, 386 S.E.2d 813, 816, 817 (1989) (emphasis omitted) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Defendant argued before the trial court that intoxication alone was insufficient to evince the \u201cgross, wanton and culpable\u201d conduct necessary to establish aggravated involuntary manslaughter in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(B). While acknowledging that evidence of an \u201calcohol level such that ... impairment] ... was just so gross and had affected motor skills in such a way that [an accused] was driving nearly comatose ... might have some bearing\u201d on aggravation, defendant maintained that, before \u201cintoxication can go to the issue of wantonness and recklessness,\u201d \u201cthe Commonwealth would ... have to show the particular effect on a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>individual,\u201d proof which he found wanting on the instant record. Thus, defendant\u2019s argument, both at trial and on appeal, presumes that the level of intoxication was the only aggravating circumstance in evidence to support the convictions, an assertion belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, \u201c Sve review the [record] in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he decision of a trial court sitting without a jury is afforded the same weight as a jury\u2019s verdict and will not be disturbed unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 102, 113, 510 S.E.2d 247, 252 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Here, the testimony of Michael and Jacqueline Dupuis established that the fatal accident occurred on a \u201cdark,\u201d \u201cwide,\u201d \u201ctwo lane\u201d rural road at \u201capproximately 8:00 [p.m.]\u201d on a winter evening. Mr. Dupuis was driving the couple home when \u201call of a sudden\u201d the headlights of a vehicle operated by defendant \u201cturned on instantly,\u201d just ahead and \u201c[a]ll the way\u201d in the Dupuis traffic lane. Within \u201ca split second,\u201d the vehicles collided, resulting in the death of two passengers traveling with defendant. Physical evidence at the accident scene confirmed that the \u201cimpact\u201d had occurred in the Dupuis lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In a post-arrest interview with Trooper J.E. Ganghom, defendant admitted \u201cdriving around drinking beer mostly,\u201d \u201cjust riding around racing,\u201d \u201call over the place,\u201d for several hours prior to the accident. Defendant recalled, with laughter, consuming \u201cright much\u201d beer, \u201clost count\u201d of the quantity, and was unsure \u201cif [he] was on [Dupuis\u2019] side of the road\u201d at the time of the collision. Incidental to his investigation of the offenses, the trooper counted \u201c[a]t least 30 beer bottles and cans\u201d in defendant\u2019s vehicle, \u201cmost of them ... empty.\u201d Hospital tests conducted immediately following the accident fixed defendant\u2019s blood alcohol concentration at .23%, a level which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>a physician witness opined \u201cwould impair a lot of motor activities or capabilities of reflex actions, visual identification and other ... of our activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In convicting defendant, the trial judge commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">I find the evidence sufficient in each of these cases to find him guilty of aggravated involuntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">We have a man that\u2019s clearly, clearly intoxicated, heavily intoxicated. He\u2019s on the wrong side of the road. I mean, it\u2019s simple. He\u2019s driving down the road and he\u2019s \u2014 the road curves and he didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s really what this is about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">And I heard the testimony of Mr. Dupuis. He said this is an open area and the pictures indicate that. And it was dark, there were no lights, and all of a sudden there are lights right in front of him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Both operating a vehicle on the wrong side of the roadway, <em>see Zirkle v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 862, 55 S.E.2d 24 (1949), and without headlights after dark, <em>see Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>170 Va. 597, 195 S.E. 675 (1938), are acts sufficient to support a conviction for common law vehicular involuntary manslaughter. Manifestly, willfully engaging simultaneously in such gross, wanton and culpable conduct, after prolonged and excessive consumption of alcohol had substantially impaired both motor and intellectual functions, would evince a mindset indifferent to the safety of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Thus, the several acts of egregious misconduct established by the instant record combined to clearly aggregate the requisite gross, wanton and culpable behavior reflective of that reckless disregard for human life contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(B). Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">A. Any person who, as a result of driving under the influence in violation of subdivision (ii), (iii), or (iv) of \u00a7 18.2-266, unintentionally causes the death of another person, shall be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">B. If, in addition, the conduct of the defendant was so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life, he shall be guilty of aggravated involuntary manslaughter....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
