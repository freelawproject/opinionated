On appeal, he contends (1) the trial court\u2019s admission of the custodial confession of a non-testifying accomplice violated the Confrontation Clause and Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule and (2) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because it did not establish he was a principal in the second degree. We hold that the accomplice\u2019s custodial confession was admissible under Virgi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>nia hearsay law but inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause and that its erroneous admission was not harmless. Therefore, we reverse appellant\u2019s convictions without reaching the sufficiency issue, and we remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">On March 22, 1998, four teenagers \u2014 Shaun Roberts, Ken Jones, Jesse Harrod and appellant \u2014 rode together in Roberts\u2019 car from Williamsburg to Hampton to visit Gwendolyn Williams and her friend, Christine Johnson, at Williams\u2019 apartment. Jones, Harrod and Johnson began to argue, and Jones threatened Johnson. About that time, three older boys from Williams\u2019 neighborhood came to Williams\u2019 apartment. Roberts and appellant thought Johnson had called the older boys over to fight Roberts and his friends, but they were able to leave without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Roberts, Jones, Harrod and appellant returned to Williams-burg, where Jones retrieved a \u201cbig gun\u201d from his house. About 10:00 p.m. that same night, they returned to Williams\u2019 apartment complex. Roberts was driving, appellant was sitting in the front passenger seat, Harrod was behind appellant, and Jones was behind the driver. Williams, Johnson and one of the older boys were standing outside Williams\u2019 apartment. Jones fired, hitting Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Appellant was indicted for malicious wounding and the related use of a firearm and was tried jointly with Shaun Roberts in a bench trial. The Commonwealth sought to introduce the out-of-court custodial confession of accomplice Ken Jones, the shooter,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Appellant argued that the confession was hearsay and that its admission would violate his right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>confrontation. The trial court ruled that Jones\u2019 statement was a declaration against interest and admitted it into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The statements admitted were verbal and written statements Jones made to Detective Gillis. Gillis went to Jones\u2019 high school, took Jones into custody, read Jones his <em>Miranda </em>rights and took his statement. Jones initially denied any involvement in the crime but subsequently admitted his involvement and told Gillis where to find the gun. Jones said, \u201c[tjhere was an argument [at Williams\u2019 apartment] between the girls and them, and ... the girls had called an unknown male over to the apartment.\u201d Then a group of boys gathered and \u201cstarted acting like they was going to fight [Jones and his friends].\u201d Jones said they were able to leave without incident, but they were \u201cmad and [Roberts] wanted to go[ ] back to see [what] was up but not without a gun.\u201d They returned to Williamsburg where Jones retrieved his .22 rifle, and they went back to the area of Williams\u2019 apartment. They found \u201ca lot of people ... waitfing] for [them],\u201d including \u201cthe same black male ... they had [an] earlier altercation with.\u201d People were yelling at them and moving toward the car but the car was too far away for them to reach it. \u201cAs [Roberts] turned around the car and started to leave ... the parking lot, ... everybody in the car was yelling for him to shoot, so he fired ... to scare them.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jones said he did not see anyone, did not aim and shot upward.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The Commonwealth subsequently offered statements appellant and codefendant Roberts made to police. Appellant posed no objection to the trial court\u2019s considering either statement as substantive evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Appellant made two statements to Detective Payne.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant told Payne</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>that he was with the other people that were charged in this matter, that basically his only involvement with this was that he, in fact, rode in the vehicle, that he didn\u2019t actively participate in these things_____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">* * * . * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">He indicated that the group of the four individuals did in fact go to that apartment earlier in the day, that there was a[n] altercation there between the girls and them, and that they had left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">Prior to going back, ... [Roberts] said that he didn\u2019t want to go back without a gun, and ... they drove up to James City County where [Jones] had gotten his gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">And ... at that particular point in time he wanted to get out, [he said take me home,] he didn\u2019t want to go back, but did go back with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">[T]hey went into the parking lot and ... the gentleman was standing outside, and as they turned the vehicle around and as they exited the parking lot ... [Jones] did in fact fire one shot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Roberts also made a statement to Detective Payne.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Roberts told Payne in detail about the repeated trips to Williams\u2019 home, Johnson\u2019s becoming angry, and the arrival of older boys he thought Johnson had called to fight Roberts and his companions. Roberts said that when they left Williams\u2019 house, appellant said they could get some beer in Williams-burg, so Roberts drove back to Williamsburg, believing they were going home anyway. When they arrived in Williams-burg, it was still early, and they went back to Williams\u2019 house. When they arrived, \u201cthe boy from earlier was standing outside and he started signaling for other boys to come. [Appellant] said come on lets [sic] go and I hurried up and turned around and we were leaving. I heard the gun shot behind us.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Roberts confirmed that Jones was the person who fired the shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Appellant did not testify, but Roberts took the stand in his own behalf. Roberts testified about the\" repeated trips to Williams\u2019 apartment to see her. Roberts denied returning to Williamsburg to get a gun and said he did not know Jones had a gun until they were on their way back to Hampton. He gave no testimony regarding appellant\u2019s involvement or lack of involvement in the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The trial court convicted appellant of the charged offenses. Codefendant Roberts also was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">VIRGINIA\u2019S HEARSAY RULE: STATEMENT AGAINST PENAL INTEREST EXCEPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">The admissibility of a statement made by an unavailable witness that is against his or her penal interest \u201cis a \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 exception to the hearsay rule in Virginia.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>Lilly v.

Under this exception, an out-of-court statement is admissible to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein if three requirements are met: (1) the declarant is unavailable to testify at trial; (2) the statement is against the declarant\u2019s interest at the time it was made; and (3) the declarant is subjectively aware at the time the statement is made that it is against his or her interest to make it. <em>See Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 573, 499 S.E.2d at 533; <em>Randolph v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 345, 355, 482 S.E.2d 101, 105-06 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"AsFI\">In addition, the record must contain evidence other than the declaration itself establishing its reliability, such as independent evidence connecting the declarant with the confessed crime. <em>See Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 573-74, 499 S.E.2d at 533-34; <em>Randolph, </em>24 Va.App. at 355-56, 482 S.E.2d at 106. Such evidence may include testimony from other witnesses, physical evidence, and the similarities or \u201ccorrespondence between [the declarant\u2019s] account and the accounts of other persons acquired by law enforcement authorities.\u201d <em>Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 574, 499 S.E.2d at 534. It may also include evidence of the declarant\u2019s demeanor and the circumstances surrounding the giving of the statement, including those indicating the voluntariness of the confession. <em>See Raia v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 546, 551, 478 S.E.2d 328, 330 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">That the declarant\u2019s statements are simultaneously against penal interest and \u201cself-serving, in that they tend[ ] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>shift principal responsibility to others or to offer claims of mitigating circumstances, goes to the weight the [fact finder] [may] assign to them and not to their admissibility.\u201d <em>Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 574, 499 S.E.2d at 534. Determining whether a statement against penal interest is reliable \u201clies within \u2018the sound discretion of the trial court, to be determined upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Raia, </em>23 Va.App. at 550, 478 S.E.2d at 330 (quoting <em>Ellison v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 404, 408, 247 S.E.2d 685, 688 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Jones\u2019 hearsay statements to Detective Gillis satisfied the three-pronged test and, therefore, were directly admissible against appellant under the statement against penal interest exception to Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule. Under the first prong, the record indicates Jones was unavailable as a witness because he asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. <em>See Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 573, 499 S.E.2d at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Under the second prong, Jones\u2019 statement was against his interest because he admitted firing the shot that struck the victim and admitted that he intended to fire the shot, although he denied aiming or intending to hurt anyone. By making this statement, Jones subjected himself to criminal liability for a variety of possible offenses, including malicious wounding and discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Under the third prong, the record supports the conclusion that Jones was aware his statements were against his interest at the time he made them. Detective Gillis took Jones, a high school student, into custody and read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which included information that anything Jones said could be used against him. <em>See, e.g., Penn v. Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 242, 250, 169 S.E.2d 427, 433 (1969). After saying he understood his rights and denying any involvement in the crime, Jones then admitted that the gun was his, was still in his possession and that he was the person who fired the shot that wounded the victim. This evidence was sufficient to establish Jones\u2019 subjective awareness that the statements were against his penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Finally, other evidence connected Jones to the confessed crime, supporting the conclusion that the statement as a whole was reliable enough to be admitted. Johnson saw \u201cfire\u201d come from the car window where Jones was sitting, and both appellant and Roberts confirmed that Jones was the person who fired the shot. The absence of evidence corroborating Jones\u2019 statement that \u201ceverybody\u201d in the car encouraged him to shoot is not dispositive of the statement\u2019s admissibility. The self-serving nature of this portion of the statement \u201cgoes to the weight the [fact finder] [may] assign to [it] and not to [its] admissibility.\u201d <em>Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 574, 499 S.E.2d at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">For these reasons, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding the statement was admissible under the Virginia hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">CONFRONTATION CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which applies to the States, provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VI; see <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 62-63, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). The right to confront witnesses secured by the Sixth Amendment encompasses the right to cross-examine them. <em>See Cruz v. New York, </em>481 U.S. 186, 107 S.Ct. 1714, 95 L.Ed.2d 162 (1987); <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 1076, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965). The right to confront and to cross-examine witnesses is a \u201cfunctional right\u201d that \u201cadvance[s] the pursuit of truth\u201d and \u201cpromotes reliability\u201d in criminal trials by \u201censuring that convictions will not be based on the charges of unseen and unknown \u2014 and hence unchallengeable \u2014 individuals.\u201d <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 540, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2062, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Under the Confrontation Clause, a hearsay statement of an unavailable declarant is admissible \u201conly if it bears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>adequate \u2018indicia of reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2589. The United States Supreme Court consistently has held, for Confrontation Clause purposes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANj\">that the veracity of hearsay statements is sufficiently dependable to allow the untested admission of such statements against an accused when (1) \u201cthe evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or (2) it contains \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d such that adversarial testing would be expected to add little, if anything, to the statements\u2019 reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116,\u2014, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 1894, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999) (plurality opinion) (quoting <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539). Although a hearsay statement that is against the penal interest of the declarant is recognized as a \u201cfirmly rooted exception\u201d to the hearsay rule in Virginia,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>see Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 575, 499 S.E.2d at 534; <em>Raia, </em>23 Va.App. at 552, 478 S.E.2d at 331, the United States Supreme Court has expressly refused to analyze \u201ca confession by an accomplice which incriminates a criminal defendant\u201d as a declaration against penal interest for the purpose of determining the admissibility of such hearsay under the Confrontation Clause, <em>see Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 544 n. 5, 106 S.Ct. at 2064 n. 5. In <em>Lee, </em>the Supreme Court stated that the category of \u201cdeclarations against penal interest\u201d is \u201ctoo large a class for meaningful Confrontation Clause analysis\u201d and held that \u201ca confession by an accomplice which incriminates a criminal defendant\u201d should be considered a distinct category of hearsay for the purpose of determining its admissibility under the Sixth Amendment. <em>See id. </em>More recently, in <em>Lilly, </em>seven justices voiced their continuing adherence to <em>Lee\u2019s </em>categorization of such confessions. <em>See </em>527 U.S. at \u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1895 (plurality opinion); 527 U.S. at\u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1904 (Rehnquist, C.J., joined by O\u2019Connor and Kennedy, JJ., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">The Court stated in <em>Lee </em>that, unlike hearsay statements that fall under firmly rooted hearsay exceptions, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>presumably include statements against penal interest made in other contexts, accomplices\u2019 confessions that incriminate defendants are \u201cpresumptively unreliable\u201d under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. 476 U.S. at 541, 106 S.Ct. at 2062. The Court also stated in <em>Lee, </em>and reiterated in <em>Lilly, </em>that the presumption of unreliability that attaches to accomplices\u2019 confessions that incriminate defendants may be rebutted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 543, 106 S.Ct. at 2063; <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at \u2014 n. 5, \u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1899 n. 5, 1900 (plurality opinion); 527 U.S. at\u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1903 (Thomas, J., concurring); 527 U.S. at\u2014-\u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1904-05 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring). A hearsay statement that falls into this category may \u201cmeet Confrontation Clause reliability standards if it is supported by a \u2018showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019\u201d <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 543, 106 S.Ct. at 2063; <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at\u2014,\u2014-\u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1894, 1899-1901 (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at\u2014-\u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1905-06 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>The Court previously has recognized that whether the portions of an accomplice\u2019s confession regarding a defendant\u2019s participation in a crime are sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible without cross-examination under the Sixth Amendment is determined by considering (1) the circumstances surrounding the accomplice\u2019s confession and (2) in a case in which the defendant also made a confession, the extent to which the accomplice\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s confessions \u201cinterlock.\u201d <em>See Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 544-46, 106 S.Ct. at 2064-65; <em>Cruz, </em>481 U.S. at 193-94, 107 S.Ct. at 1719. The Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Lilly </em>does not indicate a rejection of the interlock theory. A majority in <em>Lilly </em>presumably concluded that the accomplice\u2019s custodial confession did not bear sufficient indicia of reliability to be admissible against Lilly without cross-examination but did not conclude that such statements are never admissible. <em>See Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at \u2014-\u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1899-1901 (plurality opinion); 527 U.S. at \u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1903 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (holding that admission of confession was \u201cparadigmatic Confrontation Clause violation\u201d without discussing bases for independent admission such as indicia of reliability). Further, the Court did not have occasion to consider the impact of the interlocking nature of the defendant\u2019s and accomplice\u2019s confessions in <em>Lilly </em>because the defendant\u2019s confession was directly at odds with the challenged confession of his accomplice. <em>See Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at \u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1892. The accomplice reported to police that the defendant murdered the victim and masterminded the related carjacking and several robberies. <em>See id. </em>The defendant, by contrast, reported that the accomplice and a third person forced him to participate in the robberies, and he did not mention the murder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>When evaluating the circumstances surrounding the confession, a court should consider the extent to which the accomplice was \u201cfree from any desire, motive, or impulse ... either to mitigate the appearance of his own culpability by spreading the blame [to the defendant] or to overstate [the defendant\u2019s] involvement in retaliation for her having implicated him in the [crime].\u201d <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 544, 106 S.Ct. at 2064. When evaluating the interlocking nature of the accomplice\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s confessions, a court should consider the extent to which those portions of the accomplice\u2019s confession <em>regarding the defendant\u2019s participation in the crime </em>are substantiated by the defendant\u2019s own confession. <em>See id. </em>at 545, 106 S.Ct. at 2064. When the discrepancies between the statements are \u201cnot insignificant,\u201d the accomplice\u2019s out-of-court confession is inadmissible under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id.; \u2018 see Cruz, </em>481 U.S. at 192-93, 107 S.Ct. at 1718-19 (holding that tightly interlocking nature of confessions establishes reliability, for if codefendant\u2019s confession \u201cconfirms essentially the same facts as the defendant\u2019s own confession it is more likely to be true\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">A majority of the Court has expressly held that two factors are irrelevant to the inquiry of whether an accomplice\u2019s confession that incriminates a defendant is admissible under the Sixth Amendment: (1) \u201cwhether the [accomplice\u2019s] confession was found to be voluntary for Fifth Amendment pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>poses,\u201d <em>see Lee, 476 </em>U.S. at 544, 106 S.Ct. at 2064 (stating that \u201csuch a finding does not bear on the [Sixth Amendment] question\u201d), and (2) whether the other evidence at trial (except for the defendant\u2019s own confession) tends to corroborate the truth of the accomplice\u2019s statement, <em>see Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 822-23, 110 S.Ct. at 3150 (stating that such corroboration is \u201cno substitute for cross-examination of the declarant at trial\u201d and would \u201cpermit admission of a presumptively unreliable statement by bootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial\u201d). Instead, as with all hearsay statements that are deemed admissible under the Confrontation Clause, the portion of the accomplice\u2019s confession incriminating the defendant \u201cmust possess indicia of reliability by virtue of its <em>inherent trustworthiness\u201d </em>such that adversarial testing would add little to its reliability. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). \u201c[T]he \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 required for admission under the Confrontation Clause must ... be drawn from the totality of circumstances that surround the making of the statement and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 820, 110 S.Ct. at 3149.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Here, Jones admitted in his statement that he fired the shot that wounded the victim but contended he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>intend to hurt anyone. Although appellant\u2019s and Jones\u2019 statements interlock in many respects, including the identities of those present in Roberts\u2019 car and their identification of Jones as the shooter, at least one significant discrepancy exists <em>regarding appellant\u2019s participation in the crime. </em>Appellant said in his statement that he was merely present in the car during the shooting and that \u201che didn\u2019t actively participate in these things.\u201d Jones, by contrast, said that \u201ceverybody\u201d in the car verbally encouraged him to \u201cshoot up in the air\u201d as Roberts\u2019 car left the victim\u2019s neighborhood. This portion of Jones\u2019 statement constitutes a classic attempt of one defendant to shift to others,at least some of the blame for his actions. As a result, Jones\u2019 custodial confession did not bear sufficient indicia of reliability to be directly admissible against appellant in the absence of an opportunity for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">HARMLESS ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Under settled principles, a criminal conviction involving a violation of the Confrontation Clause may be upheld if the violation constituted error which was \u201c \u2018harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at \u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1901 (quoting <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)). Such an error may be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt when other evidence of guilt \u201cis so overwhelming, and the prejudicial effect of the codefendant\u2019s admission is so insignificant by comparison, that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the improper ... admission [of the confession] was harmless error.\u201d <em>See Schneble v. Florida, </em>405 U.S. 427, 430, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 1059, 31 L.Ed.2d 340 (1972) (involving Confrontation Clause error).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaC\">This standard requires a determination of \u201cwhether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d In making that determination, the reviewing court is to consider a host of factors, including the importance of the tainted evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the prosecution\u2019s case, whether that evidence was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the tainted evidence on material points, and the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 548, 551, 528 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1999) (on remand from United States Supreme Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Under certain circumstances, where a Confrontation Clause error results from the admission of the custodial confession of a non-testifying accomplice, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s confession ... may be considered on appeal in assessing whether any Confrontation Clause violation was harmless.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>481 U.S. at 193-94, 107 S.Ct. at 1719. The Court held in <em>Cruz </em>that, in the usual ease, the defendant challenges the existence or accuracy of his own confession, and \u201c[an] [accomplice\u2019s] confession will be ... enormously damaging if it confirms, in all essential respects, the defendant\u2019s alleged confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 107 S.Ct. at 1718. Under these circumstances, \u201ca[n] [accomplice\u2019s] confession that corroborates the defendant\u2019s confession significantly harms the defendant\u2019s case, whereas one that is positively incompatible gives credence to the defendant\u2019s assertion that his own alleged confession was nonexistent or false.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 107 S.Ct. at 1719. Therefore, where a defendant attempts to disclaim his own confession and the non-testifying accomplice\u2019s confession closely interlocks, the erroneous admission of the accomplice\u2019s statement generally cannot be said to be harmless error. <em>See id. </em>at 192, 107 S.Ct. at 1718-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Although considering the prospect unlikely, the Court also acknowledged in <em>Cruz </em>that if the defendant\u2019s and the accomplice\u2019s confessions \u201cinterlock\u201d and the defendant actually stands by his own confession, \u201cit [may] be said that the [accomplice\u2019s] confession does no more than support the defendant\u2019s very own case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 107 S.Ct. at 1719. Under these circumstances, therefore, the erroneous admission of an accomplice\u2019s interlocking confession may be harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Here, appellant did not testify and did not object to the admission of his own confession<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in which he admitted being in the car with Jones, whom he knew had a gun, but denied he participated in or encouraged the shooting. If Jones\u2019 confession interlocked with appellant\u2019s in all critical respects, its admission could be harmless. As set out above, however, Jones\u2019 statement differed from appellant\u2019s in one key respect \u2014 Jones said \u201ceverybody\u201d in the car, which would include appellant, encouraged him to shoot, whereas appellant said in his statement that he was merely present in the car during the shooting and that \u201che didn\u2019t actively participate in these things.\u201d Therefore, the admission of appellant\u2019s own statement into evidence did not, standing alone, render the erroneous admission of Jones\u2019 statement harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We also conclude that the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt, other than Jones\u2019 statement, was not overwhelming. The Commonwealth proceeded against appellant on the theory that appellant was a principal in the second degree to Jones\u2019 shooting of the victim. One who is \u201cpresent, aiding and abetting, and intend[s] his or her words, gestures, signals, or actions to in some way encourage, advise, urge, or in some way help the person committing the crime to commit it\u201d is a principal in the second degree. <em>McGill v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 728, 733, 485 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1997). \u201c[M]ere presence and consent will not suffice.\u201d <em>Underwood v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 1045, 1048, 243 S.E.2d 231, 233 (1978). The person \u201cmust share the criminal intent of the party who actually committed the [crime] or be guilty of some overt act in furtherance thereof.\u201d <em>Augustine v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 120, 124, 306 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1983). The circumstantial evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt was not so overwhelming that we can say the erroneous admission of Jones\u2019 statement, the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>direct evidence of appellant\u2019s encouragement, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court\u2019s admission of accomplice Jones\u2019 custodial confession violated the Confrontation Clause and that its erroneous admission was not harmless. Therefore, we reverse appellant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\">. The statement included reference to an earlier robbery, but the Commonwealth offered it for its relevance to the shooting, and the trial court agreed to redact any reference to anything other than the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">. Jones also said in his written statement that it was \"Nobodys\u201d idea \u201cto shoot at the people on Sacramento Dr.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">. Appellant's statements also contained a reference to what appeared to be an earlier robbery, but the Commonwealth asked the trial court \"not to consider\u201d \"any reference to any robbery charge,\u201d and the trial court responded, \"All right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b402-11\">. Roberts' statement, which included references to an earlier robbery, was considered by the court in its entirety. The portion of Roberts\u2019 statement describing the robbery does not mention appellant and does not make clear whether he was present in the car during the robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b403-11\">. In reversing the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lilly </em>on Confrontation Clause grounds, a plurality of the United States Supreme Court stated, \"We assume, as we must, that [the accomplice\u2019s] statements were against his penal interest as a matter of [Virginia] law____\" <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116,\u2014, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 1894, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999). As early as 1923, the Virginia Supreme Court recognized this exception for statements incriminating a third party declarant and exculpating an accused, either directly or indirectly. <em>See Hines </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>136 Va. 728, 739-50, 117 S.E. 843, 846-49 (1923); <em>see also Newberry v. Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 445, 460-62, 61 S.E.2d 318, 325-26 (1950). However, until more <em>recently, no </em>Virginia appellate court appears to have applied this principle in the context of a party\u2019s efforts to admit an accomplice\u2019s statement or confession against penal interest that also incriminates the accused. <em>See, e.g., Chandler v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 270, 278-79, 455 S.E.2d 219, 224-25 (1995); <em>Scaggs v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 1, 4-5, 359 S.E.2d 830, 831-32 (1987) (holding that accomplice\u2019s out-of-court statement incriminating accused would have been admissible as statement against penal interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>of accomplice if Commonwealth had proved accomplice was unavailable but that error in admission of statement was harmless). The plurality in <em>Lilly </em>agreed, observing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">[P]rior to 1995, it appears that even Virginia rarely allowed statements against the penal interest of the declarant to be used at criminal trials____ Virginia relaxed that portion of its hearsay law when it decided <em>Chandler v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 270, 455 S.E.2d 219 (1995), and ... it later apparently concluded that all statements against penal interest fall within \"a \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 exception to hearsay in Virginia,\" <em>[Lilly,] </em>255 Va., at 575, 499 S.E.2d, at 534____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-12\"><em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at\u2014-\u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1898-99.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b407-10\">. <em>See supra </em>note 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\">. The plurality of four justices in <em>Lilly </em>opined that it is \"highly unlikely\u201d that the presumption can be effectively rebutted if the statement \u201cshift[s] or spread[s] hlame.\u201d 527 U.S. at \u2014 n. 5, \u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1899 n. 5, 1900 (plurality opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer, JJ.). Four other justices opined that the Confrontation Clause \"does not impose a \u2018blanket ban on the government\u2019s use of accomplice statements that incriminate a defendant.\u2019 \u201d 527 U.S. at \u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1903 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment); 527 U.S. at\u2014-\u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1904-05 (Rehnquist, C.J., joined by O\u2019Connor and Kennedy, JJ., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-17\">Justice Scalia was the only member of the Court whose opinion did not specifically acknowledge this view. Even Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion leaves open this possibility. He wrote that <em>Lilly </em>involved \u201ca paradigmatic Confrontation Clause violation,\u201d but before making this statement, he observed that \"[the accomplice] told police officers that [defendant Lilly] committed the charged murder.\u201d 527 U.S. at\u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1903. Therefore, the type of statement to which Scalia referred could be characterized as one which shifts blame away from the accomplice and wholly onto the defendant. Further, Justice Scalia authored the opinion in <em>Cruz, </em>a case involving an accomplice\u2019s custodial confession. In <em>Cruz, </em>the Court said \"the defendant\u2019s confession may be considered at trial in assessing whether his co-defendant\u2019s statements are supported by sufficient \u2018indicia of reliability\u2019 to be directly admissible against him.\u201d 481 U.S. at 193-94, 107 S.Ct. at 1719. Thus, unless Justice Scalia has abandoned the views he espoused in <em>Cruz, </em>he remains of the opinion that an accomplice\u2019s custodial confession incriminating a defendant may be directly admissible against the defendant under certain circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b409-10\">. The plurality in <em>Lilly </em>noted its rejection of the \"notion that \u2018evidence corroborating the truth of a hearsay statement may properly support a finding that the statement bears \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at---, 119 S.Ct. at 1900-01 (citation omitted). However, in doing so, it indirectly confirmed its belief that a defendant\u2019s interlocking confession, where one exists, may appropriately be considered in assessing the reliability of the accomplice\u2019s statement. In rejecting the use of corroborative evidence to assess the reliability of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>accomplice\u2019s confession, the plurality in <em>Lilly </em>relied on the Court's earlier decision in <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 822, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3150, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990). In <em>Wright, </em>the Court discussed the interlock principle and did not expressly reject it or overrule the language in <em>Lee. See id. </em>at 823-24 &amp; n. *, 110 S.Ct. at 3150-51 &amp; n. *. It said that, in <em>.Lee, </em>it considered the interlock of the accomplice\u2019s and defendant\u2019s confessions on the one hand and declined to rely on corroborative <em>physical </em>evidence on the other. <em>See Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 824, 110 S.Ct. at 3151 (citing <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 545 \u2014 46, 106 S.Ct. at 2064 \u2014 65). It also noted that it \"rejected the \u2018interlock\u2019 theory in <em>[Lee,]\u201d </em>in which it held that it did not apply on those facts, but it did not hold that consideration of \"interlock\u201d is inappropriate corroborative evidence. <em>See Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 824, 110 S.Ct. at 3151. Therefore, the plurality in <em>Lilly </em>did not reject the Court\u2019s prior holdings on the significance of interlock to the independent admissibility of an accomplice\u2019s statement implicating the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b411-6\">. The plurality in <em>Lilly </em>suggested additional limits on the types of evidence relevant to establish a statement's trustworthiness. It rejected the notion that \"the police\u2019s informing [the accomplice] of his <em>Miranda </em>rights render[ed] the circumstances surrounding his statements significantly more trustworthy,\u201d saying that \"a suspect\u2019s consciousness of his <em>Miranda </em>rights has little, if any, bearing on the likelihood of truthfulness of his statements.\" <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at \u2014, 119 S.Ct. at 1901 (analogizing to <em>Lee\u2019s </em>rejection of idea that Fifth Amendment voluntariness determination bears on trustworthiness of statement (quoting <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 544, 106 S.Ct. at 2064)). It also said that \"the absence of an express promise of leniency to [the accomplice] does not enhance his statements\u2019 reliability <em>to the level necessary </em>for their untested admission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). It reasoned that \"[t]he police need not tell a person who is in custody that his statements may gain him leniency in order for the suspect to surmise that speaking up, and particularly placing blame on his cohorts, may inure to his advantage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plurality did not suggest that the absence of a promise of leniency is not a relevant factor for consideration. Further, of course, because this portion of the plurality opinion represented the view of only four members of the Court, its contents are advisory rather than mandatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\">. Appellant\u2019s lack of objection to the admission of his confession, combined with his failure to testify and his reliance on the confession in argument to the court, can only be fairly interpreted as standing by his own confession.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
