Southwest argues that the commission erred by holding that Bryant\u2019s claim was not barred by the two-year statute of limitation under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) or barred by the six-month limitation period under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C). For the following reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">On June 2,1995, Bryant suffered a compensable back injury arising out of and in the course of his employment with Southwest. Bryant was awarded temporary total disability benefits from June 12, 1995 through February 5, 1996, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>he returned to light-duty employment. After returning to work, Bryant was awarded temporary partial disability. On April 24, 1996, Southwest filed an Application for Hearing, alleging that Bryant had unjustifiably refused light-duty employment. After a hearing, the commission found that Bryant had unjustifiably refused light-duty work suitable to his capacity and suspended his benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-510 as of April 21, 1996, the last day for which compensation had been paid. Bryant did not appeal that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">On March 31,1998, Bryant filed a change-in-condition application requesting the resumption of temporary total disability benefits beginning December 30, 1997. The deputy commissioner found that Bryant had become totally disabled and awarded benefits effective December 31,1997. On review, the commission affirmed the decision finding that Bryant\u2019s claim was not barred by either Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) or Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C), as Southwest claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ALg\">\n<em>A. Code \u00a7 65.2-510(0</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">First, we consider whether Bryant\u2019s claim is barred by Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C), which provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0L\">[a] cure of unjustified refusal pursuant to subsection A may not be established if the unjustified refusal lasts more than six months from the last day for which compensation was paid before suspension pursuant to this section; however, the six-month period may be extended by the number of days a claimant is totally disabled if the disability commenced during such six-month period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Southwest argues that because Bryant failed to \u201ccure\u201d his unjustified refusal of selective employment within six months from the date he refused selective employment, he is barred from claiming benefits for temporary total disability. Southwest notes that an employee may \u201ccure\u201d his refusal of selective employment by accepting the refused light-duty employment or by marketing his residual capacity. <em>See generally Herbert Bros., Inc. v. Jenkins, </em>14 Va.App. 715, 419 S.E.2d 283 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>(1992); <em>Thompson v. Hampton Inst., </em>8 Va.App. 668, 353 S.E.2d 316 (1987). Southwest further argues, purportedly relying upon the holdings in two commission decisions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that an employee may also \u201ccure\u201d his refusal of selective employment by demonstrating that he is temporarily totally disabled. Thus, Southwest reasons that because Bryant\u2019s attempt to \u201ccure\u201d his unjustified refusal of selective employment is based upon his claim that he is temporarily totally disabled, a claim that arose after the six-month limitation period of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C) expired, he is barred from making a claim for temporary total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Bryant concedes that he did not cure the refusal of selective employment within the requisite period by accepting the offered selective employment or marketing his residual capacity; however, he asserts that Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C) is inapplicable to a change-in-condition application for temporary total disability. We agree. Moreover, Southwest misconstrues the commission\u2019s holdings in <em>Willis </em>and in <em>Hughes. </em>The commission did not hold, as Southwest asserts, \u201cthat temporary total disability constitutes a \u2018cure\u2019 of a refusal to perform selective duty.\u201d To the contrary, the commission held in <em>Willis, </em>\u201c[i]t is well established that an unjustified refusal of selective employment does not operate as a bar to compensation for total work incapacity.\u201d In <em>Hughes </em>the commission again reiterated that refusal of selective employment does not bar a claim for total disability based on a change in condition. Neither case held that temporary total disability \u201ccures\u201d a refusal to perform selective employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Southwest misapprehends the plain language of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C), which deals with suspension of benefits for a partially disabled employee who unjustifiably refuses an offer of employment within the employee\u2019s residual work capacity. Code \u00a7 65.2-510 does not have any bearing upon a change-in-condition application for an employee who becomes totally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>disabled as a result of the industrial injury, except to the extent that it may later affect whether a subsequent claim for partial disability is barred. We express no opinion on that issue which is not before us. Because Bryant is not attempting to cure his previous unjustified refusal of selective employment, but rather, is claiming that he is temporarily totally disabled, we find that Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C) is inapplicable. Therefore, the commission did not err in finding that Bryant was not barred by Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C) from raising his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">\n<em>B. Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We next consider whether Bryant\u2019s claim for temporary total disability is barred by the twenty-four month provision of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A). Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) requires that a change-in-condition application be filed within twenty-four months from the last day for which compensation was paid. A change in an employee\u2019s physical condition that is compensable under Code \u00a7 65.2-708 includes, among certain other changes, any \u201c \u2018progression, deterioration, or aggravation\u2019 \u201d of a previously compensated injury. <em>Leonard v. Arnold, </em>218 Va. 210, 213-14, 237 S.E.2d 97, 99 (1977) (quoting 3 Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 81.31 (1976) (construing former Code \u00a7 65.1-99)). However, \u201ca new and separate accidental injury\u201d may not be compensated as a change in condition of a previous injury. <em>Id. </em>at 214, 237 S.E.2d at 99. Thus, when an employee seeks compensation under Code \u00a7 65.2-708, the employee must prove that the change in condition is \u201ccausally connected with the injury originally compensated.\u201d <em>King\u2019s Market v. Porter, </em>227 Va. 478, 483, 317 S.E.2d 146, 148 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We have said that the language of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) providing that \u201c[n]o such review shall be made after twenty-four months from the last day for which compensation was paid,\u201d is construed to mean that \u201cthe change in condition must occur within twenty-four months from the date compensation was last due or paid.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A); <em>Armstrong Furniture v. Elder, 4 </em>Va.App. 238, 241, 356 S.E.2d 614, 615 (1987) (construing former Code \u00a7 65.1-99). We have also held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>claimant is not required by Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) to produce the evidence prior to the expiration of the twenty-four month limitation, so long as the application alleged that a change in condition existed within the time of the filing. <em>See Johnson v. Smith, </em>16 Va.App. 167, 169-70, 428 S.E.2d 508, 510 (1993); <em>Hungerford Mechanical Corp. v. Hobson, </em>11 Va.App. 675, 678, 401 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Bryant last received compensation on April 21, 1996. He filed his change-in-condition application March 31, 1998. Southwest does not dispute that Bryant filed his application within twenty-four months from the date that he last received compensation. Southwest argues, however, that Bryant did not prove that he was totally disabled within the twenty-four month period because the documentation filed with the commission in support of his claim was a doctor\u2019s report dated June 16, 1998. Southwest reasons that because the doctor\u2019s report supporting the claim was not available to Bryant until after the time limitation had run, the filing of the claim was anticipatory and Bryant was not able to establish his claim within the statutory time limitation. The notion that the date of a medical report or even a doctor\u2019s examination must be within this statutory period in order to prove the date of onset of disability is not reasonable. A doctor may conduct an examination and, together with a medical history, render an opinion as to the cause and date of onset of a disability. The June 16, 1998 office note by Dr. Yogesh Chand, Bryant\u2019s treating physician, stated that Bryant had been totally disabled since October, 1997, when Dr. Chand reported that a recent MRI revealed a small new recurrent herniated disc.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to Bryant, the prevailing party. <em>See R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990). We accept the commission\u2019s factual findings when they are supported by credible evidence. <em>See James v. Capitol Steel Constr. Co., </em>8 Va.App. 512, 515, 382 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1989). \u201cThe Commission\u2019s factual findings are \u2018conclusive and binding,\u2019 Code \u00a7 [65.2-706], and a question raised by \u2018conflicting expert medical opinions\u2019 is \u2018one of fact\u2019 \u201d binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>upon this Court on appeal. <em>Eccon Constr. Co. v. Lucas, </em>221 Va. 786, 790, 273 S.E.2d 797, 799 (1981) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Following its review of the medical evidence, the commission gave the greatest weight to Dr. Chand\u2019s June 1998 report. The commission noted that although medical reports from Dr. G.V. Reddy, Bryant\u2019s initial treating physician, and Dr. Stephen Schroering, a physician who examined Bryant at his counsel\u2019s request, indicate that Bryant was not totally disabled and was capable of light-duty work, neither doctor examined Bryant after July 1997. <em>See also Penley v. Island Creek Coal Co., 8 </em>Va.App. 310, 318, 381 S.E.2d 231, 236 (1989) (\u201cQuestions raised by conflicting medical opinions must be decided by the commission.\u201d). The commission found that Dr. Chand\u2019s medical opinion was supported by a recent positive MRI and Dr. Chand\u2019s contemporaneous office notes, which indicated that Bryant continued to complain of back pain and that he was \u201cgetting worse in his symptomology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The commission did not err in finding that Bryant\u2019s claims were not barred by Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-510(C) or 65.2-708(A) or by finding on the evidence before it that Bryant was temporarily totally disabled. We, therefore, affirm the commission\u2019s decision reinstating Bryant\u2019s temporary total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-6\">. <em>Willis v.
