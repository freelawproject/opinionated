On appeal he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. Finding the evidence sufficient, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence established that on November 19, 1997, the defendant was a teacher and coach at Marion Senior High School in Smyth County. The defendant is deaf and speech-impaired, and he communicates primarily by lip reading. He knew the fourteen-year-old victim through her boyfriend, but was neither her teacher nor coach.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">During a break from an algebra class, the victim was in the hallway getting a drink of water when the defendant asked her to come into his classroom. He inquired how she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>doing in her algebra class and offered her assistance if she needed it. She returned to class, but about ten or fifteen minutes later, the defendant asked her to step into the hall. There, he showed her a picture of his former girlfriend and stated \u201chow much he missed her and wanted to be with her.\u201d The victim returned to class.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">When class was over, the victim again saw the defendant in the hallway. He asked her how she did in algebra, and she told him she got a \u201cB.\u201d The defendant asked where she was going and she said, \u201cto the front of the school.\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cI am too, so I will walk with you.\u201d As they walked down the hall, the victim testified the defendant \u201cput his hand up under my hair on the back of my neck and started stroking it with his fingertips and said, \u2018It turns you on, don\u2019t it?\u2019 \u201d The victim responded, \u201cNo, not by you\u201d and jerked her head away. The victim understood his comment to mean \u201csomething sexual.\u201d She said the touching \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cupset\u201d her. The defendant placed his hand on her neck under her hair a second time and said, \u201cAre you horny yet?\u201d The victim said no, jerked her head away, and told him to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The victim told her mother and boyfriend about the incident the day after it happened. After the boyfriend talked to the defendant, the defendant went to the victim\u2019s class and motioned for her to come to the door. The victim stood in the doorframe. The defendant said that \u201che was sorry for what he had done and he didn\u2019t mean anything by it\u201d and that he considered her like a little sister. He also said that he knew she would be at the school for three more years, her boyfriend would not, and if she ever needed anyone to talk to or look up to, \u201che would always be there. And he told me he was sorry again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The defendant testified that on the date of the offense the victim appeared \u201cdown.\u201d The victim was walking ahead of him on his right side. In order to speak with her, he placed his hand on her neck to get her to face him; he said, \u201c[t]he first time I grabbed her I was trying to get her to look at me.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The defendant testified that when he asked the victim, \u201cWhat is turning you on?,\u201d he meant, \u201cWhat is bothering you?\u201d He touched her neck again when she failed to turn around. He claims he did not hear her tell him to stop and she never turned around. The defendant initially denied saying anything about being \u201chorny.\u201d He then testified, however, that if he did say it, it would have related to his former girlfriend, not the victim. He claims the incident was a miscommunication or misunderstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The defendant admits that he touched the victim. He contends, however, that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he intended to harm her. The defendant also argues that the court erroneously relied on the tort definition of assault and battery in concluding that a reasonable teacher would have known that the second touching was unwanted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">An assault and battery is the unlawful touching of another. <em>See Gnadt v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 148, 151, 497 S.E.2d 887, 888 (1998). Assault and battery is \u201cthe least touching of another, willfully or in anger.\u201d Roger D. Groot, <em>Criminal Offenses and Defenses in Virginia </em>29 (4th ed. 1998). The defendant does not have to intend to do harm; a battery may also be \u201cdone in a spirit of rudeness or insult.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). The touching need not result in injury. <em>See Gnadt, </em>27 Va.App. at 151, 497 S.E.2d at 888. A touching is not unlawful if the person consents or if the touching is justified or excused. <em>See id.; </em>Groot, <em>supra, </em>at 30 (\u201can intentional touching which was not justified or excused is a battery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The victim did not consent to the touchings. She jerked her head away when the defendant first touched her on the nape of her neck under her hair. No evidence suggested that the victim consented to the first touching. Her reaction to that touching removed any doubt that she consented to being touched. The court found that the second touching was \u201cunauthorized and unwelcome and unwarranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Even though a victim does not consent to the touching, it may be lawful if justified or excused. <em>See </em>Groot, <em>supra, </em>at 30 (examples include public authority, domestic authority, and crime prevention). The defendant claims the court failed to consider that he needed to touch the victim so she would turn to face him and he could read her lips. He asserts that his disability justified touching her so he could communicate with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The defendant said, \u201cI usually just touch someone\u2019s shoulder to get them to make eye contact so I can understand them.\u201d He claimed that he touched the nape of the victim\u2019s neck under her hair twice because she was walking fast. The trial court found that the \u201ctouching of the neck was not in the ordinary course for [the defendant] to get the attention of someone that he wanted to communicate with.\u201d The trial court also found that \u201c[t]here was no need for disciplinary or other control.\u201d Under the circumstances presented, the defendant\u2019s touching was neither excused nor justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The fact finder, who determines the credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded their testimony, may accept or reject the testimony in whole or in part. <em>See Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1986). The defendant testified that he meant, \u201cwhat is bothering you?\u201d when he asked the victim, \u201cwhat is turning you on?,\u201d that he was trying to get the victim\u2019s attention by touching her, and while he denies he used the word \u201chorny\u201d when speaking to her, if he did, he was talking about his former girlfriend. The trial court found the victim\u2019s testimony credible. It was entitled to disbelieve the defendant\u2019s self-serving testimony and to conclude that he was lying to conceal his guilt. <em>See Speight v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 83, 88, 354 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1987) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the conviction of assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A2y\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">I concur in affirming the conviction. I write separately only to note my view that \u201cthe unlawful touching of another,\u201d <em>see Gnadt v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 148, 151, 497 S.E.2d 887, 888 (1998), does not completely define the crime of \u201cassault and battery.\u201d In affirming a conviction for assault and battery, the Supreme Court long ago held that \u201c[a] battery consists of the willful or unlawful touching of the person of another by the assailant, or by some object set in motion by [the assailant].\u201d <em>Wood v. Commonwealth, </em>149 Va. 401, 404, 140 S.E. 114, 115 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The trial judge found that the student\u2019s testimony was credible, that the second touching was willful and not done in the ordinary course of the defendant\u2019s need to communicate or to discharge his duties as a teacher, and that \u201cit should have been clear to a reasonable teacher that [this] type of touching was not welcomed.\u201d These findings are based on credible evidence and are sufficient to prove the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
