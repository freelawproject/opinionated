Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (citation omitted). The credibility of the witnesses, the weight accorded testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters to be determined by the fact finder. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). A finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt by the trial court will not be set aside unless plainly wrong or without support in the evidence. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">During the early evening hours of November 19, 1997, Debra Taylor and her husband, William, were traveling along Route 602, a typical two-lane rural highway, en route from Harrisonburg to Shenandoah, Virginia. Mr. Taylor was the driver, and his wife the front seat passenger. The posted speed limit was 55 m.p.h.', and Mr. Taylor was driving between 45 and 50 m.p.h. As the couple rounded a curve, both noticed the headlights of two vehicles, one behind the other, \u201ccoming up ... pretty fast\u201d from the rear. Each \u201cset of lights\u201d was repeatedly alternating from high to low beam, and Mrs. Taylor watched as the nearer of the two, a truck, suddenly \u201cleft the road.\u201d Mrs. Taylor testified that the remaining vehicle, a \u201cwhite car,\u201d continued to \u201ccome closer,\u201d prompting her to caution her husband, \u201cspeed up he\u2019s coming right at us.\u201d Mr. Taylor immediately \u201csped up ... to get away,\u201d and Mrs. Taylor then observed the white car also leave the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Intending to render assistance, the Taylors returned to the area of the accident and discovered a white Ford Mustang \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>a field,\u201d disabled and smoking, with defendant alone inside, \u201cblood coming out of his nose.\u201d Fearful of fire, the couple urged defendant to leave the vehicle, but he hesitated, \u201cmumbl[ing],\u201d \u201cwhere\u2019s the guy in the truck.\u201d Once coaxed from the car, defendant assured Mrs. Taylor that he was \u201call right,\u201d and continued to question the whereabouts of the \u201cguy in the truck,\u201d explaining that he had \u201chit [the truck] in the rear.\u201d During the exchanges with defendant, Mr. Taylor noted that his \u201cspeech wasn\u2019t very clear,\u201d adding, \u201cI smelled alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Gary Taylor (no relation) came upon the scene shortly after the accident. He observed the white Mustang \u201csitting on [an] embankment ... smoking\u201d and asked defendant \u201cif he was hurt, ... had any problems getting out of the car.\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cno,\u201d \u201cstarted ... out,\u201d \u201cstumbling around a little,\u201d and Gary \u201csmell[ed] alcohol.\u201d Upon learning that another vehicle had also crashed, Gary \u201cproceeded ... through the field to look\u201d and soon located \u201ca red and black pick-up truck ... sitting on its side.\u201d The driver, Edward Dinges, was found \u201claying face up, ... on his back\u201d \u201cat the top of vehicle,\u201d fatally injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Debra Jean May, an Emergency Medical Technician dispatched to the accident, found defendant \u201cleaning against the trunk of his car,\u201d bleeding from the nose. He twice denied May\u2019s offers of medical treatment, insisting that he was unhurt. During her encounter with defendant, May was \u201cfairly close to his face\u201d and \u201cdistinguished] a smell of alcohol on his breath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Investigation of the accident was initially assigned to Virginia State Trooper P.F. Glovier. Glovier approached defendant, then \u201cpartially sitting\u201d in the Mustang, and requested his operator\u2019s license. Defendant \u201cbegan to hand [Glovier] card after card,\u201d \u201cnumerous cards,\u201d including an \u201cinsurance card\u201d and a \u201cpocket calendar,\u201d before producing the license. Glovier recalled that defendant\u2019s speech was \u201cslurred,\u201d he was unable to recite his residential zip code, and \u201chad a hard time understanding instructions.\u201d \u201c[D]etect[ing] a strong odor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>alcohol ... on [his] breath,\u201d Glovier asked that defendant accompany him to the police cruiser. As defendant began to walk, he \u201cwas very unsteady,\u201d requiring the assistance of both Glovier and another trooper, William L. Jones, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">After Glovier advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, defendant inquired, \u201cIs that boy going to be okay? What happened?\u201d Upon questioning by Glovier, defendant first stated that the Dinges truck \u201chit me\u201d when he was \u201cstuck in the ditch.\u201d Defendant admitted consuming a \u201ccouple of beers at the Eagle\u2019s Club\u201d immediately prior to the accident. Later, at the Sheriffs Department, defendant explained to Glovier, \u201cI had been at the Eagle\u2019s Club and ... on my way home. He [Dinges] hit his brakes, and I couldn\u2019t stop in time.\u201d He again acknowledged, \u201cI might\u2019ve had a couple beers earlier at the Eagle\u2019s Club.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Trooper Jones assisted Glovier in the investigation and also described defendant as \u201cunsteady,\u201d unable to walk without assistance. Jones identified numerous photographic exhibits of the vehicles which depicted significant damage to the rear of Dinges\u2019 truck and the front of defendant\u2019s Mustang, including a \u201ccontact mark\u201d of \u201cred paint on white paint\u201d on the Mustang. A search of the Mustang by Jones revealed unopened cans of beer on the \u201cpassenger floorboard\u201d and inside the trank and \u201ca not quite full bottle of vodka,\u201d also in the trank.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u201c[I]nvoluntary manslaughter in the operation of a motor vehicle [is an] accidental killing which, although unintended, is the proximate result of negligence so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard of human life.\u201d <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 601, 607, 231 S.E.2d 312, 316 (1977). Thus, \u201ca higher degree of negligence ... is required to establish criminal liability for involuntary manslaughter than to establish liability in a civil action for ordinary or even gross negligence. This higher degree of negligence has come to be known as \u2018criminal negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Keech v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>wealth, </em>9 Va.App. 272, 277, 386 S.E.2d 813, 816 (1989); <em>see Conrad v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 113, 120, 521 S.E.2d 321, 325 (1999) <em>(en banc) </em>(distinguishing \u201csimple negligence\u201d and \u201c[g]ross negligence\u201d from the \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d necessary to involuntary manslaughter). \u201c \u2018The cumulative effect of a series of connected, or independent negligent acts\u2019 causing a death may be considered in determining if a defendant has exhibited a reckless disregard for human life.\u201d <em>Jetton v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 557, 561, 347 S.E.2d 141, 144 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In assessing \u201cthe degree of negligence sufficient to support a conviction of vehicular involuntary manslaughter, the accused\u2019s conscious awareness of the risk of injury created by his conduct is necessarily a significant factor.\u201d <em>Keech, </em>9 Va.App. at 278, 386 S.E.2d at 816. \u201c[W]hen determining what is a \u2018known risk\u2019 ... [t]his Court held that an objective standard would apply and the degree of negligence would be \u2018determined by the great risk of injury together with the knowledge a defendant had or should have had of that risk.\u2019 \u201d <em>Forbes v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 304, 311, 498 S.E.2d 457, 460 (1998) (quoting <em>Keech, </em>9 Va.App. at 282, 386 S.E.2d at 818). Stated differently, ordinary negligence becomes \u201c \u2018criminal when accompanied by acts of commission or omission of a wanton or willful nature, showing a reckless or indifferent disregard of the rights of others, under circumstances reasonably calculated to produce injury, or which make it not improbable that injury will be occasioned, and <em>the offender knows or is charged with the knowledge of, the -probable results of his acts\u2019 \u201d Keech, </em>9 Va.App. at 279, 386 S.E.2d at 817 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u201cEvidence of the consumption of alcohol is admissible [in an involuntary manslaughter prosecution] where the evidence shows that it has affected a person\u2019s \u2018manner, disposition, speech, muscular movement, general appearance or behavior.\u2019\u201d <em>Jetton, </em>2 Va.App. at 559, 347 S.E.2d at 143 (citation omitted). \u201c[A]lcohol consumed by an automobile driver, even though not enough to cause legal intoxication, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>may be sufficient to impair his capacity to perceive the dangers with ... clarity, make the decisions with the prudence, and operate the vehicle with the skill and caution required by the law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Simon v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 412, 419-20, 258 S.E.2d 567, 572-73 (1979); <em>see also Beck v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 1, 5, 216 S.E.2d 8, 10 (1975). Under such circumstances, the debilitating effect of alcohol becomes \u201can aggravating factor, increasing with its degree, bearing upon the relative culpability of the defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d in determining both the measure of negligence and the \u201cappropriate quantum of punishment.\u201d <em>Essex v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 273, 283, 322 S.E.2d 216, 221-22 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u201c \u2018The application of the distinctions between ... degrees of negligence is frequently difficult to apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Forbes, </em>27 Va.App. at 309, 498 S.E.2d at 459 (citation omitted). \u201c \u2018Generally, negligence (whether ordinary, gross, or willful and wanton), contributory negligence, and proximate cause are issues for a jury\u2019s resolution. They only become questions of law to be determined by a court, when reasonable minds could not differ.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tubman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 267, 273, 348 S.E.2d 871, 875 (1986) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Here, defendant was traveling at a high rate of speed while following a vehicle so closely that he was unable to stop when the other driver \u201chit his brakes.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>was rendered more culpable because defendant was driving while his intellectual and motor functions were substantially impaired by alcohol. The measure of such deficits was established by evidence that defendant, immediately after the accident, smelled strongly of alcohol and, despite only slight injury, was confused, behaving irrationally, unable to speak clearly, could not produce his operator\u2019s license, walk without assistance, or recall the zip code for his residence. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Accordingly, the record clearly supported the finding that defendant knowingly engaged in conduct \u201cso gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard of human life\u201d which proximately caused the accident and resulting death of Dinges. We, therefore, affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\">. At oral argument, defendant abandoned his contention on brief that the trial court erroneously refused to suppress evidence of defendant's intoxication at the time of the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"><em>. </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 provides that \"[a]ny person who, as a result of driving under the influence in violation of subdivisions (ii), (iii), or (iv) of \u00a7 18.2-266, unintentionally causes the death of another person, shall be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\u201d Thus, a conviction under the statute requires proof both that the accused violated Code \u00a7 18.2-266(ii), (iii), or (iv) and that such misconduct caused the death of another, elements not necessary to common law involuntary manslaughter. <em>See Castillo v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 482, 465 S.E.2d 146 (1995); <em>Pollard v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 94, 455 S.E.2d 283 (1995). Thus, Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(C) expressly provides that \u201d[t]he provisions of [Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1] shall not preclude prosecution under any other homicide statute.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\">.
