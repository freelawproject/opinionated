Appellant also contends the Commonwealth unlawfully denied him access to psychiatric records which he could have used to impeach a Commonwealth\u2019s witness. He further contends the trial court should have reviewed the psychiatric records before denying his post-trial request for a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to obtain the documents. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>1</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">On October 22, 1996, the Fairfax County General District Court found appellant guilty of unlawful entry. Appellant received a twelve month jail sentence with six months suspended upon the condition that he remain of good behavior. The conviction order provided that appellant\u2019s sentence was to be served through \u201celectronic incarceration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Appellant entered the EIP program on February 21, 1997. He executed a written agreement to follow certain restrictions as a condition of being incarcerated in his home. Among these rules were the requirements that appellant submit to random urine tests, continuously wear a monitoring device on his anide, refrain from possessing weapons or intoxicating substances, and be subject to random, unannounced home visits by the sheriff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Acting upon an anonymous tip that appellant had a large bag of cocaine at his residence, Fairfax County Deputy Sheriff Ron Kidwell and Detectives Dan Janickey and Jule Longer-beam of the Fairfax County Police went to appellant\u2019s home on July 22, 1997. Janickey and Longerbeam were wearing civilian clothing, and Kidwell was in uniform. The officers did not possess a warrant to search appellant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Kidwell knocked on the door and Veronica Barnick, appellant\u2019s girlfriend, answered. Kidwell asked for appellant, and Barnick admitted the officers to the apartment. Appellant, Barnick, and their baby were in the living room of the apartment. Kidwell asked appellant if they could look around. Appellant said, \u201cgo ahead.\u201d Janickey and Longerbeam quickly checked the other rooms in the apartment to ensure that no one else was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Janickey and Longerbeam then returned to appellant and his girlfriend. Janickey told appellant the police had received information that appellant might have drugs in the house. Janickey asked if appellant had any drugs. Appellant said he did not. Janickey asked appellant if he \u201cwould mind\u201d if the officers looked around the apartment. Appellant replied that the officers were \u201cwelcome to look around\u201d because they were \u201cnot going to find anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Janickey and Longerbeam proceeded to the bedroom. In the bottom drawer of a dresser, among men\u2019s underwear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>socks, the officers found two handguns, a .357 caliber revolver and a .22 caliber revolver. In the dresser on the opposite side of the room the police found women\u2019s undergarments.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The officers asked appellant, a previously convicted felon, about the guns. Appellant said the .22 caliber belonged to his girlfriend. Appellant said he had purchased the .357 for $150 as a wedding present for someone. Knowing that appellant previously had been convicted of a felony, Kidwell began to laugh. Appellant then became nervous and upset. Contrary to his earlier statement, appellant said his girlfriend had purchased the .357 caliber as a wedding present for someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The officers testified at the suppression hearing that they obtained appellant\u2019s verbal consent to search the home. Appellant denied consenting to the search but believed he was required to permit the sheriff to search his home during any home visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">At trial, the Commonwealth called Barnick as a witness. Barnick testified that both of the guns found in the apartment belonged to appellant. She said he had owned one of them for almost a year and the other for only a few days prior to the search. Barnick admitted she initially told the police the guns were hers because appellant had advised her to do so. During cross-examination, Barnick denied that she was receiving care at a mental health facility called Woodburn, that she had ever been prescribed any medications through Woodburn, and that she was then on medication. Although she and appellant were no longer living together at the time of appellant\u2019s trial, she spent holidays with appellant\u2019s parents. She said that custody of the child she and appellant shared- had \u201cnever been an issue.\u201d During her rebuttal testimony, Barnick admitted she had met with appellant\u2019s attorney a week earlier in preparation for appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">\n<em>The Suppression Ruling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, finding that appellant retained no expectation of privacy in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>home while he was serving his sentence in the EIP. In its letter opinion denying the motion, the trial court further found that appellant consented to the search, \u201cthus obviating the need for a warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, the Commonwealth in this instance. <em>See Greene v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 606, 608, 440 S.E.2d 138, 139 (1994). \u201cIn performing such analysis, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them[,] and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States protects \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.... \u201d U.S. Const, amend.

Carter, 525 </em>U.S. 83, 88, 119 S.Ct. 469, 473, 142 L.Ed.2d 373 (1998) (quoting <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 143, 99 S.Ct. 421, 430, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-11\">A court must determine whether the individual maintains a legitimate expectation of privacy in the object or premises to be searched, which involves a two-part inquiry. First, we must determine whether the individual has manifested \u201ca subjective expectation of privacy\u201d in the object of the challenged search. This inquiry is a factual determination to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>which we must give deference on appeal. Second, we must determine whether the expectation of privacy is objectively reasonable, one that society is willing to recognize as legitimate. This is a legal determination, requiring no deference on review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 674, 683-84, 496 S.E.2d 143, 148 (1998). <em>But see Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 740 n. 5, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 2580 n. 5, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979) (noting that \u201cwhere an individual\u2019s subjective expectations ha[ve] been \u2018conditioned\u2019 by influences alien to well-recognized Fourth Amendment freedoms, those subjective expectations obviously c[an] play no meaningful role in ascertaining what the scope of Fourth Amendment protection [is]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">First, we consider whether appellant manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in his home during his participation in the EIP.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court found as a fact that, based upon appellant\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing, appellant believed he was required to permit the police to search his home at any time police officers arrived for a home visit. Indeed, appellant\u2019s apparent willingness to allow the officers to search his home supports this conclusion. We are bound to give deference to this finding of fact. <em>See Johnson, </em>26 Va.App. at 684, 496 S.E.2d at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Second, assuming appellant manifested a subjective expectation of privacy, we determine whether society is prepared to recognize as reasonable an expectation of privacy in the home of a participant in a program such as the EIP. Through the EIP, a person who has been convicted of a criminal offense, under certain circumstances, may be permitted to serve his or her sentence through \u201chome/electronic incarceration\u201d as administered by a supervising authority such as the sheriffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>department.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 53.1-131.2(0 provides that \u201cif the offender violates any provision of the terms of the home/electronic incarceration agreement, the offender may have the assignment revoked and, if revoked, shall be held in the jail facility to which he was originally sentenced.\u201d If an EIP participant, \u201cwithout proper authority or just cause, leaves his place of home/electronic incarceration, the area to which he has been assigned to work or attend education or other rehabilitative programs, or the vehicle or route of travel involved in his going to or returning from such place,\u201d he or she is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. Code \u00a7 53.1-131.2(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Among the rules of participation in the EIP, which appellant acknowledged in writing, was the condition that members of the sheriffs department would be permitted to visit the home where' appellant was confined. Appellant was further advised of the numerous prohibited acts which could result in his removal from the program or disciplinary action. If appellant disobeyed the rules of the EIP, he was subject to being incarcerated in jail instead of at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Under such circumstances, a participant in the EIP is far more restricted than one on probation or parole. A probationer or parolee generally enjoys freedom of movement; an EIP participant enjoys no such right. Thus, participation in the EIP is more analogous to a person serving time in a jail or prison. The participant\u2019s home is the functional equivalent of a jail or prison cell. In <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), the United States Supreme Court considered whether an inmate in a penal institution has a right to privacy in his prison cell entitling him to Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>[W]hile persons imprisoned for crime enjoy many protections of the Constitution, it is also clear that imprisonment carries with it the circumscription or loss of many significant rights. These constraints on inmates, and in some eases the complete withdrawal of certain rights, are \u201cjustified by the considerations underlying our penal system.\u201d The curtailment of certain rights is necessary, as a practical matter, to accommodate a myriad of \u201cinstitutional needs and objectives\u201d of prison facilities, chief among which is internal security. Of course, these restrictions or retractions also serve, incidentally, as reminders that, under our system of justice, deterrence and retribution are factors in addition to correction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 524, 104 S.Ct. at 3199 (citations omitted). The Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">society is not prepared to recognize as legitimate any subjective expectation of privacy that a prisoner might have in his prison cell and that, accordingly, the Fourth Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches does not apply within the confines of the prison cell. The recognition of privacy rights for prisoners in their individual cells simply cannot be reconciled with the concept of incarceration and the needs and objectives of penal institutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 526, 104 S.Ct. at 3200.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">At the time of the challenged search, appellant was serving a sentence, albeit in his home, following the conviction of a crime. Appellant was subject to the rules and regulations of the EIP. If he failed to abide by those conditions, he was subject to further disciplinary action, removal from the program, and incarceration in jail. We find that, for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, appellant\u2019s home was the functional equivalent of a jail cell. As one author has stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">[Electronic incarceration appears to be commensurate with the metaphor of \u201ca man\u2019s home is his prison,\u201d with the quantum leap of transposing inmates\u2019 cells from a correctional facility to their homes. The net effect, therefore, would be that offenders who are serving part or all of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>jail sentence at home would be afforded absolutely no fourth amendment constitutional protection from having their homes or their persons searched without a search warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADq\">Alexander M. Esteves, Note, <em>Changing of the Guard: The Future of Confinement Alternatives in Massachusetts, </em>17 New Eng. J. on Crim. &amp; Civ. Confinement 133, 167 (1991) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">At the time of the search, appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the home, which was serving as his jail cell.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, the search of appellant\u2019s home carried with it no Fourth Amendment implications, and the trial judge did not err in denying the motion to suppress. In light of this conclusion, we need not consider whether appellant voluntarily consented to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\n<em>Disclosure of Bamick\u2019s Psychiatric Records</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A_3\">The trial court entered a pretrial order requiring the Commonwealth to provide appellant with exculpatory evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>After trial, appellant filed a request for a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to obtain from Woodburn the records of Barnick\u2019s psychiatric treatment, as well as information regarding medications prescribed for her through the facility for the preceding ten years. Appellant contended, as he does on appeal, that the requested information should have been revealed by the Commonwealth before trial and that he was entitled to use the information to demonstrate that Barnick had committed perjury at trial. The trial court granted a motion to quash the subpoena <em>duces tecum. </em>Appellant subsequently filed a motion to vacate his conviction based upon the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to disclose Bamick\u2019s psychiatric records. The trial court denied this motion also.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We first address the aspect of appellant\u2019s argument pertaining to the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to provide the defense with Barnick\u2019s psychiatric records prior to trial. It is unquestioned that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth is required to provide a defendant exculpatory evidence, including evidence which impeaches the credibility of a prosecution witness.\u201d <em>Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 456, 470 S.E.2d 114, 124 (1996). In fulfilling this disclosure obligation, the \u201cprosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case, including the police.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 1567, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). <em>See also Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 928, 932, 434 S.E.2d 343, 346 (1993) (\u201c[o]ne accused of a criminal offense may obtain exculpatory evidence known to the prosecution\u201d). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">[i]n order for a defendant to establish a <em>Brady [v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963),] violation, he must demonstrate that the undisclosed evidence was exculpatory and material either to the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>guilt or to the issue of punishment. The mere possibility that \u201cundisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><em>Goins, </em>251 Va. at 456, 470 S.E.2d at 124 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We find nothing in the record to suggest that the Commonwealth or its agents had pretrial knowledge that Barnick had received psychiatric treatment. Indeed, defense counsel first broached the subject of Woodburn in cross-examination of Barnick. The Commonwealth could not have been expected to produce records of which none of its agents had knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Furthermore, the record does not show that Barnick\u2019s psychiatric records would have proven that she testified untruthfully, that she harbored a bias against appellant, or that she possessed a motive to fabricate her testimony. Considering all of the evidence produced at trial against appellant, we cannot say the results of the trial would have been different had the Commonwealth provided appellant with Bamick\u2019s psychiatric records.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">To obtain information through a subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>appellant was required to show that the requested documents were \u201cmaterial to the proceedings.\u201d Rule 3A:12(b). A \u201ctrial court\u2019s refusal to issue a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>... is not reversible error absent a showing of prejudice.\u201d <em>Gibbs v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 697, 701, 432 S.E.2d 514, 516 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">When appellant filed his subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>request, all that remained was for the trial court to sentence appellant. Barnick\u2019s credibility was no longer at issue. Thus, Barnick\u2019s psychiatric records were not material to the proceedings then pending in the trial court. Moreover, because the records would not have produced a different outcome at trial, as noted above, appellant has demonstrated no prejudice from the denial of his request for a subpoena <em>duces tecum. </em>Accordingly, we find no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Finally, we must determine whether Barnick\u2019s psychiatric records qualified as after-discovered evidence necessitating a new trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">\u201cMotions for new trials based on after-discovered evidence are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, are not looked upon with favor, are considered with special care and caution, and are awarded with great reluctance.... The applicant bears the burden to establish that the evidence (1) appears to have been discovered subsequent to trial; (2) could not have been secured for use at the trial in the exercise of reasonable diligence by the movant; (3) is not merely cumulative, corroborative or collateral; and (4) is material, and such as should produce opposite results on the merits at another trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\"><em>Hopkins v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 242, 249, 456 S.E.2d 147, 150 (1995) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Appellant has failed to prove that Barnick\u2019s psychiatric records satisfy three of the four prongs of this test. Barnick was appellant\u2019s former girlfriend, and she had met with defense counsel in preparation for trial. In fact, it was defense counsel who first mentioned the subject at trial, questioning Barnick specifically about Woodburn. The trial court found that Barnick was subpoenaed as a witness for the Commonwealth prior to trial. Therefore, appellant should have anticipated her appearance as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Considering these facts and circumstances, Barnick\u2019s prior treatment at Woodburn does not appear to have been discovered after trial. In any event, however, the exercise of reasonable diligence by appellant would have revealed this information. As earlier noted, earlier access to Barnick\u2019s records would not have produced an opposite result at another trial. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to set aside the verdict on the basis of after-discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\">. After the petition for appeal was granted in this case, several transcripts (a partial transcript dated Februaiy 9, 1998 and transcripts of hearings held on November 5, 1997 and on January 12, 1998) were forwarded to this Court from the clerk's office of Fairfax County Circuit Court. \" \u2018After the record has been transmitted to this Court pursuant to [the Rules of Court] and an appeal has been granted, the record on appeal cannot be enlarged except by our award of a writ of certiorari under Code \u00a7 8.01-673.\u2019 \u201d <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 335, 341, 494 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1998) (quoting <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 460, 465, 317 S.E.2d 781, 784 (1984)). Appellant did not request, nor did we issue, a writ of certiorari to compel the transcripts to he forwarded to this Court. Accordingly, we do not consider them, despite their inclusion in the appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-9\">. The record contains no evidence of a written agreement permitting the police to search appellant's residence without a warrant during his participation in the EIP.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\">. In his brief, appellant cites numerous cases discussing the validity of a waiver of the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. This line of argument presumes a finding that appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his home at the time of the search. Absent such an expectation, the question of waiver is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\">. Code \u00a7 53.1-131.2 further provides for participation in EIP for those accused of crimes pending trial. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 53.1-131.2.

Persons whose sentences are suspended or who are on probation enjoy less freedom than those who have not been convicted of committing a crime. <em>See, e.g., Anderson v.

Louisiana, </em>469 U.S. 17, 19-20, 105 S.Ct. 409, 410, 83 L.Ed.2d 246 (1984) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">The burden is on the Commonwealth to establish an exception to the warrant requirement. <em>See United States v. Jeffers, </em>342 U.S. 48, 51, 72 S.Ct. 93, 95, 96 L.Ed. 59 (1951); <em>Walls v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 639, 645, 347 S.E.2d 175, 178 (1986). Moreover, in discharging its obligation to prove one of the specific, well delineated exceptions, the Commonwealth \u201cbear[s] a heavy burden.\u201d <em>Welsh, </em>466 U.S. at 749-50, 104 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>S.Ct. at 2097. In my judgment, on this record, the Commonwealth failed to meet its \u201cheavy burden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">When the search occurred, Michael Megel had been convicted by a judge of the general district court and ordered to serve six months at home under the Fairfax County Community Corrections Program. Code \u00a7 53.1-131.2(A) provides that the judge may \u201cassign the offender to a home/eleetronic incarceration program <em>as a condition of probation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The written agreement that Megel signed when he entered the program included a provision that the \u201cSheriffs Office staff will conduct home visits.\u201d Megel signed no other document giving the Sheriffs office staff or any other agent of the Commonwealth the right to search his residence. In addition, nothing in the rules and conditions of the program that Megel signed purported to be a waiver of Megel\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Based upon its assertion that Megel\u2019s home was a \u201chome jail cell,\u201d the Commonwealth argues on brief \u201cthat society would not accept as reasonable any expectation of privacy [Megel might assert] from home searches by the sheriff.\u201d In support of that argument, the Commonwealth cites <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>256 Va. 580, 585-86, 507 S.E.2d 339, 341-42 (1998), and asserts that \u201c[b]ecause a court can reasonably condition probation on a waiver of Fourth Amendment rights, <em>a fortiori </em>a jailor can reasonably condition home incarceration on such a waiver as well.\u201d The rules and conditions of the program, however, did not condition entry into the program on Megel\u2019s waiver of his Fourth Amendment rights. Thus, <em>Anderson, </em>which is premised upon the existence of a \u201cwaiver ... requiring [the accused] to submit his person and property to search and seizure at any time by any law enforcement officer with or without a warrant,\u201d 256 Va. at 586, 507 S.E.2d at 342, has no bearing on the resolution of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The classic description of an effective waiver of a constitutional right is the \u201c \u2018intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u2019 \u201d <em>College Savings Bank </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>v. Fla. Expense Bd., </em>527 U.S. 666, \u2014, 119 S.Ct. 2219, 2229, 144 L.Ed.2d 605 (1999) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)). Moreover, the following principles are well established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">Courts indulge every reasonable presumption against a waiver of fundamental constitutional rights. The burden rests upon the party relying on a waiver to prove the essentials of such waiver by clear, precise and unequivocal evidence. The evidence must not leave the matter to mere inference or conjecture but must be certain in every particular.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\"><em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 559, 560, 203 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1974) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The document Megel signed contains no language that reasonably can be construed as either a consent to a search or seizure of his property or a waiver of his Fourth Amendment rights. \u201cIn Virginia, one does not relinquish constitutional rights by mere silence; there must be an affirmative act.\u201d <em>Pittman v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 693, 695, 395 S.E.2d 473, 474 (1990). Indeed, the trial judge made no finding that the rules and conditions or any other document Megel signed contained a waiver. Contrary to well established principles, the Commonwealth would have us presume a waiver. I reject that invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">The rules and conditions Megel signed state simply that the \u201cSheriffs Office staff will conduct home visits.\u201d No reasonable interpretation of that proviso gives rise to a waiver of Megel\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. Even if that proviso is construed to permit the Sheriffs staff to \u201clook around\u201d to ensure their safety, well established rules delimit the scope of that type of activity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">[A] protective sweep of a building without a warrant may be justified by exigent circumstances if the officers reasonably believe that there might be other persons on the premises who could pose a danger to them.... However, to excuse this departure from the usual requirement of a warrant, the executing officers must be able to \u201cpoint to specific and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>articulable facts\u201d supporting their belief that other dangerous persons may be in the building or elsewhere on the premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><em>United States v. Whitten, </em>706 F.2d 1000, 1014 (9th Cir.1983) (citation omitted). Furthermore, the Supreme Court has limited the degree of the intrusion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">We should emphasize that ... a protective sweep, aimed at protecting the ... officers, if justified by the circumstances, is nevertheless not a full search of the premises, but may extend only to a cursory inspection of those spaces where a person may be found. The sweep lasts no longer than is necessary to dispel the reasonable suspicion of danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-7\"><em>Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 335-36, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 1099, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990) (footnote omitted); <em>see also Arizona v. Hicks, </em>480 U.S. 321, 325, 107 S.Ct. 1149, 1152, 94 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987) (noting that the officers \u201ctaking action, unrelated to the objectives of the authorized intrusion, which exposed to view concealed portions of the apartment or its contents, did produce a new invasion of respondent\u2019s privacy unjustified by the exigent circumstance that validated the entry\u201d). Thus, even if the Sheriffs staff could \u201clook around\u201d under the guise of a protective sweep, that interpretation of the agreement Megel signed did not constitute a waiver of Megel\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights against a search of his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">The majority holds, instead, that Megel\u2019s \u201chome is the functional equivalent of his jail or prison cell.\u201d In my judgment, neither the circumstances of home detention nor the law governing Fourth Amendment expectations of privacy support the majority\u2019s analysis. That Megel was subject to the rules of the Community Corrections Program and could be returned to jail if he violated those rules does not establish that his home was the functional equivalent of jail. Indeed, those special rules and conditions and the threat that Megel could be returned to jail prove by their very nature that Megel\u2019s home was not functionally equivalent to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Although Megel was barred from using alcohol or drugs, the rules contained few other restrictions upon his conduct at home. Megel resided at home with a female friend and his child. He was permitted to shop for food and necessities for two hours each week, go to work, and go to church. He could receive unlimited visitors, make an unlimited number of telephone calls, and generally conduct his life while at home without supervision or restrictions, except for the possibility of unannounced visits by the Sheriffs staff. Given the circumstances under which Megel lawfully resided in his home, the majoritys assertion that Megel\u2019s home was the functional equivalent of a jail or prison cell defies logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Furthermore, the institutional security concerns that are inextricably bound to the definition and identity of prison and jail are not applicable in the program. The Fourth Amendment rights of prison and jail inmates are suspended because of the need within the institutional environment \u201cto preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.\u201d <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 547, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1878, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). The Supreme Court has noted that, because of the peculiar exigencies of the confined prison populations, it \u201cstrike[s] the balance in favor of institutional security, which ... is \u2018central to all other correction goals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 527, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3201, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). Those security concerns, however, are not the same outside prisons and jails.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Even the Commonwealth concedes on brief that \u201c[i]t is true that, in <em>Hudson, </em>... the Supreme Court, in holding that prisoners had no reasonable expectation of privacy in their prison cells, focused on the societal interest in institutional security.\u201d When the decision was made to allow Megel to participate in the home incarceration program, the Commonwealth dispensed \u201cwith the close and continual surveillance ... required to ensure institutional security and internal order.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>468 U.S. at 527-28, 104 S.Ct. at 3201. Few, if any, of the realities of prison and jail confinement that give rise to a diminished expectation of privacy naturally exist in home detention. \u201cIt is obvious that a jail shares none of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>attributes of privacy of a home.\u201d <em>Lanza v. New York, </em>370 U.S. 139, 143, 82 S.Ct. 1218, 1221, 8 L.Ed.2d 384 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Even if, by signing the rules and conditions governing home incarceration, Megel\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy \u201cwould be of a diminished scope,\u201d <em>Bell, </em>441 U.S. at 557, 99 S.Ct. at 1883, nothing in those rules and conditions can be construed to grant the government the extraordinary right to search Megel\u2019s home without a warrant. \u201c[C]onvicted persons do not forfeit all constitutional protections by reason of their conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545, 99 S.Ct. at 1877. In short, the limitations placed on Megel\u2019s freedom of movement fail to establish that his home was the functional equivalent of a jail cell, and the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence governing expectations of privacy in jails and prisons is not implicated in home detention programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The Commonwealth also attempts to justify the search of Megel\u2019s apartment based on consent. However, \u201c \u2018[c]onsent to a search ... must be unequivocal, specific and intelligently given ... and it is not lightly to be inferred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Elliotte v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 234, 239, 372 S.E.2d 416, 419 (1988) (citation omitted). Whenever the Commonwealth alleges that a search was consensual, \u201c[t]he [Commonwealth] ... bears the burden of establishing consent and this burden is heavier where the alleged consent is based on an implication.\u201d <em>Walls, </em>2 Va.App. at 645, 347 S.E.2d at 178. Moreover, the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cburden ... is not satisfied by showing a mere submission to a claim of lawful authority.\u201d <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 497, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1324, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983); <em>see also Bumper v. North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 548-49, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 1792, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The evidence proved that a deputy sheriff and two detectives went to Megel\u2019s residence. One of the detectives testified that the following occurred when Megel opened his door:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahqc\">Deputy Kidwell told [Megel] that he was going to check the house, said that they had some information, that they wanted to look around. I then identified myself as a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>officer ... and then I went to the back room. It was a one bedroom apartment. I went to do a cursory check of the back bedroom and came back and then spoke to [Megel] again....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">I told [Megel] that, basically, why we were there. I told him I was with the narcotics section in Fairfax County Police and we received some information that he might have some drugs in the house. Did he have anything? And he said, no, [he] did not. And I asked him again, are you sure that there is nothing in here illegal, no drugs. He said, no, go ahead and look around. And that is when myself and Detective Longerbeam looked around.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The trial judge found that \u201cMegel\u2019s own testimony indicated that he believed he was required to permit the sheriff to search his home at any time the sheriff came for a home visit.\u201d In view of Megel\u2019s testimony and that of the detective, the trial judge \u201cconclude[d] that ... Megel consented to the ... request to search, thus, obviating the need for <em>a </em>warrant.\u201d That conclusion is not supported by the facts or the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">When the officers entered Megel\u2019s apartment they did not ask his permission to search. The detective testified that the deputy sheriff <em>\u201ctold </em>[Megel] ... he was going to check the house.\u201d (Emphasis added). The detective then went \u201cinto the back bedroom and [took] a quick look around the apartment, [to] make sure that it was safe ... to be in there.\u201d The trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Megel believed the officers were permitted to search whenever they visited vitiates any claim by the Commonwealth that Megel consented. The prosecution\u2019s \u201cburden of proving that the consent was, in fact, freely and voluntarily given ... cannot be discharged by showing no more than acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority.\u201d <em>Bumper, </em>391 U.S. at 548-49, 88 S.Ct. at 1792 (footnote omitted). Indeed, where as here, Megel\u2019s subjective belief was also based on the incorrect view that the officers had a right to search, the Commonwealth\u2019s difficulty is compounded.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">For example, if the Government were suddenly to announce on nationwide television that all homes henceforth would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>subject to warrantless entry, individuals thereafter might not in fact entertain any actual expectation of privacy regarding their homes, papers, and effects. Similarly, if a refugee from a totalitarian country, unaware of this Nation\u2019s traditions, erroneously assumed that police were continuously monitoring his telephone conversations, a subjective expectation of privacy regarding the contents of his calls might be lacking as well. In such circumstances, where an individual\u2019s subjective expectations had been \u201cconditioned\u201d by influences alien to well-recognized Fourth Amendment freedoms, those subjective expectations obviously could play no meaningful role in ascertaining what the scope of Fourth Amendment protection was. In determining whether a \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy\u201d existed in such cases, a normative inquiry would be proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><em>Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 740-41 n. 5, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 2580, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979); <em>see also United States v. Ladell, </em>127 F.3d 622, 624 (7th Cir.1997) (noting that one of the questions in determining the legitimacy of consent to search is whether \u201cthe person who gave the consent knew it could be withheld\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Clearly, the officers and Megel believed that Megel\u2019s consent was not required for the officers to search his home without a warrant. Megel merely acquiesced to the officers\u2019 claim of lawful authority and did so based upon a faulty premise. Furthermore, Megel said the detective could \u201clook around\u201d only after the deputy sheriff asserted his authority to \u201clook around.\u201d That is not \u201cunequivocal, specific\u201d consent to search. <em>Elliotte, </em>7 Va.App. at 239, 372 S.E.2d at 419. No one asked for Megel\u2019s consent to search, and he gave no consent for a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Because Megel neither consented to the search nor waived his Fourth Amendment rights, I would reverse the trial judge\u2019s refusal to suppress the evidence that resulted from the warrantless search of Megel\u2019s home.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201cWe are not dealing with formalities. The presence of a search warrant serves a high function. Absent some grave emergency, the Fourth Amendment has interposed a magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>trate between the citizen and the police. This was done not to shield criminals nor to make the home a safe haven for illegal activities. It was done so that an objective mind might weigh the need to invade that privacy in order to enforce the law.... We cannot be true to that constitutional requirement and excuse the absence of a search warrant \u25a0without a showing by those who seek exemption from the constitutional mandate that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 761, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 2039, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Prior to trial, Megel filed a motion for discovery of exculpatory evidence, which specifically requested \u201c[t]he psychiatric records and/or history of all government witnesses.\u201d Although the trial judge ordered the Commonwealth to provide exculpatory evidence, the Commonwealth failed to produce the psychiatric records of its witness, Veronica Barnick. At trial, Barnick testified and lied about her treatment in a psychiatric facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\u201c[T]he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). As the Supreme Court has emphasized, \u201c[t]his ... means the individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 1567, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). Furthermore, the Court has ruled that \u201cfavorable evidence is material, and constitutional error results from its suppression by the government, \u2018if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433-34, 115 S.Ct. at 1565 (quoting <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985)). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u201c[a] \u2018reasonable probability* of a different result is accordingly shown when the Government\u2019s evidentiary suppression \u2018undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u2019\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. at 1566.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The Commonwealth relied heavily on Bamick\u2019s testimony that the guns were not hers. Her credibility was pivotal to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. The evidence proved, however, that Barnick initially told a police officer that the guns were hers. In addition, Megel produced witnesses at trial who testified they sold the guns to Barnick. The undisclosed psychiatric evidence was favorable to Megel within the <em>Brady </em>rale because it could have been used for impeachment purposes. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3380, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). The failure to produce impeachment evidence that would have discredited Bamick\u2019s testimony undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">For these reasons, I would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
