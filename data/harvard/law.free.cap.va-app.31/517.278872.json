We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u2018the burden is upon the defendant to show that the ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u2019\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted). \u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards such as probable cause and reasonable suspicion to the particular facts of the case.\u201d <em>Hayes v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 647, 652, 514 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1999) (citation omitted). \u201cIn performing such analysis, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee, </em>25 Va.App. at 198, 487 S.E.2d at 261 (quoting <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">On March 29, 1997, Officer Timothy Morton of the Chesterfield County Police Department, while patrolling Cloverleaf Mall in Chesterfield, received \u201ca call from Mall security to assist ... with a subject [defendant] that they wanted to ban from the Mall.\u201d Morton approached and asked defendant to \u201cstep back to the security office.\u201d Defendant accompanied Morton a short distance but suddenly \u201cveer[ed] off\u2019 from the office. When Morton advised defendant, \u201cit would be in your best interest to get you to Mall security and get you banned and get you out of here,\u201d he responded, \u201cThey ain\u2019t going to ban me for that shit.\u201d Morton then arrested defendant \u201cfor profanity in public,\u201d a Class 3 misdemeanor, handcuffed and \u201cwalked\u201d him to the security office, \u201cwhere the summons ... and the papers are kept.\u201d Once inside, defendant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and \u201cthoroughly searched,\u201d resulting in discovery of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In support of his contention that the search was in violation of the Fourth Amendment, requiring suppression of the related evidence, defendant asserts that a \u201cbrief detention\u201d incidental to the issuance of a summons for a Class 3 misdemean- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>or does not rise to a custodial arrest or otherwise justify a search of the accused. Defendant further contends that he was subjected to a custodial arrest in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-74(A)(2), a circumstance that he maintains also requires suppression of the evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">It is well established that, following \u201ca <em>lawful custodial arrest </em>[,] a full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a \u2018reasonable\u2019 search under that Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 477, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973) (emphasis added). However, the Supreme Court has refused to extend this \u201cbright-line rule\u201d to a \u201csearch incident to citation\u201d related to a \u201croutine traffic stop.\u201d <em>Knowles v. Iowa, </em>525 U.S. 113, 118, 119 S.Ct. 484, 488, 142 L.Ed.2d 492 (1998). The Court reasoned that \u201cthe two historical rationales for the \u2018search incident to arrest\u2019 exception[,] (1) the need to disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody, and (2) the need to preserve evidence for later use at trial[,]\u201d did not attend such \u201crelatively brief\u2019 police/citizen \u201cencounter[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116, 119 S.Ct. at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Subsequently, in <em>Lovelace v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 588, 522 S.E.2d 856 (1999), the Supreme Court of Virginia, guided by the rationale of <em>Knowles, </em>concluded that Class 3 and 4 misdemeanors were \u201csimilar in nature and duration to a routine traffic stop\u201d and did not \u201ccontemplate[ ] a custodial situation equivalent to an actual custodial arrest.\u201d <em>Lovelace, </em>258 Va. at 596, 522 S.E.2d at 860; <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-74(A)(2). Thus, \u201can \u2018arrest\u2019 that is effected by issuing a citation or summons rather than taking the suspect into custody does not, by itself, justify a full field-type search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596, 522 S.E.2d at 860. The Court recognized, however, that such \u201can encounter between [police] and an individual ... may involve some degree of danger to the officer or ... need to preserve or discover evidence sufficient to warrant an additional intrusion,\u201d \u201climited to what is necessary to answer the concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>raised by ... either historical rationale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 522 S.E.2d at 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Here, Officer Morton was authorized by Code \u00a7 19.2-74(A)(2) only to issue defendant a summons for a Class 3 misdemeanor. Nevertheless, defendant was handcuffed and escorted to a security room to afford Morton access to his \u201csummons book\u201d and other \u201cpapers.\u201d The record establishes neither a need to preserve evidence nor safety concerns<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in support of the custodial equivalent to arrest and the related search of defendant\u2019s person. <em>See id. </em>at 597, 522 S.E.2d at 860; <em>see also Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 737, 742, 519 S.E.2d 831, 833 (1999); <em>Rhodes v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 641, 645, 513 S.E.2d 904, 906 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Accordingly, the trial court erroneously denied the motion to suppress, and we reverse and remand for such further proceedings as the Commonwealth may deem appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\">. We find that this issue is subsumed in our resolution of the constitutional argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b563-14\">. If, as the Commonwealth asserts on brief, circumstances had accompanied the encounter which threatened Morton, the \"thorough search\u201d of defendant clearly exceeded the \"limited\u201d \"additional intrusion ... [ ] necessary to answer the concerns.\u201d <em>Lovelace, </em>258 Va. at 594, 522 S.E.2d at 859.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
