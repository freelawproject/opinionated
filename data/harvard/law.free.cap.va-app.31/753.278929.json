Husband specifically contends that the court (1) improperly declined to impute income to his former spouse, Diane Lynn Bingman Pellegrin (\u201cwife\u201d); (2) failed to consider wife\u2019s gross income earned from rental properties that she owned; (3) failed to consider husband\u2019s disability; and (4) failed to find wife was cohabiting on a \u201csubstantially full-time\u201d basis with her paramour, all in contravention of various provisions of the parties\u2019 Property Settlement Agreement (\u201cPSA\u201d) governing spousal support. Husband also contends the trial court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>The parties were divorced by final decree of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County on March 5, 1991. The decree incorporated the parties\u2019 PSA, whose provisions provide the basis of husband\u2019s claims on appeal. The trial court denied husband\u2019s petition seeking to terminate the spousal support he was obligated to pay to wife under the PSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Husband first contends the trial court erred in denying his petition to terminate support because the court failed to impute income to wife. The court\u2019s ruling is based on its construction of the PSA and its conclusion that since the agreement did not expressly require wife to seek and obtain employment, income could not be imputed to wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Husband contends the obligation is established by implication, noting Section 8 of the PSA, which reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\">If, as of May 1, 1995, the wife is employed or thereafter becomes employed with an annual gross income in excess of $25,000, husband\u2019s obligation to pay spousal support and maintenance shall be reduced by 50 percent of the amount by which wife\u2019s gross annual income exceeds $25,000, or by fifty percent of the amount by which wife\u2019s monthly income exceeds $2,083.33.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">The PSA also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-10\">[SJpousal support payments ... shall in any event be reduced to a maximum of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) per month, after wife\u2019s graduation from college, or June 1, 1997, whichever first occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">Finally, the PS\u00c1, also provides that husband \u201cshall pay, or cause to be paid, the tuition and related fees, not including room and board, for wife in any college, university with an accredited undergraduate and/or graduate degree program in which wife is enrolled, husband\u2019s liability and responsibility as to same to terminate as of June 1997.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Husband contends that because the PSA required him to pay for wife\u2019s college and graduate school education, and contemplated decreases in his obligation to support her as her income increased, the PSA should be construed as requiring wife to seek employment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">It is well established that a property settlement agreement is a contract between the parties and that their rights and obligations are defined under it. <em>See Douglas v. Hammett, </em>28 Va.App. 517, 523, 507 S.E.2d 98, 101 (1998) (separation agreements and property settlement agreements are contracts); <em>Jones v. Jones, </em>19 Va.App. 265, 268-69, 450 S.E.2d 762, 764 (1994) (\u201c[W]e must apply the same rules of interpretation [to property settlement agreements as are] applicable to contracts generally.\u201d); <em>Tiffany v. Tiffany, </em>1 Va.App. 11, 15, 332 S.E.2d 796, 799 (1985). \u201c\u201c\u2018[W]here a contract is complete on its face, is plain and unambiguous in its terms, the court is not at liberty to search for its meaning beyond the instrument <em>itself.Harris v. Woodrum, </em>3 Va.App. 428, 432, 350 S.E.2d 667, 669 (1986) (quoting <em>Berry v. Klinger, </em>225 Va. 201, 208, 300 S.E.2d 792, 796 (1983) (quoting <em>Globe Iron Const. Co. v. First Nat. Bank of Boston, </em>205 Va. 841, 848, 140 S.E.2d 629, 633 (1965))). In determining the intent of the parties, courts will generally not infer covenants and promises which are not contained in the written provisions. However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\">what is necessarily implied is as much a part of the instrument as if plainly expressed, and will be enforced as such. If the language of the instrument leaves the meaning of the parties in doubt, the court will take into consideration the occasion which gave rise to it, the obvious design of the parties, and the object to be attained, as well as the language of the instrument itself, and give effect to that construction which will effectuate the real intent and meaning of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-7\"><em>Va. Ry. &amp; Power Co. v. City of Richmond, </em>129 Va. 592, 611, 106 S.E. 529, 536 (1921) (citing <em>Southern Ry. Co. v. Franklin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number><em>&amp; P. R. Co., </em>96 Va. 693, 32 S.E. 485 (1899)). In determining the parties\u2019 intent, courts</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">are never shut out from the same light which the parties enjoyed when the contract was executed, and in that view they are entitled to place themselves in the same situation which the parties who made the contract occupied, so as to view the circumstances as they viewed them and so to judge of the meaning of the words and of the correct application of the language to the things described.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-6\"><em>Talbott v. Richmond &amp; Danville R.R. Co., </em>72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 685 (1879); <em>see also Paul v. Paul, </em>214 Va. 651, 653, 203 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1974) (\u201cAscertainment of the intent of the contracting parties is the cardinal rule in the construction of agreements. To do that the court will put itself in the situation occupied by the parties and look to the language employed, the subject matter and purpose of the parties, and all other pertinent circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">In the case before us, the record establishes that the parties agreed that husband\u2019s support obligation would be diminished as wife\u2019s income from employment increased. That wife would become employed was clearly within the contemplation of the parties. Furthermore, the parties agreed that the support obligation was keyed, in part, to wife earning her undergraduate degree, at which time husband\u2019s obligation to support was to diminish by a set amount. Furthermore, husband specifically agreed to pay the costs of wife\u2019s undergraduate and/or graduate degrees, an obligation which was to terminate seven years after the PSA was entered, specifically, June 1997. Given the circumstances attending the agreement, and the object to be attained, viz., that the level of support which wife could enjoy under the terms of the PSA was made dependant upon her ability to contribute to her own support or become wholly self-supporting, and that, in any event, wife\u2019s support would be reduced by a set amount upon obtaining her undergraduate degree, it follows, by implication, that the parties contemplated that wife would assume responsibility for her support within her capacity to earn income. In sum, we find that husband\u2019s agreement to pay for wife\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>educational costs after they divorced relates to wife\u2019s capacity to earn income, and when read together with the provisions requiring a reduction of support in relation to wife\u2019s earned income, established an implied contractual duty upon wife to make a reasonable effort to seek employment, at least, upon completion of her degree. Accordingly, because the trial court erred in finding no such duty arose from the terms of the contract, we remand for further proceedings based on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Husband further argues that rental income enjoyed by wife should be treated as \u201cincome from employment,\u201d but this contention previously was raised by husband in an earlier appeal and rejected by this Court in <em>Pellegrin v. Pellegrin, </em>No. 0143-96-4, 1996 WL 621643 (Va.Ct.App. Oct. 29, 1996). This issue therefore is barred as <em>res judicata, </em>and it will not be addressed further.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Husband argues also that his obligation to pay spousal support should have been terminated or reduced under the terms of the PSA because he is disabled. The provision at issue states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\">The parties agree that the [husband\u2019s] obligation to pay spousal support hereunder shall be subject to modification in the event of [husband\u2019s] disability causing reduction or loss of income on his part....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Husband failed to prove that he is disabled and that the disability caused a reduction in his income; indeed, he testified that he is \u201cworking harder than ever in his life,\u201d providing evidence which belies his claim of disability. This testimony plainly contradicted husband\u2019s earlier testimony as to a purported medical disability. Furthermore, husband presented no evidence that his medical disability, if any were proven, caused his claimed reduction in income, as required by the PSA. Consequently, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>conclusion that husband\u2019s health did not render him \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of the PSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Furthermore, we find no merit in husband\u2019s contention that the word \u201cdisability\u201d should not be limited to a disability personal to him and should be extended to encompass diminished ability to earn sufficient income due to factors such as down-turns in the economy, his employment status, or changes in his client base. Section 8 of the PSA makes clear that the meaning ascribed to the term \u201cdisability\u201d as contemplated by the parties was one personal to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Indeed, the law of the Commonwealth governing the disabled is consistent with that of the United States in deeming that a \u201c \u2018person with a disability\u2019 means any person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities....\u201d Code \u00a7 51.5-3; <em>cf. </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12102(2)(A). Because of Section 8\u2019s patent concern with the earning capacity <em>of the husband, </em>the term \u201cdisability\u201d as used in that section may only be inferred to concern a disability personal to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">In addition to the commonly accepted meaning of the term \u201cdisability\u201d as applied in pertinent law, Section 8 of the PSA states clearly that the disability in question must inhere in the husband. As is patent in husband\u2019s argument, the reduction of income of which he complains was caused by the financial vicissitudes of third parties; the PSA requires that the reduction or loss of income result <em>from husband\u2019s disability. </em>If the parties had intended that term to include unexpected business losses, they should have, and could have, specified that intent in their agreement. Having failed to do so, we will not redefine \u201cdisability\u201d to render it broader than its common usage and its context within the PSA suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Next, husband contends that the trial court erred in denying his petition for a reduction of spousal support because wife cohabits on a \u201csubstantially full-time\u201d basis with her paramour in contravention of Section 8 of the PSA. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>section provides, in pertinent part, that spousal support shall terminate if the wife \u201cfor any period of one month or more cohabits on a full-time or substantially full-time basis with a male non-relative.\u201d Thus, whether the husband\u2019s contention is valid depends upon the meaning of the word \u201ccohabit\u201d as contemplated by the PSA. <em>See Bergman v. Bergman, </em>25 Va.App. 204, 211-12, 487 S.E.2d 264, 267 (1997); <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>3 Va.App. 510, 513, 351 S.E.2d 593, 595 (1986) (\u201cIn Virginia, property settlement agreements are contracts subject to the same rules of formation, validity, and construction as other contracts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The PSA in question does not define the word \u201ccohabit.\u201d The term has been the subject of judicial construction in various contexts, however. <em>See, e.g., Schweider v. Schweider, </em>243 Va. 245, 248-49, 415 S.E.2d 135, 137 (1992) (construing the term within the context of a PSA); <em>Petachenko v. Petachenko, </em>232 Va. 296, 299, 350 S.E.2d 600, 602 (1986) (considering what constituted sufficient \u201ccohabitation\u201d to terminate a period of marital desertion); <em>Tarr v. Tarr, </em>184 Va. 443, 35 S.E.2d 401 (1945) (deciding what constituted \u201ccohabitation\u201d condoning a spouse\u2019s adultery); <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>152 Va. 965, 970, 146 S.E. 289, 291 (1929) (construing the term in a prosecution of criminal defendant for lewd and lascivious cohabitation); <em>Penrod v. Penrod, </em>29 Va.App. 96, 99-101, 510 S.E.2d 244, 245-46 (1999) (construing \u201ccohabit\u201d as intended in parties\u2019 PSA); <em>Frey v. Frey, </em>14 Va.App. 270, 275, 416 S.E.2d. 40, 43 (1992) (also construing cohabitation within intent of a PSA). A body of law of significant consistency which addresses the term\u2019s meaning emerges from these cases and those decided in our sister states,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> particularly those addressing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>issue in the context of property settlement agreements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The following factors generally have been considered relevant to the court\u2019s determination of whether cohabitation has been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">1. <em>Common residence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The requirement that the payee ex-spouse and that party\u2019s paramour be shown to have established and shared a common residence is firmly established in Virginia case law. <em>See Schweider, </em>248 Va. at 248-49, 415 S.E.2d at 187; <em>Frey, </em>14 Va.App. at 275, 416 S.E.2d at 48 (\u201ccohabitation, analogous to a marriage,\u201d means a status in which a man and woman live together continuously, or with some permanency, mutually assuming duties and obligations normally attendant with a marital relationship); <em>see also Petachenko, </em>232 Va. at 299, 350 S.E.2d at 602. The shared common residence factor has been utilized as an element of the definition of cohabitation even before its use in property settlement agreements. <em>See Johnson, </em>152 Va. at 970, 146 S.E. at 291 (cohabit means \u201cto live together in the same house as married persons live together, or in the manner of husband and wife\u201d). However, proof of a common or shared residence does not itself establish cohabitation. <em>See Bergman, </em>25 Va.App. at 213, 487 S.E.2d at 267 (citing <em>Schweider, </em>243 Va. at 248, 415 S.E.2d at 137; <em>Frey, </em>14 Va.App. at 273, 416 S.E.2d at 42).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">2. <em>Intimate or romantic involvement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">An intimate relationship does not necessarily require sexual intimacy. <em>See Penrod, </em>29 Va.App. at 101, 510 S.E.2d at 246 (a couple\u2019s sexual relationship alone is not a sufficient consideration in determining cohabitation). While sexual intimacy may provide significant proof of cohabitation, <em>see Frey, </em>14 Va.App. at 275, 416 S.E.2d at 43, other indicia of a couple\u2019s close, interrelated functioning are equally important. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number><em>See Penrod, </em>29 Va.App. at 101, 510 S.E.2d at 246; <em>see also Petachenko, </em>232 Va. at 299, 350 S.E.2d at 602. \u201c \u2018[Cohabitation] ... imports the ... continuing condition of living together and carrying out the mutual responsibilities of the ... relationship.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schweider, </em>243 Va. at 248, 415 S.E.2d at 137 (quoting <em>Petachenko, </em>232 Va. at 299, 350 S.E.2d at 602). <em>Compare Gordon v. Gordon, </em>342 Md. 294, 675 A.2d 540, 547 (1996) (\u201c[T]he ordinary definition of \u2018cohabitation,\u2019 describing a relationship of living together \u2018as man and wife,\u2019 connotes a mutual assumption of the duties and obligations associated with marriage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">3. <em>The provision of financial support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Several decisions include receipt of financial contributions from the paramour to the payee ex-spouse as a factor to be considered. <em>See Schweider, </em>243 Va. at 248-49, 415 S.E.2d at 137; <em>Frey, </em>14 Va.App. at 275, 416 S.E.2d at 43; <em>see also Petachenko, </em>232 Va. at 299, 350 S.E.2d at 602. \u201c[Contributions] to financial support [by the paramour] ... tend[ ] to prove the assumption of duties or obligations attendant to marriage----\u201d <em>Frey, </em>14 Va.App. at 275, 416 S.E.2d at 43. <em>See also Gordon, </em>675 A.2d at 548 (Maryland Court of Appeals found proof of shared assets and common bank accounts to be significant in determining cohabitation); <em>cf. In the Matter of the Marriage of Winningstad, </em>99 Or.App. 682, 784 P.2d 101, 104 (1989) (holding that without proof of such financial contribution, Oregon courts shall not terminate spousal support).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">4. <em>Duration and continuity of the relationship and other indicia of permanency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">In <em>Petachenko, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court made clear that marital cohabitation \u201cimports the <em>continuing condition </em>of living together.\u201d 232 Va. at 299, 350 S.E.2d at 602 (emphasis added); <em>see also Colley v. Colley, </em>204 Va. 225, 228-29, 129 S.E.2d 630, 632 (1963). No bright line test of duration has been established under our case law. <em>See, e.g., Penrod, </em>29 Va.App. at 98-101, 510 S.E.2d at 245-46 (dispositive evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>included intimate relationship of more than six years\u2019 duration between former wife and her paramour).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In addition to specific measures of time, courts have examined other factors of a more circumstantial nature which evidence stability and permanency to determine whether cohabitation has been proved. <em>See, e.g., Gordon, </em>675 A.2d at 548 (community\u2019s view of couple\u2019s relationship held probative in determining cohabitation); <em>Iowa v. Kellogg, </em>542 N.W.2d 514, 518 (Iowa 1996) (whether couple hold themselves out as \u201chusband and wife\u201d is an element in determining cohabitation).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, the other factors to be applied in determining cohabitation, i.e. common residence, intimate or romantic involvement, and provision of financial support, may also be probative of the continuity and duration of a relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">We emphasize that, although the enunciated factors provide discrete categories of evidence relevant to the issue, no one factor is determinative. <em>See Penrod, </em>29 Va.App. at 101, 510 S.E.2d at 246 (a court\u2019s findings \u201cmust be based upon evidence concerning the overall nature of the relationship, not merely a piecemeal consideration of individual factors\u201d); <em>Frey, </em>14 Va.App. at 275, 416 S.E.2d at 43 (trial courts must not give any single factor dispositive effect); <em>cf. Bergman, 25 </em>Va.App. at 213, 487 S.E.2d at 267 (\u201ccohabit\u201d and \u201cco-reside\u201d are not synonymous, each having distinct elements and meanings). Furthermore, it is within the province of the trial court to determine what weight to accord each of the factors relevant to the matter presented. <em>See Richardson v. Richardson, </em>242 Va. 242, 246, 409 S.E.2d 148, 151 (1991) (what weight to give the evidence is within the unique province of the trier of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Applying these principles to the instant case, we find the trial court did not err in determining that the evidence failed to prove cohabitation. The evidence, stated in the light most favorable to wife as the prevailing party, <em>see Anderson v. Anderson, </em>29 Va.App. 673, 677, 514 S.E.2d 369, 372 (1999), established that wife has been romantically involved in an exclusive relationship with her paramour since 1989, that their relationship has been marked by sexual intimacy since 1990, that they have attended family functions together, that they have vacationed together, and that they have made frequent visits to each other\u2019s homes. Wife\u2019s paramour has established a close and familial relationship with the parties\u2019 daughters. However, the evidence failed to prove that wife shared a common residence with him or that they mutually assumed the duties and obligations normally associated with a marriage. Although wife\u2019s companion undertook some of the household chores while in her home, scant evidence proved that he financially contributed to or supported her household in any significant way. Evidence that he loaned money to wife and her children and that he and wife regularly exchanged gifts is insufficient to establish the degree of financial interdependence generally associated with marital relationships. Based on this record and the requisite standard of review, we cannot say the trial court improperly weighed the factors or that the evidence established cohabitation as a matter of law. <em>See Konefal v. Konefal, </em>18 Va.App. 612, 614, 446 S.E.2d 153, 154 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Husband\u2019s final claim on appeal challenges the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to wife. Specifically, he challenges the award of $5,000 for attorney\u2019s fees the wife expended in the successful defense of the husband\u2019s motion to terminate spousal support; $500 for the fees she incurred in the enforcement of the PSA in a rule to show cause proceeding; and $10,000 for fees incurred in her defense of an action brought by husband to s\u00e9t aside the final decree of divorce and its incorporated PSA on the ground of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>The latter issue is <em>res judicata. </em>In an earlier appeal, the award of $10,000 attorney\u2019s fees was determined appropriate under, and consistent with, the PSA\u2019s provision governing such awards. <em>See Pellegrin v. Pellegrin, </em>No. 0765-98-4, 1998 WL 808385 (Va.Ct.App. Nov. 24, 1998) (rehearing denied, Va.Ct.App. Jan. 4, 1999) (petition for appeal filed in the Supreme Court, Jan. 25, 1999). The remaining claims with respect to the award of attorney\u2019s fees are controlled by the language of the PSA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-5\">The parties agree that any expenses, including but not limited to, counsel fees, court costs, and travel, incurred by a party in the successful enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement, whether through litigation or other action necessary to compel compliance herewith, shall be borne by the defaulting party.
