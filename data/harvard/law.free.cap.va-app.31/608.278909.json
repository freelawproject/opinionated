Great Eastern argues the commission erred in finding that Gordon proved by clear and convincing evidence, as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-401, that her right carpal tunnel syndrome was caused by her employment. We disagree and affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to Gordon, the party prevailing before the commission. <em>See R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990). So viewed, the evidence proved that Gordon worked for Great Eastern as a night auditor. As an auditor, she used her right hand to input the day\u2019s revenue and room charges on a machine called a \u201cmicro.\u201d The micro is a computerized cash register with a keyboard for entering data and a slot for entering invoices or \u201cfolios.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Gordon worked for Great Eastern eight hours per day, three days per week for seven and one-half years. Gordon testified that she operated the micro between one and three hours per shift, depending on how busy the resort was on a given day. She testified that due to the set-up of the work station, she was required to place her right hand at a forty-five degree angle while using her fingers to key in the data. She also fed vouchers and folios into the micro with her left hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">In January 1997, Gordon first noticed numbness in her fingers and pain in her right wrist. In January 1998, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>sought medical treatment from her regular physician, Dr. Raul Orviedo, for complaints of a herniated disc in her neck. She also reported wrist pain to Dr. Orviedo, who ordered that she undergo an MRI due to his concern that her symptoms might be related to her neck condition. After reviewing the MRI, Dr. Orviedo referred claimant to Dr. John A. Jane, Sr., a neurosurgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">Dr. Jane opined that the numbness in Gordon\u2019s hand and arm was not related to her neck problem and referred Gordon to Dr. Edward R. Laws, Jr., a neurosurgeon, for another opinion. In a May 22, 1998 letter to Dr. Jane, Dr. Laws diagnosed Gordon with carpal tunnel syndrome. Dr. Laws noted that Gordon\u2019s \u201cday-to-day work involves using an instrument called a \u2018micros\u2019 which is a type of computerized cash register. She has repetitive movements that have precipitated and aggravated the carpal tunnel syndrome, with which she presently presents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">On June 23, 1998, after operating on Gordon\u2019s right hand, Dr. Laws wrote that \u201c[h]er symptoms developed and became aggravated as she was using ... an instrument called a micros, which I understand is a computerized cash register. This type of hand problem is commonly associated with this type of repetitive occupational trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Gordon denied engaging in any hobbies or activities outside of her employment involving repetitive movements of her right hand. She admitted she had a long history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day and stated that she told Dr. Laws\u2019 nurse of this history. Gordon denied having been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome before May 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">\u201cWhether a disease is causally related to the employment and not causally related to other factors is ... a finding of fact.\u201d <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Breeding, </em>6 Va.App. 1, 12, 365 S.E.2d 782, 788 (1988). We accept the commission\u2019s factual findings when they are supported by credible evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>See James v. Capitol Steel Constr. Co., </em>8 Va.App. 512, 515, 382 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Since 1997, the Code has provided that \u201c \u2018condition[s] of carpal tunnel syndrome are not occupational diseases but are ordinary diseases of life as defined in [Code] \u00a7 65.2-401.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Fruit Prod. Co. v. Staton, </em>28 Va.App. 650, 654, 507 S.E.2d 667, 669 (1998). For an ordinary disease of life to be compensable, a claimant must prove by \u201cclear and convincing evidence, (not mere probability)\u201d that the disease (1) arose out of and in the course of his employment, (2) did not result from causes outside of the employment, and (3) follows as an incident of an occupational disease, is an infectious or contagious disease contracted in the course of the employment listed in Code \u00a7 65.2-401(2)(b), or is characteristic of the employment and was caused by conditions peculiar to the employment. Code \u00a7 65.2-401; <em>see also Lindenfeld v. City of Richmond Sheriffs Office, 25 </em>Va.App. 775, 784, 492 S.E.2d 506, 510 (1997). However, disability resulting from work-related aggravation of a pre-existing disease is not compensable. <em>See Ashland Oil Co. v. Bean, </em>225 Va. 1, 3-4, 300 S.E.2d 739, 740 (1983) (per curiam).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201cClear and convincing evidence has been defined as \u2018that measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established. It is intermediate, being more than a mere preponderance, but not to the extent of such certainty as is required beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. It does not mean clear and unequivocal.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-6\"><em>National Fruit, </em>28 Va.App. at 654, 507 S.E.2d at 669 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The employer contends that based on Dr. Laws\u2019 reports and opinions Gordon\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome necessarily pre-existed the repetitive motion at work. The employer reasons that because Dr. Laws stated, \u201cthe symptoms developed and became aggravated as she was using ... an instrument called a micros,\u201d and because he used the terminology <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u201cprecipitated\u201d and \u201caggravated\u201d to describe the development of Gordon\u2019s condition, the condition had to pre-exist in order to be \u201caggravated\u201d or precipitated. Thus, the employer argues, relying upon the holding in <em>Ashland Oil, </em>the aggravation of a pre-existing disease is not compensable. The employer further argues that, at best, Dr. Laws\u2019 report as to causation is ambiguous and equivocal and is not sufficient to satisfy the claimant\u2019s burden under Code \u00a7 65.2-401 of proving by clear and convincing evidence that this ordinary disease of life was causally related to her work. We find that the commission\u2019s decision is supported by credible evidence and that the proof satisfies the clear and convincing standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Dr. Laws\u2019 opinion and Gordon\u2019s testimony constitute credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s findings that Gordon\u2019s repetitive motion at work was the cause of her right carpal tunnel syndrome and that the disease did not pre-exist her repetitive motion at work. \u201cCarpal Tunnel Syndrome is defined as: a complex of symptoms resulting from compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, with pain and burning or tingling paresthesias in the fingers and hand, sometimes extending to the elbow.\u201d <em>Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary </em>1289 (26th ed.1985). Based upon Dr. Laws\u2019 statements in his May 22, 1998 and June 23, 1998 letters, the commission reasonably found that \u201cclaimant\u2019s employment was the \u2018precipitating\u2019 factor which caused [her carpal tunnel syndrome] to \u2018develop.\u2019 \u201d \u201cPrecipitate\u201d is defined as \u201cto cause to move or act very rapidly\u201d; \u201cto cause to happen or come to a crisis suddenly or unexpectedly.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1784 (1993). On this record, the commission could, and obviously did, find that Dr. Laws\u2019 use of the terms \u201cprecipitated\u201d or \u201caggravated\u201d did not indicate that Gordon had a pre-existing disease. Rather, the commission found that his use of the terminology described the effect that the repetitive motion at work had upon causing or \u201cprecipitating\u201d or \u201caggravating\u201d the disease process to the median nerve. Significantly, no evidence proved that Gordon had carpal tunnel syndrome or experienced symptoms related to the disease prior to her work and no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>proved that any causes outside her work contributed to cause the condition. Furthermore, no evidence proved that carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition which may lie dormant and only become symptomatic when external aggravating factors are brought to bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">\u201cWhere reasonable inferences may be drawn from the evidence in support of the commission\u2019s factual findings, they will not be disturbed by this Court on appeal.\u201d <em>Hawks v. Henrico County Sch. Bd., </em>7 Va.App. 398, 404, 374 S.E.2d 695, 698 (1988). Based upon Dr. Laws\u2019 opinions and Gordon\u2019s testimony, the commission, as the trier of facts, could conclude that the evidence proved clearly and convincingly that (1) the repetitive trauma at work caused the right carpal tunnel syndrome and (2) that prior to the repetitive trauma at work, Gordon did not have right carpal tunnel syndrome and did not engage in repetitive activity outside work that caused or contributed to cause the development of this ordinary disease of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
