In an affidavit in support of a motion for the continuance of a bastardy case, where the ground is the absence of a material witness, it is sufficient to allege that the witness would testify that at or about the time the child was conceived the witness saw a man, other than the defendant, having sexual intercourse with the prosecuting witness. It is not necessary to state the name of the absent witness.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b331-7\">2. In case of such continuance, no new recognizance for the appearance of the defendant at the next term of Court is necessary. The condition of the appeal recognizance covers, not only the appearance of the defendant at the first term, but his appearance during the entire time of the prosecution of the suit, and requires that he shall prosecute his appeal with effect, and not depart the Court without leave.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b331-8\">\n<em>(April 3, 1903.)</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b331-9\">Lore, C.
