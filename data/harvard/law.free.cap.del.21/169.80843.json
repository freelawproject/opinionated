D. 1903, at Kent County aforesaid, falsely, wickedly and maliciously did publish and cause and procure to be published in a certain newspaper called \u2018 The Index/ the said newspaper then and there having a large circulation in said Kent County, of and concerning the said plaintiff, certain false, scandalous, malicious and defamatory words, containing amongst other things the false, malicious, scandalous and defamatory matter following, that is to say:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-6\">\u201c\u2018 County Work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-7\">\u201c\u2018We (meaning the said defendant) are informed that after the bid of Contractor Hirons ( meaning one Hirons, a citizen of said county, who had submitted a bid to the Levy Court of said county for making certain changes in the County Building in the said county) was handed into the Levy Court (meaning the Levy Court of Kent County) Levy Courtman Benson ( meaning the said plaintiff) took him ( meaning the said Hirons, bidder as aforesaid) aside and after a whispered conversation (meaning a whispered conversation between said plaintiff and said Hirons, bidder as aforesaid ) Hirons ( meaning the said Hirons, bidder as aforesaid ) raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>his bid (meaning his said bid for making said changes in said County Building) from $1,600 to $1,700 ( meaning that the said plaintiff as Levy Court Commissioner as aforesaid, unlawfully, corruptly and dishonestly advised said contractor as aforesaid, to increase his said bid so that the cost of said work to said Kent County would be $100 more than the said Hirons was then and there ready and willing to do the same for.) We (meaning the said defendant ) do not find fault with Mr. Hirons (meaning Mr. Hirons, bidder as aforesaid,) he ( meaning the said Hirons, bidder as aforesaid,) like most men, wants all he can get for his (meaning the said Hirons) work. But why is it that other contractors (meaning other persons who had bid for county work given out by said Levy Court) have no chance to get county (meaning Kent County) contracts ? Perhaps it is like the county (meaning Kent County) printing and supplies (meaning printing done for and goods, wares and merchandise furnished to said Kent County). Mr. Benson (meaning the said plaintiff) has selected his man ( meaning the said Hirons, contractor as aforesaid) and as he (meaning the said plaintiff) runs the Levy Court (meaning the Levy Court of Kent County) he (meaning the said plaintiff) gives out contracts ( meaning contracts for work and labor done and materials furnished to said Kent County ) to suit himself ( meaning the said plaintiff) and when he ( meaning the said plaintiff) sees an opportunity, he ( meaning the said plaintiff) gives his ( meaning the said plaintiff) friends a chance to raise their bids ( meaning that the said plaintiff and Levy Court Commissioner as aforesaid, unlawfully, corruptly and dishonestly conveyed information of the amount of bids submitted to the Levy Court for county work or supplies for said Kent County to friends of his, so that they might raise the amount of their bids for said work and supplies to be furnished said county, and thereafter obtain from said Levy Court through the acts of the said plaintiff the contract for the performance of said contract).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-5\"><em>\u201c \u2018 </em>Small wonder that the tax rate ( meaning the tax rate of Kent County) is increased and the county ( meaning Kent County ) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>has no money. $100 (meaning the $100 increase of said Hirons\u2019 bids for work in making changes in the county building of Kent County aforesaid) is not much, but many such jugglings with bids means a large waste of the county\u2019s money. We (meaning the defendant) should like to know from Mr. Benson ( meaning the plaintiff) what became of the extra $100 ( meaning the $100 which said Hirons increased his bid aforesaid, by reason of the unlawful, corrupt and dishonest advice of the said plaintiff as Levy Court Commissioner as aforesaid ) and why he cries Graft and rake-off against other people when bids for county work (meaning work for Kent County) are raised at his (meaning the said plaintiff) suggestion. (Meaning that bids submitted to said Levy Court to do work for said Kent County were dishonestly, corruptly and unlawfully changed to greater amounts than the amount therein originally contained by and through the unlawful, corrupt and dishonest advice and assistance of the said plaintiff as Levy Court Commissioner as aforesaid, whereby the citizens and community of Kent County aforesaid, were defrauded out of large sums of money.)

Near the end of the same paragraph after the words \u201c obtain from said Levy Court through the,\u201d the words \u201c unlawful, illegal and corrupt,\u201d were used in said second, fourth and fifth counts. In the second paragraph of said libelous matter, in the innuendo as to what became of the extra $100, after the word \u201c corrupt \u201d the word \u201c evil \u201d was used; and in the innuendo following the word \u201c suggestion \u201d in the same paragraph, immediately after the word <em>\u201c </em>unlawfully \u201d the words \u201c with evil intent \u201d were used, and in the same innuendo after the words \u201c Levy Court Commissioner as aforesaid \u201d the clause \u201c given and done by said plaintiff as such Levy Court Commissioner, with evil intent,\u201d were used in said second, fourth and fifth counts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-8\">The causes of demurrer filed to the first and third counts of the declaration were as follows, viz :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-9\">1.

For that it does not appear anywhere in the said count what the bid referred to in the alleged libel related to and whether the same was for public purposes or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-8\">8. For that the said plaintiff in the said count does not inform this defendant upon what charges or statements in the said supposed libelous article therein set out he relies for his cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-9\">9. For that the said count does not contain any distinct statement showing in what way the plaintiff was injured by said publication of the said article quoted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-10\">10. For that the said count does not show that part of the said supposed libelous publication is libelous and what part is not, so that the libelous part may be pleaded to by this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-11\">11. For that the said count does not allege what offences and misconduct were imputed to the said plaintiff by the said supposed libelous publication so that the same may be traversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-12\">12. For that the said count is not sufficiently particular and definite to enable this defendant to plead thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-13\">The following additional causes of demurrer were filed to counts 2, 4, 5 and 6, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-14\">1. For that the said count does not aver any duty or authority on the part of the Levy Court Commissioners of Kent County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>to receive bids or proposals or award any contracts for any work and supplies at the time referred to in the alleged libelous publication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-4\">2. For that the said count does not allege that it was the duty of the Levy Court Commissioners of Kent County to award contracts for work and supplies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWCn\">6. For that the said count states the powers of the Levy Court Commissioners of Kent County in relation to making repairs of County Buildings in said county and receiving proposals for bids for the making of such repairs as a conclusion of law, and by way of recital and does not state the same in detail, directly and positively, as it should do.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Apd\">Defendant\u2019s Brief on Demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s declaration contains five counts. In all of the counts, the declaration recites but does not aver that the plaintiff was a Levy Court Commissioner of Kent County. It is recited that the plaintiff \u201c at the several times hereinafter mentioned and for a long time before was and still is one of the Levy Court Commissioners of Kent County\u201d but nowhere is it specifically averred that he was a Levy Court Commissioner at the time of the alleged libel or at any other time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">The first and third counts do not attempt to define the powers and duties of the Levy Court of Kent County or of the plaintiff as a member thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATn\">The second, fourth and fifth counts do attempt to state by way of recital that \u201cthe said Levy Court had and has cognizance and control of the making and repairs of all County Buildings in said county and was and is authorized to receive proposals or bids for the making of such repairs \u201d but does not aver or state in any way the duty of the Levy Court of Kent County or of the plaintiff as a member thereof or that it was his or its duty to award contracts to the lowest bidder or otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>The part of the alleged libel which appears to be relied on in the said declaration is that part which refers to the raise of a particular bid by contractor Hirons and there is no statement or averment relating to the same in the inducement of the said counts. The only attempt to state extrinsic facts is by way of innuendo.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">It is submitted that the publication set out in the several counts of the declaration, if published, in relation to one holding no office or having no duty to perform in relation to the transaction therein referred to, would not be libelous. It is therefore necessary to aver in the declaration such extrinsic facts and circumstances as will make the publication when read in connection therewith, libelous. The declaration should state that the plaintiff was a Levy Court Commissioner at the time of the receiving of bids referred to in the publication; that it was the duty of the Levy Court to receive bids and proposals for work at that time and their duty to award contracts therefor to the lowest bidder or bidders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">\n<em>Rice vs. Simmons, 2 Harr., 417; 1 Chitty\u2019s Pleading, 400, 402, 406 ; 407 ; Newell on Defamation, 613; Townsend on Slander and Libel, Section 335.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">Chief Justice Shaw in the case of <em>Commonwealth vs. David L.
