J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AfTF\">We think there ought not to be a severance on the ground stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-5\">At the trial of the case on February 4, Ella' Bird, wife of the defendant, Samuel Bird, was produced as a witness for the defendant Smith; <em>Reinhardt, </em>counsel for defendants, stating to the Court that his object in offering Mrs. Bird was to prove an <em>alibi </em>for Smith and that he did not propose to ask her any question concerning the other defendant, her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-6\"><em>Ward, </em>Attorney-General, objected to the competency of the witness on the ground that as the two defendants were jointly indicted, any testimony that she might give for the benefit of Smith would also tend to benefit her husband, the other defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-7\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014We understand that the defense here is an <em>alibi </em>and that this witness is offered as to the defendant Smith only ?</p>\n<p id=\"b10-8\"><em>Mr. </em>Reinhardt:\u2014As to Smith <em>only; </em>not in the slightest as to Bird.</p>\n<author id=\"b10-9\">Boyce, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"Au4\">\u2014We think that this witness is competent to testify on behalf of Smith, but not in any way as to Bird.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-10\">The witness then testified as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b10-11\">\n<em>By Mr. Reinhardt :</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b10-12\">Q.

Whose feathers were those in the two upstairs rooms in your house ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b11-23\">(Objected to by the Attorney-General as immaterial.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b11-24\">Boyce, J.: We sustain the objection as to the feathers. They were not in Smith\u2019s possession according to the testimony in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-26\">Q,. Did William Smith put those feathers there in those rooms ?</p>\n<p id=\"b11-27\">(Objected to by the Attorney-General.)</p>\n<p id=\"b11-28\">Boyce, J.:\u2014We sustain the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-29\">Q.

Do you own chickens of your own ?</p>\n<p id=\"b11-32\">(Objected to by the Attorney-General as incompetent.)</p>\n<p id=\"b12-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Boyce, J.:\u2014The objection is sustained. The testimony must be confined to the defendant Smith. The wife cannot testify in behalf of the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-5\">(The Court gave the usual charge in larceny cases.)</p>\n<p id=\"b12-6\">Verdict, guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
