This has been regularly placed upon the trial list, under the rules of Court requiring that cases at issue twenty days before the convening of the Court shall be placed upon the list, and we think the affidavit discloses all that is necessary. Let the case be continued until the April Term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
