Griffenberg at Glasgow in Pencader Hundred on the 8th day of August, 1904, in the store of Samuel Alrichs, where-the Regular Republican primary election for delegates to the State convention was being held. The plaintiff testified that he was sitting on the counter in said store and that the defendant and two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u25a0or three others were standing around near him conversing about the manner in which the ticket for delegates had been made up and that he, Griffenberg, became angry and remarked \u201c Do you Union Republicans think you have a right to vote here to-day ?\u201d accompanying the remark with a gesture or wave of the hand towards a group of men including the defendant; that thereupon the defendant stepped up to the prosecuting witness and hit him a blow with his clenched fist on the left cheek from which he suffered pain for \u00a1several days. That the prosecuting witness then said to the defendant \u201c You will have this to pay for,\u201d to which the defendant replied, \u201cWell, if I\u2019ve got it to pay for, if you say so I will give you some more and pay for it all together.\u201d There was some conflict of testimony as to whether the defendant struck the prosecuting witness with his open hand or clenched fist. The defendant testified that when Griffenberg made the gesture towards him he immediately struck the former a light blow thinking Griffenberg intended to strike him and that the assault on his own part was merely to resent the insulting conduct of Griffenberg. The defendant could not say positively whether his hand was open or \u25a0closed when the blow was delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-4\">The defendant\u2019s counsel in the course of his cross-examination of the prosecuting witness asked the latter whether he had brought a civil action for damages against the defendant Ratledge for the same assault for which the defendant was being tried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">This was objected to by the Attorney-General as irrelevant. <em>Mr. Reinhardt </em>contended that the testimony was admissible in mitigation of the fine which might be imposed should the defendant be convicted, also as showing malice on the part of the complainant, citing <em>3 Cyclopaedia of Law and Procedure, </em>(title, \u201cAssault and Battery\u201d), <em>157; Tatnall vs. Courtney, 6 Houst, 434)</em></summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b100-7\">Lore, C.
