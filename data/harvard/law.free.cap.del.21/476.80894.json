D. 1905, before me, Walter Pardoe, Prothonotary of the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for Kent County, personally comes Alvin B. Conner, the defendant in the above stated suit, who having been by me duly affirmed according to law, doth depose and say that he is the defendant in the above stated <em>suit; </em>that he verily believes that there is a legal defense to the whole of the cause of action in the above stated suit, the nature and character whereof is as follows, that there is nothing due and owing from the said defendant to said plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>(The above affidavit was duly signed and affirmed by the affiant.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-8\"><em>Harrington, for </em>plaintiffs:\u2014We ask for judgment notwithstanding the affidavit of defense.
