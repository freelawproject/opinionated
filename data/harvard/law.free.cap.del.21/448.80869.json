Because the report of the commissioners in this case was not filed until October 5th (after the Court had adjourned over until the following Monday, October 9th), whereas under the rule of Court it should have been filed on the first Monday of the term, which was October 2d. I was therefore prevented from filing exceptions to the report, because under the rule of Court the exceptians must be filed to ditch returns on the first Friday of the term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-30\">2. The law states specifically that a plot must be filed with the return of the commissioner. In this case there has been no plot filed. Therefore we could not except to the plot and we could not except to the return or the report of the commissioners under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the rule of Court; and for these reasons I ask that the petition and proceedings be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ac9\"><em>Mr. </em>White:\u2014This report is not completed. I move to extend the time until the next term, in order that the commissioners may complete their report. It is not a final report of referees. The plot is not with it, and I am informed that the reason for that is that the surveyor has not had time to make the survey. We do not want to treat this report as filed at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-11\"><em>Mr. </em>Moore:\u2014It is endorsed as filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-12\"><em>Mr. </em>White:\u2014I take it, as it is incomplete, that it cannot be confirmed and will be remanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0H\"><em>Mr. Moore: </em>\u2014If there had been no report, the motion for a continuance would be proper, and I could not have objected ; but to do as Mr. White requests would be a very lame and loose practice. There is great opposition to this ditch, and we ask the Court to construe this law strictly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ADf\"><em>Mr. </em>White:\u2014Even if it had been filed the Court would remand it and not dismiss it. And if your Honors should hold that it was filed, then I ask under the practice of this Court that it be remanded to the commissioners. This filing on the fifth was like this; the surveyor put it in the clerk\u2019s office and said he could not complete the plot. The filing was an inadvertence and we ask that it may be stricken off and that your Honors will treat it as not filed. Then we ask that the time be extended until the next term of Court to complete the order. The order is not complete and we cannot file an incomplete order.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AV-\">\n<em>Per Curiam :</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Avh\">There is nothing in the statute requiring that the report of the commissioners shall be filed the first day of the term. We remand the return to the commissioners, and continue the case until the April Term of Court, 1906.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
