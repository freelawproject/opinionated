Code Ch. 89, Sec. 89), </em>but there is no such statutory requirement in case of affidavits of the character now under consideration, and there is no reported case in this State in which the question has been determined.</p>\n<p id=\"AE6\">If an affidavit is valid without the signature of the affiant, it necessarily follows that the affiant would be liable to indictment for perjury if his affidavit is wilfully false.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In <em>Bates vs. Robinson, Supra, </em>the Court held that it is not essential that the affiant sign the oath, and that he is as liable to the penalties of perjury, if he does not sign as if he does.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The signature of the affiant would usually be sufficient to-identify him as the person taking the oath, but as to this and all other matters relating to the affidavit, the certificate of the officer under his hand and official seal is conclusive in the absence of sufficient evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">\n<em>Rev. Code Ch. 118 Sec. 9; Hanson vs. Cochran, 9 Houst. 192.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">The second ground of objection to the affidavit is that the affiant does not depose that he is the mortgagor named in the-mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">The description of the affiant as \u201c George P. Knight, mortgagor,\u201d is a sufficient designation of him as the person who made the mortgage, and it was not necessary that he should in express terms depose that he was the mortgagor named in the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">While it is almost the universal practice in this State for affidavits to be signed by the persons making them, and while this is the safe and better practice, we are of the opinion that the signature of the affiant was not essential in this case, and that the affidavit endorsed upon and recorded with the mortgage is sufficient.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
