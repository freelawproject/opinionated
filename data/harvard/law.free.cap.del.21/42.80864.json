St., 434.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-8\">4. \u201c Claims against a dead man\u2019s estate, which might have been made against himself, while living, are always subjects of just suspicion, and our books from <em>Graham vs. Graham, 34 Pa., 475, to Miller\u2019s Est., 136 Pa., 239 (249), </em>are full of expressions by this Court of the necessity of strict requirement of proof and the firm control of juries in such cases. The present is no better than most of its class.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Wages for domestic service are presumed to be paid at the periods customary at the time and in the neighborhood, and claims for such wages for unusual length of time, and especially those not made until after the claimant has left the service, must be supported by affirmative proof that they have not been paid. As said by Strong, J., speaking of the similar presumption of payment of a bond after the lapse of twenty years, the legal presumption shifts the burden of proof, and \u201c after twenty years the creditor is bound to show by something more than his bond, that the debt has not been paid. <em>Reed vs. Reed, 46 Pa. 239. </em>The English rule in regard to wages has long been settled. It is founded on the habits and usages of the people, the solid foundation of all common law presumptions of fact. The same habits and usages obtain in this country, and the same role was therefore adopted in <em>McConnell\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>appeal, 97 Pa. 31, </em>and is now the settled law of the State: <em>Houeh vs. Houck, 99 Pa. 552 ; Webb vs. Lees, 1 Adv. R. 677 (149 Pa. 13).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-4\">\u201cThe presumption goes stronger as each period of payment goes by. In the nature of things it is less potent against a claim for two or three months\u2019 wages, than for two or three years\u2019; and again its strength is increased or diminished by other circumstances that in the usual experience of life make payment more probable or explain the delay. And the evidence to sustain the claim must vary in the same ratio. As said by our late Brother Clark in <em>Gregory vs. Com., 1%1 Pa. 611, </em>\u2018 the presumption will gather strength with each succeeding year, and the evidence to overthrow it must, of course, be correspondingly increased.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b58-5\">Lore, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATt-\">charging the jury :</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Gentlemen of the jury:\u2014In this action, Henry T. Schuchler, the plaintiff, seeks to recover from Alexander B. Cooper, administrator of Robert Coburn Dickson, deceased, the defendant, for personal services and for board, which he rendered and furnished to the deceased in his lifetime, and which are itemized in his bill of particulars as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">Board from June 10, 1892, to May 25,1900, at $10.00 per week, ................................. $4120.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">Nursing, May 25th to June 5, 1900, at $5.00 per day,............................................. 55.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-11\">Care and attention, cleaning up and waiting upon deceased, from June 19, 1892, to May 25, 1900, at 75c per day,............................ 1463.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-13\">Probate,................................................... .15</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-14\">Aggregating,......................\u00a1...................... $5638.15</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">One of the pleas relied upon by the defendant is the statute of limitations. Under that plea the defendant claims that no recovery can be had for any parts of the items named in the bill of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>particulars, which were furnished or rendered more than three years before the date of the commencement of this action, which was September 13, 1901. Running back three years from that date would bring you to September 13, 1898.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The statute of this State provides that no action shall be brought in cases like this, after the expiration of three years from the accruing of the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Portions of the claim in this case appear upon the face of the bill of particulars to be barred by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">We are unable to find in the evidence any acknowledgment of the part so claimed to be barred by the statute as a subsisting demand made either by the deceased in his lifetime, or by his administrator the defendant since his decease, which would remove this bar. We say to you, therefore, that in reaching your verdict, you are not to consider any part of the plaintiff\u2019s bill for services rendered or board furnished prior to September 13, 1898.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Should you be satisfied from the evidence that after September 13, 1898, and before the death of the defendant, which it is not disputed occurred June 5, 1900 ; the plaintiff rendered services or furnished board, or both, as claimed in his bill of particulars, for which he had not been paid, he would be entitled to your verdict covering that period of time. In ascertaining the value of such services or board, you should be governed by the price fixed by the parties, if any price was agreed upon and shown; if no price was agreed upon, your verdict should be for such sum as the services rendered and board furnished were reasonably worth as disclosed by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Verdict for plaintiff for $925.15</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Note. The above case was taken up to the Supreme Court on a writ of error and at the June Term, 1904, thereof the writ of error was dismissed on motion of defendant\u2019s counsel, on the ground that the plaintiff Schuchler had no standing in said Court; he having assigned all his interest in the verdict immediately after same was obtained, but before judgment, and before the writ of error was taken.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
