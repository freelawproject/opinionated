Hitchens vs. School District No. 180 In Sussex County.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-5\"><em>Assumpsit\u2014Contract\u2014School District; Commissioners of\u2014Teacher; Employment of\u2014Meeting of Commissioners, When </em>Legal\u2014 <em>Employment of Teacher, When Binding\u2014Condition of Employment.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-7\">1. When two of the three commissioners of a school district, at a meeting <em>of </em>which the other commissioner had due notice, verbally employ a person as a teacher of the district, such employment is legal, and binding upon the district.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-8\">2. Where one employed for service for a certain period, at a certain compensation, enters into the service of his employer, and is discharged without sufficient cause, before the expiration of the period, he is entitled to recover the wages he would have been entitled to had he been permitted to remain in the service to the end of said period.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-9\">3. But if such discharge was for the failure or refusal of the employee to observe any material condition of his employment, such discharge would be justified, and the employee could not recover compensation for the residue of the period. An agreement on the part of the teacher, at the time of his employment, to take his dinner to the school, and remain on the school premises during the recess and noon periods, and not to board at a certain place, would be a material condition of the employment.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b333-10\">\n<em>(April 12, 1905.)</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b333-11\">Lore, C.

The said meeting was held by the other two commissioners, a majority of the board, and their action in making the agreement with the plaintiff bound the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">The nonsuit is refused.</p>\n<author id=\"b334-11\">Spruance, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALD\">charging the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">Gentlemen of the jury:\u2014This action is brought by the plaintiff, Frank D. Hitchens against the defendant, School District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Ho. 180 in Sussex County, to recover damages for an alleged breach of contract. If there was no breach of the contract by the defendant, there can be no recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We are asked by the defendant to charge you that if, from the evidence, you believe that the plaintiff was not employed by the committee, duly convened, your verdict should be for the defendant. We decline to so charge, but say to you that in view of the uncontradicted testimony, the meeting at Hill\u2019s store, of which the other commissioner had due notice, was such a meeting of the school committee as qualified the two members then present to bind the defendant corporation by entering into an agreement with the plaintiff, employing him as a teacher of the school of said district.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">It appears by the testimony on both sides that in the latter part of July or the early part of August, 1901, the defendant made a verbal agreement or contract with the plaintiff by which he was employed to teach the school of said district for seven months at $40 per month; and that under said agreement, on September 30th of the same year, the plaintiff took charge of said school and continued teaching for eleven days, when he was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The plaintiff contends that up to the time of his discharge he had performed all of the duties and conditions of his employment, and that he was ready and willing to continue so to do to the end of the period for which he had been hired by the defendant, and that his discharge was without any sufficient cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The defendant contends that at the time of the making of the said contract or agreement it was agreed by both parties,\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">1. That the plaintiff should take his dinner to the school, and remain on the school premises during the recess and noon periods, and</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">2. That he should not board at the house of one Dutton who lived a very short distance from the school. If these conditions were a part of the agreement they were binding upon the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">The defendant claims that these were material conditions of the plaintiff\u2019s employment, and that he was discharged by reason of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>breach of these conditions and his refusal to observe the same in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">It will be your duty to determine from the evidence whether these, or either of these conditions was a part of the said agreement between the parties, and if so, whether they, or either of them was broken by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Where one employed for service, for a certain period, at a certain compensation, enters into the service of his employer, and is discharged without sufficient cause, before the expiration of the period, he is entitled to recover the wages he would have been entitled to had he been permitted to remain in the service to the end of said period.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">But if such discharge was for the failure or refusal of the employee to observe any material condition of his employment, such discharge would be justified, and the employee could not recover compensation for the residue of the period.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The claim in this case is for wages at the rate of $40 per month for seven months, making $280, less $22 which is admitted to have been paid. If there was on the part of the plaintiff no breach of any of the conditions of his employment, and he was discharged, he would be entitled to recover the said amount, less this credit of $22. If on the other hand he was discharged by reason of his breach of any of the conditions of his employment, or his refusal to perform the conditions thereof, then he would not be entitled to recover anything and your verdict should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Verdict for plaintiff for $258.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
