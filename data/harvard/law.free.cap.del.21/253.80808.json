Where were you standing and where were you going at th;e time of the accident ? A. I started out of the house (N. W. Cor. Third and King) to go over and telephone for a ton of coal\u2014 Coal was scarce. On my way going over to the market house I took a cut from the door to go bias across the street and I happened to be in the middle of Third Street crossing; and this car came along. The car was ringing its bell\u2014or rather the motorman was ringing the bell; and this man stepped deliberately in front of the car. This man started about from three to four feet below the flag to go across the street and he throwed up his hands and went sideways, that way, for a distance I suppose maybe of ten feet and the car bumped him again and he still stayed on his feet, but the car came up the third time and pushed him over; and this bolster, or whatever you call it that sits on the truck, came along and it caught him and rolled him over three times and then the wheel came up on him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-12\">Cross Examination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-13\">\n<em>By Mr. miles:</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-14\">X.

Yes, sir; I did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-16\">When the plaintiff rested, <em>Mr. Silles, </em>on behalf of defendant, moved for a nonsuit upon the following grounds, viz.':</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-17\"><em>First </em>That the evidence showed that there was contributory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>negligence on the part of plaintiff\u2019s intestate; <em>second, </em>that there was a variance between plaintiff\u2019s evidence and the declarations in her narr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-4\">After argument by the respective counsel, the Court rendered the following opinion:</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b264-5\">Spruance, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AVg\">The gist of this action is negligence. If the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband, William T. Davis, was not caused by the negligence of the defendant company, the plaintiff cannot recover. The negligence of the defendant\u2019s agent, the motorman in charge of the car, 'would, if proved, be the negligence of the defendant company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The burden of proving negligence rests upon the party by 'whom it is alleged. In the absence of sufficient evidence to the contrary, the legal presumption is that neither the defendant nor the plaintiff\u2019s husband, Davis, was guilty of negligence. But this presumption ceases when overcome by evidence from which the jury might reasonably infer that the party was guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">There is no evidence whatever that the car was not equipped with proper appliances, or that the car or any of its appliances were defective or out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">It is clear from the evidence that there was no negligence whatever on the part of the defendant up to the time when Davis went upon, or was about to go upon the track. The gong was sounded when the car was near the northerly crossing of Third Street and was moving slowly from that point until it struck Davis a few feet south of the southerly crossing of said street. The plaintiff claims that the motorman was guilty of negligence in that he did not stop the car after he saw Davis or by the exercise of proper diligence might have seen him in a dangerous position and before he was crushed beneath the car. There is no direct evidence that in that interval the motorman did not do all that could be reasonably required of him under the circumstances. It does not appear from the evidence nor has it been suggested that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>was any proper mode of stopping the ear at that time but by the application of the brakes.</p>\n<p id=\"AgQ\">The evidence of two of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, Grady and Taylor, is to the effect that the motorman, as soon as he discovered Davis in a dangerous position, applied the brake and did all he could to stop the car and avoid injury to him and there is no direct evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The plaintiff insists that negligence on the part of the motorman should be inferred from the fact that the car did not stop within the distance which certain expert witnesses have testified it could have been stopped, but we do not think that such an inference is justified in view of the direct evidence as to what the motorman did in fact do to stop the car.</p>\n<p id=\"AgQB\">We are therefore of the opinion that there is no evidence from which negligence on the part of the defendant company could be reasonably inferred by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The evidence of negligence on the part of Davis is full and conclusive. After the gong had sounded in due time, and while the car was proceeding at a very moderate speed, he, in the language of the witness Grady <em>\u201c </em>stepped deliberately in front of the car.\u201d This was when the car was very close upon him. The interval of time between his thus stepping in front of the car and his being struck by the car was very brief. His negligence in stepping in front of the car was a part of the continuous transaction which terminated in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">We are clearly of the opinion that the contributory negligence of Davis was of such a character as to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">We are always reluctant to withdraw a case from the consideration of the jury, but in a proper case, it is our duty to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">In this case we would be obliged to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff, as not warranted by the evidence, and'we are therefore of the opinion that a nonsuit should be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\"><em>Mr. Knoioles: </em>If the Court please, we decline to take a non-suit.</p>\n<author id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Spruance, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"At7x\">charging the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Gentlemen of the jury:\u2014For. the reasons which have just been stated in your hearing, we are of opinion that a nonsuit should be entered. The plaintiff, as is her right, declines to take a nonsuit, which, in effect, is a request that the verdict of the jury shall be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">For the reasons assigned upon granting the motion for a non-suit, we now instruct you to find a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Verdict for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
