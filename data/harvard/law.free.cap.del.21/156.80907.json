Then come the other tracks which are six feet apart, the regulation distance. There is a turnout between the two tracks to the south or side below Orange Street that makes a reverse curve. There is a watch-box on the south side with a safety gate arrangement in front of it, and there is also a safety gate on the upper side. Those are both on the company\u2019s property. One of the safety gates extends clear across the roadway across Orange Street; the other does not quite reach the opposite side, by three or four feet. The tracks are just the same there as they were in 1902, at that point and for some distance beyond it.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZ\">(The witness further testified, in response to questions by Mr. Knowles, of counsel for defendant, as follows ):</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-9\">Q. Is there a curve or bend in that track near Orange Street? A. There is a turnout that commences about thirty-five or thirty-seven feet west of the westerly side of Orange Street, and the curve commences just beyond Thorn Street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-11\">Q. In squares, how far is that ? A. Seventy-six feet is the length of the square from Orange to Thorn. Forty-two feet, six inches is the width of Thorn Street and the curve commences starting from that, no more than ten or twelve feet.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-12\">Q.

There is this curve just beyond Thorn Street. You see the curve goes from Tatnall a slight distance. Then there is a tangent or straight line and then another curve beyond West Street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8a\">Q. Does that curve swing the main track out of sight ? A. It would, standing between 'the north-bound and south-bound tracks; a train comes in sight just about one hundred feet beyond the westerly side of West Street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-17\">Q.

Do you remember this accident at Railroad and Orange Streets about the 12th of October, 1902 ? A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-17\">Q. Where were you standing ? A. The night of the accident I was standing on the south side of the railroad on Orange; the creek side on Orange Street beyond the railroad. I was about ten feet away from the railroad. John Mullin, the plaintiff, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>just left me and had started across the track. The gate on that side was then up when he started across the track. When he commenced to go over the track he said to me that he was going down to see his mother, and he looked up the track and could not see anything but this freight train that was going south, and this passenger was going north, and he was waiting for the freight train to pass when this passenger came down back of him and struck him, and it knocked him under the car, like, and I saw him when he fell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-6\">Q. How far was the freight train up towards the French Street Station as he started across and as he looked up that way ? A. I judge it was about the middle of the square, that is between Shipley and Orange.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-7\">Q. Did you notice at what speed that train was going ? A. It was going a pretty good speed. No one could jump it. I guess it was going about eighteen or twenty .miles an hour.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-9\">Q. Did you notice the speed of the express train as it came along ? A. It was going pretty fast. I made the remark to them that she was going like hell, like that. I guess she was going twenty-five or thirty miles an hour; I should judge that.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-10\">Q. What train was it that struck him ? A. I think it was the passenger. I am certain of it,</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-11\">Q,. What did the passenger train do after it struck him ? A. Kept on going; did not make any stop at that place. After it was over I went up to Front Street to see an officer and tell him of the accident and did not see any one and went down to Front and Market and saw James McCormick, and he telephoned for the ambulance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGbb\">Q. At the time you say Mullin looked, did you see him when he looked towards Harlan and Hollingsworth\u2019s place ? A. I could not say that; I did not pay that much attention, because I was half turned around myself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-14\">Q. Did you look up towards Harlan and Hollingsworth\u2019s about the time he started across? A.

She came all of a sudden.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-6\">The defendant thereupon moved for a nonsuit on the ground that plaintiff, by his own testimony, was guilty of contributory negligence at the time of the accident; that he voluntarily and without necessity put himself in a place of danger by negligently stepping upon a railroad track to wait for a moving train to pass, upon which track a passenger train was approaching, and which he either saw or by the exercise of reasonable care ought to have seen, as the testimony on behalf of the plaintiff showed that the train must have been at that time in plain sight, and that plaintiff could not, under the law, be allowed to say that he looked, but did not see such train.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-7\">\n<em>Malin vs. Lake Shore Railroad Company, 49 Mich., 585; Minnig vs. Detroit R.
