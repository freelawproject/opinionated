Exceptions were filed to the award by devisees and legatees of the deceased, the principal ground of objection being fraud and collusion on the part of the parties to the action. A motion to dismiss the exceptions was made for the following reasons: (i) Because they did not aver any fraud or misconduct on the part of the arbitrators; (2) Because the exceptants were not parties to the record, and (3) Because the Court had no jurisdiction over the question of fraud. Motion refused, and issue framed to be tried by a jury to determine whether there was any fraud and collusion between the parties.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b458-16\">\n<em>(October 11, 1905.)</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b458-17\">Lore, C.

Cannon, deceased, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-8\">\u201c <em>First. </em>That the said award was obtained through fraudulent collusion between the plaintiff and the said Rebecca P.

Pepper, then the administratrix c. t. a. of the said Harriet H. Cannon, deceased for the purpose of perpetrating a fraud upon the said estate by promoting the said award to the plaintiff, when in fact the deceased was not indebted to the said plaintiff in any sum of money but, on the contrary, the plaintiff was indebted to the deceased at the time of her death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-10\">\u201c <em>Third. </em>That the award is based upon a probated claim, invalid and fraudulent upon its face, as will appear from an inspection of copy of the said claim herewith annexed, and all of the items in the said claim except perhaps a small part of the first item therein, were long barred by the statute of limitations, the testratrix having died on or about December 7, 1901, for it appears\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-11\"><em>\u201c </em>(1) That the first item runs back about fifteen years from the death of the said testratrix, and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AILt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>\u201c </em>(2) That all of the other items were for board alleged to have been furnished more than ten years before her death, part of these items being for board furnished fifteen years and some fourteen years before the death of the said testatrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-O\"><em>\u201c Fourth. </em>That the said award is not only fraudulent and unjust on its face but was obtained by fraudulent connivance of the said Rebecca P. Pepper and by collusion with her and without the production before the referees of evidence within the knowledge of the said Rebecca P.

Pepper, the plaintiff, was indebted to the said estate of the said deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfM\"><em>\u201c Fifth. </em>That as appears by copy of the probated claim of the plaintiff, it is on its face fraudulent and long barred by the statute of limitations, the testatrix, Harriet H. Cannon, having died on or about December 7, 1901; yet the said Rebecca P. Pepper, administratrix as aforesaid, not only did not plead or rely upon the statute limitations but entered into an amicable action and agreed to rule of reference without the advice or knowledge of her attorneys, Charles W. Cullen and Edward D. Hearne, Esqs., and at the hearing was not represented by counsel, although the plaintiff was so represented; that notwithstanding the fact that all but one of the items in the plaintiff\u2019s claim purported to be for board furnished at times more than ten years prior to the death of the said testatrix, and notwithstanding that the other items ran back for fifteen years prior to the death of the testatrix, and notwithstanding the fact that on September 10, 1900, said Horace B. Pepper made his bond or judgment note to the said Harriet H. Cannon for the payment of the sum of one hundred dollars, upon which judgment was entered by the said Harriet H. Cannon in her lifetime a short time before her death, and which judgment remains unpaid and unsatisfied of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-15\"><em>\u201c Sixth. </em>That as appears of record in the Superior Court of Sussex County, on April 23, 1901, judgment was entered in said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Court by the said Edward D. Hearne, Esq., as attorney for the said Harriet H. Cannon, for the sum of one hundred dollars, by virtue of a warrant of attorney on a bond or note dated September 10, 1890, made by the said Horace B. Pepper to the said Harriet H. Cannon, said judgment being Ho. 45 to the April Term, 1901, of said Court, and that a levy had been made on goods and chattels of said Horace B. Pepper by virtue of a fi. fa. issued on said judgment to the April Term, 1902, of said Court, said goods remaining unsold by said'Sheriff; that said judgment was not put in evidence by the said Rebecca P. Pepper, nor brought before the referees or used by her to defeat the said claim of said Horace B. Pepper, or part thereof at least <em>\u2022 </em>and that had said judgment been so used by said Rebecca P. Pepper, the said Horace B. Pepper would not have been entitled to obtain any claim for board or services rendered prior to the giving of said bond on September 10, 1890.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-5\">At the October Term, the hearing of the above exceptions was continued until the April Term, 1905, at which latter term it was further continued to the October Term, 1905. At the said October Tern , 1905, the exceptions coming on to be heard, counsel for respondents moved to dismiss the same, for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-6\"><em>First. </em>That the exceptions were not tenable in that they did not aver fraud or misconduct on the part of the arbitrators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-7\"><em>Second. </em>That the Superior Court had not jurisdiction over a question of fraud, that being a subject of equity jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-8\"><em>Third. </em>That the exceptants were not parties to the record and had no standing in Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-9\"><em>Fourth. </em>That to give the exceptants any standing in the Superior Court it would be at least necessary for them to file a petition asking leave to intervene and secure an order of the Court to that effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ao1O\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>Martin, for </em>exceptants:\u2014Every legal transaction is vitiated by fraud, when proven.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AN4\">Arbitrators are instruments of the Court, being appointed under the provisions of the statute to expedite its business, and their awards are of no effect until they receive the approbation of the Court; but when so confirmed, are \u201c as available in law as the verdict of a <em>jury; </em>and the party to whom any sum of money shall be awarded, if he be plaintiff, shall have judgment,\u201d etc. <em>Rev. Code 1898, Ch. 116.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0S\">All of the doings of the arbitrators are subject to the investigation of the Court, for, when approved, they are the acts of the Court itself. Therefore, the Court has the right to hear and determine any allegation of fraud and collusion practised upon its arbitrators, by which they were influenced in making an award. It has authority to investigate the manner in which an award was made, or verdict rendered, and to inquire into any matter of fraud by which the same may have been <em>tainted.\u2014Allen vs. Smith\u2019s Adm. 4 Harr., 284.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AD5R\">The Court of Chancery has no jurisdiction over this case; the subject matter is primarily of legal jurisdiction; the exceptions are to the misconduct of the parties plaintiff and defendant in this Court, the hearing being had under a rule of Court. Over all of these proceedings this Court has exclusive jurisdiction, and there is no appeal from its judgment to, nor can its finding be revised by a Court of Equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQXU\">The exceptions are filed by <em>\u201c </em>devisees and legatees of Harriet H. Cannon, deceased,\u201d and their interests under the provisions of the will would be greatly impaired, if not entirely abrogated, were this award confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AY7\">The respondents are informed by the exceptions filed of the capacity in which the exceptants sue, and of their interest in the subject matter, and it would be surplusage for them to file a petition asking leave to intervene.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ayd\">The above motion to dismiss was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Counsel for respondents thereupon moved to have an issue framed to be submitted to a jury, which was objected to by counsel for exceptants, who contended that the Court had the same jurisdiction of an award of referees as they had over the verdict of a jury. The Court ordered the following issue to be submitted to a jury of the Superior Court, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-12\"><em>\u201c </em>And now to wit this 11th day of October 1905, it is ordered by the Court that the following issue be tried by a jury of Sussex County at the bar of this Court: <em>\u2018 </em>Was there or was there not fraud and collusion between Horace B. Pepper and Rebecca P. Pepper, administratrix c. t. a. of Harrrit H. Cannon, deceased, the parties to this suit in procuring the award therein.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-15\">The case was then continued to the April Term, 1906.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZH\">The issue coming on to be tried at said April Term, after hearing the evidence of the exceptants, counsel for respondent asked the Court to direct the jury to find :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-18\">That there was not fraud and collusion between said Horace B.
