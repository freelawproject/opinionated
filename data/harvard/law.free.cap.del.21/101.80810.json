In a trial for pointing a gun or pistol, where the defendant has interposed the plea of former conviction, the defendant may be asked by his counsel whether he had any other altercation with the prosecuting witness on the day of the alleged offense, or on any other day, except the one embraced in the assault and battery for which he was tried before the Justice.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-7\">2. The State, at such trial, will be permitted to introduce in evidence the bond given by the defendant for his appearance at Court, and also the record of the Justice respecting the case on trial</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-8\">3. To plead <em>autrefois </em>convict with effect, the crime must be the same in fac for which the defendant was before convicted, or must be necessarily included in the former. If the jury find from the evidence that the pointing of a pistol, for which the defendant is being tried, was included in and was a necessary part of the assault and battery for which he was convicted before the Justice, then the defense of former conviction would avail, and their verdict should be for the defendant.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b109-9\">\n<em>(September 30, 1904.)</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b109-10\">Lore, C.

The State filed a replication denying that it was the same assault or was included in it and the defendant filed a <em>similiter. </em>The question submitted to the jury was whether the pointing of the pistol was a necessary part of the assault and battery for which the defendant had been tried and convicted. The record o\u00ed the Justice was admitted in evidence on the part of the defendant, and the defendant testified that the only assault and battery committed upon the prosecuting witness, J. H. Mahaffy, Jr., was the one shown by the record of \u2022 the Justice. The defendant was then asked by his counsel the following question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-4\">Q. Without giving any facts answer this question yes or no. You are charged here in an indictment with pointing a pistol at Mr. Mahaffy on the 10th of July, 1904. Did you have any other altercation of any kind with Mahaffy on that day or on any other day except the one on the charge of assault and battery testified to that day before Esquire Hollis ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">(Objected to by the Attorney-General on the ground that it was calling for the opinion of the witness and for a conclusion of fact.

The defendant then rested, and the Attorney-General called the Justice of the Peace, George H. Hollis, and asked him, among others, the following questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-8\">Q,. Will you look at this bond which I hand you and state whether or not that is the bond which was given by the defendant Day upon this record which you have stated was the record of the charge for pointing a pistol.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>(Objected to by counsel for defendant as irrelevant.

J., charging the jury :</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Gentlemen of the jury:\u2014Albert Day, the defendant, is indicted for pointing a pistol at one J. H. Mahaffy, Jr. He has interposed as a plea in bar to that indictment that he has been heretofore convicted of the offense with which he is now charged in a trial that was had before a Justice of the Peace, George H. Hollis, for an assault and battery, and that having been so convicted he is not liable to be convicted in this case, nor may he be a second time put in peril or punished for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">In order to avail himself of that plea we will state to you what the law requires as laid down in the case of <em>State vs. Townsend, 2 Harr., 546.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\"><em>\u201c </em>To plead <em>autrefois </em>convict with effect, the crime must be the <em>same </em>in fact for which the defendant was before convicted, or must be <em>necessarily included in </em>the former.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">The defendant claims that it was included in the former; that in the trial for assault and battery before Justice Hollis this whole matter was gone into and that this offense was included.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>If you find as a matter of fact from the evidence which has been adduced in this case that the pointing of this pistol was included and was a necessary part of the assault then alleged to have been made by Albert Day upon Henry (J. Mahafify, Jr., then the defense of former conviction would avail and your verdict should be for the defendant; otherwise your verdict should be for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">You are only empanelled in this case to ascertain whether or not, from the facts and the law as laid down to you by the Court, the defendant has been convicted of the same offense before, or of an offense including this, and if he has your verdict should be for him. If he has not, as the facts are disclosed before you and upon the law as we have stated it to you, then your verdict should be that he has not been so convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Verdict for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
