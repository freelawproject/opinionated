Townsend, </em>the plaintiff, testified concerning the same as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-7\">I am a farmer and drover and have been in such business for twenty years. My droving business carries me from Sussex County to Delaware City\u2014all through the State of Delaware, practically. In October 1900, I had been up in New Castle County with a bunch of cattle, I think it was Friday or Saturday\u2014I will not say positively about the date, because it has been some time\u2014and I only had I think one pair of oxen left on my hands. So I met George A. Gooden, or saw him at his house, or on the road, or there out near the iron bridge in New Castle County in Deaconsville, and I said, \u201c George, here is a pair of oxen about ready for the butcher, and if you have got a place for them, they cost me seventy dollars and if you take them home with you you can have all over the seventy dollars received for them when they are sold. I think there is some chance for you to make a dollar.\u201d George said, \u201c I will take themand we called a Mr. David\u2014he was right by\u2014 to witness that they were my oxen until they were paid for. That was the agreement, the way he took them. When I came up again, I think in that same fall, Mr. Gooden said to me, <em>\u201c </em>I traded those oxen to Willard Pierce down here at Smyrna, and I think I got a good deal for them. I got a gray mare with foal. I needed the mare to work on the farm, and I would like to have her the same way that I had the oxen. She can remain here as your property in place of the oxen.\u201d This was probably about the first of November 1900. The mare remained with George A. Gooden until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>she was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale. She was then in fair condition. She had a colt by her side at the time of the sale and one three years old. Mr. Gooden never paid me for that mare.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-6\">In 1899 I sold Mr. Gooden some cattle. That transaction was in writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Axh\">(At this point the paper in question, a note, after being proved by the attesting witness, George W.

Gooden; the note was never paid. The seven cows I took under the writ of replevin were a part of the cows mentioned in this note. I took these cattle back from George A. Gooden about the first of October, 1904, and took them to Mr. George Inselow\u2019s about two miles west from his place on the road from Clayton to Blackiston\u2019s Corner Cross Roads. That was about a week before I replevied them. They stayed at Mr. Inselow\u2019s two or three days, and then the Sheriff came and took them. At the time I issued the writ of replevin, about October 1, 1904, for the cattle and mare and colt, all the animals were at Mr. George A. Gooden\u2019s on Mr. Davis\u2019 farm in Kenton Hundred, Kent County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-18\">Cross Examination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-19\">\n<em>By Mr. Harrington:</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-20\">X.

What was the understanding between you and Gooden as to the mare ? A. I was up there a short time after that and he says, <em>\u201c </em>I traded the oxen for the mare, and I would like to have the mare on the same terms that I got the oxenthat he needed the mare or a horse to work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-27\">X.

That was the understanding ; the way I understood it. X. Do you remember how many times you had conversations with Gooden in relation to this mare ? A. No, sir; I do not. Of course I was up there a good many times afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ab4\">X. What was it you told him about the mare ? A. That he could have the mare on the same conditions as the oxen. He said he wanted her on the same terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AU9\">X.

David, </em>being called as a witness on behalf of the plaintiff, testified upon the same matter as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-24\">\n<em>By Mr. Jones:</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFy\">Q,. What did Mr. Townsend say to Mr. Gooden, in your presence, after he called you as a witness ? A.

Did you hear Mr. Townsend say that to Mr. Gooden ? A. He called my attention to witness this sale that they had made, to the agreement that they had between them. It was but a few words I heard. I understood that after he sold the oxen that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>should have the balance over seventy dollars of what they sold for; he was to receive all over seventy dollars that he got for the oxen. That is straight. That is what he said. I heard that talk in the yard. We were in the yard quite a while.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-10\">Q,. He said he was to have the oxen, and all he got over seventy dollars was to be Gooden\u2019s ? A. Yes, sir; he had seven or eight more cattle and a pair of mules there with him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-13\">When the plaintiff rested, the defendant moved for a nonsuit on two grounds, viz: _</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-14\"><em>First. </em>That the plaintiff had not proved that the Sheriff had possession of the property in question at the time suit was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-16\"><em>Second. </em>That the plaintiff had proved a conditional sale both as to the cows and to the mare and colt, and having slept on his rights for four years, and until after the property had been levied upon by the judgment creditor, it was a clear case of loches, and under the decision of the Superior Court of this State in the case of <em>Matthews vs. Smith, 8 Houston, 22, </em>he had waived his right and could not recover.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b508-23\">Lore, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"Asj\">The Court have considered the motion for a nonsuit as fully as we could during the recess, and we are quite satisfied that the sale of the seven cows was a conditional sale and comes clearly within the case of <em>Matthews vs. Smith, 8 Houston, 22. </em>We are not fully prepared, however, to announce our decisive judgment at present as to the oxen and the mare and colts which were substituted for the same, according to the testimony. For that reason we decline to grant the nonsuit. The question can be raised in the prayers and determined then, with a fuller opportunity to con-aider the whole ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-29\">(Thereupon the defendant, after proving the chattel mortgage of Hon, William C. Spruance against George A. Gooden, and the sale of the property in question by the Sheriff under said chattel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>mortgage, called <em>Hon. William C. Spruance, </em>who was sworn and examined as follows):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">\n<em>By Mr. Harrington.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APo\">Q. When did you first have any notice or knowledge of contention on the part of Mr. Townsend as to his rights in property ? A. I never saw Mr. Townsend, and I don\u2019t know I ever heard of him, until after this property was levied upon. had no knowledge whatever of any claim of his to this property any kind until after the levy had been made, which was the of September, 1904. I was very much astonished shortly that to hear that Mr. Townsend had a claim to it. That was time after that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">Q,. Did your chattel mortgage cover those particular cows, horse and colts that are mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration ? A. Yes, sir; covered all of them. They were all sold at Sheriff\u2019s sale, the Sheriff having given a counterbond or property bond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adu\"><em>George A. Gooden, </em>being sworn as a witness on behalf of the defendant, testified to the transaction as to the yoke of oxen, mare and colts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arg5\">\n<em>By Mr. Harrington.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0P\"><em>Q. </em>Did or did not Mr. Townsend sell to you a gray mare in or about the month of October, 1900 ? A. Yes, sir; in this way : he left a yoke of oxen there and told me to sell them for seventy dollars and all over that I got I could have. So I taken the oxen and traded them for a gray mare, and when he came up I told him about it, and said I would like to have the mare at the same price he asked me for the oxen, seventy dollars, and he said all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-22\">That is the way I understood it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMD\">Q. Was there anything said by Mr. Townsend or by you about Mr. Townsend\u2019s remaining the owner of the property until the seventy dollars was paid? A. No, sir; just what I told you is all that was said about it. That is the way I understood it ex- . actly</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqIZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>First. </em>That the bailment of the yoke of oxen by Townsend to Gooden, which Gooden afterwards exchanged for the mare with foal, was such a bailment as to enable the bailor to maintain replevin for the mare and her offspring from the bailee, and to recover the value thereof, with interest from the beginning of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\"><em>Second. </em>That the sale of the cattle by Townsend to Gooden on November 3, 1899, was a conditional sale, and the title thereto remained in Townsend until the note was paid, both principal and interest, and that Townsend had such a property in them as to enable him to maintain an action of replevin.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\"><em>Third. </em>That unless Townsend had committed some act divesting himself of the title to the property and the right of possession thereof, he is entitled to recover the value of the cattle taken under the present action of replevin, with interest from the beginning of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-18\"><em>Fourth. </em>That the extension of the time of payment or forbearance to retake the property after default in payment is not sufficient to amount to a waiver of Townsend\u2019s right to retake the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-22\"><em>Fifth. </em>That if the jury believe that Townsend had the right of property in the horses and cattle replevied and the immediate right of possession thereto at the time of the commencement of the action he is entitled to recover in this action the value of the said horses and cattle, with interest from the beginning of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-26\"><em>Sixth. </em>That if George A. Gooden became the possessor of said cattle by virtue of a conditional sale, no act of the said George A. Gooden without the assent of the said Timothy E. Townsend would divest the title of the said Townsend or strengthen the title of the said Gooden.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>Seventh. </em>That, if the jury believe that Townsend had such right of property and such immediate right of possession in either the horses or cattle, he is entitled to recover the value of such horses and cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"Acu\"><em>Eighth. </em>That the verdict of the jury, if they believe the fendant liable, must be the value of the property taken, with interest from the commencement of this action, as the property taken was sold by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">Defendant's Prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq2\"><em>First. </em>The failure of Townsend to exercise his right <em>to </em>retake the cattle under the conditional sale of the same of November 3, 1899, until after the execution of the mortgage of the same of July 30,1904, and until after the same was levied upon by the Sheriff under the execution of <em>Spruance vs. </em>Gooden, was a waiver of such right as against the said mortgage and execution, and the plaintiff cannot in this action recover anything of the defendant for the value of said cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"AGJ\"><em>Second. </em>If the jury shall be satisfied from the evidence that the gray mare was sold by Townsend to Gooden without the condition that the ownership of the same should remain in Townsend until the price of the same should be paid, then the said mare and her colts would be subject to be levied on and sold under said execution against Gooden, and the plaintiff cannot recover any thing of the defendant for the value of said mare and colts.</p>\n<p id=\"AUv\"><em>Third. </em>If the jury shall be satisfied from the evidence that the gray mare was sold by Townsend to Gooden in the fall of 1900 with the condition that the ownership of the same should remain in Townsend until the price of the same should be paid, the failure of Townsend to retake possession of the same until after the execution of said mortgage and until after the same were levied on under said execution, was a waiver of such right as against said mortgage and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>execution, and the plaintiff cannot recover anything of the defendant for the value of said mare and colts.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\"><em>Fowrth. </em>That the Court instruct the jury to find for the defendant in respect to said cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\"><em>Fifth. </em>That the Court instruct the jury to find for the defendant in respect to said mare and colts.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\"><em>Sixth. </em>That the Court instruct the jury to find a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<author id=\"b512-12\">Lore, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Agr\">charging the jury :</p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">Gentlemen of the jury:\u2014From a careful consideration of all the evidence in this case, the Court are entirely satisfied that it is a case in which binding instructions should be given to you <em>; </em>that so far as the seven cows were concerned, it was a conditional sale, and as to the mare and colts, it was either a conditional sale or was an absolute sale. If it was an absolute sale, the plaintiff cannot recover, because he would then have no right to the possession of the property, and if it was a conditional sale, as the sale of the cattle, it would come within the case of <em>Matthews vs. Smith, 8 Roust., on page 22, </em>where under th eterms of a conditional sale it is held: \u201c When under the terms of one of these conditional contracts the vendor has a right to proceed and enforce it, that right must be exercised within a reasonable time. The vendor cannot lie by, but must resort to his remedy within the passing of the first term of Court subsequent <em>to </em>the failure of payment, or at least by the second term after the default has been made. In the case under consideration fully nine months had elapsed after default of payment on the last note and upon this ground the defendants are entitled to a verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-25\">But in this case not only nine months elapsed, but about four years from the time the right of the plaintiff in this case to enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>his claim for default in paying for these cattle accured, and having laid by so long he waived that right and is estopped after the goods had been levied on by a creditor, or sold to a <em>bonafido </em>purchaser for value.</p>\n<p id=\"A0eP\">For these and other reasons we instruct you to return a verdict the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">Verdict for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
