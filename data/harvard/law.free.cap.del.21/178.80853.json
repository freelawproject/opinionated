My contract:</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-7\">with them was that they paid me so much a day for the team.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-8\">Q. What did that include ? A. That included a driver.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-9\">Q. A horse, cart and driver ? A. Yes, sir; I got $2.50 for a horse, cart and driver. If I did not furnish the driver I did not get that much, and the price of the driver was taken out, $1.35 a. day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-10\">Q. Did you ever furnish drivers to go with your horses and carts ? A. I generally did. It was very seldom that they went without drivers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-11\">Q. Did you ever employ and put in charge of one of those-horses and carts, your brother, James F. McMahon ? A. I did;. about the 29th of October, I think it was; somewhere in that neighborhood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-12\">Q. How long did he continue in that capacity ? A.. Until the 20th of December, when he was hurt there at the quarry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-13\">Q. Where was the horse and cart with this boy in charge working at the time\u2014for whom? A. For Hughes Brothers &amp;.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-14\">Bangs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-15\">Q. For that firm ? A. That firm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-16\">Q,. When was he hurt ? A. He was hurt on the afternoon of the 20th of December shortly after they went to work. I don\u2019t, know the exact time. I judge about half past one, the time I found it out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-17\">Q. What control or authority had that firm of Hughes Brothers and Bangs, or the defendant Anson M. Bangs, over your brother, James F. McMahon ? A. They had no control whatever . over him at all. The only control they had was over the cart. They had no control over the driver at all. The only thing they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>could do if he was not satisfactory, was to send the cart away. They could not discharge him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APe\">Q,. If the horse and cart with this driver was not doing the work satisfactorily to them they could dismiss the horse and cart ? A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-8\">Q. And with it went the driver ? A. Yes, sir; that is right. Q. This horse and cart were assigned to do whatever work that somebody about the quarry would designate to be done. A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-10\">\n<em>By Mr. Emmons:</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-11\">X. Is it true that the boy worked for Hughes Brothers and Bangs, or not ? A. He drove a cart for me. He was employed by me under my directions. Hughes Brothers and Bangs had no jurisdiction over him whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOB\">X. What had you to do with the boy when the cart was be-</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-13\">ing loaded\u2014you were not there to direct him and tell him what to do? A. Very seldom.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-14\">X. Were you ever there? A. I have been there; yes sir. X. Did you ever tell him what to do when he was on the cart and it was being loaded ? A. I have once or twice told him to pull out, that he had a load on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH\">\u2022 X. So far as the boy had to do with the stripping of the quarry was not he subject altogether to the directions of that boss ? A. Well, I would judge in a certain sense he was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-16\">X. That boy could not do as he pleased there, could he ? A. Oh, no.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-17\">X. And that boy was not subject to your orders there, was he, to do just what you told him ? A. No, sir; he was in charge of my cart.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-18\">X. And who had the control of the cart ? A.

Did you control the cart when it was on top of the hill being loaded with dirt ? A. Certainly <em>\u2022 </em>I could take it away from there any time I saw fit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-4\">X. Did you have any general direction of the cart when they were taking dirt away from there ? A. Taking it where ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-5\">X. Taking the dirt to dump it ? A. No, sir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-6\">X. Who did that? A. One of the men there, known as gang boss, I believe.</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-7\">X. Was not that gang boss employed by Hughes Brothers and Bangs ? A. I believe he was, so far as my knowledge goes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-8\">Plaintiff called <em>W. W.

I will ask you if you know of any method that can be \u25a0employed to protect persons nearby when blasting is being carried \u2022on, from injury by flying fragments of rock?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">(Mr. Emmons objects to the above question, and pending the ruling of the Court upon the objection, in cross-examination draws \u2022out from the witness the fact that the witness had had no experience with stone quarries, and that while he had set off blasts while working for the Street and Sewer Department in the City of Wilmington, he did not know how much powder or dynamite was used .as a charge in the Bellevue quarry, or whether it was a greater or less amount than was used in the City work which he had been engaged in doing; or what precautions were taken in quarry blasting or whether it was necessary or feasible in the Bellevue quarry to cover their blasts. Mr. Emmons then stated that he objected to the question upon two grounds: (1) that under the testimony adduced there was no duty resting upon the defendant to cover the blasts; (2), that the witness was not qualified to speak as an expert upon the subject of what precautions were employed to protect persons near blasting operations in a quarry.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>Whiteman, </em>for plaintiff, contended that the method of blasting or protecting the public was the same whether the blasting was done in a city or in a quarry in the country, therefore that the witness was qualified to speak as an expert.</p>\n<author id=\"b199-4\">Boyce, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"A5J\">We think the witness is not qualified to speak as an expert in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">(The plaintiff rested, and Emmons for defendant moved for a nonsuit on the ground that the proof established the relation of master and servant between the defendant and the plaintiff; that the employee who failed to give warning of the blast, whereby the plaintiff was injured, was a fellow-servant with the plaintiff, and that the failure of a fellow-servant to perform his duty could not be charged to the master; that the plaintiff, being a servant of the defendant assumed all the ordinary risks of his employment, among which was the danger arising from the fact that the blast had not been covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Said motion was argued at length by the respective counsel and numerous authorities were cited.)</p>\n<author id=\"b199-7\">Boyce, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"A1b\">We have carefully as we could, in the limited time afforded, examined the authorities of counsel, and we have also examined all of the testimony of the witnesses in this case; and we have reached the conclusion that as between the plaintiff and the defendant at the time of the accident the relation of master \u2022 and servant existed. We have further concluded that as between the plaintiff and the person whose negligence it is alleged caused the injury complained of there existed the relation of fellow-servants, and because of such relation the motion for a nonsuit is granted ; there being no liability on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">(The plaintiff declining to take a nonsuit, upon request of counsel for defendant the Court gave binding instructions to the jury as follows):</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Boyce, J., charging the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Gentlemen of the jury:\u2014We instruct you to find a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Verdict for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
