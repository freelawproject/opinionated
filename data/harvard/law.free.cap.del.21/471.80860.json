D. 1905, an action on book account was brought by Ralph B. Jarmon against Frank Patterson and Mrs. Frank Patterson for the sum of $10.75 with credit of $2. The Justice being satisfied by deposition of Ralph B. Jarmon, the plaintiff, there is danger of losing process by delay, summons issued forthwith this seventeenth day of March to Constable Jenkins. Constable Jenkins returns \u2018Served personally.\u2019 And now to wit this eighteenth day of March, 1905, Frank Patterson appearing and Mrs. Frank Patterson failing to appear and after hearing proofs in the case, the credit of $4 is corrected to $4.75 and I therefore give judgment against the defendants, Frank Patterson and Mrs. Frank Patterson, for the sum of $10.75 with credit of $4.75 and costs of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-19\">\u201c Charles D.

That it does not appear by the record that the plaintiff was present on the day of the hearing of the Justice, which was error, as judgment should not be rendered against the defendants without the allegations and proofs of the party plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-26\">2.

That the record does not show that the parties plaintiff and defendants were present at the hearing on the eighteenth of March, 1905, but discloses that only one of the defendants was present and one thereof absent at said hearing, and it was error for the Justice</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_rm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>to have rendered judgment without hearing the proofs and allegatians of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVZ\">4.
