Blake was employed by defendant as the driver of a coal wagon and plaintiff was employed as a <em>\u201c </em>helper \u201d to accompany the coal wagon in loading and delivering coal. The injury to plaintiff was caused solely by the act of Blake in throwing a bale of straw from the second story of defendant\u2019s stable upon plaintiff who was passing from the stable into defendant\u2019s stable-yard. The injury occurred immediately after working hours. If the injury had occurred during working hours there could be no question that the plaintiff would be held to have assumed the risk of Blake\u2019s negligent act as a risk of his employment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>2.

Every contract of service requires the servant to perform certain duties and authorizes the servant to exercise certain rights or privileges. Going to work returning from work, eating a noonday meal are actions of a servant outside the performance of his work yet contemplated by the contract of service. Where the master affords for the special use of the servant the means or accommodation for going to work or returning from work or eating a noonday meal, then those means or accomodations are rights or privileges of the servant incident to his contract of service. Those rights or privileges belong to the employment. Risks incurred by a servant while exercising such rights or privileges are risks of his employment. A servant injured while exercising such a right or privilege by the negligence of a fellow-servant assumes the risk of that injury as a risk of his employment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">\n<em>Gilshannon vs. Stony Brook R.

Getting his lunch basket from defendant\u2019s stable after work was an incident of plaintiff\u2019s employment.

From time immemorial defendant had accorded to drivers of coal and express wagons and to <em>\u201c </em>helpers \u201d the privileges of hanging their dinner boxes at the stables before work, of eating their dinner at the stable at noon and going for their dinner boxes after work. This privilege was accorded to facilitate defendant\u2019s work as much as to accomodate its servants. Before quitting defendant\u2019s premises plaintiff walked from one part of the defendant\u2019s premises where he was paid his day\u2019s wages, to another part of defendant\u2019s premises for his dinner box. No one except servants of defendant could eat at the stable. Going for his dinner box was a privilege accorded to plaintiff, because he was a servant and an incident of his contract of service by immemorial usage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-4\">\n<em>Boyle vs. Columbian Fire Proofing Company 182, Mass., 93 ; Olsen vs. Andrews, 168 Mass., 261; Bowles vs. Ind.

It clearly appears'that the invitation was a privilege incident to plaintiff\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-7\">No invitation was extended to anyone except as a servant. A person not a servant upon these premises would be a tresspasser.

When the servant's day's work is ended and he has left his place of work, the relation of master and servant ceases for the time being, and he stands to the master in the same relation as any other citizen, and as to whether the relation in fact existed when the injury was received is a question for the jury.\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\"><em>Wood\u2019s Law of Master and Servant, Sec., 404; </em>B. <em>&amp; O.

J. :</author>\n<p id=\"AB5\">The Court have considered the motion for a nonsuit made in this case and ably and thoroughly argued by counsel on both sides, and are prepared to announce our unanimous opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">It appears that the plaintiff, Lewis E. Taylor, on the day of the accident, was in the employ of the defendant company and had been in their employ for about three months immediately proceeding that <em>day; </em>that in the course of his employment, from day to day, he was in the habit of taking his dinner pail to the stable in the morning, eating his dinner on the premises at noontide, and after the day\u2019s work was over, of taking his dinner pail away from the place where he had kept it during the day; that this privilege was incident to and connected with the employment extended to him as an employee and by that right he took his pail there, kept it there and took it away from there at the close of each day; that at the time of the accident he had been actually paid at the office for that day and had gone, as was his custom, to the stable to take home his dinner pail.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">He was therefore in the enjoyment of a privilege which was granted to him by his employers only as an employee. It was connected with and incident to his employment at the time of the accident. The enjoyment of it therefore continued unbroken the relation of master and servant, at the time of the accident, between the plaintiff and the defendant company.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>It further appears that while the plaintiff was engaged in taking away the dinner pail one Blake, who was a driver of the defendant company, employed in the same business, threw a bale of straw down from the loft of the defendant\u2019s stable, which bale fell upon the plaintiff\u2019s head and injured him as has been detailed by the witnesses. It further appears that Blake was not then engaged in any of the primary duties which a master owes to a servant, such as the furnishing of safe tools, a reasonably safe place, etc., but was simply a fellow-servant with the injured man. And if the act of Blake\u2019s which caused the injury to the plaintiff was negligent, Blake would be liable, he being a fellow-servant, but the master or employer would not be liable, because there was no such relation subsisting between Blake and the master in that respect as to make Blake the vice principal of the master or render the latter liable for such injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">This being the case as disclosed by the evidence of the plaintiff, the relation of master and servant was subsisting and this plaintiff being in the lawful enjoyment of an incident of his employment, connected with his employment and the injury being caused by a fellow-servant, the master would not be liable, under the law. It was a risk assumed by the servant. The Court are unanimously of the opinion that a nonsuit ought to be granted, and much as we regret to take a case from the jury, we feel constrained to direct that a nonsuit be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"AGk\"><em>Mr. </em>Brockson:\u2014If the Court please, the plaintiff declines to take a nonsuit,</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Lore, C. J., charging the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Gentlemen of the jury :\u2014For the reasons which we have stated in granting the nonsuit, and others not necessary to name, we now direct you to return a verdict in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Verdict for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
