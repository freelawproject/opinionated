He was sentenced to a term of six years for the larceny and to a term of two years for carrying a concealed weapon, to run concurrently with the six-year sentence. On this appeal, appellant contends (a) that the evidence was insufficient to convict him on the larceny charge, and (b) that he was unlawfully arrested on the concealed weapon charge and that evidence taken from him as a result thereof was improperly admitted in evidence at the trial, and (c) that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">It was established at the trial that appellant went to the home of Wallace Westcott in Baltimore City on the evening of October 8, 1965; that appellant was there looking for work and Westcott put him up for the night because he had no place to stay; that Westcott agreed to take appellant to a friend\u2019s house the next morning and also agreed that appellant should return to his home for work the following Monday; that Westcott retired at approximately 1:00 a.m., after checking that everything in the house was locked up for the night. Upon arising at 5 :00 a.m., Westcott discovered that appellant was gone and that approximately $33.00 had been taken from his pants pocket; that a camera and electric razor had also been taken. There was evidence showing that Westcott checked to see if the doors and windows were still locked and discovered that there was no forced entry. The appellant did not return to Westcott\u2019s house as he had promised.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">On these facts, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to establish appellant\u2019s guilt on the grand larceny charge and that the finding of the trial court was not clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">We find no legally sufficient evidence, however, to support the conviction of carrying a concealed weapon. As to that charge, the record shows that appellant was sitting at the counter drinking a coke in a drugstore in Baltimore City on May 8, 1966 when a police officer, responding to a call that a man was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the drugstore \u201carmed with a straight razor,\u201d entered the store and arrested him. The arresting officer testified that upon entering the store, he observed that appellant \u201chad the top of a straight razor protruding out\u201d from his left side coat pocket of a sport coat. The officer testified that \u201cthe top part of it was visible from the coat\u201d; that \u201cas soon as you come in the door, you could see the top of the razor sticking out of the pocket there\u201d; that the razor was not lying down inside the pocket, but \u201cwas sticking up\u201d; and that it was \u201cthe top part of the razor where you put your finger through\u201d that was protruding from appellant\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Appellant\u2019s conviction was based upon that part of Section 36 of Article 27 of the Maryland Code (1967 Repl. Vol.), which provides that no person \u201cshall wear or carry any * * * razor, * * * concealed upon or about his person.\u201d In <em>Shipley v. State, </em>243 Md. 262, 269, it was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201c* * * a weapon is concealed if it is so situated as not to be discernible by ordinary observation by those near enough to see it if it were not concealed who would come into contact with the possessor in the usual associations of life, but absolute invisibility is not required; since ordinary observation does not extend to a search unusually careful, thorough or detailed, made because of suspicion that contraband which is not visible by ordinary observation may in actuality be present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">On the state of the record before us, it appears clear that the razor was discernible by ordinary observation; indeed, the police officer saw it immediately as he came through the door of the drugstore and he was responding to a call, presumably from a person within the drugstore, who saw appellant with the razor protruding from his pocket. Under these circumstances, we do not think the razor was concealed from ordinary observation within the meaning of the statute. While only part of it was visible, it is apparent that the part which was protruding was such as to make it clearly identifiable as a straight razor. This case is unlike <em>Crosby v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 578, where the handle of the weapon was visible only because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>defendant\u2019s jacket, which was covering the weapon, became unbuttoned at a time when he was being observed by a police officer. Here, the weapon was visible in part to ordinary observation, and it does not appear that appellant was attempting to conceal it from plain view. We conclude, therefore, that appellant\u2019s conviction for carrying a concealed weapon was clearly erroneous.
