There were several other complaints but we need consider only this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Norfolk\u2019s arrest was described by two of the three police officers involved in the following language: Officer Richard Henry testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\u201cA Well, I was standing on the corner of Williams and Hamburg Street. I was looking west on Hamburg Street and I observed what I took to be men standing alongside of the bar on the south side of Hamburg Street by a window, about twenty-five or thirty feet east of Light Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">\u201cQ What, if anything, were they doing at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\"><em>\u201cA </em>I couldn\u2019t see. I wasn\u2019t close enough to see what they were doing. And this building is the offices of Attorney at Law, Harry I. Kaplan, 1001 Light Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">\u201cQ That is the address at wdiich you saw them ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-10\"><em>\u201cA </em>Yes, sir, alongside of Hamburg Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-11\">\u201cQ What did you do ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-12\">\u201cA I started along Light Street to investigate what they were doing alongside the window there. As I was going west on Hamburg Street, I don\u2019t know if they seen me or what it was, but they took off at a fast pace walking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-13\">\u201cQ What do you mean by a \u2018Fast pace walking\u2019 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-14\">\u201cA They just took off walking real fast. It wasn\u2019t a run and it wasn\u2019t a slow walk. I mean to me, a slow walk is just dragging along, taking their good old time, but this started at a fast pace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-15\">\u201cQ What, if anything, did you do when you saw these men start to leave ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-16\">\u201cA I started going on down Hamburg Street towards Light Street to investigate them and, like I say, as I started down, I don\u2019t know if they seen me or what, but they took to walking across Light Street at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>a fast pace. By this time Car Number 902, manned by Officer Robert Stevens and Edward Johnson, was northbound on Light Street and they observed them and'stopped them on the corner \u2014 on the northwest corner of Light and Hamburg Street. And I walked down, continued on, and Officers Johnson and Stevens were talking to the two men at that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Officer Robert M. Stevens testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u201cQ What, if anything, did you observe at that time on March 15, 1967?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\"><em>\u201cA </em>We observed the defendant, Charles Norfolk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">MR. CARDIN: For the record, the witness has indicated the defendant, Charles Norfolk, seated at the counsel table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\"><em>\u201cA </em>And one Samuel Weaver, who is not present in the court room this afternoon. He emerged from alongside of 1001 Light Street, which is the law office of Harry Kaplan. As we were approaching up the street, these two walked hurriedly across the street into Hamburg Street. As we turned into Hamburg Street, the headlights of the radio car hit right on both of them and Charles Norfolk turned his back as if trying to hide something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">\u201cQ What do you mean by \u2018Turned his back as if to hide somehting\u2019? Would you be a little more specific?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">\u201cA As we were making the turn into the street, I was driving the radio car. They were on the sidewalk, which would be the northwest corner of Light and Hamburg Street. He turned his back away from us as. if he was trying to hide something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">\u201cQ What, if anything, did you do ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-13\">\u201cA We stopped. We got out. I asked him what they were doing. I got two conflicting stories from them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-14\">\u201cQ You asked them what they were doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-15\">\u201cA That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-16\">\u201cQ What response did you get ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-17\">MR. HARRIS: I would object, if Your Honor please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>THE COURT: I will overrule the objection. Were they in custody at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">\u201cA Not at that time, no sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">THE COURT: All right, I will overrule the objection, but I will admit only what Norfolk said, not what the other man said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201cQ Did Norfolk give you a response ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\"><em>\u201cA </em>He stated they were going to a friend\u2019s house to fix electrical fixtures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">THE COURT: A what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\"><em>\u201cA </em>Electrical fixtures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-11\"><em>\u201cQ </em>What time was this ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-12\"><em>\u201cA </em>Approximately 4:15 a.m. in the morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-13\"><em>\u201cQ </em>What, if anything, occurred then ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-14\"><em>\u201cA </em>That is when Officer Johnson saw this screwdriver protruding from his left coat pocket. They were then placed under arrest for investigation and I called for the cruising patrol and, as was routinely done, they were searched and patted down. That is when the two bags were found on Charles Norfolk and the other bag was found on the other defendant, Samuel Weaver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-15\"><em>\u201cQ </em>Officer Stevens, did there come a time when Officer Henry joined you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-16\">\u201cA That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-17\">\u201cQ When was that in relation to this episode you have just told us about ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-18\"><em>\u201cA </em>At about the same time we recovered the screwdriver from his pocket and it was certain information that we received from Officer Henry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-19\"><em>\u201cQ </em>What did Officer Henry tell you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-20\"><em>\u201cA </em>He told us he had been observing him alongside of Harry Kaplan\u2019s law office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-21\">\u201cQ Officer Stevens, on March 15, 1967, at 4:15 a.m., when you met the defendant, Charles Norfolk, had you known him prior to that date ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-22\">\u201cA Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-23\">\u201cQ Under what circumstances did you know him prior to that date ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>\u201cA </em>Prior to that, I had affected an arrest on him for a breaking and entering at 201 East Cross Street, which at the time was Catherine\u2019s Confectionary Store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">\u201cQ Did you know the outcome of that case ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>That is correct. He was found guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The third officer\u2019s testimony was substantially the same as Officer Stevens\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">In addition, the record shows that the area where Norfolk was observed by the officers was well lit and no jimmy marks were found on the building he was suspected of attempting to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">The State contends the arrest did not occur until after (1) Officer Johnson observed the screwdriver protruding from Norfolk\u2019s pocket (2) Officer Henry had informed Officer Stevens, the arresting officer, of his observations and that this coupled with Norfolk\u2019s prior criminal record and his unusual explanation of his presence at that hour of the morning, constituted a sufficient basis for the arrest. We do not agree. We think that even a person with a criminal record can carry a screwdriver on a well lit street at 4:15 in the morning without being subject to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">In <em>Allen v. State, </em>229 Md. 253, 255-56, 182 A. 2d 832, 833 the Court of Appeals of Maryland stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">\u201cThe lawfulness of appellant\u2019s arrest (and the proper admittance of the heroin into evidence as an incident thereto) depends upon whether the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge were sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense was being committed in his presence. <em>Price v. State, </em>227 Md. 28, 175 A. 2d 11; <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U. S. 160 (a felony case). * * * a peace officer may arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor committed in his presence or view.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">We think that this test is not substantially different from that required for a felony except for the requirement that in a misdemeanor case, as here, the offense must be committed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>officer\u2019s presence. The test for a legal felony arrest was stated by the Court of Appeals of Maryland in <em>Braxton v. State, </em>234 Md. 1, <em>4, 197 </em>A. 2d 841, 843 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">\u201c* * * the arresting officer, acting as would a reasonably cautious man, must have had grounds (including facts and circumstances within his knowledge or of which he has reasonably reliable information) to believe (a) that a felony had been committed and (b) that the person arrested had committed the felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In that case the Court held (also at page 4) that the fact that the trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">\u201c* * * (a) the police knew of recent burglaries in the neighborhood and were looking for evidence to help bring the perpetrators to justice, (b) the truck was not of the type to be expected in the area (not bearing the name of any firm or company) and took \u2018evasive action\u2019 without lights when followed, and (c) the occupants of the truck ran away * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">was not sufficient to furnish probable cause for the arrest. Although the Court found that Braxton had committed an automobile violation which justified his arrest, and although the question of probable cause is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case, it appears to us that the rationale of Braxton controls our decision here.
