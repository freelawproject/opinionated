Harris, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>sitting without a jury, of the crime of robbery. Upon her conviction, she was sentenced to not more than eight years in the Correctional Institution for Women. She appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The testimony as set forth in the record discloses that the prosecuting witness, Henry Fagan, spent the evening of February 24, 1967, and the early hours of February 25th, at Buddy Brooks\u2019 Bar, dancing and drinking with the appellant, Dorothy Watkins. After the band stopped playing around 1:00 a.m., appellant invited Fagan to her home for some drinks. He agreed and as they started for his car, she asked him to wait while she got some soda for her kids. When she returned, she was accompanied by a man she introduced as her \u201cbrother.\u201d She asked if she could bring him along, to which Fagan consented. When the three arrived at appellant\u2019s house, Fagan went upstairs to the bathroom, while appellant prepared the drinks. On his return to the living room, he was assaulted by both appellant\u2019s \u201cbrother\u201d and appellant. The \u201cbrother,\u201d who was armed with a metal pipe, struck him repeatedly about the head, while appellant moved a Hi-Fi by the door to block his escape and assisted her \u201cbrother\u201d by grabbing Fagan and taking his wallet containing $119.00 from his pocket. Bleeding profusely, Fagan finally made his escape and returned to the bar where he told his story to the police. Officers Barrick and Eckert accompanied by Fagan returned to appellant\u2019s apartment. There they found blood on the floor and appellant attempting to clean up the blood spots with a bucket of water and a broom. Fagan\u2019s empty wallet was found on the floor and a brown paper bag, containing Fagan\u2019s identification card, license and other papers, was found on the television set. The \u201cbrother\u201d had disappeared and could not be found. Fagan suffered a broken left arm and severe head injuries and was taken to the hospital. His money was never recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Appellant\u2019s first contention on appeal is that the court erred in allowing the State to amend the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Prior to the taking of testimony, the assistant State\u2019s attorney made an oral request to the court to be permitted to amend the date of the crime set forth in the indictment from February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>2, </em>1967, to February 25, 1967, the correct date of the alleged offense. He told the court that the offense report carried the date of February 25, 1967, and that the February 2, 1967 date must have been a clerical error. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the amendment, although he admitted that he had access to the State\u2019s information and was not deceived as to the correct date. He did not request a continuance and the court, being satisfied that the appellant knew the correct date, permitted the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Rule 714 a., Maryland Rules of Procedure provides that, \u201cThe court may permit an indictment or information to be amended at any time before verdict as to matter of form, but not as to matter of substance.\u201d In <em>Corbin v. State, </em>237 Md. 486, 489, 206 A. 2d 809 (1965), the Court of Appeals laid down the rule as to what is substance when it said: \u201cAs to what constitutes substance and what is merely formal in an indictment, it may be said that all facts which must be proved to make the act complained of a crime are matters of substance, and that all else\u2014 including the order of arraignment and precise words, unless they alone will convey the proper meaning \u2014 is formal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Under the circumstances as presented here changing the date of the commission of the offense charged was a change in form and not in substance, since none of the essential elements of the offense were changed, and, under the circumstances, resulted in no prejudice to the rights of the appellant. We find that the amendment was properly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">II and III</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Appellant\u2019s second and third contentions which relate to error on the part of the trial court to grant appellant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case and at the end of the entire case; and that the evidence was not sufficient to convict, may be treated together since both contentions are the same and relate to the same facts. <em>McGlothlin v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 256, 261, 229 A. 2d 428 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">In a non-jury trial this Court will review the case upon both the law and the evidence, but the judgment of the lower court will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>Jason v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 136, 138, 228 A. 2d 485 (1967); <em>Stewart v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>1 Md. App. 309, 229 A. 2d 727 (1967); <em>Michael v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 243, 229 A. 2d 145 (1967); Maryland Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in a non-jury trial, it is the function of this Court to determine whether the evidence, if believed, either shows directly or supports a rational inference of the facts to be proved, from which the court could fairly be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged. <em>McFadden v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 511, 517, 231 A. 2d 910 (1967); <em>Chittum v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 205, 209, 228 A. 2d 628 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Here there was ample evidence, if believed by the trier of the facts, to find the appellant guilty of robbery. The testimony of the prosecuting witness, Fagan, supported by the testimony of the two police officers who accompanied him to the home of the appellant after the robbery, was clearly sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant, together with her \u201cbrother,\u201d had robbed Fagan.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
