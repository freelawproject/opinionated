Cullen, sitting without a jury. Appellant was sentenced to three years in the Maryland House of Correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention raised on this appeal is that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">The thrust of the appellant\u2019s contention is that since the evidence produced at trial established that the offense occurred between 8:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. an essential element of burglary is absent, namely, the commission of the offense in the nighttime.</p>\n<p id=\"AZf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The indictment under which the appellant was convicted alleges \u201cthat Clarence Bright * * * feloniously committed burglary in the nighttime of the dwelling of Leatrice Johnson * * We therefore find that appellant\u2019s contention is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Here the uncontradicted evidence, according to the stipulation entered into between counsel for the appellant and the assistant State\u2019s attorney, shows that the alleged burglary occurred between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., which would be in the daytime and not in the nighttime as alleged in the indictment under which appellant was convicted. The judgment must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
