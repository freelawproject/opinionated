Corbett, the appellant, was convicted of unauthorized use of an automobile, in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, in a trial before the court without a jury. Corbett complains that the lower court was clearly erroneous in considering facts not in the record. There were also other contentions which we need not consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">The evidence adduced at the trial showed that on March 15, 1967 at about 3:30 P.M., Helen Smith reported to the police that her 1964 Oldsmobile had been stolen. An hour later, Of\u25a0ficer Garrity, while on radio car patrol duty, recovered the car. Garrity chased the automobile after the driver failed to obey a stop sign. At the end of the chase, the three occupants of the car fled from the scene; however, Officer Garrity did apprehend one of them \u2014 Corbett.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Two alibi witnesses testified for the defense; in addition Ronald Morgan made an in-court confession that he committed the crime but managed to elude the police officers in the alley in which Corbett was apprehended. He stated further that Corbett was not with him and had no part in the crime. In announcing his findings of fact the trial j udge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, gentlemen, I am going to hold this sub curia. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">\u201cI think that as far as Morgan\u2019s testimony is concerned, if he did do this, he\u2019s done a very courageous and honest thing by coming forward and admitting that he did it. On the other hand, his prior record is not good. He casts some doubt upon the truthfulness of the testimony and I am worried and suspicious over the testimony that he was in the car with two other men or boys and he never knew their names and still doesn\u2019t know who they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of unusual things about this case and one thing is Morgan's testimony that he stole the car with two virtual strangers, whose names he\u2019s never known, and they ran one way and he ran the other when the police caught up to them. If he did do it, he is doing a very honest and courageous thing, but his story has some loopholes in it, such as his ignorance of his two accomplices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Subsequently, when the judge announced his decision, after referring to the testimony of the police officer, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: We have that testimony, and then, of course, Morgan takes the stand and took the blame for the whole crime; that he said that he was the one who had stolen the automobile, and Corbett had not, and quite frankly, when I first heard Morgan testify to that effect, I was impressed with it. He also testified that he does not know Corbett; that was <em>my </em>recollection, and I had the reporter type up that part of Morgan\u2019s testimony. The question was, \u2018Do you know the defendant, Corbett? Answer: No; I don\u2019t know him. Question: Never knew him? Answer: Just re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>cently I have seen him, but I don\u2019t know him; not specifically to say that he is my friend, no; I can\u2019t say that. . . .\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Then I asked, I said, \u2018How did you find out Corbett was being charged with the larceny of this automobile? Answer: Well, prior to the time I came over here, some friends that do know James Corbett told me, they asked me, \u201cdid you hear how that boy had been locked up ?\u201d I said, who ? They said, \u201cJames Corbett.\u201d I asked, for what? At the time they described the crime he had committed, I knew right then and there it wasn\u2019t him.\u2019 Now, considerable doubt is thrown on the testimony of Morgan by his testimony that he never knew Corbett.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">\u201cMR. MOORE: That is not a fair interpretation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, now, I will read it again. \u2018Do you know the defendant, Corbett? Answer: No; I don\u2019t know him. Question: Never knew him? Just recently I have seen him, but I don\u2019t know him; not specifically to say that he is my friend; no; I can\u2019t say that.\u2019 <em>The source of my doubt is that since the beginning of the trial of this case, I found out that Morgan and Corbett are charged jointly in several other cases, as co-defendants, so that it is hard for me to' place much faith in what Morgan testified to when he said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t know him,\u2019 and he is being charged along with Corbett in other offenses. He must know him.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\"><em>\u201cI am convinced in my mind that Morgan not only knows Corbett, but he has known him for some time, and that Corbett knows Morgan, and for that reason, I find it quite difficult to believe that Morgan, for reasons of his own, actually committed the crime, which at least he says he did.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">Maryland Rule 1086 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-13\">\u201cWhen a case has been tried by the lower court without a jury, this Court will review the case upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>both the law and the evidence, but the judgment of the lower court will not be set aside on the evidence unless clearly erroneous and due regard will be given to the opportunity of the lower court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We hold that the trial judge was clearly erroneous when he relied upon knowledge acquired from outside of the record that Corbett and Morgan had been jointly indicted for other offenses. The other indictments were not introduced into evidence and were not called to the attention of the judge on the record, and it was not until the decision was announced that the trial judge indicated that he had any knowledge of these other indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In civil cases the Court of Appeals of Maryland has laid down the rule that it may take judicial notice of other proceedings in cases before it, <em>Jeweler v. Potomac Electric Power Company, </em>217 Md. 458, 144 A. 2d 66, but the Court has laid down a different rule with respect to trial courts. In <em>Fletcher v. Flournoy, </em>198 Md. 53, 81 A. 2d 232, 235 the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">\u201cWe are asked to say that the lower court \u2014 and this court \u2014 may take judicial notice of the record in that case in Montgomery County, in the court in which the instant case was instituted and from which it was removed to Howard County. In a recent case of the present plaintiff against Judge Bryan, <em>Fletcher v. Bryan, </em>175 F. 2d 716, 717, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit quoted and followed a statement in its opinion by Judge Soper in <em>Morse v. Lewis, </em>4 Cir., 54 F. 2d 1027, \u2018The general rule undoubtedly is that a court will not travel outside the record of the case before it in order to take notice of the proceedings in another case, even between the same parties and in the same court, unless the proceedings are put in evidence; and the rule is sometimes enforced with considerable strictness. * * * But in exceptional cases, as high authority shows, the dictates of logic will yield to the demands of justice, and the courts, in order to reach a just result, will make use of established and uncontroverted facts not formally of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>record in the pending litigation.\u2019 In the instant case, the demands of justice do not suggest an exception to settled rules. Rule 2 itself provides a simple and inexpensive way to present such records in the form of \u2018Sworn, or certified or photostatic copies\u2019 attached to or filed with an affidavit. This court, like the Supreme Court <em>(DeBearn v. Safe Deposit and Trust Company, </em>233 U. S. 24, 32, 34 S. Ct. 584, 58 L. Ed. 833), takes judicial notice of its own records, in the instant case as in other cases. <em>Christopher v. Sisk, </em>133 Md. 48, 50, 104 A. 355; <em>Snodgrass v. Stubbs, </em>Md., 64 A. 2d 130, 133. As to trial courts, the general rule stated hy Judge Soper is law in Maryland. This situation has for many years been regulated by statutes which make original papers admissible in lieu of certified copies. Code, art. 35, sec. 88; Baltimore City Charter, (1949 Ed.), sec. 308. If in this respect the scope of judicial notice should be broadened, we can accomplish such a result only by exercise of the rule-making power, not by departing from settled law in a particular case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The rule adopted in Maryland seems to be the general rule, 9 Wigmore: <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 2579 at 570 (3rd ed.) ; McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 327. Wharton states, however, that in criminal cases there is a division of authority, 1 Wharton <em>Criminal Evidence, </em>\u00a7 63 (12th ed.), but we do not think that a less stringent rule should be applied in criminal cases, where liberty is at stake, than in civil cases, where usually only property is at stake. Especially do we think that the rule should not be relaxed here where the information was not called to the attention of the witness for a possible explanation; and where the trial judge relied on unproven indictments to determine that the witness, Morgan, was unreliable. It is, of course, possible that the same determination would have been reached on the other evidence, but we cannot thus place ourselves in the position of the trial judge and ignore what he said.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
