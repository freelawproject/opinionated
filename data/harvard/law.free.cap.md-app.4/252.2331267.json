Also, the attorney\u2019s receptionist was pemitted to testify, over objection, that the Appellant was known to her both as George Morris and as George Chesnut and that the office files indicated that he used both names. The Appellant asserted that his real name was George Chesnut and he denied ever having used the name George Morris. He admitted, however, that the attorney who produced the statements had previously represented him in a civil matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>In this appeal, it is contended that the introduction of statements bearing the signature George Morris and the testimony of the receptionist identifying the Appellant as George Morris- and George Chesnut were in violation of the confidential relationship between attorney and client. The statements were offered not for their substance but solely for the purpose of identifying the Appellant as a client who had represented his name to be George Morris. Thus, the question for determination is-whether the identity of a client is protected by the privilege which ordinarily attaches to communications arising out of the attorney-client relationship. While the issue appears to be one of first impression in this State, it has been the subject of decision in a number of jurisdictions throughout the Country.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The principle of the attorney-client privilege is grounded in the common law, and, according to Professor Wigmore, its history goes back at least to the reign of Elizabeth I. See 8 <em>Wigmore, Evidence, </em>Sec. 2290 (McNaughton, rev. 1961). In some States the privilege has been recognized and regulated by statute ; but by and large, the common law principle has remained unchanged even in those states which have enacted specific statutes since they have been interpreted as simply reflecting the common law doctrine. Professor Wigmore phrases the principle as follows (supra, Sec. 2292) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">\u201c(1) Where legal advice of kind is sought (2) from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his insistence permanently protected (7) from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser, (8) except the protection be waived.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">It is apparent from the foregoing statement that what is sought primarily to be protected are the communications between the client and the attorney, the modern theory being that an individual in a free society should be encouraged to consult with his attorney whose function is to counsel and advise him and he should be free from apprehension of compelled disclosures by his legal advisor. Miller, <em>The Challenge to the Attorney-Client Privilege, </em>39 Va. L. R. 262, 268 (1963). However, since resort to the privilege obviously tends to stifle the truth, which is-what courts are seeking to ascertain, the privilege is not with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>out limitations. See <em>McCormick, Evidence, </em>Sec. 94. Thus, in <em>Coulton v. United States, </em>(C.C.A. 2d) 307 F. 2d 633, Cert. Den. 371 U. S. 951, Chief Judge Lumbard, after reciting the attorney-client privilege, stated (p. 637) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">\u201cBut, although the word \u2018communications\u2019 must be broadly interpreted in this context, see 8 Wigmore, Evidence, Sec. 2306 (McNaughton, rev. 1961), the authorities are clear that the privilege extends essentially only to the substance of matters communicated to an attorney in professional confidence. Thus the identity of a client, or the fact that a given individual has become a client are matters which an attorney normally may not refuse to disclose, even though the fact of having retained counsel may be used as evidence against the client.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">It appears, therefore, to be well settled that \u201cthe rule making communications between attorney and client privileged from disclosure ordinarily does not apply where the inquiry is confined to the fact of the attorney\u2019s employment and the name of the person employing him since the privilege presupposes the relationship of client and attorney and therefore it does not attach to its creation.\u201d See collection of cases in Anno.\u2014Disclosure of Client\u2019s name or business, 114 A.L.R. 1332. See also 3 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence, </em>Sec. 809 (Anderson\u2019s Edition); <em>Wigmore, </em>supra, Sec. 2313; <em>McCormick, </em>supra, Sec. 94; 97 C.J.S. <em>Witnesses, </em>Sec. 283 e.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Most of the authorities agree that there may be special circumstances under which the revelation of a client\u2019s identity may violate the attorney-client privilege, as for example, where so much of a confidential communication has already been disclosed that revealing the identity of the client would amount to a full disclosure of the confidential communication. <em>NLRB v. Harvey, </em>(C.C.A. 4th) 349 F. 2d 900. In the case at bar, however, no special circumstances are present. We think it is clear that the substance of the statements upon which the Appellant\u2019s signature appeared was not placed in evidence, the purpose of offering them being solely to identify the Appellant. His objection goes only to the signatures which constituted evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Appellant had previously represented his name to be George Morris and which afforded an opportunity to compare those signatures with those of the endorsements on the Welfare checks and the employers checks. It is apparent, therefore, that the revelation of the Appellant\u2019s identity by the attorney\u2019s receptionist and the production of the Appellant\u2019s signatures, under the circumstances here existing, did not constitute a violation of the confidential relationship' between the Appellant and his previously employed attorney and, accordingly, his objection to their admission is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
