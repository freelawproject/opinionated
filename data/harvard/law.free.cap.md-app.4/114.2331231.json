The autopsy report admitted into evidence by stipulation placed the time of the injury at about 7:30 a.m. on August 1, 1966.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The only eyewitness, except the participants, to the occurrence was Patrick J. O\u2019Donnell, 73 years of age, who testified that at approximately 5 :40 p.m. on August 1, 1966, he was sitting on the steps of 102 North Washington Street; that he saw a man coming out of the bar at 100 North Washington Street, cross Washington Street; and approximately a minute or two later another man came out behind him. The second man he identified as Rasnick, the appellant, herein. The witness related that Rasnick walked after the first man calling to him, \u201cwait up.\u201d The first man did not stop, but that Rasnick caught up with him and they engaged in a conversation which the witness did not overhear. Rasnick then \u201chit the other man and over the steps he went.\u201d The other man then got up, came back toward Rasnick, hollering, \u201cHe is robbing me. Help, help, he is robbing me.\u201d Rasnick then hit the other man again \u201cwith his fist and the man went over the step again.\u201d Rasnick then walked around the steps where the other man was lying and raised his foot and brought it down.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Rasnick was granted a recess in order to secure a transcript of the testimony at the preliminary hearing. On March 9th, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>1967 the witness, O\u2019Donnell, testified on further cross examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">\u201cQ Mr. O\u2019Donnell, once again, briefly, would you tell the Court exactly what you saw as you were sitting on the steps on the day in question ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">\u201cA Well, I was sitting on the steps and I saw the deceased come out of the bar, cross the street, and a few minutes later this Mr. Rasnick come out. He went across behind him and hollered for him. He got on the south side of Fairmount Avenue. Seen him talking there and the first thing I know this man, Rasnick, looked to me like he throwed him across the steps. He could have hit him. He went across the steps. The man got up, went around the step again. At this time, this deceased man hollered \u2018Help, he is robbing me.\u2019 He hit him again and went over the steps. Then he fell again and I saw Mr. Rasnick, whatever his name is, right there, put his foot up like he stomped him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">\u201cQ I believe it was your testimony just now, Mr. O\u2019Donnell, that when the two men first came together you stated Mr. Rasnick, and I think you used the words \u2018throwed him across the steps\u2019, or \u2018He could have hit him.\u2019 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">\u201cA Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">\u201cQ Do you recall testifying in this case, in your prior testimony, that the Defendant in this case, Mr. Rasnick, struck the deceased ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">\u201cA Well, he looked to me like he struck him. Could have been he just grabbed him, throwed him across the steps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">\u201cQ Of course, is it true you are not sure whether or not he struck him or threw him across the steps ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-12\">\u201cA No, I\u2019m not sure. I was a little too far away to see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-13\">\u201cQ After the Defendant, Mr. Rasnick, either threw or struck the deceased and he went across the steps, I understand it is your testimony the deceased then got up, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>\u201cA </em>That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">\u201cQ Then the deceased proceeded towards the Defendant, Mr. Rasnick, correct ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">\u201cQ At this particular point did you see the deceased strike Mr. Rasnick ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">\u201cA No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">\u201cQ Did you see Mr. Rasnick strike the deceased ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">\u201cA No, only thing I saw at that time, the deceased, this man hollering \u2018Help, he is robbing me. He is robbing me.\u2019 Then he either struck or throwed him across the steps again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">\u201cQ This second time you are not sure whether or not the Defendant struck or threw him across the steps ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">\u201cA No, I\u2019m not. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-13\">\u201cQ Again, it is my understanding, Mr. O\u2019Donnell, when the deceased got up after he was thrown down the first time or struck down the first time, he came towards the Defendant, correct ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-14\">\u201cA Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-15\">\u201cQ Approximately how far away was he from the Defendant when he was getting up in terms of feet ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-16\">\u201cA When he got up from being hit the first time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-17\">\u201cQ Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-18\">\u201cA Approximately four to five feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-19\">\u201cQ At no time did you see the Defendant go towards the deceased, is that correct ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-20\">\u201cA That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-21\">\u201cQ When the deceased got to the Defendant, Mr. Rasnick, after getting up, did you see him raise his hands at all ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-22\">\u201cA No, I did not at that time. When he started, when the deceased started hollering \u2018Help, I\u2019m being robbed,\u2019 then he either hit him. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-23\">THE COURT: Who is \u2018he\u2019? The Defendant, you mean ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-24\">THE WITNESS : Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>THE COURT: The reason the Court said \u2018Defendant\u2019 was because the witness was pointing to the Defendant in answering the Court\u2019s question. Is that stipulated ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">MR. PEREGOFF: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">MR. MAXWELL: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">THE COURT: Very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">THE WITNESS: Either hit him or throwed him across the steps again, and the Defendant went around, picked his foot up, looked like he stomped him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">BY MR. MAXWELL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">\u201cQ You didn\u2019t see that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">\u201cA No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">\u201cQ Did you see the Defendant at any time himself trip across the steps ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">\u201cA Not that I can recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-14\">\u201cQ You recall testifying at the Homicide hearing in Municipal Court on October 7, 1966. Remember testifying in this case ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-15\">\u201cA I testified practically the same statement as I\u2019m giving now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-16\">\u201cQ Do you recall, sir, testifying in that particular case: \u2018They must have gotten in a little argument, fight or something. This man drove him across the steps with his fist and the man got up and come around \u2014\u2019. Do you recall that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-17\">\u201cA Yes, I recall that because they stopped in front of these steps before any argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-18\">\u201cQ Recall testifying in your first testimony in this case Mr. Rasnick used his fist to strike the deceased ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-19\">\u201cA Looked like his fist to me. I told you I was across the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-20\">\u201cQ Do you remember, as we stated in the first hearing in this case, when you gave a statement to the Baltimore City Police Department right after you witnessed this incident you stated the man was thrown over the steps ? Recall saying that to the Police Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-21\">\u201cA Yes, I think I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u201cQ And again this afternoon you testified, Mr. O\u2019Donnell, you are not sure whether he threw him or struck him ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>Or struck him, that is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">\u201cQ Do you recall in the preliminary hearing at the Police Court being asked the question: \u2018Pie came up behind him, had an argument. Then who struck the first blow ?\u2019 The answer was: \u2018That I don\u2019t know, but I do know one man went over the steps and it wasn\u2019t that man,\u2019 indicating the Defendant. Remember that question and answer ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">\u201cA I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">\u201cQ You don\u2019t know, is that correct, who actually struck the first blow in this altercation ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">MR. PEREGOFF: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">THE COURT: Sustained. With your permission, Mr. Maxwell; Mr. O\u2019Donnell, did you see the decedent strike or attempt to strike at any time the Defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-12\">THE WITNESS : I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-13\">BY MR. MAXWELL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-14\">\u201cQ Recall being asked this question in Municipal Court? Mr. O\u2019Donnell, for the record, I am reading from the transcript of the Homicide hearing at page 16. Questioned by Mr. Federico, Court appointed in this hearing: \u2018In any event, you didn\u2019t see any robbery yourself?\u2019 Answer: \u2018No, no, no.\u2019 Question: \u2018Of course not. You don\u2019t know who struck the first blow, do you?\u2019 Answer: T do not, no.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-15\">\u201cA That is correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">Rasnick testified that he began drinking with the deceased early on the day of August 1, 1966; and that the deceased had fallen down some steps at approximately 12 Noon. His story continued that he and the deceased had gone to Jay\u2019s Bar where they were refused service; they then went to Howard\u2019s Bar at 100 N. Washington Street, where they purchased beer, which he paid for; and that thereafter the deceased left the bar and went across the street, and he followed. An argument then ensued, the deceased reaching out and grabbing him by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>shirt collar, at which point Rasnick stated he then pushed him and he fell across the steps, that the deceased then got up and came back at him saying: \u201cGod damn you, I\u2019ll cripple you,\u201d when he then hit the deceased and knocked him across the steps. While the deceased was lying across the steps, blood trickling from his mouth, Rasnick related he then stepped over him and went to another bar. Rasnick contended that because of his hip injury, he could not run and had to defend himself against the deceased. On cross examination he denied stomping or attempting to rob the deceased. It was also learned that Rasnick was S'6\" tall and weighed about 149 lbs.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">It was stipulated that Rasnick could not run because of an old hip injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">A careful review of the record reveals that the sole evidence to support the proposition that Rasnick was engaged in an attempted robbery at the time the injuries causing death occurred, was the statement of the deceased: \u201cHe is robbing me. Help, help, he is robbing me,\u201d which statement was made at the time the deceased was advancing towards Rasnick, the accused. The trial judge found the testimony of Mr. O\u2019Donnell to be entirely credible, and we, of course, accept that finding; but we do not think that that statement alone, in view of the other evidence, is sufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Rasnick was attempting to rob the deceased. There is no evidence that he attempted to take anything from the deceased; that he made any search of the deceased\u2019s clothing to find any valuables; and, in fact, the evidence discloses that after the deceased was lying helpless on the sidewalk, Rasnick voluntarily walked away, even though no one interrupted the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In <em>Estep v. State, </em>199 Md. 308, 86 A. 2d 470, 473 the Court of Appeals of Maryland said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">\u201cNo matter how sordid the case and how suspicious the circumstances, we cannot permit a person charged with crime to be convicted without evidence. The conjectures of the trial judge might be entirely correct, and the evidence produced before him might be false in important particulars. Nevertheless, a conviction without proof cannot be sustained under the laws of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>this State. A man is innocent until he is proved guilty, and there must be evidence which leads to such a result. Since we find there was no such evidence in this case, the judgment must be reversed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Under Maryland Rule 1086 we find the evidence insufficient to support the judgment which, therefore, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-9\">. It will be noted the time of the alleged offense was at a later hour.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
