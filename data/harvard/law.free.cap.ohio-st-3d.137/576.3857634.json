We accept the board\u2019s recommendation and approve the proposed consent decree as submitted by the parties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-13\">Whereas, Respondent is not and has never been an attorney admitted to practice, granted active status, certified to practice law in the State of Ohio pursuant to Rules I, II, III, IV or V of the Supreme Court Rules [for] the Government of the Bar;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-14\">Whereas, on December 1, 2010, Robert D. Mellinger filed a complaint with the Ohio State Bar Association Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee [\u201cOSBA UPL Committee\u201d] alleging that John Cleminshaw engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by cross-examining him while he was a witness in a hearing before the Wayne County Board of Revision as an appraiser for the Orville Shopping Center;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-15\">Whereas, Respondent admits that while retained as a consultant real estate appraiser by the Wayne County Board of Revision, he questioned Mr. Mellinger, while Mr. Mellinger appeared as a witness;</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b787-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>William Hicks and Eugene Whetzel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b787-15\">Thompson Hine, L.L.P., Frank DeSantis, and John R.

Respondent shall not examine witnesses or otherwise participate in a County Board of Revision hearing through any conduct that would constitute the unauthorized practice of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-9\">2.

Based upon the facts: that Respondent was unaware that his conduct constituted the unauthorized practice of law at the time he undertook said activities; that Respondent has ceased and desisted said activities and has not engaged in such activities since he was first put on notice of the investigation by the Relator on January 12, 2011; that Respondent completely cooperated with the investigation by the OSBA UPL Committee with respect to the complaints against him; that no harm came to any third party as a result of his conduct; and that Respondent has agreed to cease and desist said conduct in the future, as well as any conduct that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law, no civil penalty shall be applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-11\">4.
