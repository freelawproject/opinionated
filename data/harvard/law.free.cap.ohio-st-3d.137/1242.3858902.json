Thimmes has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge Colleen O\u2019Donnell and all other Franklin County judges from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. 13-CV-007921, a legal-malpractice action pending in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Thimmes claims that defendant Thomas Taneff is an attorney who is \u201cpersonally known\u201d by Judge O\u2019Donnell and other Franklin County judges and that disqualification is therefore necessary to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Judge O\u2019Donnell has responded in writing to Thimmes\u2019s affidavit, stating that she has no personal knowledge of any party in the case and affirming that she can fairly and impartially preside over the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">{\u00b6 3} Contrary to Thimmes\u2019s contention, the fact that a local attorney is a party in an action does not create an appearance of impropriety mandating the sitting judge\u2019s removal, unless the judge\u2019s relationship with that particular lawyer justifies disqualification. <em>See In re Disqualification of Panagis, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1213, 657 N.E.2d 1328 (1989). Here, Judge O\u2019Donnell denies having any personal knowledge of Taneff, and Thimmes has not offered any evidence establishing a connection between Judge O\u2019Donnell and Taneff.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">{\u00b6 4} Accordingly, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge O\u2019Donnell.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
