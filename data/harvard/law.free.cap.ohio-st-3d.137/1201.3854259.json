Hunter from hearing and deciding motions to close the above-captioned delinquency proceedings to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-14\">{\u00b6 2} In her affidavit, Baker claims that a May 2013 e-mail from Judge Hunter to the Hamilton County prosecuting attorney demonstrates the judge\u2019s belief that Baker \u201cillegally forged\u201d the judge\u2019s name on court forms. The e-mail, according to Baker, \u201cdemonstrates bias and prejudice\u201d and requires the judge\u2019s disqualification from hearing the closure motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-15\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Hunter has responded in writing to the allegations in Baker\u2019s affidavit, asserting that neither Baker nor the Cincinnati Enquirer has standing under R.C. 2701.03 to request the judge\u2019s disqualification. The judge also disclaims any bias towards Baker or the Enquirer.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-16\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Hunter.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-17\">The Enquirer\u2019s standing to file an affidavit of disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"b791-18\">{115} Under R.C. 2701.03, \u201cany party to the proceeding or the party\u2019s counsel\u201d may file an affidavit of disqualification. In previous affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, the chief justice has strictly enforced this statutory requirement and has consistently found that individuals who do not qualify as a party or party\u2019s counsel do not have standing to file an affidavit of disqualification. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Cleary, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1225, 657 N.E.2d 1337 (1990); <em>In re Disqualification of Haas, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1217, 657 N.E.2d 1331 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>{\u00b6 6} The circumstances here, however, are unique because the media and the public play an important role \u2014 and have certain rights \u2014 regarding the closure of juvenile-court proceedings. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Floyd, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 56, 2006-Ohio-4437, 855 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 46 (\u201cWe have held that the press and the general public have standing to contest the closure of a juvenile court proceeding\u201d); <em>id. </em>(\u201cunder the current version of Juv.R. 27(A)(1), persons\u2014including the public and the press \u2014 have a right to present evidence at a closure hearing to show a \u2018countervailing right to be present\u2019 at a juvenile court proceeding\u201d); <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 47 (\u201c \u2018representatives of the press and general public \u201cmust be given the opportunity to be heard on the question of exclusion\u201d \u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court for Norfolk Cty., </em>457 U.S. 596, 609, 102 S.Ct. 2613, 73 L.Ed.2d 248 (1982), fn. 25, quoting <em>Gannett Co., Inc. v. DePasquale, </em>443 U.S. 368, 401, 99 S.Ct. 2898, 61 L.Ed.2d 608 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring); <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Geer, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 511, 2007-Ohio-4643, 873 N.E.2d 314, \u00b6 20 (prohibiting enforcement of a juvenile-court judge\u2019s media restriction that was issued \u201cwithout allowing all parties affected to have the opportunity to respond to the possibility of a restriction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">{\u00b6 7} Given this precedent \u2014 along with the fact that the Enquirer has filed objections to the pending closure motions and has entered an appearance for the hearing \u2014 the Enquirer and other similarly situated media entities shall be considered the equivalent to a party in the closure proceedings for purposes of R.C. 2701.03. Therefore, the Enquirer has standing to file an affidavit of disqualification under these limited circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Merits of the affidavit of disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"A9m\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 2701.03(B)(1) requires an affiant to.set forth \u201cspecific allegations on which the claim of interest, bias, prejudice, or disqualification is based and the facts to support each of those allegations.\u201d <em>See also In re Disqualification of Mitrovich, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-7358, 803 N.E.2d 816, \u00b6 4 (\u201cAn affidavit must describe with specificity and particularity those facts alleged to support the claim of bias or prejudice\u201d). The Enquirer has set forth only one specific allegation of bias: that \u201cJudge Hunter\u2019s May 1 e-mail demonstrates that she has concluded [that Baker] illegally forged [the judge\u2019s] name, despite clear evidence to the contrary,\u201d which \u201cdemonstrates bias and prejudice such that Judge Hunter should be disqualified from presiding over the hearings on the Closure Motions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqn\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe term \u2018bias or prejudice\u2019 \u2018implies a hostile feeling or spirit of ill-will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Neill, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1232, 2002-Ohio-7479, 798 N.E.2d 17, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956). In addition, a \u201cpresumption of impartiality\u201d is \u201caccorded all judges\u201d in affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings. <em>In re Disqualification of Celebrezze, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1224, 2003-Ohio-7352, 803 N.E.2d 823, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">{\u00b6 10} Here, Baker claims that while she was completing the juvenile court\u2019s media-access application, an unidentified court employee advised her to write the name of the judge on the form. As a result, Baker printed Judge Hunter\u2019s name on the signature line of three applications. Judge Hunter later e-mailed the prosecutor, accusing Baker of forgery, even though Baker claims that there was \u201cclear evidence to the contrary.\u201d In response, Judge Hunter asserts that she reported Baker to the prosecutor \u201cnot due to bias, but due to her judiciary obligation to report conduct of concern regarding Ms. Baker\u2019s affixing Judge Hunter\u2019s name to the signature line of the media application.\u201d According to Judge Hunter, \u201cno other reporter or any other media outlet, including the Cincinnati Enquirer\u201d affixed names to the judge\u2019s signature line on the application form. Judge Hunter further avers that she does not personally know Baker, that she did not vigorously pursue Baker\u2019s prosecution, that she has not demonstrated any bias against Baker or the Enquirer, and that she will treat all litigants fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">{\u00b6 11} On this record, the Enquirer has not conclusively established that Judge Hunter\u2019s e-mail demonstrates bias or prejudice against Baker or the Enquirer. Specifically, the record reveals that Judge Hunter discovered Baker\u2019s applications on May 1, 2013, and that the judge e-mailed the prosecutor the same day. While Baker alleges that Judge Hunter accused her of forgery \u201cdespite clear evidence to the contrary,\u201d Baker has not further explained the nature of this \u201cclear evidence\u201d or how the judge was allegedly aware of this \u201cclear evidence\u201d at the time she e-mailed the prosecutor. \u201c[V]ague, unsubstantiated allegations of the affidavit are insufficient on their face for a finding of bias or prejudice.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988); <em>see also In re Disqualification of Flanagan, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1236, 2009-Ohio-7199, 937 N.E.2d 1023, \u00b6 4 (\u201cAllegations that are based solely on hearsay, innuendo, and speculation \u2014 such as those alleged here \u2014 are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">{\u00b6 12} In conclusion, \u201c[t]he statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. * * * A judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. The record does not include sufficiently compelling evidence to overcome these presumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">{\u00b6 13} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The cases may proceed before Judge Hunter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
