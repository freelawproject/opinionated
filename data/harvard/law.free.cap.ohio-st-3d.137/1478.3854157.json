The only remaining poster \u2014 one depicting President George W. Bush and his cabinet containing the caption \u201cThe effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much,\u201d James 5:16 \u2014 had been distributed to Freshwater and others by the school administration. The other teachers and colleagues displayed that same poster in their classrooms and offices, but never received a directive to remove it from display. It is telling that the only other basis for terminating Freshwater is the fact that he withdrew two books from the school library and kept then in his classroom' \u2014 not for teaching purposes or for use in connection with the science curriculum, but rather for his own personal inspiration. This is not insubordinate conduct, nor does it establish good and just cause as required by R.C. 3319.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">{\u00b6 4} Notably, six members of this court have upheld Freshwater\u2019s constitutional right to have his Bible in his classroom. Yet this conduct and Freshwater\u2019s decision to withdraw two books from the school library for his own personal inspiration and his failure to remove the presidential poster from his classroom formed the basis of his termination by the school board. This evidence is manifestly insufficient to establish insubordination or to form a basis to conclude that good and just cause exists to discharge a veteran science teacher who has served the school district with distinction for more than 20 years. This case now stands as a basis for school boards to violate the constitutional rights of veteran teachers and to terminate them for insignificant reasons. I encourage reconsideration and further review of these important issues.</p>\n<judges id=\"b931-9\">Pfeifer and Kennedy, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
