Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">{\u00b6 1} Appellants, Jeremy Pauley and his mother, appeal from a judgment of the Fourth District Court of Appeals that affirmed summary judgment in favor of the city of Circleville regarding appellants\u2019 civil action for injuries Jeremy sustained while sledding in the city\u2019s park. We accepted the appellants\u2019 discretionary appeal, which sets forth a single proposition of law: \u201cRecreational user immunity does not extend to man-made hazards upon real property that do not further or maintain its recreational value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">{\u00b6 2} Under the recreational-user statutes (R.C. 1533.18 and 1533.181), property owners who open their premises to recreational users free of charge are immune from liability for injuries suffered by recreational users while they are engaged in a recreational activity. Appellants urge this court to hold that if a property owner modifies his or her property in a manner that creates a hazard without promoting or preserving the recreational character of the property, immunity does not apply. Finding no support in statutory or case law, we decline to adopt such an exception. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">II. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">{\u00b6 3} The city owns Barthelmas Park, which contains ball fields, a playground, and various structures, such as a concession stand and picnic shelters. Entry to the park is free of charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">{\u00b6 4} In the summer of 2006, the city was offered free topsoil that was excavated from a nearby construction site. The city uses topsoil for numerous projects, including reseeding the park. Consequently, the city accepted approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>mately 150 to 200 truckloads, which were taken to its maintenance facility for storage. When that facility reached capacity, the remaining topsoil was taken to the park and emptied onto the ground, where it formed two mounds approximately 15 feet high.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 5} On the afternoon of January 24, 2007,18-year-old Jeremy Pauley and his friends Kevin Baisden, Danielle Ziemer, and Natasha Cox decided to go snow sledding at the park. Jeremy and Kevin began sledding at about 5 p.m., while the girls looked on. At approximately 6:00 p.m., as it began getting dark, Jeremy decided on a new location for his last sled run, which was, in fact, one of the mounds of dirt that had been stored at the park by the city. Kevin moved the car so that its headlights illuminated the hill. Although there were other sled tracks on the mound, this was the first time that Jeremy had sledded down it. In his deposition, Jeremy asserted that \u201c[t]o the very, very far left side [of the hill] away from where I went sledding there was a little bit of brush or something, but nothing around where I went down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 6} Jeremy claimed that as he sledded down the hill, he \u201chit an immovable object\u201d and \u201cinstantly went numb\u201d and could not move his body. Realizing that Jeremy was critically injured, Kevin Baisden called 9-1-1. At the time, Kevin did not notice any obstacle in Jeremy\u2019s path. However, the day after the accident, Kevin went back to the park and observed an object that looked like a railroad tie in the area where Jeremy was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">{\u00b6 7} Jeremy suffered a broken neck, which caused him to become a quadriplegic. He and his mother filed a complaint alleging that the city acted negligently, recklessly, and wantonly in dumping debris in the park, which resulted in a physical defect that caused Jeremy\u2019s injuries. The complaint alleged that \u201cwaste and debris * * * created an inherently dangerous situation which no user of the park could have anticipated and thus substantially altered the nature and characteristic of the public property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court granted the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that the city was immune from suit under R.C. 1533.181. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, with one judge dissenting. 2012-Ohio-2378, 971 N.E.2d 410 (4th Dist.).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">{\u00b6 9} We accepted the appellants\u2019 discretionary appeal. 133 Ohio St.3d 1422, 2012-Ohio-4902, 976 N.E.2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">{\u00b6 10} Appellants claim that \u201cthe recreational user immunity statute is designed to preclude the right to recovery of civil damages only in specific instances.\u201d Appellants contend that R.C. 1533.181 does not apply when a property owner makes the property \u201cmore dangerous without promoting or preserving recreational activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The city argues that R.C. 1533.181 provides a \u201cbright-line rule\u201d: \u201cIf a premises is freely open to the public for recreational purposes and a person is injured while using the premises for a recreational purpose, the landowner has no duty to that user to keep the premises safe.\u201d The city argues that appellants \u201cimproperly ask this Court to judicially create an exception or limitation to recreational immunity that does not exist in the Statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\n<em>Recreational-User Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">{\u00b6 12} We begin our analysis by examining the statute, as well as applicable case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 1533.181(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">No owner, lessee, or occupant of premises:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-10\">(1) Owes any duty to a recreational user to keep the premises safe for entry or use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\">(2) Extends any assurance to a recreational user, through the act of giving permission, that the premises are safe for entry or use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-12\">(3) Assumes responsibility for or incurs liability for any injury to person or property caused by any act of a recreational user.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 1533.18 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-14\">As used in sections 1533.18 and 1533.181 of the Revised Code:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-15\">(A) \u201cPremises\u201d means all privately owned lands, ways, and waters, and any buildings and structures thereon, and all privately owned and state-owned lands, ways, and waters leased to a private person, firm, or organization, including any buildings and structures thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-16\">(B) \u201cRecreational user\u201d means a person to whom permission has been granted, without the payment of a fee or consideration to the owner, lessee, or occupant of premises, other than a fee or consideration paid to the state or any agency of the state, or a lease payment or fee paid to the owner of privately owned lands, to enter upon premises to hunt, fish, trap, camp, hike, or swim, or to operate a snowmobile, all-purpose vehicle, or four-wheel drive motor vehicle, or to engage in other recreational pursuits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>{\u00b6 15} \u201cPremises\u201d under R.C. 1533.18(A) includes land owned by municipalities and the state. <em>LiCause v. Canton, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 109, 110, 537 N.E.2d 1298 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">{\u00b6 16} In determining whether immunity applies, courts examine the essential character of the property. First, the property must be held open to the public for recreational use, free of charge. <em>See id. </em>at syllabus; <em>Fryberger v. Lake Cable Recreation Assn., Inc., </em>40 Ohio St.3d 349, 533 N.E.2d 738 (1988), paragraph one of the syllabus. <em>Compare Loyer v. Buchholz, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 65, 526 N.E.2d 300 (1988) (private pool not held open for public use is not protected by R.C. 1533.181); <em>Brinkman v. Toledo, </em>81 Ohio App.3d 429, 611 N.E.2d 380 (6th Dist.1992) (even though sidewalks and streets are often used for recreational purposes, such premises are not protected by recreational-user immunity because they do not have the essential character of land held open to the public for recreational use).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b6 17} The character of the premises envisioned by the recreational-user statute involves \u201cthe true outdoors,\u201d because \u201c[m]ost of the recreational activities enumerated in R.C. 1533.18(B) are generally conducted in \u2018the wide open spaces,\u2019 such as parks or wilderness tracts * * *.\" <em>Loyer </em>at 67. Recreational premises typically \u201cinclude elements such as land, water, trees, grass, and other vegetation.\u201d <em>Miller v. Dayton, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 113, 114, 537 N.E.2d 1294 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 18} However, \u201c[t]o qualify for recreational user immunity, property need not be completely natural, but its essential character should fit within the intent of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, a softball field requires certain manmade elements, but those improvements do not change the essential character of the property so as to remove it from the protection of the statute. The property is still held open for public use for recreational purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 115. <em>Compare Light v. Ohio Univ., </em>28 Ohio St.3d 66, 68, 502 N.E.2d 611 (1986) (a gymnasium, an entirely manmade structure, \u201cis not within the contemplation of the recreational user immunity statutes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 19} The types of recreational activities that qualify as a recreational use are diverse. R.C. 1533.181(B) lists hunting, fishing, trapping, camping, swimming, operating a snowmobile, all-purpose vehicle, or four-wheel-drive motor vehicle, and \u201cother recreational pursuits\u201d as examples of the types of activities contemplated by the statute. And courts have broadly construed \u201cother recreational pursuits\u201d to include sledding, <em>Marrek v. Cleveland Metroparks Bd. of Commrs., </em>9 Ohio St.3d 194, 459 N.E.2d 873 (1984); horseback riding, <em>Crabtree v. Shultz, </em>57 Ohio App.2d 33, 384 N.E.2d 1294 (10th Dist.1977); watching others swim, <em>Fetherolf v. Ohio Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>7 Ohio App.3d 110, 454 N.E.2d 564 (10th Dist.1982); motorcycle riding, <em>Kelley v. Differential Corp., </em>3d Dist. Hancock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>No. 5-81-35, 1982 WL 6787 (May 6, 1982); using a swingset, <em>Vitai v. Sheffield Lake, </em>9th Dist. Lorain No. 4045, 1987 WL 5561 (Jan. 21, 1987); riding a merry-go-round, <em>Miller v. Sheffield Lake, </em>9th Dist. Lorain No. 4133, 1987 WL 9477 (Apr. 8, 1987); riding a bicycle, <em>Erbs v. Cleveland Metroparks Sys., </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 53247, 1987 WL 30512 (Dec. 24, 1987); and watching others play baseball, <em>Buchanan v. Middletown, </em>12th Dist. Butler No. CA86-10-156, 1987 WL 16062 (Aug. 24, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 20} However, activities such as pulling down a soccer goalpost <em>(Fuehrer v. Westerville City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>61 Ohio St.3d 201, 574 N.E.2d 448 (1991)), or marching in a parade on a public street <em>(McGuire v. Lorain, </em>9th Dist. Lorain No. 10CA009893, 2011-Ohio-3887, 2011 WL 3426186 (Aug. 8, 2011)), are not the types of activities envisioned by the recreational-user immunity statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\n<em>Property Owners Owe No Duty of Care to Keep Their Premises Safe for Entry or Use by Recreational Users</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">{\u00b6 21} Under R.C. 1533.181(A)(1), \u201c[n]o owner owes <em>any duty </em>to a recreational user to keep the premises safe for entry or use.\u201d (Emphasis added.) A duty is \u201c[a] legal obligation that is owed or due to another and that needs to be satisfied.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>580 (9th Ed.2009). Generally speaking, \u201c[i]f there is no duty, no liability can follow.\u201d <em>Collins v. Sabino, </em>11th Dist. Trumbull No. 96-T-5590, 1997 WL 531246, *4 (Aug. 29, 1997), fn. 5. Consequently, an owner cannot be held liable for injuries sustained during recreational use \u201ceven if the property owner affirmatively created a dangerous condition.\u201d <em>Erbs v. Cleveland Metroparks Sys. </em>at *2, citing <em>Milliff v. Cleveland Metroparks Sys., </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 52315, 1987 WL 11969 (June 4, 1987); <em>see also Phillips v. Ohio Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>26 Ohio App.3d 77, 79, 498 N.E.2d 230 (10th Dist.1985) (property owner not liable to recreational user for willful and wanton failure to warn of dangerous condition); <em>Press v. Ohio Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>Ct. of Cl. No. 2005-100004-AD, 2006-Ohio-1024, 2006 WL 538106, \u00b6 11 (property owner not liable to recreational user for injuries caused by owner\u2019s affirmative creation of a hazard). The determination of whether R.C. 1533.181 applies depends not on the property owner\u2019s actions, but on whether the person using the property qualifies as a recreational user. <em>Estate of Finley v. Cleveland Metroparks, </em>189 Ohio App.3d 139, 2010-Ohio-4013, 937 N.E.2d 645, \u00b6 50 (8th Dist.); <em>Look v. Cleveland Metroparks Sys., </em>48 Ohio App.3d 135, 137, 548 N.E.2d 966 (8th Dist.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 22} In this case, appellants admitted that Pauley was a recreational user within R.C. 1533.181, as he clearly was. He entered the park, free of charge, to go sledding. Thus, the city owed him no duty to keep the premises safe, and the city\u2019s alleged creation of a hazard on the premises does not affect its immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>Miller v. Dayton </em>and <em>Ryll v. Columbus Fireworks Display Co., Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">{\u00b6 23} In arguing that property owners should not be afforded immunity if they \u201crender!] their land more dangerous without promoting or preserving recreational activities,\u201d appellants rely primarily upon <em>Ryll v. Columbus Fireworks Display Co., Inc., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 467, 2002-Ohio-2584, 769 N.E.2d 372, and <em>Miller v. Dayton, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 113, 537 N.E.2d 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 24} Appellants cite <em>Ryll </em>for the proposition that even if an injured person was a recreational user within the meaning of R.C. 1533.18(B), the property owner is not automatically afforded immunity in all cases. \u201cIn addition to considering whether the plaintiff was a \u2018recreational user\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 1533.18(B),\u201d appellants urge, \u201ccourts must also determine whether the cause of the injury is attributable to premises that are truly recreational.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 25} Citing <em>Miller, </em>appellants then ask this court to hold that \u201c[i]n lawsuits involving man-made objects, liability has been precluded only when such improvements enhance the recreational activities on the property.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>Ryll, </em>a spectator was attending a fireworks show sponsored by the city of Reynoldsburg when he was fatally injured by shrapnel from a fireworks shell. The spectator\u2019s estate sued the city, which asserted that it was immune from liability under the recreational-user statutes. We held that the recreational-user statute immunizes property owners from injuries that arise from a defect in the premises. Because the shrapnel was not a defect <em>in the premises, </em>immunity did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 27} In <em>Miller, </em>the plaintiff was playing in a softball tournament in a park owned by the city of Dayton when he was injured sliding into second base. The plaintiff sued the city seeking to recover for his injuries. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city pursuant to R.C. 1533.181.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">{\u00b6 28} The court of appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment. The court of appeals held that a baseball diamond is an artificial, manmade development, bearing little resemblance to land in its natural state. Thus, the court of appeals held that the plaintiff was not a recreational user, and the city was not immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">{\u00b6 29} This court held that \u201c[i]n determining whether a person is a recreational user under R.C. 1533.18(B), the analysis should focus on the character of the property upon which the injury occurs and the type of activities for which the property is held open to the public.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 113, 537 N.E.2d 1294, at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">{\u00b6 30} In its analysis, this court stated that \u201cthe presence of man-made improvements on a property does not remove the property from statutory protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114. \u201cTo qualify for recreational-user immunity, property need not be completely natural, but its essential character should fit within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>intent of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further instructed that the premises should be \u201cviewed as a whole\u201d to determine whether users enter to hunt, fish, trap, camp, hike, swim, or engage in other recreational pursuits. <em>Id. </em>at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">{\u00b6 31} Applying this test, we held that \u201c[t]he essential character of [the ballpark] is that of premises held open to the plaintiff, without fee, for recreational purposes\u201d and that improvements such as \u201cdugouts, fences, base plates, and similar manmade structures\u201d did not change the park\u2019s essential character as outdoor premises used for recreational purposes within the recreational-user statutes. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the plaintiff was a recreational user, and the city was immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 32} We find that the instant case is distinguishable from both <em>Ryll </em>and <em>Miller. </em>In <em>Ryll, </em>the injury was caused by a fireworks shell, not by a defect on the city\u2019s premises, so R.C. 1533.181 did not immunize the city from liability. In the instant case, the railroad-tie-like object was embedded in a mound of dirt that was part of the park at the time Jeremy suffered his accident. Therefore, the injury was caused by a defect in the premises, making <em>Ryll </em>inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 33} In <em>Miller, </em>there was no discussion of a defect in the premises. Indeed, the recreational-user statutes protect property owners from such defects. Rather, the question in <em>Miller </em>was whether manmade <em>improvements, </em>such as a baseball diamond, changed the essential character of the property to something other than an outdoor space used for something other than an outdoor recreational activity. Accordingly, <em>Miller </em>lends no support to appellants\u2019 proposition that liability is precluded for injuries caused by manmade improvements only when such improvements enhance the recreational activities on the property. Whether the manmade improvements in <em>Miller </em>enhanced the recreational activities in the park was irrelevant. The question was whether the improvements so changed the essential character of the park as to take it outside the protection of the statute. We cannot accept as reasonable any contention that the presence of a railroad tie in a public park changes its essential character as a recreational space.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 34} Moreover, to adopt appellants\u2019 reading of <em>Miller </em>would require property owners to make their property safe for entry and use in direct contravention of the plain language in R.C. 1533.181(A)(1). \u201cIt is not this court\u2019s role to apply a judicially created doctrine when faced with statutory language that cuts <em>against </em>its applicability.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Wallace v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 266, 2002-Ohio-4210, 773 N.E.2d 1018, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 35} In addition, adopting appellants\u2019 interpretation of <em>Miller </em>would conflict with the purpose of the recreational-user statute, which is to encourage owners of premises suitable for recreational pursuits to open their land to public use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>without fear of liability. <em>Moss v. Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>62 Ohio St.2d 138, 142, 404 N.E.2d 742 (1980); <em>Marrek v. Cleveland Metroparks Bd. of Commrs., </em>9 Ohio St.3d at 198, 459 N.E.2d 873. Removing the protection of immunity would undoubtedly cause property owners to restrict recreational use of their properties, or close them entirely, from fear of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 36} Finally, even assuming arguendo that we agreed with appellants\u2019 interpretation of <em>Miller, </em>it would not change the outcome in this case. <em>Miller </em>requires that the property be \u201cviewed as a whole,\u201d and only when the \u201cessential character\u201d of the property has been altered to something other than an outdoor property on which outdoor recreational activities occur does immunity fall away.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 37} The park in this case is an outdoor property with trees and grass and is open to the public free of charge for picnicking and sporting activities such as sledding, baseball, soccer, and basketball, as well as other recreational activities that inevitably occur in parks, such as tinkering with a model plane, reading poetry, or jogging. <em>See Miller, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 115, 537 N.E.2d 1294. The alleged defect in this case is an object resembling a railroad tie. When viewing the park property \u201cas a whole,\u201d the existence of a single railroad tie does not change the essential character of the park to something other than a property that is open for recreational use.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 38} Critics may claim that our decision reaches a harsh result. However, the language of the recreational-user statute is plain: a property owner owes no duty to a recreational user to keep the property safe for entry or use. Creating an exception to this immunity is a policy decision that comes within the purview of the General Assembly, not the courts. The General Assembly understands how to draft laws that contain exceptions, but included no exception that can be applied in this case. And we will not create an exception by judicial fiat. <em>Akron v. Rowland, </em>67 Ohio St.3d 374, 380, 618 N.E.2d 138 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">{\u00b6 39} Pauley entered the park free of charge and engaged in the recreational activity of snow sledding on the date of his injury. Therefore, as he conceded, he was a recreational user as defined in R.C. 1533.18(B). Therefore, the city was not liable for his injuries, because it owes no duty to recreational users to ensure that the park is safe for entry or use.

In particular, the immunity provisions contained in R.C. 1533.18 and 1533.181 are overbroad and provide unreasonable and, with respect to governmental entities, unconstitutional protection to premises owners.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b430-8\">O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AsV\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">{\u00b6 41} I respectfully dissent from the majority in this case. The holdings of the Fourth District Court of Appeals and the Pickaway County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment to the city of Circleville should be reversed, and this case should be remanded for trial. I agree wholeheartedly with the letter, spirit, and intent of most recreational-user statutes. This court has said that the purpose of Ohio\u2019s recreational-user statute is \u201c \u2018to encourage owners of premises suitable for recreational pursuits to open their land to public use without worry about liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marrek v. Cleveland Metroparks Bd. of Commrs., </em>9 Ohio St.3d 194, 198, 459 N.E.2d 873 (1984), quoting <em>Moss v. Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>62 Ohio St.2d 138, 142, 404 N.E.2d 742 (1980). There is no question that a swimming-pool owner would simply close the pool if every child who slipped on the wet pavement was entitled to litigate his boo-boo for years in a court of competent jurisdiction. However, when, as here, a property owner converts a recreational park to a municipal dump site for construction fill and debris, there is no statute in the land that should shield that tortfeasor from accountability for such a disastrous action. As stated so eloquently by Justice Cardozo in <em>Palsgraf: </em>\u201cThe risk reasonably to be perceived <em>defines the duty to be obeyed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Palsgraf v. Long Island RR. Co., </em>248 N.Y. 339, 344, 162 N.E. 99 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">{\u00b6 42} In <em>Miller v. Dayton, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 113, 537 N.E.2d 1294 (1989), this court extended recreational-user immunity to improvements made to property. We said that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">significant query is whether such improvements change the character of the premises and put the property outside the protection of the recreation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>al-user statute. To consider the question from a different perspective: Are the improvements and man-made structures consistent with the purpose envisioned by the legislature in its grant of immunity? In other words, are the premises (viewed as a whole) those which users enter upon \u201c * * * to hunt, fish, trap, hike, swim, or engage in other recreational pursuits?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 114-115 (quoting R.C. 1533.18(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 43} The majority asserts that our holding in <em>Miller </em>requires that the property be viewed as a whole, and only when the \u201cessential character\u201d of the entire property has been altered to something other than an outdoor property on which outdoor recreational activities occur does immunity fall away. Majority opinion at \u00b6 36. The opinion goes on to say that \u201c[w]hen viewing the park property \u2018as a whole,\u2019 the existence of a single railroad tie does not change the essential character of the park to something other than a property that is open for recreational use.\u201d' Majority opinion at \u00b6 37. Even if the majority\u2019s overreliance on the words \u201cas a whole\u201d is correct \u2014 and it is not \u2014 I disagree. And let\u2019s be accurate here \u2014 we are not talking about a single railroad tie. That tie that crippled this child was part of an overall scheme of disposal of huge mounds of debris that the city had incredibly decided to place in the middle of a recreational park! Cover it with a light dressing of snow, and the perfect killing field was created. I would hold, as a matter of law, that when the owner of a property that <em>enjoys the immunity granted by the people of Ohio </em>for recreational purposes makes a conscious decision to use the property for other purposes, the immunity ceases. <em>See Huffman v. Willoughby, </em>11th Dist. Lake No. 2007-L-040, 2007-Ohio-7120, 2007 WL 4564384, \u00b6 50 (a lowhead dam \u201cwas not an improvement that was made to encourage the recreational use of this part of the river. Instead, * * * it made that part of the river inherently dangerous and thus not suitable for recreational use\u201d); <em>Vinar v. Bexley, </em>142 Ohio App.3d 341, 755 N.E.2d 922 (10th Dist.2001) (because a roadway through a park was available to the public for travel not related to a recreational use, recreational-user immunity under R.C. 1533.181 is inapplicable). <em>See also Smith v. S. Pacific Transp. Co., Inc., </em>467 So.2d 70, 73 (La.App.1985) (when persons are allowed to use the property for purposes not associated with recreational activities, the statutes should not apply). To hold otherwise would be to suggest, for example, that the city could store hazardous waste alongside the running track, or possibly it could release wild animals from the city zoo into the park area in the hopes that they would find dinner on their own. Would the current state of the law in Ohio absolve such conduct, possibly with the addition of attractive signs cautioning the children to \u201cplay at your own risk\u201d?</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b432-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Bashein &amp; Bashein Co., L.P.A., and W.

The city made a decision to dump huge mounds of debris into a city-owned park. When it did that, it lost its \u201crecreational user\u201d immunity entirely.
