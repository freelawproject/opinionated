Moretz and Nicole L. Moretz. For the reasons explained, we hold that the court of appeals improperly affirmed the judgment. We conclude that the court of appeals properly affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the Moretzes leave to file late a transcript of a videotaped deposition, because the trial court\u2019s error, if any, was harmless. But we hold that it improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s decisions (1) to admit, over objection, as an exhibit an illustration from a learned treatise, (2) to refuse to submit a properly drafted interrogatory to the jury, and (3) to prohibit Dr. Muakkassa from presenting evidence of \u201cwrite-offs\u201d to contest the Moretzes\u2019 medical bills without a foundation of expert testimony on the reasonable value of the medical services rendered. We further hold that these errors, taken together, deprived Dr. Muakkassa of a fair trial. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth District Court of Appeals, and we remand this case to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">\n<em>The surgery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">{\u00b6 2} On September 28, 2005, Larry J. Moretz underwent surgery to remove a grapefruit-sized mass from his pelvis. The mass was discovered in May 2005 when Mr. Moretz sought treatment at an emergency room for pain in his lower back. The emergency-room physician directed Mr. Moretz to follow up with his family physician. In turn, the family physician referred him to Dr. Muakkassa, a board-certified neurosurgeon. Dr. Muakkassa diagnosed an anterior sacral meningocele.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">{\u00b6 3} A meningocele is a type of congenital cyst. A sacral meningocele is a cyst located at the lowest part of the spinal cord next to the tailbone. \u201cAnterior\u201d means that the cyst was growing from the front of the spine or, in other words, from the back to the stomach. Anterior cysts are rare.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Dr. Muakkassa recommended that Mr. Moretz consult Gary B. Williams, M.D., a general surgeon, for removal of the cyst using a laparoscopic approach. Ultimately, because Dr. Williams\u2019s attempt to remove the cyst laparoseopically was not successful, he surgically opened Mr. Moretz\u2019s abdomen, according to the contingency plan. Dr. Williams moved the organs and other structures out of the way in order to expose the cyst.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">{\u00b6 5} Once the cyst was exposed, Dr. Williams put a surgical stitch at the bottom and at the top of the cyst and then cut out the cyst. Dr. Muakkassa entered the operating room periodically to check on the progress of the procedure and confirmed for Dr. Williams that the stitches had closed the cyst, so that no cerebral spinal fluid was leaking. Dr. Muakkassa did not \u201cscrub in,\u201d i.e., he did not participate in the surgery or perform any part of the procedure himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">{\u00b6 6} Dr. Williams submitted tissue from the cyst to a pathologist for analysis. The pathologist\u2019s report reflected the diagnosis as \u201csoft tissue with a neurenterie cyst.\u201d A neurenterie cyst is also a type of congenital cyst.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">{\u00b6 7} As a result of the surgery, Mr. Moretz permanently lost bladder, bowel, and sexual function. The Moretzes filed this action against Drs. Williams and Muakkassa and alleged that their malpractice had caused Mr. Moretz\u2019s injuries. The case against Dr. Muakkassa proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">{\u00b6 8} At trial, the Moretzes contended that Dr. Muakkassa should never have recommended that the cyst be accessed through Mr. Moretz\u2019s abdomen. Also central to their case was the nature of the role Dr. Muakkassa was supposed to play in the removal of Mr. Moretz\u2019s cyst, once it was exposed through the abdomen.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">\n<em>Motion in limine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">{\u00b6 9} The Moretzes filed a motion in limine that sought to prohibit Dr. Muakkassa from offering evidence or making any argument at trial that the reasonable value of the medical services associated with Mr. Moretz\u2019s injuries was the amount equal to the actual amount accepted as full payment for the services after the \u201cwrite-off\"<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> unless he supported that argument with expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court granted the motion and held that \u201cthe issue here is not whether Defendant can present evidence of the write-offs, but whether he can do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>so without expert testimony in support of this evidence.\u201d The trial court explained that by enacting R.C. 2317.421, the General Assembly created a statutory presumption that medical bills reflect the reasonable value of medical services, but it held that the legislature \u201chas not created any such presumption for write-off payments.\u201d Accordingly, it held that evidence of write-offs was not admissible unless Dr. Muakkassa supported it with expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\n<em>Civ.R. 32(A) motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">{\u00b6 11} On the first day of the trial, after the jury was impaneled and sworn, Dr. Muakkassa\u2019s counsel orally moved to preclude the'Moretzes from playing the videotaped deposition of their expert witness, board-certified neurosurgeon Gary C. Dennis, M.D., on the ground that the transcript had not been timely filed. Civ.R. 32(A) requires that any deposition intended to be used as evidence \u201cmust be filed at least one day before the day of trial or hearing unless for good cause shown the court permits a later filing.\u201d And although the trial court acknowledged that the defense was \u201cabsolutely correct\u201d that a violation had occurred, it excused the Moretzes\u2019 failure to file the transcript as \u201ctechnical noncompliance\u201d and permitted the video deposition to be played for the jury that day. Defense counsel had received the video transcript a few days before, and the trial court concluded that Dr. Muakkassa had not been ambushed by the late filing. Trial commenced, and the transcript was filed with the court the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\n<em>Allegations of malpractice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">{\u00b6 12} At trial, Mr. Moretz testified that after initially meeting with Dr. Muakkassa and submitting to testing, Dr. Muakkassa explained to him that he had a hole in his tailbone and the membrane surrounding the spinal cord, permitting spinal fluid to force its way out. Dr. Muakkassa recommended that Dr. Williams be consulted so that the possibility of laparoscopic surgery to treat the cyst could be explored, with the understanding that if laparoscopic surgery failed, Dr. Williams could open up Mr. Moretz\u2019s abdomen and \u201cmove everything out of the way\u201d so that the cyst could be accessed. Mr. Moretz understood that if an open surgery took place, once the cyst was exposed, Dr. Muakkassa would remove it because he was the neurosurgeon and the cyst was attached to the spinal cord.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">{\u00b6 13} The Moretzes also presented the video deposition of Dr. Dennis, who testified that Mr. Moretz\u2019s surgery required the expertise of a neurosurgeon. Dr. Dennis described his understanding of the standard of care applicable to a neurosurgeon when performing a surgical procedure on a meningocele:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Well, when you operate on those structures, one thing you need is you need magnification. So as a general rule, you can use either loupes, which are little telescopic glasses or you can use a microscope. * * * And the other is a way to identify the nerves themselves. One can inspect an area but, usually, when you have abnormalities that are congenital, sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell a difference between a piece of fibrous tissue and a nerve. Especially, when the nerves are little rootlets, which are very tiny. So in cases like that, we always use a nerve stimulator. That\u2019s, of course, the way I was trained and that\u2019s the way all neurosurgeons are trained in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, Dr. Dennis opined that Dr. Muakkassa proximately caused Mr. Moretz\u2019s injuries when he breached the standard of care applicable to a neurosurgeon. First, Dr. Muakkassa failed to \u201cscrub in,\u201d i.e., he did not physically assist in the removal of the cyst, but merely observed. Second, he failed to use, or recommend that Dr. Williams use, magnification to identify and protect the nerves. Third, he failed to use, or recommend that Dr. Williams use, stimulation to identify and protect the nerves.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">{\u00b6 15} Fourth, Dr. Dennis explained that Dr. Muakkassa had failed to recommend the best approach for reaching the cyst. He testified that the only rarity in Mr. Moretz\u2019s condition was the anterior location of the cyst. And his review of the literature disclosed that it is easier to operate on anterior cysts by using a posterior approach, i.e., by going through the back, \u201cbecause then you can see the . origin of the nerve roots.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">{\u00b6 16} Because Mr. Moretz permanently lost bladder, bowel, and sexual function as a result of the surgery, Dr. Dennis opined that Dr. Williams had cut nerves while operating on the cyst. He explained that because Mr. Moretz\u2019s cyst had been there for a long time, \u201cthe nerves are going to be plastered to the side of it.\u201d Dr. Dennis acknowledged that the pathologist had found no nerves in. the tissue that was submitted for analysis, but reasoned that the pathologist\u2019s finding did not undermine his position, because the entire cyst was not excised.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">\n<em>Rebuttal of the allegations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">{\u00b6 17} Dr. Muakkassa testified in his own defense and explained that after ordering and reviewing CT scans and an MRI, he diagnosed Mr. Moretz as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>having an anterior sacral meningocele. He testified that the MRI, which is \u201cextremely sensitive,\u201d showed that there were no nerves in Mr. Moretz\u2019s cyst. A radiologist also concluded from the MRI films that there were no nerves in Mr. Moretz\u2019s cyst.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 18} In Dr. Muakkassa\u2019s view, there were no nerves in the cyst and thus the cyst did not require the expertise of a neurosurgeon. The trouble was the \u201cextremely rare\u201d anterior location of the cyst and the difficulty of getting to it in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 19} Dr. Muakkassa testified that \u201cin the old days,\u201d neurosurgeons had to treat anterior cysts using a posterior approach. And he acknowledged that some still do. Dr. Muakkassa testified about advancements in the treatment of anterior cysts, including removal by general surgeons using laparoscopic techniques and an anterior approach, which he recommended to Mr. Moretz and which Mr. Moretz ultimately opted to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 20} Dr. Muakkassa understood that if laparoscopic surgery failed, Dr. Williams would open Mr. Moretz\u2019s abdomen and remove the cyst, and Dr. Muakkassa would be present to make sure that there was no spinal fluid leaking after the cyst was closed. Dr. Muakkassa testified that in any event, he was available to scrub in and physically help Dr. Williams, if he had been needed and if he had been asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">{\u00b6 21} Dr. Muakkassa testified that he did not use magnification or encourage Dr. Williams to use magnification because it was not necessary. If there had been nerves, he contended, they would have been large enough for him to see with the naked eye, even without scrubbing in. Similarly, he explained that nerve stimulation, which is used to protect the spinal cord, was not necessary because \u201cthere is no spinal cord in that area to monitor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">{\u00b6 22} Dr. Muakkassa testified that he discovered that he was wrong about Mr. Moretz having a meningocele when he reviewed the report of the pathologist, who had conclusively determined that the mass was a neurenteric cyst. And he explained that by definition, neurenteric cysts have no nerves.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">{\u00b6 23} On cross-examination, counsel attempted to elicit testimony from Dr. Muakkassa that meningoceles located at the anterior sacral position have nerves. Dr. Muakkassa disagreed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At that point, over defense objection, counsel produced an illustration,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which had been photocopied from a medical textbook authored by Edward C. Benzel, M.D. The textbook was entitled \u201cSpine Surgery: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Techniques, Complication Avoidance, and Management,\u201d and the illustration was entitled, \u201canterior sacral meningocele.\u201d This exchange then followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">Q. Doctor, does this accurately depict the anatomy of an anterior sacral meningocele, do you believe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">Q. You don\u2019t. Okay. So you don\u2019t believe there is a potential for the nerve roots to be over the sac; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">{\u00b6 24} Dr. Muakkassa also presented the expert testimony of board-certified neurosurgeon Mark R. McLaughlin, M.D., who also testified that Mr. Moretz had a neurenteric cyst, not a meningocele. Dr. McLaughlin explained that neurenteric cysts are abnormalities that occur while the fetus is forming and that consist of \u201can area of tissue that fails to properly form * * * while the tissues are all migrating into their appropriate position.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s something that is associated with spinal abnormalities, but it doesn\u2019t have nervous tissue in it; and it\u2019s really more of a digestive gut abnormality than it is a nervous system abnormality.\u201d Accordingly, he testified that Dr. Williams, a general surgeon, was the \u201cbest suited doctor\u201d to approach the cyst and that it was \u201cperfectly appropriate\u201d for Dr. Muakkassa to simply be in the operating room as an advisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">{\u00b6 25} On cross-examination, counsel questioned Dr. McLaughlin extensively about the standard of care for the treatment of meningoceles and, in doing so, confronted him with Dr. Benzel\u2019s illustration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">Q. And in this authoritative text don\u2019t they show nerve roots here stretched over the sac?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-13\">A. Yes, they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-14\">Q. You wouldn\u2019t disagree that that is what can occur, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-15\">A. No, that is what can occur. And a neurenteric cyst can look very similar to that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">{\u00b6 26} On redirect, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-17\">Q. Did anyone identify a nerve coursing over the cyst?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-18\">A. No, not in the operative report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Q. You have been on the stand here on cross-examination for over an hour and 15 minutes and you have been asked over and over about the care and treatment of an anterior sacral meningocele.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">Was this an anterior sacral meningocele?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">A. No, it was not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 27} Dr. Williams also testified.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He explained that he had assumed that Dr. Muakkassa would actively participate in Mr. Moretz\u2019s surgery as co-surgeon, but Dr. Muakkassa did not scrub in. Nevertheless, Dr. Muakkassa was in the operating room at times during Mr. Moretz\u2019s surgery, and he looked into Mr. Moretz\u2019s abdomen and observed what Dr. Williams was doing. During the surgery, Dr. Williams asked Dr. Muakkassa if there was anything special that he needed to do, and Dr. Muakkassa answered that there was not. Dr. Williams testified that there was no need for Dr. Muakkassa to scrub in during the surgery. Even so, at one point he invited Dr. Muakkassa to scrub in, but Dr. Muakkassa declined and stated that Dr. Williams was doing fine. Indeed, Dr. Williams testified that had he asked Dr. Muakkassa, \u201cwould you scrub in and help me,\u201d he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Dr. Muakkassa would have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 28} On cross-examination, Dr. Williams testified that he is not qualified to perform neurosurgery and is not trained in the surgical treatment of meningoceles. He also testified that he had assumed that Dr. Muakkassa would have taken care of any necessary nerve monitoring, and if Dr. Muakkassa had told him that he needed to use magnification or stimulation, he would have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">\n<em>Admission of the exhibit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">{\u00b6 29} At the close of evidence, the Moretzes moved to admit the illustration as an exhibit, and Dr. Muakkassa objected on the ground that \u201cthe authoritative text wasn\u2019t cross-examined.\u201d In deciding the issue, the trial court reasoned that \u201cthe fact that this depiction comes from a learned treatise does not obviate the fact that it is, in fact, an artistic diagram, and as such, presuming it is properly authenticated as accurately representing the anatomy in question, is properly admissible.\u201d Because it concluded that Dr. McLaughlin had authenticated the illustration, the trial court admitted it as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">\n<em>Rejection of the interrogatory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">{\u00b6 30} Before charging the jury, the trial court reviewed the interrogatories and verdict forms with counsel. While doing so, it rejected an interrogatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>proposed by Dr. Muakkassa that would have required the jurors, in the event of an adverse verdict, to specify in what respect he had been negligent. Defense counsel argued that he thought there were four acts that Dr. Dennis had described as negligent but that he could only remember (1) the failure to scrub in, (2) the failure to use magnification, and (3) the failure to use stimulation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When defense counsel told the court that he could not remember the fourth, the Moretzes\u2019 attorney provided it: \u201cPosterior approach.\u201d Defense counsel agreed, \u201cYeah, that he should have used the posterior approach rather than anterior approach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">{\u00b6 31} The trial court held, \u201cI don\u2019t find that there are multiple allegations of negligence separate and independent from one another, and so I\u2019m not going to allow that interrogatory.\u201d In the trial court\u2019s view, Dr. Dennis\u2019s criticisms all boiled down to one allegation: that Dr. Muakkassa breached the standard of care because he faded to scrub in.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\n<em>Jury verdict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 32} Six jurors concluded that Dr. Muakkassa was negligent and that his negligence proximately caused Mr. Moretz\u2019s injuries. The same six jurors found the total loss to be $995,428.73. The damages interrogatories disclosed that the verdict represented $205,828.73 in economic loss, including $125,869.13 in medical bills, $539,600 in noneconomic loss to Mr. Moretz, and $250,000 in noneconomic loss to Mrs. Moretz.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 33} In light of the $500,000 statutory cap on noneconomic damages, the trial court reduced the award to Mr. Moretz by $39,600. And it granted Dr. Muakkassa\u2019s motion for setoff due to the settlement reached with Dr. Williams, thereby reducing the jury verdict by an additional $195,400. After awarding the Moretzes prejudgment interest, the trial court entered a final judgment against Dr. Muakkassa in the amount of $953,858.08. Both parties appealed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court of appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\n<em>The Ninth District litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">{\u00b6 34} On appeal, Dr. Muakkassa raised four assignments of error that are relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">{\u00b6 35} First, he argued that the trial court had abused its discretion by permitting the Moretzes to play the video deposition of their expert witness, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Dennis, even though they had not timely filed the transcript of the deposition or shown good cause for the late filing, as required by Civ.R. 32(A). 2012-Ohio-1177, 2012 WL 982996, \u00b6 7. Dr. Muakkassa contended that he would have been entitled to a directed verdict had the video deposition been properly excluded. But because Dr. Muakkassa was not surprised or in any way prejudiced by the late filing, the Ninth District affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the video deposition to be played for the jury. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 36} Second, Dr. Muakkassa argued that the trial court had abused its discretion when it refused to submit to the jury an interrogatory requiring the jurors to specify in what respect it found him negligent. According to the court of appeals, the trial court rejected the interrogatory for two reasons: \u201c(1) all allegations of negligence were dependent upon his failure to scrub in to the surgery, and (2) the narrative form was likely to confuse the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 14. Even though it recognized that Dr. Dennis had testified that Dr. Muakkassa violated the standard of care in three separate ways, the Ninth District affirmed because \u201c[t]here is no evidence that Dr. Muakkassa could have used either magnification or nerve stimulation techniques without scrubbing in to the procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 37} Third, Dr. Muakkassa argued that the trial court had abused its discretion by admitting as an exhibit the medical illustration from a learned treatise. The court of appeals acknowledged that Evid.R. 803(18) permits the admission of statements from learned treatises only when offered in connection with an expert witness\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18. And it acknowledged that learned treatises \u201c \u2018may not be received as exhibits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Evid.R. 803(18).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 38} But because Dr. McLaughlin testified that the illustration is accurate, that the text is authoritative, and that the relevant chapter is \u201cexcellent,\u201d the court of appeals concluded that the exhibit was properly authenticated, and therefore admissible, as \u201can artistic rendering of human anatomy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 39} The Ninth District reasoned that Evid.R. 803(18) \u201cis primarily aimed at passages in treatises containing \u2018theories and opinions\u2019 \u201d of the author. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24, quoting <em>Piotrowski v. Corey Hosp., </em>172 Ohio St. 61, 69, 173 N.E.2d 355 (1961). The court of appeals concluded that Evid.R. 803(18) did not apply because the rule was meant to address \u201cstatements\u201d and the only statement that the medical illustration asserted was that it accurately depicted an anterior sacral meningocele. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 25. Because in its view, Dr. McLaughlin adopted that assertion as his own,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the court concluded that the illustration was not hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>and therefore was not subject to the rule. Finally, the court of appeals concluded that admission of the exhibit did not prejudice Dr. Muakkassa, because the illustration did not tend to prove that Mr. Moretz had a meningocele. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 40} Finally, Dr. Muakkassa argued that the trial court incorrectly excluded evidence of write-offs without expert testimony regarding reasonableness. The court of appeals affirmed that holding on the ground that the presumption of reasonableness of medical bills codified at R.C. 2317.421, which obviates the need for foundational expert testimony, applies to plaintiffs and not defendants. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 41 \u2014 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 41} We accepted Dr. Muakkassa\u2019s appeal under our discretionary jurisdiction. 132 Ohio St.3d 1481, 2012-Ohio-3334, 971 N.E.2d 960 (accepting Proposition of Law No. IV); 132 Ohio St.3d 1527, 2012-Ohio-4308, 974 N.E.2d 1206 (accepting Proposition of Law Nos. I, II, and III on reconsideration). The four propositions of law before us assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">Proposition of Law No. 1: The Ninth District\u2019s decision excusing a party from the mandatory filing requirements for depositions has effectively rendered Civ.R. 32(A) meaningless and the end result will be uncertainty throughout Ohio as to the requisite procedures for filing depositions pursuant to Civ.R. 32(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">Proposition of Law No. 2: The Ninth District\u2019s decision allowing for the admission of a portion of a medical textbook as a trial exhibit is both legally and factually flawed, in direct conflict with Evid.R. 803(18) and the end result will be uncertainty throughout Ohio as to the proper use of learned treatises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">Proposition of Law No. 3: The Ninth District\u2019s decision disallowing a jury interrogatory regarding appellees\u2019 multiple claims of negligence is legally and factually flawed, is internally inconsistent and contradictory, is in direct conflict with decisions rendered by this court and other appellate courts throughout Ohio and effectively renders Civ.R. 49(B) meaningless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">Proposition of Law No. 4: The Ninth District\u2019s decision requiring that evidence of \u201cwrite-offs\u201d of medical bills be supported by expert testimony is in direct conflict with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Jaques v. Manton, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 342, 2010-Ohio-1838, 928 N.E.2d 434, and has, consequently, redefined the collateral source rule as set forth by this court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">{\u00b6 42} We now address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"A0a\">\n<em>Civ.R. 32(A)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 43} The Ninth District properly affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the Moretzes leave to file late the transcript of Dr. Dennis\u2019s videotaped deposition even though the trial court failed to expressly make a determination that good cause existed for the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 44} Civ.R. 32(A) provides: \u201cEvery deposition intended to be presented as evidence must be filed at least one day before the day of trial or hearing unless for good cause shown the court permits a later filing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 45} The rule imposes a mandatory duty to file certain depositions at least one day before trial. The Moretzes filed the deposition transcript on the second day of trial. There can be no dispute that the Moretzes failed to comply with the timing requirement of Civ.R. 32(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cHowever hurried a court may be in its efforts to reach the merits of a controversy, the integrity of procedural rules is dependent upon consistent enforcement because the only fair and reasonable alternative thereto is complete abandonment.\u201d <em>Miller v. Lint, </em>62 Ohio St.2d 209, 215, 404 N.E.2d 752 (1980). We reaffirm that important principle today. Trial courts have a duty to ensure proper adherence to the governing rules, including Civ.R. 32(A), in order to afford fairness to all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 47} Although the trial court\u2019s duty to enforce Civ.R. 32(A)\u2014including the duty to permit a late filing for good cause shown \u2014 was clear and unequivocal, its holding in this regard was murky and tentative. The trial court acknowledged that a late filing can be excused only for good cause, but it failed to make an express finding on cause. But the court made sufficient inquiry to establish that Dr. Dennis\u2019s trial deposition was not taken until the Wednesday before trial, July 7, 2010. And on the first day of trial, July 12, 2010, when defense counsel moved to exclude Dr. Dennis\u2019s videotaped testimony based on the failure to comply with Civ.R. 32(A), the Moretzes\u2019 counsel told the court that he still had not received a transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">{\u00b6 48} In deciding whether to permit a late filing, the trial court explained that the rules, including Civ.R. 32(A), are designed to prevent and guard against undue surprise and trial by ambush. And it held that \u201cin light of the fact that this was designated a trial deposition, at all times was described as such <em>for good </em>\u2014 I find that there is no surprise in this matter and that I will permit the playing of the video deposition despite the Plaintiffs\u2019 technical noncompliance with 32(A).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">{\u00b6 49} In explaining its reasons for permitting a late filing, the trial court used the words \u201cfor good,\u201d which we presume was a truncated preamble to a good-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>cause finding that the trial court unfortunately never made express. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s characterization of the Civ.R. 32(A) violation as \u201ca mere technical noncompliance\u201d was apparently an inartful way of saying \u201cgood cause.\u201d Use of the phrase \u201ctechnical noncompliance\u201d implies that the trial court acknowledged the late filing but excused it for a good reason, i.e., good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 50} In turn, the Ninth District held that \u201cthe trial court exercised proper discretion in determining there was good cause\u201d to permit a later filing. 2012-Ohio-1177, 2012 WL 982996, \u00b6 10. In doing so, the court of appeals engaged in an extensive discussion of why, on this record, a violation of Civ.R. 32(A) could not have prejudiced or surprised Dr. Muakkassa. To that end, the court of appeals appropriately gave great weight to the fact that Dr. Muakkassa had ample notice that the Moretzes intended to use the deposition at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 51} Specifically, the court of appeals noted that one month before trial, the Moretzes filed a document entitled \u201cNotice of Videotaped Trial Testimony of Gary C. Dennis, M.D.,\u201d which reflected that \u201c[t]he videotaped trial testimony will be used as evidence in the trial of this matter.\u201d And five days before trial, Dr. Muakkassa\u2019s attorney was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, actively participating in Dr. Dennis\u2019s trial deposition. We also note that Dr. Dennis testified that he has an active neurosurgery practice in Louisiana that calls on him to treat patients on both emergency and elective bases. In addition to treating patients at his office, Dr. Dennis provides neurosurgical care at three hospitals that serve \u201ca very large area in Louisiana.\u201d There is every indication that the timing of Dr. Dennis\u2019s trial deposition was carefully coordinated by everyone involved, considering the schedules of one busy physician and three lawyers in the midst of trial preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 52} For all of these reasons, we hold that if the trial court committed any error in failing to expressly determine whether good cause existed for the delay, on this record, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\n<em>Evid.R. 803(18)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">{\u00b6 53} The trial court abused its discretion when it granted the Moretzes\u2019 motion to admit as an exhibit a medical illustration from a learned treatise. In doing so, it refused to apply the hearsay rule that governs the use of learned treatises, Evid.R. 803(18).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">{\u00b6 54} In 2006, Ohio amended its hearsay rules by adopting Evid.R. 803(18). 109 Ohio St.3d LXXXI, LXXXVII. This new exception to the hearsay rule permits the admission of statements from learned treatises during the testimony of expert witnesses. Evid.R. 803 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>(18) Learned Treatises. To the extent called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the expert witness in direct examination, statements contained in published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on a subject of history, medicine, or other science or art, established as a reliable authority by the testimony or admission of the witness of by other expert testimony or by judicial notice. <em>If admitted, the statements may be read into evidence but may not be received as exhibits.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 55} Evid.R. 803(18) replaced former Evid.R. 706, 109 Ohio St.3d LXXXI, which permitted the limited use of learned treatises only for impeachment purposes, and thus prohibited their use during direct examination. Evid.R. 803(18) was adopted in acknowledgement of the fact that in forming their opinions, expert witnesses necessarily rely on \u201cbackground hearsay * * * in the form of the out-of-court statements of textbook authors, colleagues, and others.\u201d 2006 Staff Notes to Evid.R. 803(18). \u201cThe rule makes explicit the sources of the expert\u2019s opinion, and in doing so both avoids disputes about the level of detail in their testimony and assists the trier of fact in evaluating that testimony.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Beard v. Meridia Huron Hosp., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 237, 2005-Ohio-4787, 834 N.E.2d 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\n<em>The exhibit was hearsay, subject to Evid.R. 803(18)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 56} The court of appeals improperly approved the trial court\u2019s admission of the illustration as an exhibit by reasoning: \u201cAlthough an illustration in a textbook could include \u2018statements\u2019 of the type Rule 803(18) was meant to address, exhibit 36 does not.\u201d 2012-Ohio-1177, 2012 WL 982996, at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 57} We hold that illustrations from medical textbooks are subject to the learned-treatise hearsay exception set forth in Evid.R. 803(18) and therefore shall not be admitted into evidence as an exhibit over the objection of a party. The purpose of a medical illustration is to explicate the medical text. Because an illustration gives meaning to written statements, textbook authors use them to more fully explain complex medical concepts, anatomical structures, and conditions. Thus, they do not differ from text for purposes of the rule. When a party uses a medical illustration in connection with an expert\u2019s testimony, the illustration is inextricably intertwined with both the author\u2019s statements and the testimony of the expert witness. The simple act of separating the illustration from the text by photocopying does not divorce it from its context or somehow transform it into a neutral artist\u2019s rendering.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>{\u00b6 58} The exhibit at issue in this case has a heading that reads, \u201cChapter 83: Anterior Sacral Meningocele.\u201d The medical illustration depicts what appears to be a cross-section of a spine and various other structures, identified by name, including a \u201cventral nerve root transversing pedicle\u201d and the \u201cterminal syrinx.\u201d A large balloon-like structure (not identified, but presumably the meningocele) protrudes in front of the spine, near the end of its length. The balloon has a darkened spot that is labeled \u201ctumor.\u201d Two thin tubes begin at what is labeled \u201cspinal cord\u201d and extend to the balloon-like structure. One of the tubes appears to wrap around it. The tubes are labeled, \u201cnerve root stretched over sac.\u201d Nothing is labeled \u201csac.\u201d Underneath the illustration is the following caption: \u201cFigure 83.1 Illustration of a typical anatomic scenario regarding a congenital anterior sacral meningocele. Intrathecal (filum term\u00ednale), intracystic, and extracystie-intrapelvic tumors may be associated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 59} Exhibit 36 is a highly technical medical illustration that lacks clear meaning without interpretation from a medical expert. Although the context is not readily understandable, the illustration plainly makes the \u201cstatement\u201d that nerves coming from the spinal cord are wrapped around a sac. The title and the caption invite the inference that the sac is a meningocele. And the caption makes the assertion that the illustration depicts a \u201ctypical anatomic scenario.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 60} The inescapable conclusion is that the exhibit was offered for the truth of the matter asserted by Dr. Benzel: anterior sacral meningoceles have nerves. Accordingly, in light of the objection, the trial court was required to prevent the jury from receiving the illustration as independent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 61} We now turn our attention to an inquiry into the prejudice that resulted from the trial court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\n<em>Admission of the exhibit unfairly prejudiced Dr. Muakkassa</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A3M\">{\u00b6 62} Dr. Benzel\u2019s medical illustration was evidence bearing on a dispositive question, i.e., whether Mr. Moretz\u2019s cyst had nerves. By admitting the illustration as an exhibit, the trial court failed to do what was required, i.e., it failed to prevent the jurors from giving excessive weight to Dr. Benzel\u2019s illustration and from interpreting the illustration in the jury room on their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 63} Evid.R. 803(18) contains \u201csafeguards against unreliability and misuse\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">Misunderstanding is guarded against by the fact that the statements in learned treatises come to the trier of fact only through the testimony of qualified experts who are on the stand to explain and apply the material in the treatise. The rule provides that the treatise may be read into evidence but not received as an exhibit to prevent the trier from giving it excessive weight or attempting to interpret the treatise by itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>2006 Staff Notes to Evid.R. 803(18).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 64} In this case, the Moretzes used the medical illustration as evidence to bolster their claim that Mr. Moretz\u2019s cyst had nerves in it and to undermine Dr. Muakkassa\u2019s position that the cyst had no nerves because it was a neurenteric cyst. Dr. Muakkassa does not object to the Moretzes\u2019 reliance on the illustration. He objects to its admission into evidence as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 65} In closing arguments, the Moretzes\u2019 counsel emphasized the importance of the medical illustration by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">We had a drawing up from the book published by Dr. Benzel that was a representative drawing of an anterior presacral meningocele of the type Larry had * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">[J]ust to remind you that Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 36, <em>which you will get, so, if you so choose, you can look at this </em>* * *. Dr. McLaughlin, who, by the way, knows that doctor very well who prepared this text and thinks highly of him, whether this was a [sic] representative of a type of cyst that Mr. Moretz had at that time and he indicated yes, because we were having this dispute about whether or not there are nerves here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">* * * Certainly this is evidence that their expert indicated this is a cyst of the type that Mr. Moretz had that potentially had nerve root stretched over it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">{\u00b6 66} Dr. Williams testified that he is not qualified to perform neurosurgery and, likewise, not trained in the surgical treatment of meningoceles. On the other hand, he does have experience operating on neurenteric cysts. As the Moretzes\u2019 counsel made clear during closing argument, \u201cThere was a fight in this case as to whether or not it was a meningocele * * *. * * * [I]f it\u2019s not a meningocele, maybe they are not in the nervous system and maybe they don\u2019t need a neurosurgeon * * *. You will determine that.\u201d To that end, the Moretzes\u2019 counsel directed the jurors\u2019 attention to Exhibit 36 and stated, \u201cThat has nerves in it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">{\u00b6 67} We agree with the Moretzes\u2019 trial counsel that this case hinged on whether there were nerves in Mr. Moretz\u2019s cyst. The Moretzes prevailed in convincing enough jurors that there were; they garnered the minimum number of votes necessary to sustain a verdict in their favor. But they did so by doing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>end run around Evid.R. 803(18). During trial, the Moretzes\u2019 counsel justified using the illustration to cross-examine Drs. Muakkassa and McLaughlin by invoking Evid.R. 803(18). As required by Evid.R. 803(18), before using the medical illustration to cross-examine Dr. McLaughlin, the Moretzes\u2019 trial counsel laid a foundation by eliciting testimony from him that he believed Dr. Benzel\u2019s medical textbook was authoritative. But later, when it was time to move for exhibits to be admitted into evidence, counsel changed gears and asserted that the illustration was not hearsay, because Dr. McLaughlin had adopted it as his own statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 68} The trial court accepted the Moretzes\u2019 argument and justified doing so by relying on an unreported court of appeals case, <em>Robertson v. McCue, </em>9th Dist. Summit No. 19539, 2000 WL 14118 (Jan. 5, 2000), that was decided six years before Evid.R. 803(18) was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 69} In <em>Robertson, </em>a physician performed surgery on Robertson\u2019s wrists. An unsuccessful result led to a malpractice suit. At trial, both parties prepared diagrams to demonstrate what they believed had happened during surgery. Expert testimony authenticated the physician\u2019s diagram, but no expert testified as to the accuracy of Robertson\u2019s diagram.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 70} The trial court admitted the physician\u2019s diagram but ruled that Robertson\u2019s was inadmissible because no expert had authenticated it. The jury returned a verdict for the defense, and the Ninth District affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 71} <em>Robertson </em>is factually distinguishable. To begin, the diagram in <em>Robertson </em>was not an illustration photocopied from a learned treatise. <em>Robertson </em>involved an original artist\u2019s rendering that was generated for the purpose of litigation. Moreover, the relevant legal issue in <em>Robertson </em>was authentication of the exhibit, not whether it was hearsay admissible under an exception that did not even exist at the time. Even now, authentication is irrelevant under Evid.R. 803(18) because learned treatises are not admissible as exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">{\u00b6 72} Even if Evid.R. 803(18) had been in effect when <em>Robertson </em>was decided, the <em>Robertson </em>court would have had no reason to analyze it. The exhibit in <em>Robertson </em>was not from a learned treatise. By the same token, <em>Robertson </em>gave the trial court here no justification for ignoring Evid.R. 803(18).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">{\u00b6 73} Nevertheless, the trial court in this case emphasized that the <em>Robertson </em>court had opined, \u201cGiven the technical, and unfamiliar, nature of the subject matter of this action, the court properly determined that \u2018it would be very unfair to submit this to the jury without any pictures.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robertson </em>at *3. Even if that reasoning had been relevant under Evid.R. 803(18), it directly conflicts with that rule\u2019s prohibition against jurors interpreting technical and unfamiliar material in the jury room by themselves, without the aid of an expert. Thus, the trial court here should have recognized that reliance on <em>Robertson </em>was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>{\u00b6 74} Here, Evid.R. 803(18) clearly prohibited admission of the illustration as an exhibit. Nevertheless, it was so admitted, and the Moretzes\u2019 trial counsel described the exhibit as proving that \u201cthat cyst has nerves.\u201d Whether the cyst had nerves was central to the case and was hotly contested. In deciding that issue, the jurors were invited to interpret a highly technical medical illustration in the jury room, by themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 75} The trial court was required to exclude the illustration as an exhibit to prevent the jurors from giving it excessive weight and from attempting <em>to </em>interpret the material themselves. By failing to do what was required, the trial court deprived Dr. Muakkassa of his right to a fair jury deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\n<em>Proposed interrogatory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 76} The trial court abused its discretion when it refused to submit to the jury a properly drafted interrogatory offered by Dr. Muakkassa.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">{\u00b6 77} The interrogatories proposed by Dr. Muakkassa stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">INTERROGATORY (A):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">Have plaintiffs proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Kamel Muakkassa, M.D. was negligent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-11\">IF THE ANSWER OF SIX OR MORE JURORS TO (A) IS \u201cYES,\u201d COMPLETE THE ANSWER TO INTERROGATORY (B).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-12\">INTERROGATORY (B):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-13\">State the respect in which you find Kamel Muakkassa was negligent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">The trial court rejected Interrogatory (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">{\u00b6 78} Civ.R. 49(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-16\">The court shall submit written interrogatories to the jury, together with appropriate forms for a general verdict, upon request of any party prior to the commencement of argument. * * * The interrogatories may be directed to one or more determinative issues whether issues of fact or mixed issues of fact and law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-17\">{\u00b6 79} \u201cThe purpose of an interrogatory is to \u2018test the jury\u2019s thinking in resolving an ultimate issue so as not to conflict with its verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freeman v. Norfolk &amp; </em>W. <em>Ry. Co., </em>69 Ohio St.3d 611, 613, 635 N.E.2d 310 (1994). When both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the content and the form of a proposed interrogatory are proper, Civ.R. 49 imposes a mandatory duty upon the trial court to submit the interrogatory to the jury. <em>See id. </em>A proper interrogatory is designed to lead to \u201c \u2018findings of such a character as will test the correctness of the general verdict returned and enable the court to determine as a matter of law whether such verdict shall stand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613-614, quoting <em>Bradley v. Mansfield Rapid Transit, Inc., </em>154 Ohio St. 154, 160, 93 N.E.2d 672 (1950). Accordingly, \u201c[w]hen the plaintiffs allegations include more than one act of negligence, it is proper to instruct the jury to specify of what the negligence consisted.\u201d <em>Freeman </em>at 614, citing <em>Davison v. Flowers, </em>123 Ohio St. 89, 174 N.E. 137 (1930), at paragraph four of the syllabus. We have repeatedly approved interrogatories requesting the jury to state \u201c \u2018in what respects the defendant was negligent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freeman </em>at 614, quoting <em>Ragone v. Vitali &amp; Beltrami, Jr., Inc., </em>42 Ohio St.2d 161, 327 N.E.2d 645 (1975), at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 80} In this case, the trial court was incorrect when it held that all of Dr. Dennis\u2019s allegations boiled down to a single complaint that Dr. Muakkassa did not scrub in for surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 81} Dr. Dennis testified that Dr. Muakkassa breached the standard of care in four ways: (1) he failed to scrub in to the surgery and operate himself, (2) he failed to use magnification or recommend that Dr. Williams use it, (3) he failed to use stimulation or recommend that Dr. Williams use it, and (4) he failed to recommend a posterior approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">{\u00b6 82} Dr. Muakkassa recommended and, in fact, arranged for Mr. Moretz\u2019s surgery to proceed through his abdomen. Three weeks before the surgery, Dr. Williams confirmed in writing that Mr. Moretz was scheduled for surgery on September 28, 2005, and that \u201c[s]urgery will consist of a laparoscopic excision of a presacral mass, possible open.\u201d Therefore, the allegation that Dr. Muakkassa was negligent in recommending the anterior approach is immaterial to when and if Dr. Muakkassa scrubbed in to surgery several weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">{\u00b6 83} While it is debatable on this record whether a surgeon can use magnification or stimulation himself if he does not scrub in to the surgery, the allegations here were also that Dr. Muakkassa was negligent in failing to <em>recommend </em>that Dr. Williams use magnification and stimulation. Dr. Muakkassa was in the operating room and observed the surgical field, at which time Dr. Williams asked for and received his guidance. Dr. Williams testified unequivocally that he did not need Dr. Muakkassa to do the actual cutting on the cyst, but that \u201cit made me comfortable that he agreed that what I was doing was proper.\u201d And although Dr. Williams did not believe that magnification or stimulation would have made a difference, he testified that he would have used both, if Dr. Muakkassa had recommended it.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>{\u00b6 84} Finally, magnification and stimulation are separate tools, which can be used independently and for different purposes. Magnification makes nerves more visible, while stimulation identifies nerves too tiny to see with magnification. Dr. McLaughlin testified that whether magnification is used depends on how the surgeon was trained, while nerve stimulation is an option whose use varies by region.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 85} Accordingly, because several distinct allegations of negligence were made, Dr. Muakkassa was entitled to have the jury specify of what the negligence consisted. Moreover, the narrative form of the proposed interrogatory was proper because it tracked the precise language that we approved in <em>Freeman. </em>The trial court\u2019s error in rejecting the interrogatory deprived Dr. Muakkassa of his right to test the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\n<em>Damages evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 86} The trial court abused its discretion when it prohibited Dr. Muakkassa from attempting to show that the reasonable value of medical services is equal to the amount paid after write-offs unless he laid a foundation through expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 87} On several occasions, we have had the opportunity to clarify the law on the use of evidence of write-offs in negligence actions. <em>Robinson v. Bates, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 17, 2006-Ohio-6362, 857 N.E.2d 1195; <em>Jaques v. Manton, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 342, 2010-Ohio-1838, 928 N.E.2d 434. We have repeatedly recognized that \u201ceither the bill itself or the amount actually paid can be submitted to prove the value of medical services.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>at \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">{\u00b6 88} In <em>Robinson, </em>we recognized that \u201cR.C. 2317.421 makes * * * bills prima facie evidence of the reasonable value of charges for medical services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 9. R.C. 2317.421 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">In an action for damages arising from personal injury or wrongful death, a written bill or statement, or any relevant portion thereof, itemized by date, type of service rendered, and charge, shall, if otherwise admissible, be prima-facie evidence of the reasonableness of any charges and fees stated therein for medication and prosthetic devices furnished, or medical, dental, hospital, and funeral services rendered by the person, firm, or corporation issuing such bill or statement, provided, that such bill or statement shall be prima-facie evidence of reasonableness only if the party offering it delivers a copy of it, or the relevant portion thereof, to the attorney of record for each adverse party not less than five days before trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>{\u00b6 89} Based on the plain language of the statute, in <em>Robinson </em>we affirmed the court of appeals\u2019 holding that the trial court had erred when it refused to allow the original medical bills to be admitted into evidence. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 9. But we noted that the court of appeals erred when it held that the collateral-source rule applied to exclude evidence of write-offs. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 10. We explained that the collateral-source rule \u201cprevents the jury from learning about a plaintiffs income from a source other than the tortfeasor so that a tortfeasor is not given an advantage from third-party payments to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 11. And we concluded that the common-law collateral-source rule does not exclude evidence of write-offs of expenses that are never paid. A write-off is not a payment, and thus it cannot constitute payment of a benefit. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16. Thus, evidence of write-offs can be admitted because the tortfeasor \u201cdoes not obtain a \u2018credit\u2019 \u201d therefrom. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 90} Moreover, we declined to adopt a categorical rule that the reasonable value of medical services is either the amount billed or the amount paid. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 17. \u201cInstead, the reasonable value of medical services is a matter for the jury to determine from all relevant evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe jury may decide that the reasonable value of medical care is the amount originally billed, the amount the medical provider accepted as payment, or some amount in between.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 91} In <em>Jaques, </em>we revisited our decision in <em>Robinson </em>in light of the intervening enactment of R.C. 2315.20,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which largely abrogated the common-law collateral-source rule. <em>Id., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 342, 2010-Ohio-1838, 928 N.E.2d 434, at \u00b6 1. We explained that R.C. 2315.20 \u201cpertains only to \u2018evidence of any amount payable as a benefit to the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 11. We concluded that our common-law analysis set forth in <em>Robinson </em>applies equally in the context of the statute because the statute\u2019s \u201cformulation is no different substantively from the common-law rule described in <em>Robinson </em>as excluding only \u2018evidence of benefits <em>paid </em>by a collateral source.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we reaffirmed that \u201c \u2018[b]oth the original medical bill rendered and the amount accepted as full payment are admissible to prove the reasonableness and necessi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ty of charges rendered for medical and hospital care.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 15, quoting <em>Robinson, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 17, 2006-Ohio-6362, 857 N.E.2d 1195, at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 92} We reaffirm our holdings in <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Jaques </em>and hold that pursuant to R.C. 2317.421, evidence of \u201cwrite-offs,\u201d reflected in medical bills and statements, is prima facie evidence of the reasonable value of medical services. But whether this sort of evidence requires the party offering it to lay a foundation for its admission through expert testimony is an open question. The court of appeals held that expert testimony is required before evidence of write-offs may be admitted. The court held that the presumption of reasonableness for medical bills contained in R.C. 2317.421 does not extend to write-offs, and because the reasonable value of medical services is outside the common knowledge of laypeople, expert testimony is necessary as a foundation for presentation of this evidence to the jury. 2012-Ohio-1177, 2012 WL 982996, at \u00b6 41. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 93} Before the enactment of R.C. 2317.421, Ohio courts \u201crequire[d] the usually empty ceremonial of having a doctor testify that the charge * * * made for a particular service is a reasonable and customary one.\u201d <em>De Tunno v. Shull, </em>166 Ohio St. 365, 377, 143 N.E.2d 301 (1957) (Bell, J., concurring). R.C. 2317.421 provides that \u201ca written bill or statement, or any relevant portion thereof\u2019 establishes a presumption of the reasonableness of medical charges and fees. At a minimum, the bills and statements must reflect the date of service, the type of service rendered, and the original charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 94} The statute refers to \u201ca written bill or statement, or any relevant portion thereof.\u201d The phrase \u201cany relevant portion thereof\u2019 broadens the meaning of the words \u201cbill or statement\u201d and reflects that the General Assembly intended the statute to encompass more than just charges. Moreover, there is no language in R.C. 2317.421 that excludes write-offs from the statutory presumption. Finally, the statute refers to \u201cthe party offering\u201d the bills and statements, which means that the statutory presumption applies to either party, not just to plaintiffs. As we explained in <em>Robinson, </em>that language plainly permits plaintiffs to offer the statements to prove that the reasonable value of the medical services is equal to the charges. And we explained in <em>Jaques </em>that defendants may offer evidence of write-offs to prove that the reasonable value of the medical services is equal to the amount paid after write-offs. There is no basis for requiring expert-witness testimony that the actual amounts charged for medical services are reasonable, when the initial charges for the services are admissible into evidence without such testimony. Eliminating the need for expert testimony allows both parties to avoid the expense and \u201cthe usually empty ceremonial\u201d of expert testimony on reasonableness. <em>De Tunno, </em>166 Ohio St. at 377, 143 N.E.2d 301 (Bell, J., concurring). Thus, we conclude that R.C. 2317.421 obviates the necessi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ty of expert testimony for the admission of evidence of write-offs, reflected on medical bills and statements, as prima facie evidence of the reasonable value of medical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 95} The write-offs at issue here were reflected on the statements from Mr. Moretz\u2019s health-care providers. They were, therefore, a \u201crelevant portion\u201d of the statements, which Dr. Muakkassa was entitled to have admitted without an expert\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, on remand, Dr. Muakkassa shall be permitted to argue that the reasonable value of Mr. Moretz\u2019s medical services is the amount equal to the amount paid after write-offs without supporting that argument with expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 96} The trial court\u2019s order granting the Moretzes leave to file a transcript of a videotaped deposition even though the filing conflicted with Civ.R. 32(A) was harmless error given the facts of this case. However, the trial court did abuse its discretion when it admitted as an exhibit an illustration from a learned treatise offered by the Moretzes, refused to submit to the jury a properly drafted interrogatory offered by Dr. Muakkassa, and prohibited Dr. Muakkassa from presenting evidence of write-offs to contest the Moretzes\u2019 medical bills without a foundation of expert testimony on the reasonable value of the medical services rendered. We further hold that these errors deprived Dr. Muakkassa of a fair trial. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth District Court of Appeals, and we remand this case to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b403-10\">O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b403-11\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-13\">.

The rows of crops appear evenly spaced and the barn well painted. The view from the ground is very different. Due to weather, the crops may be uneven or sparse and the paint on the barn may be peeling. But, even with these imperfections, the farms are productive. Unfortunately, the majority opinion in this case gets so caught up in the imperfect ground view that it overlooks the larger realities. Viewed from the proper perspective, the verdict in this case is both justified and reasonable. Moreover, by focusing on the motes, the majority opinion has attacked the trial court and the court of appeals in a way that is unwarranted and just plain demeaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>{\u00b6 98} This case involves a civil trial where the burden of persuasion is on the plaintiffs to establish their case by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Merrick v.

The criminal standard is tougher because \u201cthe state has a more jealous concern for the lives and liberties of its inhabitants than it can possibly entertain for property rights.\u201d <em>Merrick </em>at 261. The majority opinion turns these standards on their heads by essentially determining that any error in a civil trial justifies sending the case back for a new trial. That is not the standard in criminal trials, even trials where a person\u2019s life is at stake, and it certainly should not be the standard in civil trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 99} In criminal cases, we routinely overlook errors that are not outcome-determinative, even errors that are constitutional in nature. <em>Grundy v.

The question thus becomes whether the introduction of the illustration as an exhibit affected the framework of the trial. Clearly, it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>{\u00b6 103} The majority opinion places great weight on this illustration, imbuing it with the power to contort the jury\u2019s deliberations. But there is no reason to think that that is what happened. The trial lasted four days and produced nearly 700 pages of transcript. The illustration is discussed on fewer than ten pages of the transcript. It was offered as a representative of the type of cyst that Moretz had, and it was authenticated by Dr. Mark R. McLaughlin, one of the defense\u2019s expert witnesses. Its use during the trial was fine; only its introduction as an exhibit was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">{\u00b6 104} Dr. McLaughlin, when discussing the illustration, stated that nerves can occur on an anterior sacral meningocele and that \u201ca neurenteric cyst can look very similar to\u201d an anterior sacral meningocele. Dr. McLaughlin stated that nerve roots stretched over the sac \u201ccan occur,\u201d indicating the possibility of nerves, not the reality or the certainty. Similarly, in closing argument, the Moretzes\u2019 counsel stated that the illustration depicts a cyst that \u201cpotentially had nerve roots stretched over it.\u201d Defense counsel chose not to mention the illustration in closing, perhaps not wanting to draw the jury\u2019s attention to it. But the Moretzes\u2019 counsel already had referred to it, and if defense counsel thought that the illustration was particularly damaging, he could have explained to the jury why it was misleading or misrepresentative.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 105} The majority opinion attaches significance to the Moretzes\u2019 counsel referring to the illustration and stating, \u201cThat has nerves in it.\u201d But the defense\u2019s own expert witness had testified, when discussing the illustration, that nerves like that \u201ccan occur.\u201d Furthermore, the jury knew that the illustration was just that \u2014 \u201can illustration\u201d of a representative cyst. They knew that it was not intended to depict the cyst in Larry Moretz\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 106} There is no reason to believe that admitting the illustration as an exhibit led the jury astray. There was ample evidence presented throughout the trial that Dr. Muakkassa did not conduct himself during the surgery as Larry Moretz thought he would, did not conduct himself as Dr. Williams thought he would, did not conduct himself as Dr. McLaughlin would have conducted himself, and did not conduct himself as Dr. Dennis thought he should. That is the evidence that led to the jury verdict, not the incidental, though plainly improper, introduction of a properly authenticated illustration as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">{\u00b6 107} Larry Moretz thought that Dr. Muakkassa would be the co-surgeon, not just an interested academic observer. Dr. Williams also thought that Dr. Muakkassa would be the co-surgeon, and he testified that he asked Dr. Muakkassa to scrub in, which Dr. Muakkassa did not do. Dr. McLaughlin testified that he would have used magnification to search for nerves, that he would have used stimulation to check for nerves, and that he would have scrubbed in. Dr. Muakkassa did none of those things. As the majority opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Dr. Dennis testified that Dr. Muakkassa breached the standard of care in four ways: (1) he failed to scrub in to the surgery and operate himself, (2) he failed to use magnification or recommend that Dr. Williams use it, (3) he failed to use stimulation or recommend that Dr. Williams use it, and (4) he failed to recommend a posterior approach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Majority opinion at \u00b6 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">{\u00b6 108} Against this evidence, the majority opinion concludes that the admission of the illustration as an exhibit was so overwhelmingly prejudicial that it \u201cdeprived Dr. Muakkassa of his right to a fair jury deliberation.\u201d That is nonsense. To reiterate: use of the illustration did not violate the rules of evidence. The illustration itself was relevant and properly authenticated. Only the admission of the illustration as an exhibit was against the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">{\u00b6 109} And the jury had ample other evidence from which to reach a verdict of negligence. The defense\u2019s expert witness testified that the best way to remove the cyst was with posterior surgery. Dr. Muakkassa was asked whether he made any attempt to protect the nervous system. He replied that he had not. He also testified that he didn\u2019t look to see whether there was a nerve on the cyst and that he didn\u2019t look for a nerve because he didn\u2019t expect to see one. Against all of this, the majority opinion suggests that the admission of a properly authenticated illustration as an exhibit deprived Dr. Muakkassa of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">{\u00b6 110} That brings us to the standard of review on this issue, which is abuse of discretion. The majority opinion concludes that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the illustration to be admitted as an exhibit. Accordingly, a majority of this court believes that the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably, though it does not tell us which. I conclude that admitting the illustration as an exhibit was not within the discretion of the court, but rather was error, mere error, and that given the abundance of other evidence presented in support of the verdict, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">\n<em>Proposed Interrogatory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">{\u00b6 111} Do we not ask enough of our juries in complicated medical-malpractice cases? They are already asked to learn obscure terminology and complex concepts that are not part of their day-to-day world. They are asked to make fine factual distinctions between reasonable options that have been explained, often inconsistently, by counsel and by witnesses. They are asked to absorb lengthy testimony, some of which they are supposed to assume they didn\u2019t hear, such as after an objection is sustained. They are asked to live for a day, a week, or a month in an unfamiliar legal environment. We should all be very thankful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>for their efforts and impressed with the results they produce. But now, a majority of this court would have the juries of this state become essay writers. There is no other way to describe requiring juries to answer open-ended interrogatories. And there is no better way to induce innocent mistakes on the part of laypeople.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 112} The better practice in this case would have been for the defense to submit a yes/no question as to each issue that the plaintiffs contend was negligence. That tactic would have adequately tested the verdict without requiring the jury to write an essay on a topic with which it is generally unfamiliar. Open-ended prose answers from juries could be a gold mine for disgruntled defendants. Juries would likely make technical misstatements that could lead to reversals, even when the jury is justifiably convinced that negligence occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 113} In this case, the defense submitted an open-ended interrogatory. The trial court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 case essentially boiled down to one issue: whether Dr. Muakkassa was negligent in failing to scrub in. It is certainly arguable that there was more than one respect in which Dr. Muakkassa could have been deemed negligent. We do not know the logic that animated the trial court\u2019s decision not to allow the proposed interrogatory, other than what was stated. But I believe that the trial court wished to avoid requiring the jury to expound in writing on a complex issue of medical care on which even the experts differed. Unfortunately, a majority of this court appears to think that that is a grand idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 114} The court of appeals agreed with the trial court that the basic theory of the plaintiffs\u2019 case was that Dr. Muakkassa was negligent in failing to scrub in. 2012-Ohio-1177, 2012 WL 982996, \u00b6 16. I\u2019m not sure I agree with that conclusion, but it was not unreasonable. Even if we disagree with that characterization of the case, even if we would have decided differently, that does not mean that the decision should be reversed. It can only be reversed if the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 115} One more aspect of this issue is interesting. The defense did not submit an alternative interrogatory, though they had ample opportunity. They should have submitted several: one yes/no question as to each aspect of the plaintiffs\u2019 case that in defense counsel\u2019s view constituted an allegation of negligence. Such straightforward interrogatories would have been relatively simple for the jury to answer without delving into complicated language and issues, would have properly tested the jury\u2019s verdict, and could not have been reasonably rejected by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">{\u00b6 116} A trial court\u2019s decision to submit interrogatories is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Freeman v. Norfolk, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 611, 614, 635 N.E.2d 310 (1994). I conclude that the trial court did not act unreasonably, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>arbitrarily, or unconscionably in rejecting the proposed interrogatory. I further conclude that the defense waived its right to complain when it failed to submit alternative interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">{\u00b6 117} By allowing open-ended questions to be asked of juries, Civ.R. 49(B) causes more harm than good. It allows defendants to attempt to confuse or distract juries, often on minor points that have little or no bearing on the outcome and the issues they are to decide. The only thing saving the civil-justice system from daily train wrecks caused by a literal reading of Civ.R. 49(B) is the common sense and wisdom of trial judges who reject interrogatories that are designed to confuse or distract. This court should have the sense to affirm trial courts when they so act, especially when, as here, the defense had the alternative of asking straightforward yes/no questions that were unlikely to confuse or distract the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\n<em>Damages Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 118} The trial court did not allow Dr. Muakkassa to introduce evidence to show that the value of the medical services at issue in this case was equal to the amount paid after write-offs were taken. The court concluded that evidence of write-offs could be introduced only through expert testimony. The majority opinion deems this approach an abuse of discretion, even though it calls the question an \u201copen\u201d one. Majority opinion at \u00b6 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b6 119} The Moretzes introduced evidence of medical expenses by supplying copies of medical bills to opposing counsel and to the court. Dr. Dennis also testified as to the necessity and reasonableness of the treatment and medical bills. Accordingly, these medical bills are presumed to be reasonable. R.C. 2317.421. When Dr. Muakkassa attempted to present evidence of write-offs, the trial court refused because he did not have expert testimony in support of his evidence. The court stated that \u201cassuming you have expert testimony available to support the reasonableness of that, then you can present the evidence.\u201d This approach by the trial court does not strike me as unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">{\u00b6 120} During the trial, the defense had ample opportunity to introduce evidence about the reasonableness of the write-offs. But when Joanne Smith, a medical-billing specialist, was on the stand, the defense did not ask a single question about the medical bills in question. Instead, he focused his questions on the bill that Dr. Muakkassa presented for his services. The defense did not question Dr. Dennis or Dr. McLaughlin about the write-offs. Given that the defense did not proffer evidence of the reasonableness of the write-offs at trial, I conclude that the defense should be precluded from contesting that issue on appeal.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b409-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Mark D.

Even if that were true, this error on the part of the trial court does not necessitate a new trial because it can be easily corrected with a remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">{\u00b6 122} Larry Moretz has a permanent loss of bowel, bladder, and sexual function. His condition is inarguably the result of the surgery he underwent. Whether Dr. Muakkassa was negligent was an issue for the jury to determine. It had ample evidence before it that he had not been negligent and ample evidence that he had been negligent. It concluded that he had been negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">{\u00b6 123} The last thing defense counsel told the jury was \u201cI trust this system. And I will accept your verdict, as will my client * * After deciding that the best way to treat his patient was a drive-by surgery and after vowing to abide by the jury verdict, Dr. Muakkassa now declares that justice demands that he receive a new trial, a new opportunity to convince a fresh jury that the horrendous outcome in this case should be laid at the doorstep of his colleague, the general surgeon to whom he referred Moretz. And this court is sanctioning it, transmogrifying a couple of minor discretionary decisions that did not affect the outcome of the trial into a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">{\u00b6 124} The jury verdict in this case was proper. The finding of negligence and the amount of damages do not reflect passion and prejudice. Nothing in the jury verdict suggests that Dr. Muakkassa did not receive substantial justice. In short, the jury got it right, and its verdict is not \u201cinconsistent with substantial justice\u201d within the meaning of Civ.R. 61. The trial court\u2019s rulings were appropriate, any error was harmless under the circumstances, and the court of appeals should be affirmed, not chastised.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">{\u00b6 125} We have stated many times that criminal defendants are entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect trial. A fair reading of the majority opinion leaves one with the unmistakable impression that from this day forward a doctor in a medical-malpractice case is entitled to a perfect trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">{\u00b6 126} I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-12\">O\u2019Neill, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Bricker <em>&amp; </em>Eckler L.L.P., Anne Marie Sferra, and Keesha Warmsby, urging reversal for amici curiae American Insurance Association, Ohio Alliance for Civil Justice, Ohio Hospital Association, Ohio Osteopathic Association, and Ohio State Medical Association.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b410-5\">Dinkier Pregon, L.L.C., Jamey T.
