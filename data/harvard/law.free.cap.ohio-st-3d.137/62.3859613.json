Monroe contends that Kitchen is actually a Democrat and that his profession of independence was not made in good faith, as required by R.C. 3513.257 and <em>Morrison v. Colley, </em>467 F.3d 503 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">{\u00b6 2} We find that Monroe has failed to satisfy his burden of proof and deny the writ. In addition, we deny Monroe\u2019s motion to strike the board\u2019s answer on the grounds of improper service.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">{\u00b6 3} On May 6, 2013, Kitchen filed a nominating petition to run as an independent candidate for mayor of Youngstown. Monroe, a qualified elector, filed a written protest challenging Kitchen\u2019s candidacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">{\u00b6 4} The board held a protest hearing on July 18, 2013, at which both Monroe and Kitchen testified under oath. The hearing produced the following evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">{\u00b6 5} (1) Between November 2000 and May 2013, Kitchen voted a Democratic Party ballot on five occasions: May 7, 2002; May 2, 2006; May 8, 2007; March 4, 2008; and May 5, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">{\u00b6 6} (2) In the 2013 primary election, Kitchen voted an issues-only ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-16\">{\u00b6 7} (3) Kitchen served on the executive committee of the Mahoning County Democratic Party for a period of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>{\u00b6 8} (4) Kitchen also represented the Second Ward on the Youngstown City Council as a Democrat.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">{\u00b6 9} (5) When Democrat Charles Sammarone became mayor of Youngstown, he hired Kitchen as the \u201cnumber-two man\u201d in his office. Kitchen described the job as a \u201cnonpartisan appointed position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">{\u00b6 10} (6) When Kitchen accepted Mayor Sammarone\u2019s offer, he resigned from both the city council and the Democratic Party executive committee. These resignations occurred more than two years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">{\u00b6 11} (7) Kitchen testified that accepting the job with Mayor Sammarone was \u201cnot a partisan issue,\u201d but rather \u201can issue of providing and taking care of my family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">{\u00b6 12} (8) Monroe testified that Kitchen had stated, as quoted in an article in a local newspaper, that \u201c[i]t was more strategic to run as an independent\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to saturate the primary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">{\u00b6 13} (9) When directly asked why he chose to leave the Democratic Party and declare himself an independent candidate, Kitchen expressed his belief that voters were frustrated with \u201cthe constant accusations and things\u201d that arise with the two-party system. He went on to say that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">the fact that I\u2019m running as an independent is a reflection of my ideology * * *, there are things I would agree with with the Democratic party. There are things I would agree with, I\u2019m sure, with the Republican party. But my decision to run as an independent was truly because I feel that I am an independent as it relates to my world view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">{\u00b6 14} At the end of the hearing, the board voted to deny the protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">Procedural history</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">{\u00b6 15} Monroe filed this original action on September 16, 2013, and the board filed an answer on September 23, 2013. Monroe filed a motion to strike the board\u2019s answer on September 26, 2013, and the board filed a memorandum in opposition the next day, September 27, 2013. Pursuant to the accelerated schedule for expedited election cases set forth in S.Ct.Prac.R. 12.08(A)(2), Monroe filed his merit brief and evidence on September 26, 2013, the board filed its merit brief and evidence on September 30, 2013, and Monroe filed a reply brief on October 3, 2013. This cause is now before the court for consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\n<em>The motion to strike</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">{\u00b6 16} Parties in expedited election cases must serve all documents upon the other parties by personal service, facsimile transmission, or e-mail. S.Ct.Prac.R. 12.08(C). The board admits that it served its answer on Monroe by ordinary mail only. On September 26, 2013, Monroe filed a motion to strike the board\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">{\u00b6 17} S.Ct.Prac.R. 3.11(D)(2) permits the court to deny a motion to strike an improperly served pleading when the complaining party has not been adversely affected. Even in expedited election cases, a party seeking to have a pleading stricken must demonstrate adversity. <em>State ex rel. McCord v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 346, 2005-Ohio-4758, 835 N.E.2d 336, \u00b6 18-21 (decided under former S.Ct.Prac.R. XIV(2)(D)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">{\u00b6 18} Monroe has not demonstrated any harm from the improper service. He filed his merit brief within the three days allowed by S.Ct.Prac.R. 12.08(A)(2)(a). For this reason, we deny the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">\n<em>Prohibition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">{\u00b6 19} For a writ of prohibition to issue in an expedited election case, the relator must establish that (1) the board of elections is about to exercise or has exercised quasi-judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power is not authorized by law, and (3) denying the writ will result in injury for which no other adequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Warren Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 24, 2011-Ohio-4623, 955 N.E.2d 379, \u00b6 12; <em>State ex rel. Columbia Res., Ltd. v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 167, 2006-Ohio-5019, 855 N.E.2d 815, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">{\u00b6 20} The board concedes the existence of the first element: the board exercised quasi-judicial power because it denied Monroe\u2019s protest after conducting a hearing that included sworn testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">{\u00b6 21} In an extraordinary action challenging the decision of a board of elections, the standard is whether the board engaged in fraud, corruption, or abuse of discretion or acted in clear disregard of applicable legal provisions. <em>Whitman v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 216, 2002-Ohio-5923, 778 N.E.2d 32, \u00b6 11. Monroe has not alleged fraud or corruption, so the question is whether the board clearly disregarded established law or abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">{\u00b6 22} An independent candidate is \u201cany candidate who claims not to be affiliated with a political party\u201d and who meets the filing requirements set forth in R.C. 3513.257. R.C. 3501.01(1). In <em>Morrison, </em>467 F.3d at 509, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that R.C. 3513.257 requires that an independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>candidate\u2019s declaration of nonaffiliation must be made in good faith. The Ohio secretary of state adopted the <em>Morrison </em>holding in a directive to the local boards of elections. Secretary of State Advisory Opinion No. 2007-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">{\u00b6 23} Monroe alleges that the board abused its discretion by placing Kitchen\u2019s name on the ballot. According to Monroe, Kitchen\u2019s declaration of disaffiliation was not made in good faith, as demonstrated by Kitchen\u2019s voting history, his employment in the office of Mayor Sammarone, and his \u201cwell established and long standing relationships with prominent members in the Democratic Party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">{\u00b6 24} The evidence submitted by Monroe shows that Kitchen has voted a Democratic Party ballot five times, most recently in May 2009. There is no evidence that Kitchen has voted in a Democratic primary, held elective office as a Democrat, or held a position on the Democratic Party central committee at any time <em>after </em>filing his declaration of independent candidacy and nominating petition on May 6, 2013. In Advisory Opinion No. 2007-05, the secretary of state, relying on <em>Morrison, </em>opined that a candidate\u2019s prior voting history alone is an insufficient basis for disqualifying an independent candidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">{\u00b6 25} Monroe argues that Kitchen\u2019s voting history should be considered in tandem with the fact that he is the \u201cnumber-two man\u201d in the administration of a Democratic mayor. However, there is no evidence in the record as to Kitchen\u2019s title, his duties, or the extent to which he has policy-making responsibilities or duties that are more administrative in nature. No Ohio court has ordered the disqualification of an independent candidate based on the fact that he or she holds a nonelective position in a branch of government. And even if a court were inclined to do so, it would take a stronger evidentiary record than the record in this case to show by clear and convincing evidence that the candidate\u2019s claim to be an independent was false or not made in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">{\u00b6 26} The fact that Kitchen has friendships with members of the Democratic Party is irrelevant. For one thing, Kitchen testified that he also has Republican friends. Moreover, disaffiliation from a party does not require one to abandon all friends and acquaintances.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">{\u00b6 27} We also find that Kitchen\u2019s remark that it was \u201cmore strategic\u201d to run as an independent is not disqualifying. <em>See State ex rel. Livingston v. Miami Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>196 Ohio App.3d 263, 2011-Ohio-6126, 963 N.E.2d 187, \u00b6 35 (2d Dist.) (evidence that candidate acted on a calculation that he would have a better chance of winning as an independent fails to rise to level of clear and convincing evidence that claim of disaffiliation was a sham).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">{\u00b6 28} Monroe cites two cases in which appellate courts affirmed decisions by boards of elections to disqualify independent candidates: <em>State ex rel. Lorenzi v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>7th Dist. Mahoning No. 07 MA 127, 2007-Ohio-5879, 2007 WL 3227667, and <em>State ex rel. Wilkerson v. Trumbull Cty. Bd. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>Elections, </em>11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2007-T-0081, 2007-Ohio-4762, 2007 WL 2696769. However, in both cases, the putative independent candidate voted in a partisan primary <em>after </em>submitting a nominating petition to run as an independent. <em>Lorenzi </em>at \u00b6 1; <em>Wilkerson </em>at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b276-13\">Cecil Monroe, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b276-14\">Paul J. Gains, Mahoning County Prosecuting Attorney, and Linette M. Stratford and Gina DeGenova Bricker, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b6 29} In summary, the evidence does not demonstrate an abuse of discretion by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\n<em>Laches</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">{\u00b6 30} We also note that Monroe failed to act with the \u201cutmost diligence\u201d required of relators in election cases. <em>State ex rel. Fuller v. Medina Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 221, 2002-Ohio-5922, 778 N.E.2d 37, \u00b6 7. Monroe learned of the board\u2019s decision to deny his protest on July 18, 2013, yet he waited two months to file his suit. He attributes this delay to a mistaken belief that he had 45 days to seek review in this court, but he admits that he learned of his error in late August and still waited more than three weeks to file suit. Thus, laches presents an alternative basis upon which to deny the writ. <em>Rust v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 139, 2005-Ohio-5795, 841 N.E.2d 766, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">{\u00b6 31} Based on the foregoing, we find that Monroe has failed to demonstrate his entitlement to an extraordinary writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Writ denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b276-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b276-12\">O\u2019Neill, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
