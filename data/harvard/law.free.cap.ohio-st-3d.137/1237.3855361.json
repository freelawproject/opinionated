Porter, have filed affidavits with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 and 2101.39 seeking to disqualify Judge Damian J. Vercillo from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. 20134001A, now pending in the Probate Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Ashland County.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">{\u00b6 2} Affiants fear that Judge Vercillo cannot be impartial to Crumrine because of conclusions the judge reached regarding Crumrine\u2019s credibility in a previous guardianship case. Affiants further question Judge Vercillo\u2019s ability to preside fairly over the underlying trust matter because the judge\u2019s former law partner represents a defendant and may be called as a witness. Judge Vercillo has responded in writing to the concerns raised in the affidavits, averring that he has no bias for or against any party in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">{\u00b6 3} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Vercillo.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">\n<em>The guardianship case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b827-15\">{\u00b6 4} Judge Vercillo recently denied Crumrine\u2019s application for guardianship in a proceeding involving most of the same parties as the underlying trust matter. In his decision in the guardianship case, Judge Vercillo concluded that some of Crumrine\u2019s testimony was \u201cvague and somewhat deceptive,\u201d and the judge found other portions of his testimony \u201cto not be credible.\u201d Judge Vercillo also noted that Crumrine may have overly influenced the alleged incompetent person. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>Affiants now claim that Judge Vercillo\u2019s negative opinion of Crumrine from the guardianship case may affect the judge\u2019s ability to impartially consider Crumrine\u2019s testimony in the pending trust matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">{\u00b6 5} Contrary to affiants\u2019 contention, \u201c[s]tate and federal courts have been virtually unanimous in holding that \u2014 absent a showing of actual bias \u2014 a judge who presided over prior proceedings involving one or more parties presently before the court is not thereby disqualified from presiding over later proceedings involving the same parties.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Bryant, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1251, 2006-Ohio-7227, 885 N.E.2d 246, \u00b6 4. Even if a judge forms a negative opinion about a party as a result of what he or she learned in a prior proceeding, such opinions are ordinarily not a basis for disqualification in a future proceeding involving that party. <em>See In re Disqualification of Basinger, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1293, 2013-Ohio-1613, 987 N.E.2d 687, \u00b6 5 (\u201cbecause \u2018 \u201cevidence presented in the trial of a prior cause * * * do[es] not stem from an extrajudicial source,\u201d it creates no personal bias requiring recusal\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>State v. D'Ambrosio, </em>67 Ohio St.3d 185, 188, 616 N.E.2d 909 (1993), quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>242 N.W.2d 320, 324 (Iowa 1976). Judges are expected to be able to keep their prior opinions from intruding on their duties to fairly and impartially decide each case. That is, \u201c[j]ust as a \u2018[a] judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased,\u2019 <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5, a judge is presumed to be capable of separating what may properly be considered from what may not be considered.\u201d <em>Basinger </em>at \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">{\u00b6 6} Here, Judge Vercillo avers that he assessed Crumrine\u2019s credibility in the guardianship case based on the evidence presented in that proceeding, and he further states that he has no preconceived opinion about Crumrine\u2019s truthfulness in the current matter. Because nothing in the record suggests that Judge Vercillo has been unduly influenced by the testimony in the guardianship case, the judge\u2019s presumption of impartiality has not been overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">\n<em>The judge\u2019s relationship with defense counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">{\u00b6 7} Affiants also question whether Judge Vercillo\u2019s relationship with defense counsel, John Vanosdall, will affect the judge\u2019s impartially; alternatively, they assert that the relationship at least suggests an appearance of bias. Vanosdall was Judge Vercillo\u2019s former law partner, and affiants claim that Vanosdall drafted the allegedly defective trust at issue in the underlying case, which will likely require Vanosdall to testify as a witness. In response, Judge Vercillo acknowledges that he was Vanosdall\u2019s law partner from 1983 to 1993, at which time the partnership dissolved. But the judge further explains that the trust in the underlying case was allegedly created in 2006 \u2014 well after the law partnership terminated \u2014 and that while he remains acquainted with Vanosdall, the judge has no business or ongoing social relationship with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>{\u00b6 8} In general, \u201cthe more intimate the relationship between a judge and a person who is involved in a pending proceeding, the more acute is the concern that the judge may be tempted to depart from the expected judicial detachment or to reasonably appear to have done so.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Shuff, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1230, 2004-Ohio-7355, 884 N.E.2d 1084, \u00b6 6. However, it is well established that \u201ca prior professional relationship between a judge and an attorney will not be grounds for disqualification where that relationship ended some years ago.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Ward, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1211, 798 N.E.2d 1 (2002) (disqualification denied when judge\u2019s professional relationship with an attorney appearing before him ended seven years prior). Here, Judge Vercillo\u2019s professional relationship with Vanosdall ended almost 20 years ago, and Judge Vercillo states that his current relationship with Vanosdall is no different from the judge\u2019s relationship with most of the attorneys in Ashland County. On this record, no reasonable or objective observer would question Judge Vercillo\u2019s ability to preside fairly in the underlying case. <em>See In re Disqualification of Lewis, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1227, 2004-Ohio-7359, 884 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 8 (a judge\u2019s participation in a case presents an appearance of impropriety if \u201ca reasonable and objective observer would harbor serious doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. * * * A judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, at \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">{\u00b6 10} For the reasons stated above, the affidavits of disqualification are denied. The case may proceed before Judge Vercillo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
