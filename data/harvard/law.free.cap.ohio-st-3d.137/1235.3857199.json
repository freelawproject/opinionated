I(12)(E), recommending that Karyn Marie Washington\u2019s application to take the Ohio bar examination be disapproved and that she be permitted to apply for the February 2015 bar examination. The applicant did not file objections. On June 18, 2013, the court granted, in part, Washington\u2019s motion to seal the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">{\u00b6 2} On consideration of the board\u2019s report, the court adopts the board\u2019s finding that Washington has failed to prove that she currently possesses the requisite character, fitness, and moral qualifications for admission to the practice of law in Ohio and hereby orders that Washington\u2019s pending application be disapproved. Based on the court\u2019s review of the record, the court also finds that a longer waiting period is required before Washington may reapply to take the Ohio bar examination. Accordingly, it is further ordered that Washington is permitted to reapply for the July 2016 bar examination pursuant to the requirements of Gov.Bar R. I, including completion of a new character-and-fitness investigation.</p>\n<judges id=\"b825-12\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
