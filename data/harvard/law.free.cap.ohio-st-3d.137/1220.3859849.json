Grendell from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. 13-JF-000284, a child-neglect case pending in the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Geauga County.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">{\u00b6 2} Catalano is the maternal grandmother of R.S. and claims that Judge Grendell has shown favoritism towards the paternal grandparents. However, according to Catalano\u2019s affidavit, Judge Grendell denied Catalano\u2019s motion to intervene in the underlying case, concluding that she has no standing in the matter. Under R.C. 2701.03(A), an affidavit to disqualify a judge may be filed by \u201cany party to the proceeding or the party\u2019s counsel.\u201d In previous affidavit-of-disqualification cases, the chief justice has strictly enforced this statutory requirement and consistently found that individuals who do not qualify as a \u201cparty\u201d or \u201cparty\u2019s counsel\u201d do not have standing to file an affidavit of disqualification. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Cleary, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1225, 657 N.E.2d 1337 (1990); <em>In re Disqualification of Haas, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1217, 657 N.E.2d 1331 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">{\u00b6 3} Because Catalano has not demonstrated that she is a party to the underlying case, she is not one of the persons who may file an affidavit of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">{\u00b6 4} Accordingly, Catalano\u2019s affidavit of disqualification is dismissed. The case may proceed before Judge Grendell.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
