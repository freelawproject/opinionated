S.Ct.Prac.R. 6.01(A)(1). The motion for reconsideration that Andrews filed in the court of appeals did not extend his time to appeal that court\u2019s judgment. <em>State ex rel. Manuel v. Stenson, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 52, 2010-Ohio-2673, 930 N.E.2d 310, \u00b6 1. Andrews cannot use an appeal from a denial of his motion for reconsideration as a substitute for a timely appeal from the judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-15\">{\u00b6 3} Insofar as Andrews appeals the court of appeals\u2019 denial of his motion for reconsideration, that court lacked jurisdiction to consider a motion for reconsideration and thus correctly denied the motion. A request for reconsideration of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>judgment rendered by an appellate court in an original action is a nullity because App.R. 26(A) is inapplicable. <em>Phillips v. Irwin, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 350, 2002-Ohio-4758, 774 N.E.2d 1218, \u00b6 5. Because the Eleventh District lacked jurisdiction over his motion (and thus correctly denied it), we affirm.
