McGinnis of Lakewood, Ohio, with the unauthorized practice of law for preparing two court documents and distributing a flyer advertising legal services. McGinnis is not, and never has been, admitted to the practice of law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">{\u00b6 2} Even though McGinnis had initially met and communicated with relator regarding the allegations against her, she did not answer the complaint, and relator moved for an entry of default. Based on the affidavits submitted with relator\u2019s motion, a three-member panel of the Board on the Unauthorized Practice of Law issued findings of fact and conclusions of law and determined that McGinnis had violated Ohio\u2019s licensure requirements. The panel recommended that we enjoin McGinnis from committing further illegal acts and assess a $20,000 civil penalty. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings and recommended penalty, and no objections have been filed to the board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">{\u00b6 3} We agree that McGinnis engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and that an injunction is warranted. However, consistent with our precedent in comparable unauthorized-practice-of-law cases, we assess a $6,000 civil penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">McGinnis\u2019s Unauthorized Practice of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">{\u00b6 4} Based on the sworn affidavits in the record, the board found that McGinnis had prepared an answer on behalf of grievant, Stephen Johnson, for an eviction action in the Cleveland Municipal Court, prepared a notice of appeal on Johnson\u2019s behalf for his appeal in that eviction case, and accepted $40 from Johnson for transportation and parking fees to attend hearings with him. In addition, McGinnis gave Johnson a flyer reading: \u201cForrestine\u2019s Law, Inc. Avoid expensive attorney fees 216-351-XXXX.\u201d Johnson claims that he also saw the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>flyer posted at a local library. Based on these findings, the board determined that McGinnis had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">{\u00b6 5} We agree. The unauthorized practice of law is defined as \u201c[t]he rendering of legal services for another by any person not admitted to practice in Ohio.\u201d Gov.Bar R. VII(2)(A)(1); <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Pearlman, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 136, 2005-Ohio-4107, 832 N.E.2d 1193, \u00b6 7. The rendering of legal services includes \u201cthe drafting and preparation of pleadings filed in the courts of Ohio.\u201d <em>Lorain Cty. Bar Assn. v. Kocak, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 396, 2009-Ohio-1430, 904 N.E.2d 885, \u00b6 17; <em>see also Geauga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Haig, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 601, 2011-Ohio-4271, 955 N.E.2d 352, \u00b6 2 (unauthorized practice of law includes \u201cthe preparation of legal documents for others\u201d). In addition, the unauthorized practice of law includes \u201c[h]olding out to the public or otherwise representing oneself as authorized to practice law in Ohio by a person not authorized to practice law.\u201d Gov.Bar R. VII(2)(A)(4). The term \u201cholding out\u201d means the use of \u201claw\u201d or \u201claw office\u201d by any person who is not licensed to practice law in connection with a sign, advertisement, circular, or other document, \u201cthe evident purpose of which is to induce others to believe that person to be an attorney.\u201d R.C. 4705.07(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 6} McGinnis did not possess the qualifications necessary to practice law in this state, yet a preponderance of the evidence shows that she prepared two legal pleadings for filing in court and distributed a flyer advertising her services as \u201cForrestine\u2019s Law, Inc.\u201d Accordingly, we accept the board\u2019s findings that McGinnis has engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">{\u00b6 7} Having found that McGinnis engaged in-the unauthorized practice of law, we accept the board\u2019s recommendation that we issue an injunction prohibiting her from preparing legal documents for others, holding herself out as authorized to practice law, and engaging in all other acts constituting the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">{\u00b6 8} We also accept the recommendation that we impose a civil penalty. Under Gov.Bar R. VII(19)(D)(1)(c), we may impose a civil penalty \u201cfor an amount greater or less than the amount recommended by the Board, but not to exceed ten thousand dollars per offense.\u201d The board recommends that we impose a $5,000 civil penalty for each pleading that McGinnis prepared and the $10,000 maximum penalty for McGinnis\u2019s flyer, for a total of $20,000. Based on McGinnis\u2019s misconduct here, the relevant factors in Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B), and our precedent, we find that McGinnis should be fined $1,000 for each pleading and $4,000 for the flyer, for a total of $6,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">\n<em>Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B) factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">{\u00b6 9} Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B) requires us to consider the following five factors in imposing a civil penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>{\u00b6 10} (1) Degree of cooperation. McGinnis initially communicated and even met with relator during the early stages of its investigation. But after agreeing to a deposition date, she failed to appear, and she later failed to participate in the board proceedings. In addition, McGinnis\u2019s communications with relator were not always coherent and included many astrological references that were not directly responsive to relator\u2019s inquiries. For example, in one correspondence, she declared that she had received relator\u2019s letter \u201cwhen two planets were in opposition to my North Node.\u201d In another letter, she stated that she had forwarded relator\u2019s communications to her \u201ctribunal for a diagnoses of any and all infarctions [sic] that I\u2019ve committed against the United Nations declarations on human, indigenous, and stateless people rights.\u201d And in response to relator\u2019s request for documents relating to her research, she submitted a document entitled \u201cPerpetual Universal Charter of the Moabite Nation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">{\u00b6 11} (2) Number of violations. As explained above, McGinnis committed three acts constituting the unauthorized practice of law: (1) the preparation of an answer for filing in court, (2) the preparation of a notice of appeal for filing in court, and (3) holding herself out in a flyer as authorized to practice law. The acts were not widespread, as all three related to one individual \u2014 grievant Johnson \u2014 and the two pleadings were filed in his eviction action.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">{\u00b6 12} (3) and (4) Flagrancy of the violations and harm to third parties. In its analysis, the board considered these two factors particularly relevant, finding that McGinnis \u201ccontinued to market her services as a person qualified to practice law in Ohio even after commencement of this action,\u201d \u201cJohnson\u2019s legal rights were undoubtedly affected when [McGinnis] prepared pleadings on his behalf,\u201d and \u201c[McGinnis] may have at least one other client on whose behalf she engages in the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d In reaching these conclusions, the board did not cite the record, and we are unable to find conclusive evidence in the record demonstrating that McGinnis continued her illegal acts after commencement of this action or that she has another \u201cclient.\u201d Based on the sworn record evidence, McGinnis\u2019s offenses affected only Johnson, and his affidavit states that McGinnis handled his appeal, \u201cwhich she did wrong.\u201d But Johnson did not further explain how McGinnis\u2019s actions harmed him or affected his legal rights. Without more evidence, it is difficult for us to weigh these two factors in considering either a harsher or a more lenient civil penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">{\u00b6 13} (5) Other relevant factors. The board\u2019s regulations list aggravating and mitigating factors that may be used in weighing Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B)\u2019s final catchall factor. UPL Reg. 400(F). We find that in aggravation, McGinnis prepared two legal instruments for filing with a court and allowed others to mistakenly believe that she was admitted to practice law. <em>See </em>UPL Reg. 400(F)(3)(f) and (g). In mitigation, in McGinnis\u2019s letters, she admitted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>conduct under review by acknowledging that she had prepared Johnson\u2019s answer for his municipal court case. <em>See </em>UPL Reg. 400(F)(4)(b). However, we do not give much weight to this mitigating factor as McGinnis also declared that \u201c[t]he practice of law can not be licensed by any State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\n<em>Applicable precedent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b6 14} We generally reserve the $10,000 maximum civil penalty for the most egregious acts constituting the unauthorized practice of law. For example, in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Pratt, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 293, 2010-Ohio-6210, 939 N.E.2d 170, we imposed the maximum penalty for each of six acts occurring over a two-year period, including the respondent\u2019s representations to multiple people that he was a licensed attorney, his acceptance of over $72,000 in legal fees, and his performance of various legal services, including drafting and reviewing contracts and negotiating a settlement. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4-15, 19. In <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Dalton, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 514, 2010-Ohio-619, 924 N.E.2d 821, we imposed the maximum penalty of $10,000 \u2014 $20,000 for two acts \u2014 on a title agent who, in addition to refusing to cooperate in the board proceedings, prepared and filed two deeds and forged an attorney\u2019s name on one. And in <em>Cleveland Metro. Bar Assn. v. Boyd, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 36, 2009-Ohio-305, 901 N.E.2d 795, we imposed the maximum penalty of $10,000 \u2014 $20,000 for two acts \u2014 for preparing and filing complaints in two separate domestic-relations actions, receiving a fee for those services, and failing to participate in the board proceedings. And Boyd was a repeat offender; the fact that he \u201cflagrantly continued to engage in the unauthorized practice of law despite our order enjoining [his] conduct\u201d contributed to the assessment of the maximum $20,000 penalty. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 15} In contrast, we routinely assess a lower penalty when the acts are less frequent, less flagrant, or involve fewer victims \u2014 even in cases in which the respondent does not appear or fully cooperate in the board proceeding. For example, in <em>Lorain Cty. Bar Assn. v. Kocak, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 396, 2009-Ohio-1430, 904 N.E.2d 885, the respondent prepared, filed, and signed numerous legal documents in a debt-collection action, in both the trial court and the appellate court, and he continued to engage in this conduct despite admonitions from those courts. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 20. Nonetheless, we reduced the board\u2019s recommended maximum penalty of $20,000 to $10,000 \u2014 $5,000 for his appearances and copious filings in each court \u2014 because the respondent\u2019s actions were on behalf of his fianc\u00e9e and not likely to be repeated. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. In <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Heath, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 483, 2009-Ohio-5958, 918 N.E.2d 145, the respondent prepared documents threatening legal action on behalf of a friend and also prepared, filed, and signed a series of legal papers in municipal court for this friend. The respondent defended himself against the relator\u2019s charges with \u201cunfounded and often nonsensical arguments,\u201d such as referring to his name as a \u201cfiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 2, 32. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>nonetheless reduced the board\u2019s recommended penalty of $15,000 to $1,000 because the respondent was merely trying to help a friend, he had not charged the friend, and he stated that he had ceased all unlicensed practice of law. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 30-33. Similarly, in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Kafele, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 283, 2006-Ohio-904, 843 N.E.2d 169, the respondent filed and signed numerous \u201cirregular\u201d legal documents in a mortgage-foreclosure action on behalf of a limited-liability company. The respondent participated in the board proceeding but refused to testify and argued mistaken identity. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8, 13. We reduced the board\u2019s recommended penalty of $10,000 to $1,000 based on the relatively few acts of unauthorized legal practice and the little harm caused by his conduct, and because the respondent did not perform the acts for profit. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">{\u00b6 16} Finally, it must be noted that even in default proceedings, we have not always imposed a civil penalty for the unauthorized preparation of legal pleadings. For example, in <em>Geauga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Haig, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 601, 2011-Ohio-4271, 955 N.E.2d 352, a loan officer prepared four answers and three motions on behalf of customers in two foreclosure cases. We refrained from imposing a penalty because the respondent\u2019s actions did not cause any harm and in a letter to the relator, he had admitted his actions and explained that he was unaware that he was violating the law. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 17} Having reviewed the record, the Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B) factors, and the penalties imposed in comparable unauthorized-practice-of-law cases, we find that the board\u2019s recommended penalty is too high and inconsistent with our precedent. Unlike the respondents in many of the cases cited above, McGinnis engaged in relatively few acts constituting the unauthorized practice of law. She prepared only two legal documents, and they were both for the same person in his eviction action. And it does not appear that she completed the documents for profit, because she received only $40 to cover her transportation and parking costs. Consistent with <em>Heath </em>and <em>Kafele, </em>we find that a $1,000 penalty for each pleading is appropriate. McGinnis\u2019s flyer, however, suggests that she attempted to commit illegal acts on behalf of others, and a harsher penalty is warranted to discourage this kind of conduct. We find that a $4,000 penalty is appropriate for this act of unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 18} Accordingly, we enjoin McGinnis from engaging in any further acts that constitute the unauthorized practice of law, and we also impose a civil penalty against McGinnis in the amount of $6,000. Costs and expenses are taxed to McGinnis.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b380-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lanzinger, Kennedy, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b381-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>John A.
