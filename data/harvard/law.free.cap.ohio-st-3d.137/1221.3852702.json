Proudfoot <em>v. </em>Proudfoot.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"b811-6\">[Cite as <em>In re Disqualification of Harwood, </em>137 Ohio St.3d 1221, 2013-Ohio-5256.]</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b811-9\">(No. 13-AP-091</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Abv\">Decided October 10, 2013.)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b811-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">{\u00b6 1} Margaret Kreiner, counsel for the plaintiff, has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge Sandra Stabile Harwood from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. 13-DR-74, a divorce action pending in the domestic relations division of the Court of Common Pleas of Trumbull County.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">{\u00b6 2} Kreiner alleges that Judge Harwood should be disqualified because at recent prehearing and status conferences, the judge demonstrated bias in favor of defense counsel, indicated an intention to award the family home to the defendant, engaged in an improper ex parte communication, and expressed an unwillingness to continue adjudicating the case with Kreiner as counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-14\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Harwood has responded in writing to Kreiner\u2019s affidavit, denying any impropriety and averring that despite the allegations against her, she can decide the underlying case fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-15\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Harwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-16\">{\u00b6 5} A \u201cpresumption of impartiality\u201d is \u201caccorded all judges\u201d in affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings. <em>In re Disqualification of Celebrezze, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1224, 2003-Ohio-7352, 803 N.E.2d 823, \u00b6 7. In addition, the burden in these cases falls on the affiant to submit sufficient evidence demonstrating that disqualification is warranted. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1). \u201cGenerally, an affiant is required to submit evidence beyond the affidavit of disqualification supporting the allegations contained therein.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Baronzzi, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1212, 2012-Ohio-6341, 985 N.E.2d 494, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Here, Kreiner\u2019s affidavit and Judge Harwood\u2019s response indicate that they remember the events at the recent prehearing and status conferences very differently. For example, Kreiner claims that Judge Harwood told her to \u201cshut up\u201d and that the judge did \u201cnot want to see [Kreiner] again.\u201d Judge Harwood states that this allegation is \u201ctotally false\u201d and an \u201coutright lie.\u201d Kreiner alleges that Judge Harwood engaged in an improper ex parte communication with defense counsel. Judge Harwood states that this charge is \u201ccompletely false\u201d and that Kreiner\u2019s perception is \u201ctotally inaccurate\u201d because the judge did not discuss any issue with counsel outside of Kreiner\u2019s presence. And Kreiner alleges that Judge Harwood has indicated that she will award the family home to defendant regardless of the facts in the case. According to Judge Harwood, this allegation is \u201ctotally and completely false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">{\u00b6 7} Kreiner offers only her affidavit to support her allegations, although she indicates that other people witnessed the alleged judicial misconduct, including Kreiner\u2019s associate and paralegal. Given the conflicting evidence in the record\u2014 and Kreiner\u2019s failure to substantiate her allegations with third-party affidavits or other evidence \u2014 Kreiner has failed to set forth sufficiently compelling evidence to overcome the presumption that Judge Harwood is fair and impartial. <em>See, e.g., Baronzzi </em>at \u00b6 8 (affiant\u2019s \u201cvague and unsubstantiated allegations \u2014 especially in the face of clear denials by Judge Baronzzi \u2014 are insufficient to overcome the presumption that Judge Baronzzi is fair and impartial\u201d); <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2004-Ohio-7354, 826 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 8 (\u201cIn the wake of the conflicting stories presented by the various affiants, however, I cannot conclude that the judge is clearly biased and prejudiced * * * \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">{\u00b6 8} Kreiner also claims that Judge Harwood is biased in favor of defense counsel because the judge allowed defense counsel to proceed first with her arguments at the prehearing conference and because the judge \u201cscolded\u201d Kreiner for attempting to point out contested facts while defense counsel was speaking. For her part, Judge Harwood acknowledges allowing defense counsel to present her arguments first at the pretrial conference, but the judge further explains that she conducts such conferences informally, with no procedure as to which side speaks first. Judge Harwood also admits scolding and reprimanding Kreiner for interrupting opposing counsel but denies that these admonitions were the result of bias against Kreiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">{\u00b6 9} Contrary to Kreiner\u2019s contention, \u201c[t]rial judges are entitled to exercise considerable discretion in the management of the cases on their dockets,\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Sutula, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1237, 2004-Ohio-7351, 826 N.E.2d 297, \u00b6 4, and it is not the role of the chief justice in deciding affidavits of disqualification to second-guess such matters. Here, Judge Harwood\u2019s alleged failure to conduct the pretrial conference in the manner in which Kreiner would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>preferred does not reflect bias on the judge\u2019s part. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, judges are entitled to express dissatisfaction with an attorney\u2019s conduct, especially if the judge perceives that a litigant is acting unprofessionally. That dissatisfaction, however, \u201c \u2018can and should be expressed in a way that promotes public confidence in the integrity, dignity, and impartiality of the judiciary.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Bates, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1249, 2012-Ohio-6342, 984 N.E.2d 17, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2004-Ohio-7354, 826 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 10. On this record, Judge Harwood\u2019s admonitions to Kreiner do not establish bias or prejudice mandating her disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">{\u00b6 10} In the end, \u201c[t]he statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. * * * A judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">{\u00b6 11} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Harwood.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
