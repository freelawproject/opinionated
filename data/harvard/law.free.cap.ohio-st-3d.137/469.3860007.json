More specifically, we must address whether the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate that appellee, Mount Vernon City School District Board of Education (\u201cthe board\u201d or \u201cthe district\u201d), terminated Freshwater for insubordination in refusing to remove religious displays in his classroom after being told to do so, and for continuing to inject his personal religious beliefs into his plan and pattern of instruction, thereby exceeding the bounds of the school district\u2019s bylaws and policies, even after being forbidden to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">{\u00b6 2} After detailed review of the voluminous record in this case, we hold that the court of appeals did not err in affirming the termination. The trial court properly found that the record supports, by clear and convincing evidence, Freshwater\u2019s termination for insubordination in failing to comply with orders to remove religious materials from his classroom. Accordingly, based on our resolution of this threshold issue, we need not reach the constitutional issue of whether Freshwater impermissibly imposed his religious beliefs in his classroom. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals because there was ample evidence of insubordination to justify the termination decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">{\u00b6 3} Mount Vernon School Board asserts that despite the district\u2019s instructions to cease doing so, Freshwater unequivocally injected his own Christian faith into his classroom as early as 1994 and continued to do so right up until he was relieved of his teaching duties. The board also asserts that after it denied Freshwater\u2019s 2003 teaching proposal to critically evaluate evolution, Freshwater surreptitiously supplemented his eighth-grade science curriculum with religious handouts, showed videos on creationism and intelligent design, displayed religious materials in his classroom, and made various statements in class referring to the Bible.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">{\u00b6 4} Freshwater, on the other hand, argues that the board violated his right to academic freedom pursuant to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution when it terminated him based on the content or viewpoint of his curriculum-related academic discussions with students and his use of supplemental academic materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>{\u00b6 5} We agree with the board and find that there is ample support for Freshwater\u2019s termination based upon insubordination. We resolve this case solely as a teacher-employment-termination case governed by R.C. 3319.16, which sets forth standards and procedures for termination of teaching contracts by boards of education. We need not address the various constitutional issues raised by Freshwater, because we resolve this appeal on an other-than-constitutional ground. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Essig v. Blackwell, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 481, 2004-Ohio-5586, 817 N.E.2d 5, \u00b6 34, citing <em>State ex rel. DeBrosse v. Cool, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 1, 7, 716 N.E.2d 1114 (1999) (\u201cCourts decide constitutional issues only when absolutely necessary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">\n<em>Early Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 6} The legal battle in this case began largely in 2007, when a student and his parents alleged that Freshwater used a Tesla coil<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in class to make a mark on the student\u2019s arm. But the antecedents of this case go back to 1994, when district administrators first instructed Freshwater not to distribute materials informing his students about a religious seminar. And district officials advised and counseled Freshwater multiple times about similar behavior in the 15 years that followed, directing him not to incorporate religious documents based upon creationism or intelligent design into his classroom instruction and to remove displays of religious materials from the classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 7} The voluminous record here establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that Freshwater has been insubordinate in the course of his employment with the district. For purposes of this appeal, however, we are specifically concerned with the occurrences of 2007 forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">{\u00b6 8} Thus, we find it necessary to review in detail the evidence presented in the hearing conducted by a referee considering whether termination was warranted and summarized in the referee\u2019s report issued after the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">\n<em>Background to the Referee\u2019s Report and the Evidence at the Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">{\u00b6 9} After the hearing, which involved 38 different days of witness testimony spread out over almost 21 months, included more than 80 witnesses and hundreds of exhibits, and ultimately resulted in over 6,000 pages of transcript, the referee issued a report on January 7, 2011. In his report, the referee set forth the facts, including an overview of Freshwater\u2019s sometimes contentious teaching record.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>{\u00b6 10} The referee addressed the four grounds asserted by the board in considering Freshwater\u2019s termination: (1) the Tesla-coil incident, (2) his failure to adhere to established curriculum, (3) his role as administration-appointed facilitator, monitor, and supervisor of the student group Fellowship of Christian Athletes (\u201cFCA\u201d), and (4) his disobedience of orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 11} The referee ultimately concluded in his report that grounds two and four were valid bases to support Freshwater\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\n<em>Freshwater\u2019s teaching record and evaluations contain references to his incorporation of creationism and intelligent design in his classroom instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">{\u00b6 12} In 1987, the board hired Freshwater as an eighth-grade science teacher. In addition to his teaching duties, Freshwater served as the administration-appointed facilitator, monitor, and supervisor of the FCA for more than 15 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">{\u00b6 13} Freshwater\u2019s students at Mount Vernon Middle School often performed at or above the state\u2019s standards and requirements in achievement testing. Dr. Lynda Weston, former director of teaching and learning for the district, testified that Freshwater\u2019s students\u2019 science scores on state standardized tests were \u201cthe highest of the three eighth grade science teachers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">{\u00b6 14} William Oxenford, a seventh-grade science teacher at Mount Vernon Middle School, also served as an academic-achievement coach. In the latter capacity, Oxenford was responsible for coordinating the implementation of strategies that would assist students in passing the achievement test. He confirmed that Freshwater\u2019s students had the highest performance level on achievements tests of the students taught by the three eighth-grade science teachers. Similarly, Kerri Mahan, a teacher at Mount Vernon Middle School who also served on the \u201cdata team\u201d, for improving standardized-test performance, testified that Freshwater\u2019s students \u201cshowed proficiency and achievement\u201d on those tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">{\u00b6 15} During his employment with the district, Freshwater received at least 20 performance evaluations. Almost all were positive. In fact, Freshwater had never been disciplined before the precipitating events. But Freshwater\u2019s teaching career certainly was not without controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">{\u00b6 16} Freshwater\u2019s evaluations and communications from his superiors repeatedly directed him to cease distributing documents that presented students with information about intelligent design and creationism. Freshwater was admonished a number of times to abide by the board\u2019s policy forbidding the teaching of religious thought in the curriculum.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">{\u00b6 17} The first of these incidents occurred on September 19, 1994, when Freshwater received a memorandum from Jeff Kuntz, then the principal at Mount Vernon Middle School, regarding Freshwater\u2019s distribution to students of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>a handout entitled \u201cAnswers In Genesis\u201d giving information about an upcoming seminar. The handout discussed in the memorandum described a <em>\u201cfree </em>meeting * * * for students * * * [to] learn the evidence that supports creation \u2014 and denies evolution.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) The handout also stated that the seminar would \u201creveal why it is vital to believe in Genesis as it is written * * * [and] declare that many of the important issues in our troubled society (the breakdown of the family, abortion, lawlessness, etc.) are related to evolution!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">{\u00b6 18} In the memorandum, Kuntz instructed Freshwater to \u201cplease refrain from distributing materials not supported by your adopted course of study to students. Your classroom is not an appropriate format for disseminating information on religious seminars to students. In addition, please withdraw any extra credit you awarded to students who attended the \u2018Answers In Genesis\u2019 seminar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 19} The record contains limited information of any occurrences for a number of years that followed, with no additional counseling or intervention regarding Freshwater documented until January 21, 2003. That day, Freshwater received a mostly positive evaluation from Kuntz, who noted specifically that \u201cMr. Freshwater utilizes a good variety of methods and materials in his classroom.\u201d But Kuntz also noted, under the section of the evaluation marked \u201cGrowth/Improvement Areas,\u201d that Freshwater should \u201c[c]ontinue to adhere to board policy and guidelines 2270 with respect to Religion In The Curriculum (see attached).\u201d Kuntz attached the board\u2019s policy and guidelines to Freshwater\u2019s evaluation and later testified that he did so because of \u201ctwo different situations\u201d that had occurred in the fall of 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">{\u00b6 20} The first situation Kuntz referred to evidently arose when some teachers from the high school, in particular one science teacher, spoke to Kuntz about her concern that she was having to \u201creteach\u201d evolution to students in her high-school classes. That teacher believed that Freshwater was contributing to that problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">{\u00b6 21} The second incident Kuntz referred to arose from a complaint from a parent concerning a handout that Freshwater had distributed. Notably, however, at the hearing, Kuntz could not \u201cexactly\u201d recall the handout or its content.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">{\u00b6 22} Although the record does not reveal whether these complaints had merit, Kuntz decided to act because two complaints had been voiced within a reasonably short period of time and he felt that he could not ignore them. Therefore, Kuntz attached the board policy and guidelines on religion in the curriculum because he felt it was a \u201cvery appropriate\u201d way to make a statement to Freshwater that was relevant to the concerns raised in the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">{\u00b6 23} The record establishes two patterns in Freshwater\u2019s teaching career from 1994 through 2002 \u2014 he repeatedly received positive evaluations of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>teaching, and he repeatedly was advised not to distribute materials about creationism and intelligent design to students.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\n<em>Freshwater\u2019s proposal to \u201ccritically examine\u201d evolution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">{\u00b6 24} Despite receiving prior instructions not to provide students with religious information, Freshwater submitted a proposal to the board in 2003 entitled \u201cObjective Origins Science Policy.\u201d In that proposal, Freshwater requested that the board \u201c[a]dd a policy statement to the MVCS [Mount Vernon City Schools] science curricula that allows teachers/students to critically examine the evidence both for and against evolution.\u201d More specifically, Freshwater asserted that one problem with teaching evolution was that \u201cthe Mount Vernon City Schools do not offer a place in the curricula to scientifically and critically examine this theory\u201d and that \u201cthere is confusion among some MVCS science teachers over whether they are even allowed to encourage critical scientific thinking on evolution, even though it is considered excellent scientific reasoning to do so with any other controversial science theories (such as the particle versus wave theories on light).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">{\u00b6 25} The board rejected Freshwater\u2019s proposal. Its rejection was consistent with the State Board of Education\u2019s subsequent decision to strike language similar to Freshwater\u2019s proposal from the state of Ohio\u2019s Academic Content Standards for K-12 science. When first adopted, those standards required schools to teach students to critically evaluate evolution, which is primarily taught in the eighth and tenth grades in Ohio\u2019s public schools. Specifically, part of the relevant benchmark for grades nine and ten then provided, \u201cDescribe how scientists continue to investigate and critically analyze aspects of evolutionary theory. (The intent of this benchmark does not mandate the teaching or testing of intelligent design.)\u201d The accompanying achievement indicator for grade ten tracked this language. But on February 14, 2006, the State Board of Education modified the above-mentioned benchmark and indicator to remove the foregoing language from its standards. Thus, the state no longer required or encouraged schools to teach students to critically evaluate evolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">{\u00b6 26} But neither the board\u2019s denial of his proposal nor the State Board of Education\u2019s decision dissuaded Freshwater from teaching as if his proposal had been adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">{\u00b6 27} On April 7, 2006, Paul Souhrada, a parent of one of Freshwater\u2019s students, submitted a complaint form to the district. In it, Souhrada alleged that on April 4, 2006, Freshwater distributed a handout to his son\u2019s class entitled \u201cDarwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution \u2014 The Premise and the Problem.\u201d Although Freshwater apparently collected the handouts at the end of class, Souhrada\u2019s son kept his and gave it to his father. Souhrada checked the source of the information contained in the handout. In his complaint, he wrote that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>handout came from \u201cAll About God Ministries\u201d and stated, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that is a proper source for science material, especially in light of the state school board\u2019s decision in February to strike language regarding the critical evaluation of evolution from the state guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">{\u00b6 28} Six weeks later, on May 26, 2006, Charles Adkins, a science teacher at Mount Vernon Middle School, and Richard Cunningham, the science-department chairperson at Mount Vernon High School, wrote an e-mail to Weston and the district\u2019s superintendent at the time, R. Jeff Maley, in response to Maley\u2019s request that the school district review the handout mentioned in Souhrada\u2019s complaint. Adkins and Cunningham stated that they had investigated the possible sources of the handout and examined the associated media related to the topic and had determined that the handout, as well as the original source of the material, had not passed the test of scientific peer review and acceptance by the scientific establishment. Neither of them was able to attribute this handout to a particular author, but they opined that the handout appeared in part or in its entirety on several intelligent-design websites.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">{\u00b6 29} After reviewing the complaint and researching the handout, Adkins and Cunningham met with Weston and Freshwater so that Freshwater could provide background information regarding the handout\u2019s alignment with the Ohio content standards, benchmarks, and indicators. Adkins and Cunningham wrote in the email to Maley that Freshwater\u2019s \u201cexplanation [did] not match the direction or the tone of the article.\u201d They also concluded that the \u201chandout is inappropriate as an instructional resource for the grade level content benchmarks and indicators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">{\u00b6 30} On June 8, 2006, Maley directed Freshwater, in writing, to cease use of the handout and similar materials. Maley wrote,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">After review, I have determined the material in question cannot be attributed to a particular author or source. The material has not passed the test of scientific review and acceptance of the established scientific community. I am directing you to delete the material from your supplemental resources. Also, in the future please refrain from using materials that the source or author cannot be readily identified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Maley subsequently emphasized that his main concern with the material was that it did not have a source and that the failure to provide sources was \u201cbad practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">{\u00b6 31} Despite this warning and the prior incidents in which Freshwater had been warned not to distribute religious materials, there is no indication in the record suggesting that the district took adverse action against Freshwater for his practice of failing to cite sources in supplemental materials or his prior transgres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>sions. But the following school year, new allegations arose that raised serious questions about Freshwater\u2019s compliance with the directives of Superintendent Maley and his continued status with the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">\n<em>The allegations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">{\u00b6 32} On December 7, 2007, Stephen and Jenifer Dennis met with Stephen Short, then the interim superintendent for the district. Their son was one of Freshwater\u2019s eighth-grade science students and a participant in the FCA. The Dennises complained that on the day before, December 6, 2007, Freshwater used a Tesla coil to make a mark on their son\u2019s arm that appeared to be in the shape of a cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">{\u00b6 33} On December 10, 2007, Short met with William White, Mount Vernon Middle School principal, to investigate and determine what had taken place in Freshwater\u2019s classroom. Later that same day, White met with Freshwater to discuss the incident. Freshwater admitted to White that he had used the Tesla coil on students during class and that he had used it to put an \u201cX\u201d on the Dennises\u2019 son\u2019s arm. But he also testified that he did not see that he had made any significant lasting mark on the student, let alone a mark in the shape of a cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">{\u00b6 34} On January 22, 2008, White wrote a letter to Freshwater as a follow-up to their conversation on December 10. White stated that \u201cthe electrostatic machine(s) should not be used for purposes of shocking students\u201d and \u201cthe machine(s) should be removed from the classroom or locked up so that the students do not have access to\u201d them. White testified that after sending the letter to Freshwater, he never heard a single word or further complaint from the Dennises about the mark on their son\u2019s arm until the Dennises filed suit against the board in April 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">{\u00b6 35} But in the intervening period, White heard several other concerns about Freshwater from the Dennises. For example, the Dennises complained about the manner in which Freshwater advised the FCA. They alleged that Freshwater was operating in an improper leadership role by directly participating in the organization\u2019s affairs rather than simply monitoring it. Direct faculty participation in the organization was a violation of the FCA\u2019s rules, which require that FCA clubs must be voluntary, student-initiated, and student-led.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">{\u00b6 36} The district was also aware that Freshwater allegedly was not enforcing the required permission-slip policy for FCA events, was contacting speakers himself rather than having the students do so, and allegedly had conducted a healing session for a speaker who appeared at an FCA event who had been ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">{\u00b6 37} The Dennises also complained that Freshwater had religious materials in the classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>{\u00b6 38} On April 7, 2008, White met with Freshwater about these issues. White then instructed Freshwater, in clear and unequivocal writing, that Freshwater could not display religious materials in his classroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">With regard to religious materials in your classroom, it has been brought to my attention that you have a bible out on your desk and that the \u201ccollage\u201d on your classroom window includes the 10 commandments. While you certainly may read your bible on your own, duty free time [i.e. during lunch], it- cannot be sitting out on your desk when students are in the classroom and when you are supposed to be engaged in your responsibilities as a teacher. As for the 10 commandments, that part of your collage must be taken down and replaced with something that is not religious in nature. As a public school teacher, you cannot engage in any activity that promotes or denigrates a particular religion or religious beliefs while on board property, during any school activity or while you are \u201con duty\u201d as a teacher. Unless a particular discussion about religion or religious decorations or symbols is part of a Board approved curriculum, you may not engage in religious discussions with students while at school or keep religious materials displayed in the classroom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">{\u00b6 39} On April 11, 2008, White once again met with Freshwater regarding the need to remove overtly religious icons and materials from display in his classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">{\u00b6 40} And on April 14, 2008, White yet again gave written instructions \u201cto follow up\u201d on his prior meetings, conversations, and writings with Freshwater regarding religious items in Freshwater\u2019s classroom. White\u2019s letter directed that \u201call religious items need to be removed from your classroom by the end of the day on Wednesday, April 16, 2008. Bibles and other religious DVD\u2019s, videos, etc. should also be placed out of sight and access of the students by this date.\u201d Freshwater signed the letter as acknowledgment of his receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">{\u00b6 41} But evidently, Freshwater was far from compliant. Despite having been directed repeatedly to remove the Bible and other religious items from his classroom, Freshwater proceeded to the school\u2019s library, where he checked out two books, <em>Jesus of Nazareth </em>and the <em>Oxford Bible. </em>He then displayed them on a lab table in his classroom rather than keeping them from his students\u2019 sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">{\u00b6 42} And on April 16, 2008, the date by which he had been ordered to remove religious material from his classroom, Freshwater submitted a written statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>refusing to remove the Bible from his classroom.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">{\u00b6 43} As these events were unfolding, the Dennises\u2019 attorney was formulating a letter to Short regarding what the Dennises believed to be \u201cseveral instances of violations of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\u201d The letter, dated April 14, 2008, set forth eight alleged violations in bulletpoint fashion, including the Tesla-coil incident and regarding Freshwater\u2019s behavior during FCA activities. As to one violation, the Dennises alleged that the Ten Commandments were displayed in Freshwater\u2019s classroom and several Bibles were also kept in the classroom as a display to his students, not for his personal use. The Dennises averred, \u201cThis display represents an ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing religion and violates that central Establishment Clause value of official religious neutrality.\u201d This allegation was supported by citing <em>McCreary Cty., Kentucky v. Am. Civ. Liberties Union of Kentucky, </em>545 U.S. 844, 125 S.Ct. 2722, 162 L.Ed.2d 729 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">{\u00b6 44} The Dennises also claimed that Freshwater teaches his personal beliefs, from the Bible, in his eighth-grade science class. According to the Dennises, students were taught the meaning of Easter and Good Friday in their science class. The Dennises further asserted that whenever Freshwater disagrees, based upon his own religious beliefs, with teaching material, he advises the students that although he is forced to teach from the textbooks, the teachings are wrong or not proven according to the Bible.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">{\u00b6 45} In their letter, the Dennises requested three remedies: (1) the immediate removal of the Bibles and the Ten Commandments display, (2) Freshwater\u2019s removal from both the classroom and his leadership role in the FCA as well as the commencement of an investigation regarding his violation of the laws of this country and the policies of the district, and (3) an agreement by the district to correct the concerns they raised and to follow the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">{\u00b6 46} Counsel for the Dennises sent a follow-up letter on April 21, 2008, alleging a ninth violation by Freshwater. That letter alleged that since the date of the April 14, 2008 letter, Freshwater had continued to teach religion in his classroom, including the assignment of extra-credit work regarding intelligent design. Counsel wrote that it was obvious that Freshwater had not ceased his religious teachings and that the district nevertheless continued to allow Freshwater to teach eighth-grade science.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\n<em>Investigation by H.R. On Call, Inc.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">{\u00b6 47} In response to the Dennises\u2019 claims, the district engaged an independent investigator, H.R. On Call, Inc. (\u201cHROC\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to investigate the allegations. Beginning on April 23, 2008, and continuing through the end of the school year, a monitor sat in Freshwater\u2019s classroom and took notes of classroom observations and of statements made in class. HROC investigated the Dennises\u2019 nine concerns, along with the complaint from April 2006 regarding the handout on Darwin that Freshwater had used in class, by interviewing the Dennises\u2019 child, former and current students, and 18 teachers and administrators, including Weston.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">{\u00b6 48} In its summary of findings, HROC found that Freshwater\u2019s teaching of evolution was not consistent with the district\u2019s curriculum and state standards. Specifically, HROC found that Freshwater taught creationism or intelligent design and the unreliability of carbon dating as reasons to support opposing evolution and that he discussed the meaning of Easter and Good Friday with his students. Moreover, HROC found that Freshwater distributed materials from religious sources challenging evolution and then collected the materials back from the students in spite of specific directives not to teach religion, creationism, or intelligent design. In addition, HROC recounted evidence that Freshwater had told students that \u201cscience is wrong because the Bible states that homosexuality is a sin.\u201d HROC concluded that Freshwater taught his religious beliefs in his classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">{\u00b6 49} HROC also found that Freshwater gave an extra-credit assignment for students to view the movie <em>Expelled, </em>which is about intelligent design.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">{\u00b6 50} HROC\u2019s report included a finding that Freshwater was insubordinate by failing to remove all religious materials from his classroom as ordered by his superior, Principal White.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">{\u00b6 51} HROC issued its 15-page report on June 19, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">\n<em>Board resolutions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">{\u00b6 52} On June 20, 2008, the board unanimously passed a resolution titled \u201cIntent to Consider the Termination of the Teaching Contract of John Freshwater.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">{\u00b6 53} The board resolution set forth four grounds for Freshwater\u2019s termination: (1) the Tesla-coil incident, (2) his failure to adhere to established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>curriculum, (3) his role as facilitator, monitor, and supervisor of the FCA, and (4) his disobedience of orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\n<em>Referee\u2019s Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">{\u00b6 54} On June 30, 2008, Freshwater requested a public hearing pursuant to R.C. 3319.16. That request was honored, and the protracted hearing ensued. In his subsequent report and findings, the referee addressed the four specified grounds for Freshwater\u2019s termination as set forth above in the board\u2019s resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">\n<em>Ground One: Tesla-coil incident</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">{\u00b6 55} The referee found that the Tesla-coil incident \u201cbecame the focus of the curious * * * and print media\u201d due to the sensational and provocative nature of the allegation. He also found that once sworn testimony was presented regarding the incident, it became obvious that \u201cspeculation and imagination had pushed reality aside.\u201d He found that the Tesla-coil issue was at an end as soon as White instructed Freshwater to stop using it. Freshwater did in fact stop using the Tesla coil for any purpose thereafter. Thus, the referee found that the Tesla-coil incident did not seem to be a proper subject for the amended resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">\n<em>Ground Two: Freshwater\u2019s failure to adhere to established curriculum</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AFAe\">{\u00b6 56} The referee found that Freshwater injected his personal religious beliefs into his plan and pattern of instruction of his students. According to the referee, in so doing Freshwater exceeded the bounds of all pertinent board policies and bylaws, including \u201cReligion in the Curriculum,\u201d \u201cControversial Issues,\u201d \u201cReligious/Patriotic Ceremonies and Observances,\u201d \u201cReligious Expression in the District,\u201d and \u201cAcademic Freedom of Teachers.\u201d The referee found that Freshwater instructed his students to examine evidence both for and against evolution, as if his proposed policy for doing so had been adopted by the board, and that Freshwater presented evidence against evolution by passing out and collecting handouts and showing videos. The evidence against evolution was based upon the Christian religious principles of creationism and intelligent design, running afoul of the board\u2019s policies entitled \u201cReligion in the Curriculum\u201d and \u201cReligious/Patriotic Ceremonies and Observances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">{\u00b6 57} The referee relied on testimony by Jim Stockdale, a retired teacher from the district. Stockdale testified that in the fall of 2006, he was a substitute special-education teacher and that he accompanied his students into Freshwater\u2019s classroom and sat in one of the student desks in the back.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>{\u00b6 58} Stockdale testified that Freshwater started the class on a new unit regarding the origin of the universe. According to Stockdale, Freshwater stated that \u201coftentimes scientists and information in textbooks are incorrect\u201d and that as an example Freshwater stated that in an article in <em>Time </em>magazine, scientists had found a genetic link to homosexuality. But, Stockdale testified, Freshwater then told the students that the \u201cscientists in the article were wrong because the Bible states that homosexuality is a sin, so anyone who chooses to be a homosexual is a sinner; and that, therefore, science can be wrong, scientists can be wrong.\u201d Then, Freshwater concluded that the material in the textbook in that particular unit could be incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">{\u00b6 59} The referee concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">[I]n one incident, witnessed by an experienced and seasoned educator, John Freshwater not only injected his subjective, biased, Christian religion based, non-scientific opinion into the instruction of eighth grade science students but also gave those students reason to doubt the accuracy and or veracity of scientists, science textbooks, and/or science in general.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">\n<em>Ground Three: Freshwater\u2019s role as facilitator, monitor, and supervisor of FCA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">{\u00b6 60} Regarding ground three, the referee stated that although \u201cFreshwater was provided a copy of the guidelines for the conduct of [FCA] on more than one occasion * * *, Freshwater did not follow the guidelines implicitly.\u201d The referee concluded that there were several acts \u2014 Freshwater instituting a prayer, admitting to putting his hands up during a prayer, and praying for a guest speaker\u2014 that constituted violations of the FCA Handbook for Public Schools. However, the referee did not discuss these violations in later setting forth his conclusions regarding Freshwater\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">\n<em>Ground Four: Freshwater\u2019s disobedience of orders</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AKW\">{\u00b6 61} Regarding ground four, which is dispositive for purposes of our opinion, the referee stated that school administrators were concerned about materials displayed in Freshwater\u2019s classroom, including the \u201chandwritten Bible verses, videos, posters, and a Living Bible.\u201d The referee also found that White was assigned the task of implementing a plan of corrective action. The referee further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Beginning on April 7, 2008 [White] had several contacts with John Freshwater both in person and in writing. Principal White testified that \u201cthere were several meetings and several conversations in April.\u201d He further testified that multiple contacts with John Freshwater became necessary \u201cbecause the things that I had asked to happen on April 7th were not attended to.\u201d Granted, there may have been some confusion about the instructions, orders, and directives which Mr. White gave John Freshwater. However, it is abundantly clear that what may have begun as confusion soon transformed into defiance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">Between April 7th and April 16, 2008, Mr. White clarified and reiterated the directives. Finally, he was forced to set a deadline for compliance\u2014 April 16, 2008. Two days prior (April 14, 2008), Mr. White and John Freshwater had a discussion about whether his disobedience would constitute insubordination. He (Freshwater) was told that it would be. Nevertheless, John Freshwater decided to comply only in part. * * * [Freshwater] also decided to add another element to the controversy. He checked out [two] religious texts from the school library and [testified that he positioned them on his lab table in his classroom]. John Freshwater\u2019s explanation for this act included the phrases \u201cit was a curiosity\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s my inspiration.\u201d These explanations seem questionable. The act appears to have been one of defiance, disregard, and resistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">When Mr. White returned to John Freshwater\u2019s classroom on April 16, 2008 to see if his directives had been followed, he discovered that they had not been. His testimony recounts his observations}:] \u201cAlmost everything had been removed, but there was still the Colin Powell poster * * * out of the school library he had checked out the Bible and had a book called Jesus of Nazareth.\u201d John Freshwater admitted that he had not removed the Colin Powell poster. He explained * * * \u201cwith that poster, that\u2019s a patriotic poster of our Commander and Chief\u2019 * * * \u201cand I don\u2019t recall being told to remove it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">(Ellipses sic; citations to transcript omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">\n<em>Referee\u2019s conclusions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">{\u00b6 62} The referee concluded that pursuant to R.C. 3319.16, a teacher may be terminated for \u201cgood and just cause,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe conduct of the teacher in question must constitute a \u2018fairly serious matter,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Hale v. Lancaster Bd. of Edn., </em>13 Ohio St.2d 92, 99, 234 N.E.2d 583 (1968). The referee found that Freshwater\u2019s conduct constituted a fairly serious matter and was therefore \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>valid basis for his termination in accordance with ORC 3319.16.\u201d Specifically, the referee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\">John Freshwater was given ample opportunity to alter or adjust his content and style of teaching so as to avoid running headlong into the Establishment Clause and the Policy/Bylaws of the Mount Vernon Board of Education. Instead, he persisted in his attempts to make eighth grade science what he thought it should be \u2014 an examination of accepted scientific curriculum with the discerning eye of Christian doctrine. John Freshwater ignored the concept of in loco parentis and, instead, used his classroom as a means of sowing the seeds of doubt and confusion in the minds of impressionable students as they searched for meaning in the subject of science.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">John Freshwater purposely used his classroom to advance his Christian religious views knowing full well or ignoring the fact that those views might conflict with the private beliefs of his students. John Freshwater refused and/or failed to employ objectivity in his instruction of a variety of science subjects and, in so doing, endorsed a particular religious doctrine. By this course of conduct John Freshwater repeatedly violated the Establishment Clause. Without question, the repeated violation of the Constitution of The United States is a \u201cfairly serious matter\u201d and is, therefore, a valid basis for termination of John Freshwater\u2019s contract(s). Further, he repeatedly acted in defiance of direct instructions and orders of the administrators \u2014 his superiors. These defiant acts are also a \u201cfairly serious matter\u201d and, therefore, a valid basis for termination of John Freshwater\u2019s contract(s).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">{\u00b6 63} The referee\u2019s final recommendation was that the board terminate Freshwater\u2019s contract for good and just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">\n<em>Freshwater\u2019s Termination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">{\u00b6 64} On January 10, 2011, the board, relying on the referee\u2019s report, adopted it by a four-to-one vote and found that two main grounds (ground two, his failure to adhere to established curriculum, and ground four, his disobedience of orders) constituted good and just cause for the termination of Freshwater\u2019s teaching contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">{\u00b6 65} As to ground two, the board found that Freshwater injected his personal religious beliefs into his plan and pattern of instructing his students. In doing so, the board found, \u201che exceeded the bounds of all the pertinent Bylaws/Policies of the Mount Vernon City School District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>{\u00b6 66} As to ground four, the board found that \u201cFreshwater acted in defiance of direct instructions and orders of the administrators\u201d by failing to comply with the directive to remove or discontinue the display of all religious articles in his classroom, including all posters of a religious nature and had \u201cbrought additional religious articles into his classroom, in a direct act of insubordination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 67} The board determined that \u201ceach individual action independently constitutes \u2018good and just cause\u2019 for the termination of Mr. Freshwater\u2019s teaching contract(s), whether considered individually or jointly,\u201d and it therefore terminated Freshwater\u2019s employment contract with the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">{\u00b6 68} On January 11, 2011, Barbara Donohue, treasurer of the school district, sent Freshwater a letter informing him of the board\u2019s vote to terminate his contract at the board meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">{\u00b6 69} After his termination, Freshwater brought suit in the Knox County Common Pleas Court to appeal the board\u2019s resolution terminating his contract and to request that the trial court conduct additional hearings. The trial court reviewed the referee\u2019s report and the evidence and found that there was clear and convincing evidence to support the board\u2019s termination of Freshwater\u2019s employment \u201cfor good and just cause.\u201d Thus, the trial court affirmed the board\u2019s resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">{\u00b6 70} Freshwater appealed to the Fifth District Court of Appeals. In his sole assignment of error, he argued that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that there was clear and convincing evidence to support the board\u2019s termination of his employment contract for good and just cause, in affirming the board\u2019s termination of his employment contract, and in ordering him to pay the costs of the appeal. 2012-Ohio-889, 2012 WL 714392, at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">{\u00b6 71} The court of appeals affirmed. In doing so, the appellate court held that pursuant to <em>Graziano v. Amherst Exempted Village Bd. of Edn., </em>32 Ohio St.3d 289, 513 N.E.2d 282 (1987), it was compelled to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment unless it determined that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. In its analysis, the court of appeals held that it did not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-11\">perceive an \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable attitude,\u201d nor one that is \u201cnot merely error of judgment, but [one of] perversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality, or moral delinquency.\u201d To the contrary, the referee\u2019s memorandum provides a well-reasoned and articulated basis for affirming the decision of the Board and for the trial court to accept the recommendation of the referee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">{\u00b6 72} The appellate court held that pursuant to <em>Graziano, </em>the \u201c \u2018report <em>and recommendation </em>undertaken by the referee pursuant to R.C. 3319.16 must be considered and weighed by the board of education,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018due deference must be accorded to the findings and recommendations of the referee * * * who is best able to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and weigh their credibility.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added by the appellate court.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23, quoting <em>Graziano </em>at 293. The appellate court then rejected Freshwater\u2019s contentions that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain the board\u2019s termination decision and that additional hearings were necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">{\u00b6 73} The Fifth District next rejected Freshwater\u2019s contention that \u201cthe conduct found did not rise to the level of good and just cause sufficient to terminate his contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 26. The appellate court stated that in <em>Hale v. Lancaster Bd. of Edn., </em>13 Ohio St.2d at 99, 234 N.E.2d 583, \u201cgood and just cause\u201d is defined as a \u201cfairly serious matter,\u201d and observed that the referee found that Freshwater\u2019s \u201c \u2018repeated violation of the Constitution of the United States\u2019 \u201d and his repeated acts \u201c \u2018in defiance of direct instructions and orders of the administrators \u2014 his superiors\u2019 \u201d \u2014 both constituted a \u201cfairly serious matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27, quoting the referee\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">{\u00b6 74} The court of appeals noted that \u201ca hearing spanning nearly two years was conducted, testimony from over 80 witnesses was received, a transcript of over 6,000 pages was produced, and approximately 350 exhibits were admitted into evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 31. It further noted that Freshwater \u201cwas represented by a competent attorney, he was permitted to fully explain his actions, he presented witnesses on his behalf, and he had a full opportunity to challenge the Board\u2019s key witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 32. The Fifth District concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting Freshwater\u2019s requests for additional hearings and that the common pleas court\u2019s decision to affirm the termination was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 33-34. Therefore, the appellate court overruled Freshwater\u2019s sole assignment of error. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">{\u00b6 75} We accepted Freshwater\u2019s discretionary appeal, 132 Ohio St.3d 1461, 2012-Ohio-3054, 969 N.E.2d 1230, and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">\n<em>Standards for Termination of a Teacher\u2019s Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">{\u00b6 76} Before a board of education can terminate a teacher\u2019s contract, it must comply with R.C. 3319.16, which sets forth the procedures for terminating a contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>[T]he employing board shall furnish the teacher a written notice signed by its treasurer of its intention to consider the termination of the teacher\u2019s contract with full specification of the grounds for such consideration. * * * [T]he teacher may file with the treasurer a written demand for a hearing before the board or before a referee * * *. The hearing shall be conducted by a referee appointed pursuant to section 3319.161 of the Revised Code * * * and shall be confined to the grounds given for the termination. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\">* * * After a hearing by a referee, the referee shall file a report within ten days after the termination of the hearing. * * * After consideration of the referee\u2019s report, the board, by a majority vote, may accept or reject the referee\u2019s recommendation on the termination of the teacher\u2019s contract. After a hearing by the board, the board, by majority vote, may enter its determination upon its minutes. Any order of termination of a contract shall state the grounds for termination. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">Any teacher affected by an order of termination of contract may appeal to the court of common pleas of the county in which the school is located within thirty days after receipt of notice of the entry of such order. * * * The court shall examine the transcript and record of the hearing and shall hold such additional hearings as it considers advisable, at which it may consider other evidence in addition to the transcript and record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">{\u00b6 77} If a party to an R.C. 3319.16 proceeding, i.e., termination of a teacher\u2019s contract, appeals to an appellate court, \u201c[ajbsent an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, the court of appeals may not engage in what amounts to a substitution of judgment of the trial court.\u201d <em>Graziano, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 294, 513 N.E.2d 282. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 has been defined as implying \u2018not merely error of judgment, but perversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality, or moral delinquency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(Douglas, J., concurring), quoting <em>State ex rel. Shafer v. Ohio Turnpike Comm., </em>159 Ohio St. 581, 590-591, 113 N.E.2d 14 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">{\u00b6 78} Here, the board had good and just cause to terminate Freshwater\u2019s contract. The court of appeals held: \u201cThere was sufficient evidence to support both the referee and [the board\u2019s] findings, and we do not determine issues involving credibility.\u201d 2012-Ohio-889, 2012 WL 714392, at \u00b6 24. The appellate court held that it did \u201cnot perceive an \u2018unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable attitude,\u2019 nor one that is \u2018not merely error of judgment, but [one of] perversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality, or moral delinquency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">{\u00b6 79} Upon careful review, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">\n<em>Display of Religious Materials</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">{\u00b6 80} White\u2019s letter to Freshwater made clear that Freshwater, as a public school teacher, could not \u201cengage in any activity that promotes or denigrates a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>particular religion or religious beliefs while on board property, during any school activity,\u201d or when he was teaching. The district simply stated what the law, and the First Amendment, commands.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 81} Freshwater not only ignored the school district\u2019s directive, he defied it. After he was directed to remove the items, Freshwater deliberately added to them, incorporating the <em>Oxford Bible </em>and <em>Jesus of Nazareth </em>into the classroom. He then refused to remove his personal Bible from his desk, and refused to remove a depiction of former President George W. Bush and Colin Powell and others in prayer from his wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 82} Pursuant to R.C. 3319.16, a public school teacher\u2019s contract may not be terminated except for good and just cause. When a teacher has been insubordinate, good and just cause exists for a board of education to terminate that teacher\u2019s contract. In the context of teacher-contract-termination cases, the term \u201cinsubordination\u201d has been defined to include a willful \u201cdisobedience of, or refusal to obey, a reasonable and valid rule, regulation, or order issued by the school board or by an administrative superior.\u201d Annotation, <em>What Constitutes \u201cInsubordination\u201d as Ground for Dismissal of Public School Teacher, </em>78 A.L.R.3d 83, 87 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">{\u00b6 83} This is a succinct definition of the term \u201cinsubordination,\u201d and we adopt it for our purposes here. We therefore hold that in a proceeding under R.C. 3319.16 for the termination of a public school teacher\u2019s contract, \u201cgood and just cause\u201d includes insubordination consisting of a willful disobedience of, or refusal to obey, a reasonable and valid rule, regulation, or order issued by a school board or by an administrative superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">{\u00b6 84} It is undisputed that Freshwater willfully disobeyed orders when he failed to remove (1) his personal Bible, (2) <em>Jesus of Nazareth </em>and the <em>Oxford Bible, </em>and (3) the poster of government officials praying. But disobedience alone will not establish insubordination under the definition we adopt above. We must also find that the orders themselves were reasonable and valid. If any order was either unreasonable or invalid, Freshwater\u2019s disobedience of it would not be insubordinate.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">\n<em>Freshwater\u2019s personal Bible</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">{\u00b6 85} We begin by considering Principal White\u2019s order for Freshwater to remove his personal Bible from his desk. We conclude that this order was neither reasonable nor valid. The order infringed without justification upon conduct protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The district\u2019s proffered rationale for the order \u2014 that Freshwater\u2019s display of his Bible on his desk violated the Establishment Clause\u2014 was erroneous, because this Bible presented no such violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>{\u00b6 86} Teachers do not abandon their First Amendment rights when they enter their classrooms. <em>Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Community School Dist., </em>393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969) (students and teachers do not \u201cshed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate\u201d). Included in those First Amendment rights is the ability to freely exercise one\u2019s religion. The protections of the Free Exercise Clause apply whenever the government \u201cregulates or prohibits conduct because it is undertaken for religious reasons.\u201d <em>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, </em>508 U.S. 520, 532, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">{\u00b6 87} Freshwater\u2019s conduct in keeping his personal Bible at his desk was plainly undertaken for religious reasons. And the district sought to regulate that conduct solely because the conduct was religiously motivated. Thus, when the district ordered Freshwater to put away his personal Bible, it infringed upon religious conduct protected by the Free Exercise Clause, something Freshwater has asserted throughout this controversy. <em>See Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 547, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), fn. 13 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cpossession of * * * personal property relating to religious observance, such as a Bible or a crucifix, is surely protected by the Free Exercise Clause\u201d); <em>Warnock v.

The district undeniably has an interest in avoiding Establishment Clause violations, and this interest may even justify infringement on teachers\u2019 First Amendment rights. <em>Widmar v. Vincent, </em>454 U.S. 263, 271, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981); <em>Good News Club v. Milford Cent. School, </em>533 U.S. 98, 112-113, 121 S.Ct. 2093, 150 L.Ed.2d 151 (2001). But the interest must be grounded in reality; the district\u2019s mere fear of an Establishment Clause violation will not justify burdening First Amendment protections. <em>See United States v. Natl. Treasury Emps. Union, </em>513 U.S. 454, 475, 115 S.Ct. 1003, 130 L.Ed.2d 964 (1995), quoting <em>Whitney v. California, </em>274 U.S. 357, 376, 47 S.Ct. 641, 71 L.Ed. 1095 (1927) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>(Brand\u00e9is, J., concurring) (First Amendment restrictions \u201crequir[e] a justification far stronger than mere speculation about serious harms. * * * \u2018Men feared witches and burnt women\u2019 \u201d). If the district was acting to avoid an Establishment Clause violation, there actually needed to be an Establishment Clause violation to avoid. <em>Lamb\u2019s Chapel v. Ctr. Moriches Union Free School Dist., </em>508 U.S. 384, 395, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993) (rejecting school district\u2019s Establishment Clause defense because its \u201cposited fears of an Establishment Clause violation are unfounded\u201d); <em>Brown v. Polk Cty., Iowa, </em>61 F.3d 650, 659 (8th Cir.1995) (baseless fear of Establishment Clause violation could not justify county\u2019s order for public employee to remove Bible from his desk).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">{\u00b6 89} In this case, we must reject the district\u2019s justification because the inconspicuous presence of Freshwater\u2019s personal Bible posed no threat to the Establishment Clause and the record supports that he did not use the Bible while teaching. A public school violates the Establishment Clause if its actions could reasonably be perceived as an official endorsement of religion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Cty. of Allegheny v. Am. Civ.

Mergens, </em>496 U.S. 226, 250, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990) (\u201cschools do not endorse everything they fail to censor\u201d); <em>see also Helland v. S.

Allowing teachers to have personal religious items conveys a message of accommodation, not endorsement. <em>See Nichols v. Caroline Cty. Bd. of Edn., </em>D.Md. No. JFM-02-3523, 2004 WL 350337, at *12 (Feb. 23, 2004), fn. 15 (allowing teacher to keep personal Bible by his desk was an accommodation of teacher\u2019s religious expression).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">{\u00b6 91} The scene of Freshwater\u2019s classroom and the particular physical setting of his Bible \u2014 key factors to. our endorsement inquiry \u2014 further demonstrate the impossibility of any perceived state endorsement of religion. <em>See Cty. of Allegheny, </em>492 U.S. at 595, 109 S.Ct. 3086, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (highlighting importance of context and physical setting in endorsement test). Freshwater kept his Bible at his desk. Teachers at Mount Vernon considered their desks to be personal space. The desk area was off-limits to students, and teachers often kept private items there. Freshwater had even posted a large \u201cKEEP OUT\u201d sign on the side of his desk. The personal nature of the space makes it unlikely that a reasonable observer would perceive official state endorsement of private items placed there.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">{\u00b6 92} In addition to being on a personal workspace, rather than in a public, student-accessible area, Freshwater\u2019s Bible was inconspicuous. It lay flat on his desk, amongst electronics, texts, office supplies, and other papers. Oftentimes, the Bible was buried under other materials. Teachers testified that there was \u201cstuff all over his desk, so you couldn\u2019t hardly see [the Bible]\u201d and that it was \u201chard to find on his messy desk.\u201d Many students never even noticed the Bible or only realized it was in the classroom after it became a highlight of this controversy. HROC concluded that the Bible was not on display; it was neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>prominently staged nor placed in a way that would draw any particular attention to it. Other witnesses testified that Freshwater himself never drew any attention to the Bible. Given this unobtrusive, obscured, personal setting, no reasonable observer would assume that the state intended to promote or endorse Freshwater\u2019s Bible. <em>See, e.g., ARIN Intermediate, </em>268 F.Supp.2d at 554 (\u201cunobtrusiv[e] displays [of] religious adherence\u201d by school employees do not imply government endorsement of religion and do not violate Establishment Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">{\u00b6 93} Finally, we consider that the district has the power to correct any misperceptions it anticipates. As the Supreme Court has stated, a school district\u2019s \u201cfear of a mistaken inference of endorsement is largely self-imposed, because the school itself has control over any impressions it gives its students.\u201d <em>Westside Community Schools, </em>496 U.S. at 251, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 110 L.Ed.2d 191. If the school does not want people to think that it promotes Freshwater\u2019s beliefs, it can tell them so. <em>Id.; see also Capitol Square, </em>515 U.S. at 769, 115 S.Ct. 2440, 132 L.Ed.2d 650 (\u201cIf Ohio is concerned about misperceptions, nothing prevents it from requiring all private displays * * * to be identified as such\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">{\u00b6 94} The Free Exercise Clause protected Freshwater\u2019s conduct as to his personal Bible. When the district asked Freshwater to remove his Bible from his desk, it was not asking him to cease a meaningless activity. It was demanding that he give up his constitutionally guaranteed rights. The government can encroach upon constitutional rights, but it must have a legitimate reason for doing so. Here, the district\u2019s reason was not legitimate. The district feared an Establishment Clause violation where none existed. Unsubstantiated fear alone cannot justify flouting the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">{\u00b6 95} We therefore conclude that the district\u2019s order for Freshwater to remove his personal Bible from his desk was neither reasonable nor valid; the order infringed on Freshwater\u2019s free-exercise rights without justification. Because this particular order was invalid, Freshwater\u2019s disobedience of the order cannot be considered insubordination or grounds for his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">\n<em>The remaining orders</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">{\u00b6 96} Freshwater\u2019s refusal to remove the other items from his classroom \u2014 the <em>Oxford Bible, Jesus of Nazareth, </em>and the George W. Bush/Colin Powell poster\u2014 presents a much simpler issue. Freshwater\u2019s First Amendment rights did not protect the display of these items, because they were not a part of his exercise of his religion. Freshwater admitted that he checked out the additional books only in order to make a point once this controversy began. Thus, the district would not run afoul of the Free Exercise Clause by ordering Freshwater to remove these materials; the orders were both reasonable and valid. Freshwater\u2019s willful disobedience of these direct orders demonstrates blatant insubordination. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>insubordination is established by clear and convincing evidence, and the record fully supports the board\u2019s decision to terminate him on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">\n<em>Teaching of Creationism and Intelligent Design Alongside Evolution Generally Disfavored</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 97} We recognize that this case is driven by a far more powerful debate over the teaching of creationism and intelligent design alongside evolution. <em>See, e.g., McLean v. Arkansas Bd. of Edn., </em>529 F.Supp. 1255 (E.D.Ark.1982). Federal courts consistently hold that the teaching of evolution in public schools should not be prohibited, <em>Epperson v. Arkansas, </em>393 U.S. 97, 106-107, 89 S.Ct. 266, 21 L.Ed.2d 228 (1968), and have struck as unconstitutional policies and statutes that require public school teachers to devote equal time to teaching both evolution and the Biblical view of creation. <em>See, e.g., Daniel v. Waters, </em>515 F.2d 485 (6th Cir.1975). The United States Supreme Court and at least one other federal court have held that teaching theories of creationism and intelligent design in public schools violates the Establishment Clause because they convey \u201csupernatural causation of the natural world\u201d and therefore are inherently religious concepts. <em>Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School Dist., </em>400 F.Supp.2d 707, 736 (M.D.Pa.2005); <em>Edwards v. Aguillard, </em>482 U.S. 578, 591-592, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 96 L.Ed.2d 510 (1987). However, the Supreme Court holds that teaching creationism is not prohibited in public schools as long as it is done \u201cwith the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction.\u201d <em>Edwards </em>at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">{\u00b6 98} The Supreme Court also cautions that the courts must be \u201cvigilant in monitoring compliance with the Establishment Clause in elementary and secondary schools\u201d because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">[f]amilies entrust public schools with the education of their children, but condition their trust on the understanding that the classroom will not purposely be used to advance religious views that may conflict with the private beliefs of the student and his or her family.

The relevant \u201cconduct\u201d here consists solely of Freshwater keeping his personal Bible on his desk. Numerous students testified that Freshwater never held up, read from, or opened his Bible during class. One student alleged that Freshwater once referred to his Bible during class, but HROC investigated this allegation and found no evidence to substantiate it. Many teachers, including Deborah Strouse, who monitored Freshwater\u2019s classroom in 2008 when this controversy developed, similarly confirmed that Freshwater never used his personal Bible in class.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b699-6\">. Traditionally, courts have tested for Establishment Clause violations using the test set forth in <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 612-613, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971) (government action violates the Establishment Clause if (1) it does not have a secular purpose, (2) its primary effect is to advance or inhibit religion, or (3) it creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion). In recent years, however, the Supreme Court has only intermittently used the <em>Lemon </em>test, and whether the test actually applies in any given scenario is difficult to discern. <em>See, e.g., Utah Hwy. Patrol Assn. v. Am. Atheists, Inc., </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 12, 14, 181 L.Ed.2d 379 (2011) (Thomas, J., dissenting from the denial of certiorari) (\u201cOur jurisprudence provides no principled basis by which a lower court could discern whether <em>Lemon </em>/endorsement, or some other test, should apply in Establishment Clause cases\u201d). In its most recent cases dealing with the Establishment Clause in public schools, the Supreme Court has declined to apply <em>Lemon, </em>instead opting for the endorsement test. <em>See Good News Club, </em>533 U.S. at 113, 115, 121 S.Ct. 2093, 150 L.Ed.2d 151; <em>Santa Fe Indep.

Even if we were to apply <em>Lemon </em>in this case, we would find no Establishment Clause violation. Simply allowing a teacher to keep his personal Bible on his desk would not have a religious purpose, would not advance religion, and would not excessively entangle government with religion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b703-9\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AyK\">concurring in syllabus and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">{\u00b6 101} With respect to this case involving science students in a public middle school, I would hold that the school district\u2019s order that John Freshwater put away his personal Bible while students were present was a reasonable and valid attempt to avoid an Establishment Clause violation. That order did not infringe on Freshwater\u2019s free speech rights, for he was not required to remove the Bible from the classroom \u2014 merely putting the book into a desk drawer during class time would have sufficed. The lead opinion states that an order to remove religious materials is valid and reasonable but that an order that a personal Bible not be displayed while students are present is not. I do not see the distinction. In my view, Freshwater disobeyed a reasonable order by incorporating the Bible by reference while teaching in his science classes and displaying the book on his desk while students were present. I would hold that this constituted part of his insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">{\u00b6 102} Because I disagree with the lead opinion\u2019s discussion of this point, I join the syllabus and concur in judgment only.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b703-12\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ais\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">{\u00b6 103} To the end, John Freshwater has been a teacher. For more than five years, he has argued that the school board had no right to require him to remove his Bible from his desk. Five years of hearings and appeals have passed, over $900,000 in legal fees reportedly were expended by the school board on the hearing alone in its quest to fire its best eighth-grade science teacher, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>only holding of consequence by this court today echoes what John Freshwater told a gathering of supporters in Mount Vernon\u2019s town square on April 16, 2008:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">Because the Bible is * * * personal and private property and the source of personal inner strength in my own life, the removal of it from my desk would be nothing short of infringement on my own deeply held personal religious beliefs, granted by God and guaranteed under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment in the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 104} This court has determined today that Freshwater was right. The central piece of the insubordination claim against Freshwater \u2014 that he refused to remove his Bible from his desk \u2014 has been determined by this court (by the three members of the court that concur in the lead opinion and by at least one other justice, myself) to be an invalid cause for discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">{\u00b6 105} What next? With the insubordination claim gutted, the lead opinion should have moved on to consider the constitutional issues remaining in the case. Instead, the majority walks away from the opportunity to provide helpful guidance to every school board in Ohio and to the thousands of great teachers who could benefit from knowing more about the extent of and limits on their academic freedom. Justice O\u2019Donnell\u2019s well-reasoned dissent addresses the issue, but goes unrebutted. In short, the majority shrinks from the chance to be a Supreme Court. The lead opinion cobbles together the piddling other claims of supposed insubordination, and, sitting as Supreme School Board, the majority declares the matter closed. In a case bounding with arrogance and cowardice, the lead opinion fits right in.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">\n<em>The Desk Bible Was the Center of the Insubordination Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">{\u00b6 106} Since Freshwater became aware of possible discipline, the presence of the Bible on his desk was a bone of contention. The April 7, 2008 letter from Principal William White to Freshwater was to follow up with Freshwater regarding concerns about Freshwater\u2019s role with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (\u201cFCA\u201d) and about \u201creligious materials in [his] classroom.\u201d The letter mentioned only the Bible on his desk and the Ten Commandments on Freshwater\u2019s classroom window as potentially offensive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">With regard to religious materials in your classroom, it has been brought to my attention that you have a bible out on your desk and that the \u201ccollage\u201d on your classroom window includes the 10 commandments. While you certainly may read your bible on your own, duty free time [i.e. during lunch], it cannot be sitting out on your desk when students are in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the classroom and when you are supposed to be engaged in your responsibilities as a teacher. As for the 10 commandments, that part of your collage must be taken down and replaced with something that is not religious in nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">{\u00b6 107} A letter from White to Freshwater on April 14 \u2014 before Freshwater had checked out books from the-library \u2014 memorializes an April 11 conversation between White and Freshwater regarding religious items in Freshwater\u2019s classroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">As per our conversation, all religious items need to be removed from your classroom by the end of the day on Wednesday, April 16, 2008. Bibles and other religious DVD\u2019s, videos, etc. should be placed out of sight and access of students by this date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 108} In the letter from their attorneys dated April 14, 2008, Stephen and Jenifer Dennis, the parents of Zaeh Dennis, the now adult who was the eighth-grade student at the heart of this case, outlined their own bill of particulars stating why Freshwater\u2019s career must end:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">The Ten Commandments are displayed in Mr. Freshwater\u2019s classroom. Several Bibles are also kept in Mr. Freshwater\u2019s classroom and are there as a display to his students, not for his personal use. This display represents an ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing religion and violates the central Establishment Clause virtue of official religious neutrality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">{\u00b6 109} In a letter from their attorney to Superintendent Stephen Short dated April 21, 2008, the hypervigilant Dennises apparently were satisfied that the religious-display issue had been cleared up, and moved on to other matters: \u2018While we appreciate Mt. Vernon\u2019s efforts to have Mr. Freshwater remove religious materials from his classroom, it is obvious that Mr. Freshwater has not ceased his religious teachings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">{\u00b6 110} On April 16, 2008, Freshwater and White came to a crystal clear understanding: If Freshwater did not remove his personal Bible from his desk in his classroom, he would be considered insubordinate. That conclusion was specific and undeniable. Only one thing was necessary for Freshwater to be found insubordinate \u2014 that his personal Bible remain on his desk. Freshwater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>could not abide any directive to remove it. He so fervently believed his rectitude that he went public, literally entering the public square to air his grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">{11111}Ina story in the April 18, 2008 <em>Mansfield News Journal </em>entered into evidence by Freshwater, Mount Vernon School Board president Ian Watson spoke about insubordination, mentioning only Freshwater\u2019s Bible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t remove the Bible from his desktop, at some point, and I don\u2019t know that point yet because we haven\u2019t progressed that far, but some claim of insubordination could be made,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThere would be penalties involved, which would vary depending on the level of insubordination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Kinton, <em>Mount Vernon School Officials Hope to Resolve Bible Standoff Quickly, </em>Mansfield News Journal (April 18, 2008).

Most recently, I spoke to the family at the first of this month,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe would like to see the Bible removed so that we can be responsive to parents, and we would like to reach a common ground with Mr. Freshwater that everyone can be OK with, but I don\u2019t know if that will happen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">{\u00b6 112} Over and over again, the Ten Commandments and Freshwater\u2019s personal Bible were the focus of the complaints against Freshwater. There is no dispute that the Ten Commandments were quickly removed from his classroom. The Bible remained the sticking point.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">\n<em>Other Evidence of Insubordination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">{\u00b6 113} The issue of Freshwater\u2019s desktop Bible deserves the attention the lead opinion gives it. The presence of that Bible on his desk was at the very center of the insubordination claim against Freshwater. Now that theory is gone, and less than a fig leaf remains. The lead opinion spends many paragraphs explaining the invalidity of the central reason given for Freshwater\u2019s dismissal, his refusal to remove his Bible from his desk. An unofficial majority of the court agrees with that aspect of the holding, as I consider myself a member of that unofficial majority. But the lead opinion spends just one scant, conclusory \u25a0 paragraph outlining why Freshwater\u2019s career had to end. Now that Freshwater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>has won on the most important dispute, the myth must be created that the presence of the other items constituted insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">\n<em>Bush/Powell Poster</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">{\u00b6 114} Was there a valid work rule in effect regarding the Bush/Powell poster? The majority cannot be bothered to say whether there was or whether it was willfully disobeyed. Certainly, if there were a rule about the Bush/Powell poster, it did not apply to everyone. As Justice O\u2019Donnell relates in his dissenting opinion, at \u00b6 147, the poster was distributed by the school and was displayed in other teachers\u2019 rooms. The picture of the poster in evidence shows that the biblical quote at the top of the poster is largely obscured by other items on Freshwater\u2019s bulletin board. There is no evidence that Freshwater left the Powell/Bush poster up because of its religious nature. He claimed that it was a patriotic poster that appealed to him because he had two children in the military. The president of the school board, Watson, testified that \u201cin and of itself,\u201d the poster was not a religious display. And on April 16, the poster was inconsequential \u2014 Freshwater was told he would be insubordinate for failing to remove his Bible. The poster was then what it is today: a trifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\n<em>Library Books</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">{\u00b6 115} What work rule or order did Freshwater violate by checking out books from the library? Was there a work rule in effect that a teacher could not borrow books from the school library and keep them in his work area? Does the lead opinion really mean to say that books of a religious nature are acceptable in the library but not acceptable to be checked out from the library? Or is it only practicing Christians who cannot borrow such books from the library? Freshwater is not accused of reading to his class from the books or assigning the books to his students. They were school property and could have been removed at any time. There is no documented complaint about the books and no specific order that they be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">{\u00b6 116} Whether Freshwater checked them out of the library to make a point or to provide himself comfort is irrelevant. There was no work rule or order that he could not have them in his classroom. If he did check them out to make a point, the point was valid: religious materials were present in the school and if they were not forced upon children, possessing them was acceptable. If the placement of the library books, the <em>Oxford Bible </em>and <em>Jesus of </em>Nazareth, was designed to demonstrate defiance, should Freshwater be fired for indicating his resistance to a policy that this court has declared illegal?</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">\n<em>A Fairly Serious Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">{\u00b6 117} In interpreting the \u201cother good and just cause\u201d clause of the version of R.C. 3319.16 at issue here, this court has made clear that firings implicating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>phrase must involve conduct on a par with that justifying termination for other reasons under the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">In construing the words, \u201cother good and just cause,\u201d we note that they are used with the words \u201cgross inefficiency or immorality\u201d and \u201cwillful and persistent violations\u201d of board regulations. In our opinion, this indicates a legislative intention that the \u201cother good and just cause\u201d be a fairly serious matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\"><em>Hale v. Lancaster Bd. of Edn., </em>13 Ohio St.2d 92, 98-99, 234 N.E.2d 583 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">{\u00b6 118} Is the presence of this poster and a couple of library books in his classroom a serious matter on a par with \u201cgross inefficiency or immorality\u201d or \u201cwillful and persistent violations\u201d of board regulations? Is this enough to end a career of over 20 years?</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">{\u00b6 119} Freshwater\u2019s activities do not sink to the level of other school employees terminated pursuant to R.C. 3319.16.

For example, many of the cases involved inappropriate sexual relations between faculty and students. Other cases involved instances in which a teacher had been convicted of a serious criminal offense. Some of the cases involved direct refusals by teachers to follow board guidelines. In other cases, the actions of a teacher could have caused serious harm to a student.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>(Footnotes omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">{\u00b6 121} <em>Bertolini </em>discussed, in particular, cases involving direct refusals by-teachers to follow board guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">In <em>Buie </em>[v. <em>Chippewa Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>9th Dist. Wayne No. 2924, 1995 WL 542217 (Sept. 13, 1995)], the teacher resisted making any changes suggested by the school principal over a two-year period to alleviate excessive noise and disorder in his classroom. In <em>Wynne v. S. Point Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(July 23, 1992), [4th Dist.] Lawrence App. No. 91CA15, unreported, 1992 WL 174720, a teacher failed to report to work at the expiration of her leave of absence after having been absent from work for twenty months.

Neither the Bush/Powell poster nor the library books had a serious effect on the school system. At worst, they were de minimis violations of an unwritten, ad hoc rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">{\u00b6 123} This court\u2019s decision will have far-reaching consequences. In its effort to be rid of Freshwater\u2019s case without too much heavy lifting, this court has set a very low bar for what constitutes \u201cgood and just cause.\u201d Precedent from this court regarding R.C. 3319.16 is fairly limited, but now we have a case on the books setting forth that good and just cause means very little cause at all. Teachers throughout the state should feel much less secure in their employment today.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">{\u00b6 124} This case illustrates the importance of leadership and the power of hysteria. This case should be a cautionary tale for other school boards, a case study of what not to do. For at least a month before the situation exploded, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Dennises had been complaining about Freshwater, often to the school-board president, Watson, who was a personal acquaintance of Stephen Dennis. Based on those complaints, Freshwater was admonished by a letter dated April 7, 2008, to abide by rules regarding his participation in FCA events and to remove religious displays in his classroom. The situation cried out for leadership by the superintendent, a school-board member, or a prominent community member to bring the sides together and work together toward some understanding. Indeed, a meeting was arranged between the Dennises and Freshwater. The Dennises, however, wished to remain anonymous so that if they canceled the meeting, Freshwater would not know who had lodged complaints against him. According to the Dennises, this was done to protect their son from retaliation. Near the time of the meeting, White revealed to Freshwater the name of the complainant, which upset the Dennises. They canceled the meeting because, according to Mr. Dennis, Freshwater was going to have representation at the meeting and the Dennises were not. Soon enough, the Dennises obtained representation. Within a week, their counsel was demanding Freshwater\u2019s removal from the classroom. Fire him or face a lawsuit, the Dennises said. Bullies are not relegated to playgrounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">{\u00b6 125} On April 16, Freshwater made his appearance on the square in Mt. Vernon. The Board of Education responded with a press release announcing many of the claims that the Dennises had raised against Freshwater. And then the headlines started. One headline, accompanied by an article on page A1 of the <em>Columbus Dispatch </em>on April 23, 2008, proclaimed: \u201cDISPUTE WITH MOUNT VERNON TEACHER; Religious \u2018healing,\u2019 branding charged.\u201d The circus came to Mount Vernon.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">{\u00b6 126} Hurriedly, an investigation was started. Counsel was retained by the school. Counsel then retained a \u201cmom and pop\u201d human-resources investigation firm, which used a tiny rear-view mirror to review a man\u2019s 20-year career. Hired to find evidence to fire Freshwater, the investigator did just that. Based on the report (the board\u2019s lawyer reviewed earlier drafts), the board announced its intention to fire Freshwater.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">{\u00b6 127} Meanwhile, the Dennises, deciding that the end of Freshwater\u2019s career was insufficient, filed suit in federal court. That Tesla-coil mark on poor Zach\u2019s arm \u2014 the one Freshwater claimed was an X and they claimed was a cross\u2014 started looking an awful lot like a dollar sign. Eventually, the suit against Freshwater would be settled for $475,000, which included $300,000 for the Dennis parents, $25,000 for their lawyer, and a $150,000 annuity that will end up paying Zach around $217,000 by the time he is 30. The suit against the school district settled for less: in that case, each parent received $1, Zach $5,500, and their lawyers $115,500. Money was a wonderful salve for Zach\u2019s injured arm, which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>after all, had suffered a mark on it that disappeared in three weeks. It had kept him from sleeping for a few minutes the night it happened. But now, all is well. His mother, Jenifer, was quoted in a magazine article, Boston, <em>Insidious Design: At the Ohio Supreme Court, a Teacher Claims an \u201cAcademic Freedom\u201d Right to Push Creationism in Public School, </em>Church &amp; State (Nov. 2012) 4, available at https://www.au.org/church-state/november-2012-chureh-state/featured/insidiousdesign (accessed Nov. 4, 2013), in 2012:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-4\">\u201cAlthough Mount Vernon has many positive attributes and we still spend time there,\u201d Jenifer Dennis said, \u201cwe are extremely fortunate to have found a warm and welcoming community in an adjacent county that we\u2019ve now become a part of. It is a community that is accepting of all ideas, thoughts and people from all walks of life and our family is now a part of it, so we haven\u2019t thought about moving back to Mount Vernon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">{\u00b6 128} How special.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">{\u00b6 129} R. Lee Shepherd was hired to conduct the hearing Freshwater demanded; Freshwater had preferred that the board hear it directly, but that request was denied. And so Shepherd conducted the hearing sporadically for two years, taking evidence. On January 7, 2011, he announced his findings. He concluded that none of the grounds individually was enough to cause Freshwater\u2019s ouster: \u201cIt is not herein determined whether any one of the bases/grounds for consideration of termination would be sufficient in and of itself. However, the multiple incidents which give rise to the numerous and various bases/grounds more than suffice in support of termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">{\u00b6 130} Despite relying on only one ground for Freshwater\u2019s termination, the lead opinion does not suffer from Shepherd\u2019s finding that only a combination of grounds could lead to his termination, because the school board\u2019s resolution slickly states that each action, whether individually or jointly, constituted good and just cause for termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">{\u00b6 131} Shepherd concluded that \u201cFreshwater refused and/or failed to employ objectivity in his instruction of a variety of science subjects and, in so doing, endorsed a particular religious doctrine. By this course of conduct John Freshwater repeatedly violated the Establishment Clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">{\u00b6 132} This conclusion of constitutional significance has gone unexamined by every reviewing court. Each reviewing court has instead remarked how very, very large the record is. Judge Eyster\u2019s two-page rubber stamp of the termination noted that \u201c[t]he referee presided over thirty-eight (38) days of witness testimony from over eighty (80) witnesses generating six thousand three hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>forty four (6,344) pages of transcript. The Referee also admitted approximately three hundred fifty (350) exhibits into evidence.\u201d What followed in the trial court\u2019s entry was exactly zero (0) analysis of the referee\u2019s report upon which the board based its termination resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">{\u00b6 133} The appellate court stated that \u201c[a] review of the record shows that a hearing spanning nearly two years was conducted, testimony from over 80 witnesses was received, a transcript of over 6,000 pages was produced, and approximately 350 exhibits were admitted into evidence.\u201d 2012-Ohio-889, 2012 WL 714392, at \u00b6 31. The appellate court found merely that the trial court had not abused its discretion in affirming the board. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">{\u00b6 134} Here, the lead opinion, at \u00b6 9, adds, \u201cAfter the hearing, which involved 38 different days of witness testimony spread out over almost 21 months, included more than 80 witnesses and hundreds of exhibits, and ultimately resulted in over 6,000 pages of transcript, the referee issued a report on January 7, 2011.\u201d With a record that large, how could an R.C. 3319.16 referee be wrong about the Establishment Clause?</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">{\u00b6 135} How many of those 38 different days were wasted, how many of those 80 witnesses were ultimately unnecessary? The 6,000 pages of transcript were at least 60 times too many. For the lead opinion, all that was necessary to fire Freshwater was proof that he had checked out library books and put them in his classroom, a classroom that contained a poster that might be considered religious.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">(\u00b6 136} Thus concludes the sorry saga of John Freshwater, excellent junior-high science teacher, terminated as a result of an extreme overreaction of the parents of a decent student, followed by even less informed and measured responses by Mount Vernon school administrators and the school board. The Mount Vernon school board and school administration are the nominal winners of this case, but they have managed to divide a really nice community and cost the school board and/or its insurance providers well over a million dollars to free itself of a very good teacher. And the people they did it for left town.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">{\u00b6 137} There is a clear set of winners today: the lawyers who advised a high-dollar settlement of a good case that would have proved valueless to the plaintiff parents and student if taken to trial and those who advised the Mount Vernon school board to pursue a very bad case against John Freshwater to a hollow but expensive victory in the Ohio Supreme Court. They have told themselves that they are participating in the evolved version of the <em>Scopes </em>trial, when in reality they have created a modern <em>Jarndyce and Jarndyce.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">{\u00b6 138} John Freshwater will be deemed today\u2019s loser by superficial press accounts. He has lost his job, reportedly mortgaged his home to cover his litigation expenses, and will receive no compensation whatsoever. But John Freshwater is not today\u2019s big loser, because he fought to prove that he actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>followed the rules, that he taught well, and that over a lifetime of dedication to the students in his classrooms he made a positive contribution to their lives. That proof is uncontroverted. In that most important measure of public education, John Freshwater is a winner and his final departure is a loss to the Mount Vernon schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">{\u00b6 139} This court accepted jurisdiction in this case presumably to speak to the important issues of the Establishment Clause, academic freedom, and how schools may approach educating children about the scientific theories of evolution, which may directly clash with religious teachings of creation to which many children have been exposed at home and at church. Instead this court sidesteps all of the difficult issues presented in the ease leaving the resolution of all these heady matters in the hands of a lone referee. Ironically, the lead opinion in this case proves the existence of God. Apparently, he\u2019s an R.C. 3319.16 referee from Shelby.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b713-6\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AoP\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">{\u00b6 140} The right of free speech of public school teachers and their students and the freedom of a public school teacher to select and utilize teaching materials and methods to effectively present the prescribed school curriculum are the core issues in this case. It involves a veteran science teacher singled out by the Mount Vernon City School District Board of Education because of his willingness to challenge students in his science classes to think critically about evolutionary theory and to permit them to discuss intelligent design and to debate creationism in connection with the presentation of the prescribed curriculum on evolution. It is not about marking a cross on a student\u2019s arm with a Tesla coil, nor, as viewed by the majority, a simple case of teacher insubordination. We accepted jurisdiction on two propositions of law, which present issues of constitutional magnitude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">[I] The termination of a public school teacher\u2019s employment contract based on the teacher\u2019s use of academic freedom where the school board has not provided any clear indication as to the kinds of materials or teaching methods which are unacceptable cannot be legally justified, as it constitutes an impermissible violation of the rights of the teacher and his students to free speech and academic freedom under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and a manifestation of hostility toward religion in violation of the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">[II] The termination of a public school teacher\u2019s employment contract based on the mere presence of religious texts from the school\u2019s library and/or the display of a patriotic poster cannot be legally justified, as it constitutes an impermissible violation of the rights of a teacher and his students to free speech and academic freedom under the First Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>to the United States Constitution and a manifestation of hostility toward religion in violation of the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Because the majority resolves this case by finding that sufficient evidence exists to support just cause for termination and fails to examine the constitutional issues, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Insubordination</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">{\u00b6 141} John Freshwater served with distinction as a teacher in the Mount Vernon City School District for more than 20 years. Prior to his termination by the board of education, he had received overwhelmingly positive performance reviews and, as acknowledged in the referee\u2019s report issued after a protracted hearing in this matter, he had been \u201crecognized by his peers for his outstanding teaching skills.\u201d In addition, the record reflects, he had never been subject to any formal discipline by school administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">{\u00b6 142} In December 2007, one of his students, Z.D., complained about the use of a Tesla coil that marked his arm with what appeared to be an \u201cX\u201d or a cross. After Z.D.\u2019s parents complained, William White, the school principal, resolved the matter by instructing Freshwater not to use the Tesla coil on students and to secure it when not in use. That directive, however, did not satisfy the student\u2019s parents, and in April 2008, through counsel in a letter to district Superintendent Stephen Short, they threatened to sue the board of education if it did not order Freshwater to remove Bibles and religious displays from the classroom by April 18, 2008, and if it did not suspend him from teaching pending an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">{\u00b6 143} In an apparent response to the threatened litigation, White instructed Freshwater by letter that \u201call religious items need to be removed from your classroom by the end of the day on Wednesday, April 16, 2008. Bibles and other religious DVD\u2019s, videos, etc. should also be placed out of sight and access of the students by this date.\u201d Despite the fact that he had been singled out and that other teachers and administrators had Bible verses or other religious references on display in their rooms, Freshwater removed copies of the Ten Commandments from the walls in his classroom, together with at least ten inspirational posters containing Bible verses, various religious DVDs and videos, and boxes of Bibles used by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, a school-sanctioned organization that he monitored and allowed to meet in his classroom. The only items that remained at the end of the day on April 16 were his personal Bible, a religious book and a Bible from the school\u2019s library, and a poster of President George W. Bush and his cabinet captioned, \u201cThe effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much,\u201d James 5:16, which had been distributed by the school and which other teachers and colleagues displayed in their classrooms and offices at the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>{\u00b6 144} The board concluded that by having his personal Bible, the school library books, and the school-issued poster in his classroom, Freshwater \u201cacted in defiance of direct instructions and orders of the administrators.\u201d The board then stated, \u201cFreshwater was directed to remove or discontinue the display of all religious articles in his classroom, including all posters of a religious nature, and * * * has failed to comply with that directive and, further, has brought additional religious articles into his classroom, in a direct act of insubordination.\u201d That finding is wrong and is not supported by the record. Notably, White\u2019s letter did not instruct Freshwater to remove all religious articles from his classroom, as the board stated. The principal testified that he told Freshwater that \u201ccertainly he may read his Bible during his own time, but during the times that students were in the classroom it was supposed to be, you know, out of sight and put away from the students.\u201d White also informed Freshwater that \u201cother religious DVD\u2019s, videos, etc. should also be placed out of sight and access of the students.\u201d Lacking in the record is any indication that any students were present in the classroom when White inspected it on April 16 or that students had access to them. The conclusion that Freshwater defiantly violated the directive is subjective \u2014 especially because Freshwater had permission to read his own Bible and the two other books in his classroom came from the school\u2019s own library.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">{\u00b6 145} The lead opinion recognizes that Freshwater had a constitutional right to keep his Bible on his desk and that he was not insubordinate for doing so and could not be terminated on that basis, yet it concludes that he had no First Amendment right to have the copies of the <em>Oxford Bible </em>or <em>Jesus of Nazareth </em>from the school library in his classroom, because these books were not a part of his personal religious exercise. But this is a specious argument and a distinction without a difference. The conclusory statement in the lead opinion that Freshwater was defiant because he had these library books in his classroom is unwarranted. He explained that at the time he checked these books out, he \u201cwas expecting my Bible to be removed out of my classroom. And my daughter and I would walk in \u2014 my daughter would always open it up and say, Dad, it\u2019s still there, Dad, it\u2019s still there. That\u2019s my inspiration. I\u2019m not going to go without my inspiration.\u201d He testified that he checked these books out of the library for two reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">[O]ne, I was curious about if the library had them. I wanted to look at them. And I found some interesting information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">A. So it was a curiosity. Two, it\u2019s my inspiration. I thought that someday, after the 16th and on, that my Bible would be removed out of my classroom, so I would have the <em>Oxford [Bible] </em>from the school library <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>there. And my thinking was they\u2019re not going to remove the school library Bible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">* * * My point would be, again, inspirational. I want to have a Bible on my desk. They\u2019re not going to take the school library Bible off my desk. That was my thinking at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">{\u00b6 146} Thus, his purpose for having the school Bible on a lab table in his classroom had nothing to do with being defiant or insubordinate. As an individual who read his Bible during his personal time for inspiration and moral growth, he did not want to be deprived of that opportunity if the school authorities confiscated his personal Bible. The school board could not constitutionally preclude Freshwater from seeking religious inspiration from the school library\u2019s <em>Oxford Bible </em>or its book <em>Jesus of Nazareth. </em>Rather, the analysis articulated by the lead opinion in holding that Freshwater had a First Amendment right to have his personal copy of a Bible at his desk also applies to the books he withdrew from the school library, because his purpose for doing so is protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The presence of these school library books in the classroom cannot reasonably be viewed as an official endorsement of religion, because they are the school\u2019s own books, and thus does not justify the school board\u2019s action that encroached on Freshwater\u2019s constitutional right to personal religious exercise, let alone justify discharging him for insubordination because he had them in the classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">{\u00b6 147} Nor did Freshwater have any reason to believe that he had to remove the poster of President Bush and his cabinet, because he considered it to inspire patriotism, not religion, and it had been provided to him by the school. In addition, other members of the faculty had the same poster on display in their classrooms and offices \u2014 including Dino D\u2019Ettore, Ben Sanders, David Carter, Brian Gastin, and Timothy Keib \u2014 apparently none of whom had been ordered to remove it from display. Carter kept the poster in his office long after the board resolved to terminate Freshwater for not removing it. And faculty members testified that in their view, the poster was not a religious display. Seventh grade teacher Lori Miller thought, \u201c[W]hat an awesome poster to see men that are\u2014 that have so much power having a moment of humbleness or weakness or \u2014 you know, I just thought that was great for \u2014 especially for middle school kids to see powerful men kind of taking a time out.\u201d Former interim principal Timothy Keib called the poster \u201cnon-religious\u201d; former middle school principal Jeff Kuntz \u201cdidn\u2019t look at it as a religious poster\u201d; and intervention specialist Andrew Thompson saw it as depicting \u201cthe leader of the country and not necessarily religious connections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>{\u00b6 148} Thus, based on this and other evidence, Freshwater did not act in defiance of instructions and orders of school administrators when he failed to remove his personal Bible, school library books, or the poster of President Bush and his cabinet that the school had provided him. The conclusion that Freshwater was insubordinate for failing to remove these items is not supported by the evidence, which demonstrates that the school board singled him out to avoid defending itself against a threatened lawsuit. This is not a valid basis to terminate the teaching contract of a veteran science teacher with skill and talent whose students demonstrated their level of curriculum comprehension by their scores on the Ohio Achievement Test.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Academic Freedom</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">{\u00b6 149} The remaining cause asserted for terminating Freshwater is that he \u201cinjected his personal religious beliefs into his plan and pattern of instructing his students\u201d by exceeding the bounds of all pertinent bylaws and policies of the Mount Vernon City School District. The board referenced Freshwater\u2019s instruction on evolution as injecting Christian religious principles of creationism and intelligent design.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">{\u00b6 150} Notably, the referee in this case rejected any claim that Freshwater failed to teach any material, including evolution, as required by the Academic Content Standards, and the referee found that Freshwater\u2019s students met or exceeded the expectations for eighth grade science students regarding such mandatory subject areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">{\u00b6 151} And the Bylaws and Policies of the Mount Vernon City School District provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">The Board of Education believes that the consideration of controversial issues has a legitimate place in the instructional program of the schools.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">Properly introduced and conducted, the consideration of such issues can help students learn to identify important issues, explore fully and fairly all sides of an issue, weigh carefully the values and factors involved, and develop techniques for formulating and evaluating positions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">For purposes of this policy, a controversial issue is a topic on which opposing points of view have been promulgated by responsible opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">The Board will permit the introduction and proper educational use of controversial issues provided that their use in the instructional program:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">A. is related to the instructional goals of the course of study and level of maturity of the students;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>B. does not tend to indoctrinate or persuade students to a particular point of view;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-4\">C. encourages open-mindedness and is conducted in a spirit of scholarly inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">Controversial issues related to the program may be initiated by the students themselves provided they are presented in the ordinary course of classroom instruction and it is not substantially disruptive to the educational setting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">{\u00b6 152} The Academic Content Standards as promulgated by the State Board of Education and the Ohio Department of Education do not provide a script that teachers are required to follow when teaching core requirement subjects. Rather, the Ohio Department of Education explains that in standards-based instruction,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">teachers start with the state standards as the basis for classroom instructional planning, rather than starting with a textbook or other classroom materials. Teachers select a unit of instruction that meets the standards, benchmarks and indicators and use the standards to determine how the unit shall be designed, assessed, delivered and evaluated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Ohio Department of Education, <em>What Does Standards-Based Instruction Look Like?, </em>http://ims.ode.state.oh.us/ODE/IMS/Lessons/FAQ/planning_standards_ based-instruction_what_doesmt_look_like.asp (accessed Sept. 3, 2013). Several teachers at Mount Vernon Middle School testified that they were given \u201cwide latitude\u201d in planning their classes. One teacher explained that this allowed lesson plans to include \u201c[wjhatever * * * would enhance that standard and * * * would help the students be successful in learning the concept.\u201d Thus, Freshwater too enjoyed wide latitude in the realm of academic freedom to teach his classes in the manner he felt most effective and had the discretion to supplement the lessons with handouts and movies.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">{\u00b6 153} Importantly, teachers in public schools have a First Amendment interest in choosing a particular pedagogical method for presenting the material in the official curriculum to students. The United States Supreme Court first recognized the academic freedom of teachers in a series of cases arising from efforts to purge Communists and subversives from college campuses. <em>See, e.g., Sweezy v. New Hampshire, </em>354 U.S. 234, 250, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1 L.Ed.2d 1311 (1957) (\u201cTeachers and students must always remain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, to gain new maturity and understanding; otherwise our civilization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>will stagnate and die\u201d); <em>Barenblatt v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 109, 112, 79 S.Ct. 1081, 3 L.Ed.2d 1115 (1959) (\u201cWhen academic teaching-freedom and its corollary learning-freedom, so essential to the well-being of the Nation, are claimed, this Court will always be on the alert against intrusion by Congress into this constitutionally protected domain\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">{\u00b6 154} In <em>Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of State of New York, </em>385 U.S. 589, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967), members of the faculty of a state university challenged state laws that disqualified those who advocated the overthrow of government by force, including members of the Communist Party, from teaching. The court held that the laws chilled the exercise of First Amendment rights by not clearly informing teachers what conduct was prescribed, and it stated: \u201cOur Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom, which is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned. That freedom is therefore a special concern of the First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603. The court emphasized that \u201c \u2018[t]he vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Shelton v. Tucker, </em>364 U.S. 479, 487, 81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">{\u00b6 155} Although these prior cases dealt with academic freedom in universities and colleges, the court in <em>Epperson v. Arkansas, </em>393 U.S. 97, 107, 89 S.Ct. 266, 21 L.Ed.2d 228 (1968), applied this precedent to a state statute that barred school teachers from teaching evolutionary theory. Relying on <em>Keyishian </em>in holding the statute unconstitutional, the court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">The State\u2019s undoubted right to prescribe the curriculum for its public schools does not carry with it the right to prohibit, on pain of criminal penalty, the teaching of a scientific theory or doctrine where that prohibition is based upon reasons that violate the First Amendment. It is much too late to argue that the State may impose upon the teachers in its schools any conditions that it chooses, however restrictive they may be of constitutional guarantees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">{\u00b6 156} Thus, as the Supreme Court of Colorado observed in <em>State Bd. for Community Colleges &amp; Occupational Edn. v. Olson, </em>687 P.2d 429, 437 (Colo. 1984),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\">a teacher in a public educational institution has a constitutionally protected First Amendment interest in choosing a particular pedagogical method for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>presenting the idea-content of a course, as long as the course is part of the official curriculum of the educational institution and the teaching method serves a demonstrable educational purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">{\u00b6 157} The academic freedom of teachers also extends to the teaching of controversial subjects. It is recognized that \u201cteachers at public institutions may not be forced to surrender their rights to speak out on controversial issues as a condition of their employment.\u201d 2 Rodney A. Smolla, <em>Smolla and Nimmer on Freedom of Speech, </em>Section 17:32 (2013); <em>accord Dube v. State Univ. of New York, </em>900 F.2d 587, 597 (2d Cir.1990) (explaining that the denial of tenure or promotion in retaliation for controversial teachings viewed by some observers as racist violates the First Amendment). In accord with the principle, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals noted in <em>Zykan v. Warsaw Community School Corp., </em>631 F.2d 1300, 1305-1306 (7th Cir.1980), that local school boards may not place \u201ca flat prohibition on the mention of certain relevant topics in the classroom,\u201d forbid \u201cstudents to take an interest in subjects not directly covered by the regular curriculum,\u201d or take actions \u201cguided by an interest in imposing some religious or scientific orthodoxy or a desire to eliminate a particular kind of inquiry generally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">{\u00b6 158} More recently, in <em>C.F. ex rel. Farnan v. Capistrano Unified School Dist., </em>654 F.3d 975 (9th Cir.2011), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals considered a claim that a teacher violated the Establishment Clause by making controversial comments in class that were hostile to religion in general and to Christianity in particular. The court noted, \u201cwe are aware of no prior case holding that a teacher violated the Establishment Clause by appearing critical of religion during class lectures, nor any case with sufficiently similar facts to give a teacher \u2018fair warning\u2019 that such conduct was unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 987. And holding that the teacher lacked notice that the comments might violate the Establishment Clause, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">The Supreme Court has long recognized the importance of protecting the \u201crobust exchange of ideas\u201d in education, \u201cwhich discovers truth \u2018out of a multitude of tongues.\u2019 \u201d <em>Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents, </em>385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967) (quoting <em>United States v. Associated Press, </em>52 F.Supp. 362, 372 (S.D.N.Y.1943)). \u201cTeachers and students must always remain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, to gain new maturity and understanding * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sweezy v. New Hampshire, </em>354 U.S. 234, 250, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1 L.Ed.2d 1311 (1957)) (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>* * </em>*. This academic freedom will sometimes lead to the examination of controversial issues. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>In broaching controversial issues like religion, teachers must be sensitive to students\u2019 personal beliefs and take care not to abuse their positions of authority. * * * But teachers must also be given leeway to challenge students to foster critical thinking skills and develop their analytical abilities. This balance is hard to achieve, and we must be careful not to curb intellectual freedom by imposing dogmatic restrictions that chill teachers from adopting the pedagogical methods they believe are most effective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">(Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 988.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">{\u00b6 159} However, the academic freedom of teachers is not without limit. Local school boards are vested with the authority to establish the curriculum and the responsibility to ensure that teachers do not \u201cstray from the established curriculum by injecting religious advocacy into the classroom,\u201d such as by teaching creationism in violation of the Establishment Clause. <em>Webster v. New Lenox School Dish No. 122, </em>917 F.2d 1004, 1007 (7th Cir.1990); <em>accord Edwards v. California Univ. of Pennsylvania, </em>156 F.3d 488, 492 (3d Cir.1998) (holding that academic freedom did not permit professor\u2019s classroom tools to inject religious ideals in curriculum materials in contravention of university dictates); <em>Piggee v. Carl Sandburg College, </em>464 F.3d 667 (7th Cir.2006) (upholding decision not to renew contract of teacher who injected her religious views in cosmetology classes); <em>Helland v. S. Bend Community School Corp., </em>93 F.3d 327, 331-332 (7th Cir.1996) (concluding that substitute teacher could be removed from list of approved substitutes for failing to follow lesson plans and discussing creationism in a fifth grade science class); <em>Peloza v. Capistrano Unified School Dist., </em>37 F.3d 517, 521-522 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that biology teacher could be required by the school board to teach evolution and precluded from discussing religion with students).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">{\u00b6 160} But presenting alternative views on scientific theories as a means of challenging students to think critically is not tantamount to promoting religion in the classroom, a fact that the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Edwards v. Aguillard, </em>482 U.S. 578, 594, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 96 L.Ed.2d 510 (1987), when it stated that \u201cteaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to schoolchildren might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">{\u00b6 161} The record includes testimony from several teachers and reveals that Freshwater began the school year by teaching his students the scientific method and encouraging them to think critically and to distinguish between scientific hypothesis and established fact. Teaching students these critical analytic skills serves a secular purpose, not a religious one, and notably, the school district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>curriculum recognized that it is beneficial for science students to learn how to critically analyze aspects of scientific theory, including the theory of evolution. At the time Freshwater taught science, the Academic Content Standard for Grade 6-8 science required students to be able to \u201c[e]xplain why it is important to examine data objectively and not let bias affect observations.\u201d According to prior standards for life sciences, by the time students completed tenth grade, they should have understood \u201chow scientists continue to investigate and critically analyze aspects of evolutionary theory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">{\u00b6 162} Also, the Mount Vernon City School District Bylaws and Policies allowed teachers to address controversial issues that arose while teaching the curriculum, and an administrative guideline for that policy directed teachers to \u201chelp students use a critical thinking process * * * to examine different sides of an issue.\u201d Evolution is a controversial topic, as Freshwater\u2019s fellow eighth grade science teacher, Elle Button, recognized when she testified that students in her class \u201cwould question greatly the validity of the theory of evolution.\u201d Freshwater permitted his students to raise these questions and also to debate among themselves evolution, intelligent design, and creationism, but he did not participate in those debates. Notably, special education teacher Kerri Mahan, who observed these debates in Freshwater\u2019s classroom, testified that the students led the debates and that Freshwater stepped in only when necessary to maintain decorum.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 163} Further, the evidence vindicates Freshwater\u2019s teaching methods because it demonstrates that his students learned evolutionary theory as mandated by the official curriculum. Notably, among the building\u2019s three eighth grade science teachers for the 2007-2008 academic year \u2014 the last year Freshwater taught at Mount Vernon Middle School \u2014 only Freshwater exceeded the state goal of 75 percent of his students passing the science portion of the Ohio Achievement Test. Even more striking is the fact that 89 percent of his students passed the life science section, which assessed, among other topics, students\u2019 knowledge of evolutionary theory. In contrast, the students of the other two eighth grade science teachers achieved passage rates of 76 and 67 percent on this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 164} Deborah Strouse, the school district\u2019s achievement coordinator, explained that this passage rate shows that Freshwater \u201cdid teach the indicators\u201d contained in the Academic Content Standards. Similarly, Mahan, who also served as the school achievement coach for education, agreed that the Ohio Achievement Test is \u201ca good indicator of what the kids are actually learning\u201d because the test is based on the standards. Mahan also suggested that Freshwater\u2019s approach to teaching critical thinking skills in science may have benefited his students on the Ohio Achievement Test because the test assesses \u201cabstract thinking, synthesis, [and] evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>{\u00b6 165} In addition to this objective evidence, Mahan, who regularly attended Freshwater\u2019s classes for almost six years with her special education students, remembered him teaching the evolution section in the textbook. And Andrew Thompson, an intervention specialist who also attended Freshwater\u2019s classes, disputed the media\u2019s portrayal of Freshwater as \u201ca crazy science teacher who the rest of the staff did not care for or respect\u201d and expressed the opinion that Freshwater taught evolution effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">{\u00b6 166} Further, the record shows that Freshwater did not teach students creationism or intelligent design, either as a substitute for or an alternative to the theory of evolution. The best evidence in the case is Freshwater\u2019s own testimony: \u201cI' do not teach intelligent design. * * * I teach evolution. I do not teach ID or creationism.\u201d He denied attempting to indoctrinate students, nor did he inject his personal religious beliefs into his lessons, explaining: \u201cI do not want creationism taught in the schools. * * * [CJreationism is based on faith. Science is based on scientific method. * * * I wouldn\u2019t want my students or my own personal kids to be taught in the schools by somebody that didn\u2019t understand or didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t understand creationism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">{\u00b6 167} His students and colleagues corroborated his testimony. Various former students testified that Freshwater had never taught creationism or intelligent design in class. For instance, a classmate of the student whose parents threatened to sue the district testified that Freshwater never referred to his Bible in class and never said anything about God, intelligent design, or creationism in the classroom, and she even noted that Freshwater changed the subject when a student brought up a \u201chigher power.\u201d Three other classmates testified that Freshwater did not teach the Bible or his religious beliefs in class, and another agreed that Freshwater did not promote creationism or intelligent design. Mahan, who brought her special education students for inclusion into Freshwater\u2019s science class, stated that during the six years she attended his classes, Freshwater taught evolution without mentioning intelligent design to the students. Thompson, who also often attended Freshwater\u2019s classes as an intervention specialist, testified that he never witnessed Freshwater teach creationism or intelligent design, and former interim principal Keib observed that he never saw Freshwater \u201ctry to push his faith or his philosophical beliefs on anybody that was a student.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">{\u00b6 168} And when Freshwater proposed changing the curriculum in 2003 to adopt an Objective Origins Science Policy, his proposal sought only to \u201c[e]ncourage the presentation of scientific evidence regarding the origins of life and its diversity objectively and <em>without religious, naturalistic, or philosophic bias or assumption.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) As Freshwater explained, he meant \u201cto take a tenth grade standard and put it down to the eighth grade standard to critically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>analyze evolution.\u201d Like the tenth grade standard, his proposal distinguished the secular method of critically examining evolution from teaching intelligent design, and Freshwater confirmed that he did not intend that the proposed standard permit the teaching of religious concepts in science class.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">{\u00b6 169} Thus, the evidence in this case reveals that the school board has misint\u00e9rpreted Freshwater\u2019s effort to challenge students to think critically about evolutionary theory and instead construed his instruction as promoting intelligent design from a creationist perspective. This is a misimpression and contrary to the evidence in this case, and it is not a basis to terminate the contract of a teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">{\u00b6 170} The school board concluded that Freshwater had injected his personal religious beliefs into his plan and pattern of instruction. It apparently assumed that he could not fairly present lessons on evolution and stated that he \u201cnot only injected his subjective, biased, Christian religion based, non-scientific opinion into the instruction of eighth grade science students but also gave those students reason to doubt the accuracy and or veracity of scientists, science textbooks, and/or science in general.\u201d Yet student scores on standardized tests stand as strong, persuasive evidence of the board\u2019s faulty conclusion; those scores instead reveal that Freshwater did teach evolution as mandated by the curriculum. Moreover, teaching students to question and rethink accepted scientific theories is essential to their understanding of the scientific method, the key concept his science students learned in eighth grade. As the United States Supreme Court recognized in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 590, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), \u201carguably, there are no certainties in science,\u201d and \u201c'scientists do not assert that they know what is immutably \u201ctrue\u201d \u2014 they are committed to searching for new, temporary, theories to explain, as best they can, phenomena.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Brief for Nicolaas Bloembergen et al. as Amici Curiae at 9. Thus, there is nothing unscientific in Freshwater challenging students to critically evaluate and question the underlying premises of any scientific theory, including evolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">{\u00b6 171} In the last analysis, it is apparent that the board has taken separate, isolated instances when Freshwater allegedly made religious statements sometime between 1994 and 2008 to demonstrate that he injected his personal religious beliefs into his plan and pattern of instruction in the 2007-2008 school year.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1994, Freshwater gave students information about a seminar support<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ing the Biblical story of creation, and he also provided several handouts challenging evolutionary theory in 2002 or 2003 and in 2006 that the school board viewed as promoting intelligent design. And there is some evidence that Freshwater made off-hand remarks of a religious nature, including one reference to views on homosexuality mentioned by the school board in its termination resolution. In addition, Z.D. testified that sometime during the 2007-2008 school year, Freshwater referred to a \u201chigher being\u201d while discussing the Big Bang theory, suggested that the earth would come \u201cto a fiery end\u201d as foretold by the Bible, and said that Good Friday \u201cshould be called the greatest Friday or the best Friday ever.\u201d But those isolated statements over an extended period of time do not establish a practice of injecting religious belief into his regular classroom instruction. As the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals explained in <em>Webster, </em>917 F.2d at 1007, \u201cschool boards may not fire teachers for random classroom comments.\u201d This is especially true when, as here, the school board has not complained about religious statements or displays in classrooms of other teachers, but rather, has targeted this specific teacher only after he became the subject of a complaint and the board faced a threatened lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">{\u00b6 172} Teachers enjoy academic freedom to adopt the pedagogical methods they believe are most effective and are permitted to discuss controversial subjects with students related to the curriculum. Although local school boards have authority to establish the curriculum and may discipline teachers who stray from it by injecting religious advocacy in the classroom, they may not prohibit teachers from mentioning topics that are relevant to teaching the curriculum nor forbid students from considering issues not specifically prescribed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">{\u00b6 173} Thus, the school board violated Freshwater\u2019s First Amendment rights when it terminated his contract based on its belief that he failed to adhere to the curriculum and that he was instead teaching creationism and intelligent design. Rather, the evidence demonstrates that he encouraged students to critique the theory of evolution to foster their critical thinking skills and to develop their analytical abilities, not to inject his religious beliefs into that instruction. Further, monitoring a student-led debate on evolution, providing handouts critical of evolutionary theory, and making isolated comments over a 20-year career that could be construed as religious does not establish that Freshwater taught creationism or intelligent design in the classroom. To the contrary, the evidence shows that Freshwater excelled in teaching evolutionary theory as part of the science curriculum for eighth grade students.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AaOJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The Law Office of R.

The claim of insubordination is not proven by clear and convincing evidence, which is \u201cthat measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established.\u201d <em>Cross v. Ledford, </em>161 Ohio St. 469, 477, 120 N.E.2d 118 (1954). Thus, the school board lacked sufficient cause to terminate his contract. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and order his reinstatement with back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">{\u00b6 175} For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b726-6\">Pfeifer and Kennedy, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b724-8\">. Many of these incidents are not supported by record evidence. Administrators recalled that Freshwater distributed three \u201cunauthorized\u201d handouts between 2000 and 2007; the content of the first is unknown, the second could not be identified, and the problem with the third was that its source could not be documented. And although the board concluded that Freshwater used the movie <em>Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed </em>and the video <em>The Watchmaker </em>to challenge evolution, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>copy of <em>Expelled </em>does not appear in the record, and Freshwater did not show <em>The Watchmaker </em>in science class; rather, some of his science students saw it during a meeting of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
