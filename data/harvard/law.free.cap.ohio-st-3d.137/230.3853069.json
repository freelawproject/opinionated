A jury convicted appellant, Donna Roberts, of the aggravated murder of her former husband, Robert Fingerhut, with one death specification. The jury recommended that Roberts be sentenced to death. The trial court accepted that recommendation and sentenced her to death. However, on appeal we vacated the death sentence and remanded to the trial court for resentencing. On remand, the trial court again sentenced Roberts to death. For the following reasons, we are again compelled to vacate Roberts\u2019s sentence of death and to remand this case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 2} Our previous decision in this case sets forth the facts in detail. <em>State v. Roberts, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168, \u00b6 1-86 <em>(\u201cRoberts I</em>\u201d). For purposes of this opinion, we summarize the facts as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 3} Roberts lived with Robert Fingerhut, her former husband, in Howland Township, Trumbull County. Fingerhut, who operated Greyhound bus terminals in Warren and Youngstown, owned two insurance policies on his life, both of which named Roberts as sole beneficiary. The total benefit of the two policies was $550,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 4} At some point, Roberts began an affair with Nathaniel Jackson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2001, the affair was interrupted by Jackson\u2019s confinement in the Lorain Correctional Institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">{\u00b6 5} While Jackson was in prison, he and Roberts exchanged numerous letters and spoke on the telephone. Prison authorities recorded 18 of their telephone conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">{\u00b6 6} Passages from the Roberts-Jackson correspondence and the recorded phone conversations indicated a plot between the two to murder Fingerhut. Jackson repeatedly pledged to kill Fingerhut upon Jackson\u2019s release from prison. In one letter, Roberts complained about Fingerhut\u2019s maintaining control of her finances and urged Jackson to \u201c[d]o whatever you want to him ASAP.\u201d At Jackson\u2019s request, Roberts purchased a ski mask and a pair of gloves for Jackson to use during the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">{\u00b6 7} Jackson was released from prison on December 9, 2001. Roberts drove to Lorain to pick him up, spent that night with him in a motel, and spent much of the next two days with him as well. On December 11, 2001, Fingerhut was shot to death at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">Indictment, Trial, and Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">{\u00b6 8} Roberts was indicted on two counts of aggravated murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.01(A) (prior calculation and design) and (B) (felony murder). Both counts carried two death specifications under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7): one charging murder during an aggravated burglary and one charging murder during an aggravated robbery. The indictment also charged aggravated burglary, R.C. 2911.11, with a firearm specification, R.C. 2941.145, and aggravated robbery, R.C. 2911.01, also with a firearm specification. The jury found Roberts guilty of all counts and specifications. After trial, the state elected to proceed on Count One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>(prior calculation and design) for sentencing purposes, and the trial court dismissed Count Two (felony murder) and its specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b6 9} Before the mitigation hearing, Roberts informed her counsel that she did not wish to present any mitigating evidence except an unsworn statement. After a hearing pursuant to <em>State v. Ashworth, 85 </em>Ohio St.3d 56, 706 N.E.2d 1231 (1999), paragraph one of the syllabus, the trial judge determined that Roberts was competent to make that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 10} At the mitigation hearing, Roberts exercised her right under R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) to make an unsworn statement to the jury. She elected to present no other evidence. In compliance with Roberts\u2019s instructions, defense counsel waived opening statement and closing argument. The jury recommended a death sentence, and the trial court sentenced Roberts to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Previous Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">{\u00b6 11} On direct appeal, we affirmed Roberts\u2019s convictions of aggravated murder and both death specifications. We also overruled a proposition of law in which Roberts attacked the validity of her waiver of mitigation. However, we vacated the death sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing because the trial judge had improperly allowed the prosecutor to participate in drafting the sentencing opinion and in doing so, had engaged in ex parte communications with the prosecutor. <em>Roberts I, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168, at \u00b6 153-164. We directed the trial court \u201cto afford Roberts her right to allocute,\u201d to \u201cpersonally review and evaluate the evidence [and] weigh the aggravating circumstances against any relevant mitigating evidence,\u201d and to \u201cdetermine anew the appropriateness of the death penalty.\u201d We further instructed the trial court to \u201cpersonally prepare an entirely new penalty opinion * * * and conduct whatever other proceedings are required by law and consistent with this opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Sentencing Proceedings on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">{\u00b6 12} On remand, the defense filed a motion to allow Roberts to fully present mitigation at the sentencing rehearing. The trial court denied the motion. However, Roberts proffered her evidence into the record. This consisted of her prison records, a Social Security disability claim file documenting Roberts\u2019s head injury after a 1999 motor-vehicle accident, an affidavit by a psychologist giving his preliminary opinion that Roberts suffered from Bipolar Type II Disorder (manic-depressive illness), and a letter about Roberts from her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">{\u00b6 13} At a hearing on October 22, 2007, the trial court heard Roberts\u2019s allocution. One week later, after asking Roberts if she had anything further to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>say, and after hearing argument from defense counsel, the trial court sentenced Roberts to death and filed its sentencing opinion pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">{\u00b6 14} Roberts presents seven propositions of law for our consideration. Her second proposition of law, which claims that the trial court failed to consider her allocution in sentencing her to death, has merit. Accordingly, we sustain it, and we remand this case to the trial court for consideration of Roberts\u2019s allocution when weighing the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">I. Exclusion of Mitigating Evidence on Limited Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">{\u00b6 15} In her first proposition of law, Roberts contends that the trial court erred by precluding her from presenting mitigating evidence on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">{\u00b6 16} Before the resentencing hearing, Roberts filed a motion to allow her to present mitigation at the resentencing hearing. In her motion, Roberts argued that she was entitled to \u201cfully develop her mitigation for the evaluation of [the trial court] at her sentencing re-hearing.\u201d The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">{\u00b6 17} After the motion was denied, the defense proffered the following four items, which would have been adduced in mitigation had the trial court granted the motion:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">{\u00b6 18} (1) Roberts\u2019s prison records, which document her bipolar disorder, depression, and an incident of hallucination during her time in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">{\u00b6 19} (2) A file documenting a Social Security disability claim that Roberts had filed after being injured in a 1999 motor-vehicle accident. This file also contains a diagnosis that Roberts suffered from a bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">{\u00b6 20} (3) An affidavit by James Eisenberg, Ph.D., a psychologist, who had reviewed Roberts\u2019s records and formed a preliminary opinion that Roberts suffered from Bipolar Type II Disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, probably beginning in childhood. According to Dr. Eisenberg, this disorder \u201ccauses unusual shifts in a person\u2019s mood, energy, and ability to function.\u201d Its symptoms include poor judgment; aggressive behavior; extreme irritability; inappropriate, intense, or uncontrolled anger; and \u201cfrantic efforts to avoid abandonment, either real or imagined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">{\u00b6 21} (4) A letter from Michael Raymond, Roberts\u2019s son, extolling his mother\u2019s character, setting forth some of the history of her life before the murder, and pleading that her life be spared.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">{\u00b6 22} Roberts contends that the trial court\u2019s refusal to consider this proffered evidence before resentencing her violated the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">A. Roberts\u2019s Eighth Amendment Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b443-16\">{\u00b6 23} It is a well-established tenet of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence that the sentencer in a capital case may \u201cnot be precluded from considering, <em>as a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>mitigating factor, </em>any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (plurality opinion). Moreover, \u201c[j]ust as the State may not by statute preclude the sentencer from considering any mitigating factor, neither may the sentencer refuse to consider, <em>as a matter of law, </em>any relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 113-114, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982). <em>See also Hitchcock v. Dugger, </em>481 U.S. 393, 398-399, 107 S.Ct. 1821, 95 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>Skipper v. South Carolina, </em>476 U.S. 1, 4-5, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986), the court held that a capital defendant had an Eighth Amendment right to introduce, at his sentencing hearing, \u201ctestimony * * * regarding his good behavior during the over seven months he spent in jail awaiting trial.\u201d Such evidence was \u201crelevant evidence in mitigation\u201d because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">the jury could have drawn favorable inferences from this testimony regarding petitioner\u2019s character and his probable future conduct if sentenced to life in prison. * * * [T]here is no question but that such inferences would be \u201cmitigating\u201d in the sense that they might serve \u201cas a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d * * * [Ejvidence that the defendant would not pose a danger if spared (but incarcerated) must be considered potentially mitigating. Under <em>Eddings, </em>such evidence may not be excluded from the sentencer\u2019s consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\"><em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Lockett </em>at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 25} Roberts contends that the trial court committed constitutional error by denying her motion to allow full presentation of mitigation at the resentencing, because the Eighth Amendment \u2014 as interpreted in <em>Lockett, Eddings, </em>and <em>Skipper</em>\u2014entitled her to introduce mitigating evidence before the trial judge on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">{\u00b6 26} We rejected a similar claim in <em>State v. Davis, </em>63 Ohio St.3d 44, 584 N.E.2d 1192 (1992) <em>(\u201cDavis II\"). </em>Davis had been tried to a three-judge panel and sentenced to death in 1984. <em>State v. Davis, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 361, 528 N.E.2d 925 (1988) <em>{\u201cDavis I </em>\u201d). On Davis\u2019s initial appeal, we \u201caffirmed [his] conviction, but * * * reversed [his] death sentence based upon errors which occurred after all available mitigating evidence had been heard in the penalty phase of [his] trial.\u201d <em>Davis II </em>at 44. We then remanded the case to the original three-judge panel for a resentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>{\u00b6 27} At the hearing on remand, the trial court did not permit Davis to introduce evidence concerning his adjustment to prison life after his conviction and sentencing. Nor was Davis permitted to present expert testimony providing a \u201c \u2018psychological update\u2019 \u201d covering the period since his conviction and sentencing. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the panel \u201climit[ed] its consideration to the evidence presented in mitigation at appellant\u2019s 1984 trial\u201d and reimposed the death sentence on Davis. <em>Id. </em>at 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 28} We affirmed, rejecting Davis\u2019s argument that <em>Lockett, Eddings, Skipper, </em>and <em>Hitchcock </em>entitled him to a new sentencing hearing. We distinguished <em>Skipper </em>by noting that it involved the erroneous exclusion of \u201cevidence of Skipper\u2019s good prison record <em>between his arrest and trial.\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>at 46. In contrast,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">no relevant mitigating evidence was excluded from consideration by the panel during the mitigation phase of appellant\u2019s 1984 trial. All mitigating evidence which was available at that time was duly received and considered by the panel including appellant\u2019s ability to adjust to prison life. That same relevant evidence was again received and considered by the panel in 1989 for purposes of resentencing appellant. The evidence excluded from consideration * * * at appellant\u2019s resentencing hearing concerned certain <em>post-trial </em>matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">(Emphasis sic.) <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">{\u00b6 29} We considered the same issue in <em>State v. Chinn, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 548, 709 N.E.2d 1166 (1999). In <em>Chinn, </em>the defendant was sentenced to death after a jury trial. The court of appeals determined, however, that the trial judge had committed errors in performing his functions under R.C. 2929.03(D)(3) and (F)\u2014 i.e., in his independent evaluation of the sentence and in writing the sentencing opinion. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment as to all other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">{\u00b6 30} Like the appellant in <em>Davis, </em>Chinn argued that <em>Lockett, Skipper, </em>and <em>Hitchcock </em>entitled him to present new mitigating evidence on remand. We again rejected that argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-11\">[Ejach of those cases involved a situation where the capital sentencer was prohibited, in some form or another, from considering relevant mitigating evidence at trial. * * * [N]o relevant mitigating evidence was ever excluded from consideration during the penalty phase of [Chinn\u2019s] 1989 trial. Therefore, the case at bar is clearly distinguishable from * * * <em>Lockett, Skipper, </em>and <em>Hitchcock. </em>Accordingly, as was the case in <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>Davis </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 44, 46, 584 N.E.2d 1192, 1194-1195, we find <em>Lockett, Skipper, </em>and <em>Hitchcock </em>to be inapplicable here. It is of no consequence that the additional mitigating evidence in <em>Davis </em>involved <em>post-trial </em>accomplishments, whereas appellant\u2019s additional mitigation evidence involves matters appellant claims he could have presented but did not present during the mitigation phase of his 1989 trial. In this case, as in <em>Davis, </em>the errors requiring resentencing occurred after the close of the mitigation phase of the trial. Under these circumstances, the trial court is to proceed on remand from the point at which the error occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><em>Chinn </em>at 564-565.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 31} Since our decision in <em>Chinn, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has addressed this issue in habeas corpus proceedings involving the <em>Davis </em>case. In <em>Davis v. Coyle, </em>475 F.3d 761 (6th Cir.2007), the Sixth Circuit held that the three-judge panel\u2019s decision to exclude posttrial mitigation evidence from Davis\u2019s resentencing hearing violated his Eighth Amendment rights and that our affirmance of that ruling in <em>Davis II, </em>\u201cbased on the court\u2019s belief that the facts of Davis\u2019s case could be distinguished from Skipper\u2019s solely on the basis of timing, was both an unreasonable application of the decision in <em>Skipper </em>and contrary to the holding in that opinion and its antecedent cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 32} <em>Coyle </em>states that \u201cthe holding in <em>Skipper </em>that a defendant \u2018be permitted to present any and all relevant mitigating evidence that is available\u2019 * * * requires that, at resentencing, a trial court must consider any new evidence that the defendant has developed since the initial sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 774, quoting <em>Skipper, </em>476 U.S. at 8, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1. <em>Accord Creech v. Arave, </em>947 F.2d 873, 881-882 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc); <em>Sivak v. State, </em>112 Idaho 197, 199-203, 731 P.2d 192 (1986). <em>See also Spaziano v. Singletary, </em>36 F.3d 1028, 1032-1035 (11th Cir.1994) (assuming, without discussion, that <em>Lockett </em>requires a trial court to allow new evidence on remand); <em>State v. Tison, </em>160 Ariz. 501, 502, 774 P.2d 805 (1989) (case remanded for resentencing; remand order specified, without discussion, that \u201c[ejither party may offer additional evidence of aggravation or mitigation applicable in each case as of the time of the hearing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 33} As the state points out, we are \u201cnot bound by rulings on federal statutory or constitutional law made by a federal court other than the United States Supreme Court.\u201d <em>State v. Burnett, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 419, 424, 755 N.E.2d 857 (2001). Hence, we are not obliged to follow <em>Coyle. </em>We are, however, free to consider whether <em>Coyle </em>is persuasive and whether it is on point in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">{\u00b6 34} We begin by noting, as we did in <em>Davis II </em>and <em>Chinn, </em>that <em>Lockett, Eddings, Skipper, </em>and <em>Hitchcock </em>are all distinguishable from this case. Each case in the <em>Lockett-Eddings-Skipper-Hitchcock </em>tetralogy involved the trial court\u2019s exclusion of, or refusal to consider, evidence in the original sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>proceeding. None of these cases involved a proceeding on remand. This case, like <em>Davis II </em>and <em>Chinn, </em>involves a proceeding on remand for the limited purpose of correcting an error that occurred <em>after </em>the defendant had had a full, unlimited opportunity to present mitigating evidence to the sentencer.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 35} In other words, neither <em>Lockett </em>nor any of its progeny required the trial court to reopen the evidence after an error-free evidentiary hearing had already taken place. <em>See Chinn, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 564-565, 709 N.E.2d 1166. \u201c[T]he issue in this case is whether the presentation of evidence of mitigating * * * factors must be reopened when a death sentence is reversed for a reason unrelated to the presentation of evidence. None of the Supreme Court cases cited by the majority supports that premise.\u201d <em>Coyle, </em>475 F.3d at 782 (Gibbons, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 36} In a case in which the defendant was not deprived of any constitutional right \u2014 including her Eighth Amendment right to present mitigation \u2014 at the time of her mitigation hearing, there seenis to be no basis for requiring the trial court to reopen or supplement that evidence in a later proceeding. To hold, as <em>Coyle </em>does, that a new mitigation hearing must be held, even though no constitutional error infected the original one, would transform the right to present relevant mitigation into a right to <em>update </em>one\u2019s mitigation. Such a right has no clear basis in <em>Lockett </em>or its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">{\u00b6 37} Establishing a right to update mitigation could result in arbitrary distinctions between similarly situated capital defendants. A defendant who had an error-free mitigation hearing could not update his mitigation \u2014 no matter how compelling the new mitigation that might be available to him \u2014 if the trial judge committed no error <em>after </em>the mitigation hearing that called for the case to be remanded. But another defendant, whose mitigation hearing was equally free of error, <em>would </em>have the right to update his mitigation in the event that a posthearing sentencing error took place that required a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">{\u00b6 38} Furthermore, as we noted in <em>Davis II, </em>the right to update mitigation would imply that-a capital defendant appealing his death sentence would have a right to present new mitigation to the appellate court. <em>Davis II, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 46, 584 N.E.2d 1192, fn. 2. Under R.C. 2929.05(A), this court (and, in pre-1995 cases, the court of appeals) has the obligation to independently review the death sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, a reviewing court could be considered a \u201csentencer\u201d for <em>Lockett </em>purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">{\u00b6 39} For the foregoing reasons, we adhere to our precedent in <em>Davis II </em>and <em>Chinn. </em>Accordingly, we reject Roberts\u2019s claim that the Eighth Amendment required the trial court to admit Roberts\u2019s proffered mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>B. The Trial Court\u2019s Compliance with the Remand Order in <em>Roberts I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 40} Having rejected Roberts\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim, we will briefly consider certain points not argued by Roberts, but set forth in the concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 41} The concurring and dissenting opinion asserts that by refusing to admit Roberts\u2019s proffered mitigation evidence, the trial court failed to comply with the instructions we issued in <em>Roberts I </em>when we remanded this case to the trial court for the first time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 99. The concurring and dissenting opinion interprets <em>Roberts I </em>as <em>ordering </em>the trial court to hold a new mitigation hearing and to permit Roberts to introduce mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 42} <em>Roberts I </em>did no such thing. In <em>Roberts I, </em>we instructed the trial court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">On remand, the trial judge will afford Roberts her right to allocute, and the trial court shall personally review and evaluate the evidence, weigh the aggravating circumstances against any relevant mitigating evidence, and determine anew the appropriateness of the death penalty as required by R.C. 2929.03. The trial court will then personally prepare an entirely new penalty opinion as required by R.C. 2929.03(F) and conduct whatever other proceedings are required by law and consistent with this opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168, at \u00b6 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">{\u00b6 43} The above order says nothing about holding a new evidentiary hearing. Nor is a requirement to hold a new evidentiary hearing implicit in our instructing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>the trial court to \u201cweigh the aggravating circumstances against any relevant mitigating evidence\u201d and \u201cdetermine anew the appropriateness of the death penalty.\u201d Relevant mitigating evidence may be found in the guilt phase, as well as in the penalty phase. Indeed, R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) <em>requires </em>the trial court to consider \u201cany evidence raised at trial\u201d that is relevant \u201cto any factors in mitigation of the imposition of the sentence of death.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">{\u00b6 44} Moreover, the remand order in <em>Roberts I </em>must be read against the backdrop of our precedents in <em>Davis II </em>and <em>Chinn. </em>In <em>Davis II, </em>a death sentence had been reversed, and the case remanded for resentencing, because of errors that occurred after mitigating evidence had been heard in the penalty phase. On appeal from remand, we rejected the claim that the trial court had erred by limiting its consideration to the evidence presented in the original mitigation hearing. <em>Davis II, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 45-46, 584 N.E.2d 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">{\u00b6 45} In <em>Chinn, </em>we adhered to <em>Davis II </em>and held that when \u201cerrors requiring resentencing occurred after the close of the mitigation phase,\u201d the correct procedure was for the trial court \u201cto proceed on remand from the point at which the error occurred.\u201d <em>Chinn, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 565, 709 N.E.2d 1166. Indeed, we stated that \u201cthe trial court was <em>required </em>to proceed on remand from the point at which the errors had occurred, i.e., after the jury had returned its recommendation of death.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b6 46} The trial court was bound by those precedents, as well as by our remand order in <em>Roberts I. Roberts I </em>neither overruled nor modified <em>Davis II </em>or <em>Chinn </em>and did not order the trial court to hold a new penalty-phase evidentiary hearing. Thus, <em>Roberts I </em>cannot reasonably be understood as imposing a requirement that <em>Davis II </em>and <em>Chinn </em>had expressly declined to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b6 47} The concurring and dissenting opinion also points out that Roberts \u201cproffered four items in mitigation, only one of which dealt with her conduct in prison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 99. While this is true, it lends no support to the claim that she should have been allowed a fresh opportunity to submit mitigating evidence on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 48} As we stated in <em>Chinn, </em>\u201c[i]t is of no consequence that the additional mitigating evidence in <em>Davis </em>involved <em>post-trial </em>accomplishments, whereas appellant\u2019s additional mitigation evidence involves matters appellant claims he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>have presented but did not present during the mitigation phase of his 1989 trial.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Chinn, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 564-565, 709 N.E.2d 1166. In <em>neither </em>case is a capital defendant entitled to present such evidence on remand when \u201cthe errors requiring resentencing occurred after the close of the mitigation phase of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 49} Additionally, mitigation evidence pertaining to events that took place before trial could have been presented to the trial court during Roberts\u2019s original mitigation hearing in 2003. Instead of doing so at that time, Roberts expressly and validly waived her right to present mitigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the case for admitting proffered mitigation involving events that took place before trial is, if anything, weaker than the case for admitting posttrial prison records.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">{\u00b6 50} For all of the foregoing reasons, we overrule Roberts\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">II. The Trial Court\u2019s Failure to Consider Roberts\u2019s Allocution</p>\n<p id=\"Azy\">{\u00b6 51} In her second proposition of law, Roberts contends that the trial court failed to consider her allocution in determining the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">{\u00b6 52} Pursuant to our mandate, the trial judge invited Roberts to make a statement in allocution at the hearing on October 22, 2007, and Roberts did. One week later, on October 29, the trial court imposed sentence and filed its sentencing opinion. Before imposing sentence, the trial court heard a brief statement from Roberts\u2019s counsel and asked Roberts if she had anything further to say. The trial court then stated that it had considered the record and the oral statements. The sentencing opinion notes that the trial court had been instructed to provide Roberts with the right of allocution before reimposing a sentence. Beyond this, however, the opinion does not discuss Roberts\u2019s allocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">{\u00b6 53} Roberts contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to discuss the allocution in its opinion shows that the trial court failed to consider her allocution. This alleged failure, Roberts claims, violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s requirement that the sentencer in a capital case consider all relevant mitigation. <em>See Eddings, </em>455 U.S. at 113-114, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">{\u00b6 54} We have previously rejected claims that a trial court\u2019s failure to <em>mention </em>particular mitigating factors in a sentencing opinion obliges a reviewing court to infer that the trial court failed to <em>consider </em>those factors. \u201cAppellant erroneously assumes that evidence that is not specifically mentioned in an opinion was not considered. While a sentencing court must consider all evidence of mitigation, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>need not discuss each [allegedly mitigating] factor individually.\u201d <em>State v. Phillips, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 72, 102, 656 N.E.2d 643 (1995), citing <em>Parker v. Dugger, </em>498 U.S. 308, 314-315, 111 S.Ct. 731, 112 L.Ed.2d 812 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">{\u00b6 55} Nevertheless, we conclude that the particular circumstances of this case warrant the inference that the trial judge did, in fact, fail to consider Roberts\u2019s allocution in sentencing her to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">{\u00b6 56} To begin with, Roberts\u2019s allocution was the <em>only </em>relevant matter that was specifically placed before the trial court as mitigation. At her original mitigation hearing in 2003, Roberts had elected to present no evidence. Although she had given an unsworn statement before the jury, that statement contained no mitigation; indeed, Roberts had used it to insist that a sentence of death be imposed upon her. <em>See Roberts I, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168, at \u00b6 137 and 148. And although Roberts tried to present mitigating evidence during the proceedings on remand, that attempt was (properly, as we hold today) overruled by the trial court. The trial court did find one mitigating factor in the guilt-phase record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But this merely underscores the fact that <em>nothing </em>was placed before the trial court for the specific purpose of mitigating the sentence \u2014 except Roberts\u2019s statement in allocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">{\u00b6 57} And this statement contained much information whose relevance as mitigation was clear. For instance, Roberts stated that she grew up in a \u201cvery very abusive\u201d household, in which her father abused her mother physically and verbally and in which \u201cguns came out\u201d at times during household disputes. Roberts claimed that when she was very young, her cousin raped her. Roberts also said that she \u201calways felt empty\u201d because she never received any attention or affection.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">{\u00b6 58} Roberts recounted a long history of motor-vehicle accidents and resulting injuries, including injuries to her head, that she claimed affected her mental health. In 1963, 1983, and 1999, Roberts said, she was involved in accidents serious enough to put her in the hospital. After the 1963 accident, she said, she was \u201cspaeey for awhile.\u201d In the 1983 collision, she was thrown through a windshield. She went to a neurosurgeon for many months after that accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">{\u00b6 59} In 1999, Roberts was involved in an accident that demolished her car. Roberts remembered being in the hospital, but after that she could not remember anything \u201cfor a long time.\u201d Roberts said that Fingerhut \u201cwas really worried\u201d about her because she was acting \u201cspaeey\u201d and \u201cgoofy.\u201d After this last accident, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Roberts stated, she suffered from depression. She attempted suicide and was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward. She suffered from auditory hallucinations that were successfully treated with Risperdal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">{\u00b6 60} After the suicide attempt, Roberts began falling down repeatedly, hitting her head, and losing track of what day it was. Eventually, Roberts said, Fingerhut made her \u201cgo to Social Security,\u201d and she was sent to a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">{\u00b6 61} In her allocution, Roberts also cited examples of her selflessness and contributions to society. Roberts worked \u201calmost 23 years\u201d in a plastic surgeon\u2019s office and \u201chelped a lot of people\u201d during that time. She also volunteered to go to Israel, along with her employer, to treat wounded soldiers. She recounted how, after her conversion to Judaism, she had raised funds to rescue a person from Ethiopia who was in danger of being murdered for his religious beliefs. She said that when she ran the restaurant in the bus terminal, she gave food and money to people who were short of money at the end of the month. She also gave several thousand dollars to help her sisters and her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">{\u00b6 62} <em>Lockett </em>explains that the category of relevant mitigating factors includes \u201cany aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d 438 U.S. at 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973. A court may \u201cexclude, as irrelevant, evidence not bearing on the defendant\u2019s character, prior record, or the circumstances of his offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, fn. 12. <em>See also Brown v. Payton, </em>544 U.S. 133, 149-150, 125 S.Ct. 1432, 161 L.Ed.2d 334 (2005) (Souter, J., dissenting) (\u201cit was settled law that a capital defendant has a plenary right to present evidence going to any aspect of [the defendant\u2019s] character, background, or record * * * that might justify a sentence less than death\u201d); <em>Skipper v. South Carolina, </em>476 U.S. 1, 4, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986). The information contained in Roberts\u2019s allocution was clearly relevant under this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">{\u00b6 63} We note, too, that our opinion in <em>Roberts I </em>specifically called the matter of allocution to the attention of the trial judge. When we remanded this case to the trial court, we did so with the following instruction: \u201cThe trial court shall provide Roberts with her right of allocution before imposing any new sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Roberts I, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168, at \u00b6 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>{\u00b6 64} When we consider the presence of relevant and potentially significant mitigation in Roberts\u2019s allocution, the utter lack of anything else offered for the specific purpose of mitigation, and our order specifically calling the matter of allocution to the trial judge\u2019s attention, we can hardly conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to mention the allocution in its sentencing opinion was a mere oversight. Given these unusual circumstances, we are justified in drawing the inference that when the trial judge weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors, he did not consider Roberts\u2019s allocution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 65} This failure violated the Eighth Amendment. Unquestionably, the allocution contained information relevant to mitigation. That information (unlike the evidence discussed in relation to Roberts\u2019s first proposition of law) was properly before the court. The court could not, therefore, refuse to consider it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cThe sentencer * * * may determine the weight to be given relevant mitigating evidence. But [it] may not give it no weight by excluding such evidence from [its] consideration.\u201d <em>Eddings, </em>455 U.S. at 114-115, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">{\u00b6 66} Our decisions have acknowledged the importance of allocution in capital cases. In <em>State v. Campbell, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 320, 323-326, 738 N.E.2d 1178 (2000), and <em>State v. Green, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 352, 358-360, 738 N.E.2d 1208 (2000), we remanded capital cases for resentencing because the trial courts had failed to comply with Crim.R. 32(A)(1). \u201cTrial courts must painstakingly adhere to' Crim.R. 32, guaranteeing the right of allocution. A Crim.R. 32 inquiry is much more than an empty ritual: it represents a defendant\u2019s last opportunity to plead his case or express remorse.\u201d <em>Green </em>at 359-360. In a capital case, the denial of allocution can undermine the \u201cconstitutional reliability\u201d of a death sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">{\u00b6 67} We recognize, as the dissent notes at \u00b6 114, that the allocution under Crim.R. 32(A)(1) is unsworn and thus may not technically amount to evidence. <em>See </em>Evid.R. 603 (witness testimony must be preceded by oath or affirmation). However, the dissent concludes that the information contained therein is therefore not relevant to weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors. Dissenting opinion at \u00b6 110 and 116. This conclusion is incorrect. In the context of capital sentencing, as <em>Lockett </em>makes plain, relevant information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>has to do with content, not form. We do not believe that a sentencer is licensed to ignore constitutionally relevant mitigating factors brought before the sentencer in accordance with state law, simply because they come labeled \u201callocution\u201d instead of \u201cevidence.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">{\u00b6 68} <em>People v. Davis, </em>794 P.2d 159 (Colo.1990), exemplifies this point. In <em>Davis, </em>the trial court had instructed the jury that the defendant\u2019s penalty-phase unsworn statement<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was not evidence. The Colorado Supreme Court recognized that this was \u201ctechnically correct\u201d because the statement, which was unsworn, was not evidence under Colorado law. However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">in the sentencing phase of a capital case, the jury is not limited to consideration of matters technically defined as evidence. In making the profoundly moral decision of whether to impose a sentence of death, it must consider all the facts and. circumstances of the crime, the defendant\u2019s background and character and any mitigating factors raised by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 192. The court then proceeded to evaluate the likelihood that a reasonable juror would interpret the trial court\u2019s instructions to prevent consideration of the defendant\u2019s statement. <em>Id. </em>at 192-193. Even though the defendant\u2019s unsworn statement lacked the status of evidence under Colorado evidentiary law, <em>Davis </em>regarded that statement as \u201cconstitutionally relevant evidence\u201d for Eighth Amendment purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">[O]ur examination of the instructions as a whole, as well as the context of the sentencing hearing, leads us to conclude that there is not a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that the jury applied instructions No. 1 and No. 4 in a manner preventing it from considering constitutionally relevant evidence. On the contrary, reasonable jurors would have properly understood that they should consider fully the statement offered by the defendant in allocution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>(Footnote omitted.) 794 P.2d at 193. We cannot, therefore, agree with the dissent\u2019s contention that \u201c[b]ecause the allocution offered by Roberts prior to the imposition of sentence is not evidence, it has no significance in establishing any mitigating factor.\u201d Dissenting opinion at \u00b6 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b6 69} For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court failed to consider Roberts\u2019s allocution and that this error violated the Eighth Amendment. That leaves us with the question of how to remedy the error. In <em>Phillips, </em>we stated: \u201c[E]ven if \u2018the trial court in this case should have more explicitly analyzed the mitigating evidence,\u2019 this court\u2019s independent reweighing will rectify the error.\u201d 74 Ohio St.3d at 102, 656 N.E.2d 643, quoting <em>State v. Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 160, 171, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 70} In <em>State v. Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 239, 473 N.E.2d 768 (1984), we used independent review to rectify a trial court\u2019s failure to enunciate its reasoning. There, we observed that the very purpose of an independent appellate review of death sentences is, \u201cat least in part, to correct such omissions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">{\u00b6 71} However, we also cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">In so holding, we do not intend to trivialize the duty of the trial court under R.C. 2929.03(F) to articulate its reasoning or to suggest that such an omission is insignificant. It is not. The failure of a trial court to comply with this aspect of R.C. 2929.03(F) disrupts the review procedures enacted by the General Assembly by depriving the defendant and subsequent reviewing courts of the trial court\u2019s perceptions as to the weight accorded all relevant circumstances. In a closer case, those perceptions could make a difference in the manner in which a defendant pursues his appeal and in which a reviewing court makes its determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">{\u00b6 72} This case presents the closer call that we anticipated in <em>Maurer.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We find that the sentencing opinion is so inadequate as to severely handicap our ability to exercise our power of independent review. Accordingly, we must vacate Roberts\u2019s sentence of death and remand this ease for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">{\u00b6 73} On remand, the trial court is to review the entire record, including Roberts\u2019s allocution of October 22, 2007. The trial court shall consider the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>record \u2014 again, including the allocution \u2014 in determining whether the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court shall then write and file a sentencing opinion pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(F) reflecting that it has complied with these instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">{\u00b6 74} In accordance with our holding as to Roberts\u2019s first proposition of law, Roberts is not entitled to present any further evidence on remand. Moreover, because Roberts has been given her opportunity to make allocution pursuant to Crim.R. 32, she is not entitled to make another one.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 75} Finally, while the trial court must consider Roberts\u2019s allocution, nothing in today\u2019s opinion should be interpreted as a determination that the matters discussed in her allocution are true or that the trial court must afford them any particular weight. It is for the trial court to determine in the first instance what mitigating factors, if any, are present in the case, and what weight, if any, they should be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 76} Roberts\u2019s second proposition of law is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">III. Nonstatutory Aggravating Circumstances in Sentencing Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 77} In her third proposition of law, Roberts contends that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion demonstrates that the trial court erroneously considered nonstatutory aggravating circumstances in sentencing her to death. Inasmuch as the trial court, on remand, will be required to write a new sentencing opinion, we find that Roberts\u2019s third proposition of law is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">IV. Denial of Recusal Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">{\u00b6 78} In her fourth proposition of law, Roberts contends that the trial judge should have recused himself from her resentencing. However, - during the pendency of this appeal, the trial judge died. Because we are remanding this case for resentencing, which necessarily will be conducted by a different judge, we find that Roberts\u2019s fourth proposition of law is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">V. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">{\u00b6 79} In her fifth proposition of law, Roberts contends that her counsel rendered ineffective assistance at her 2003 mitigation hearing. She argues that her counsel \u201cfail[ed] to fully investigate and present all possible evidence of mitigation.\u201d Specifically, Roberts complains that trial counsel failed to discover and present information contained in her Social Security file and in a letter to the trial court written by her son, both of which she proffered to the trial court on remand in 2007. The state argues that Roberts\u2019s current ineffective-assistance claim with regard to the mitigation hearing is barred by res judicata, inasmuch as Roberts did not raise it on her original appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>{\u00b6 80} In light of our disposition remanding this ease to the trial court for resentencing, we decline to address Roberts\u2019s fifth proposition of law at this time. If Roberts receives a death sentence on resentencing, the parties may present these arguments (including the state\u2019s res judicata argument) to us for review on the ensuing direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">VI. Competency to Stand Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 81} Roberts\u2019s sixth and seventh propositions of law address her competency to stand trial during the mitigation hearing in 2003 and during the resentencing proceedings on remand in 2007. <em>See generally </em>R.C. 2945.37 (establishing standards and procedures for adjudicating defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">A. Competency during the 2007 Resentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">{\u00b6 82} A defendant is competent to stand trial if she has sufficient present ability to consult with her lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and has a rational as well as a factual understanding of the proceedings against her. <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960). In her sixth proposition of law, Roberts contends that the state failed to prove that she met the standard of competency during her 2007 resentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">{\u00b6 83} Roberts contends that \u201c[t]he trial court may not conduct a sentencing hearing for a death-eligible defendant where the record does not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is legally competent,\u201d that \u201cthere was insufficient evidence of her ability to assist counsel in preparation for the hearing,\u201d and that <em>\u201c[w]ithout evidence </em>that Roberts <em>could </em>properly assist counsel, the [sentencing] hearing should not have been conducted.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">{\u00b6 84} Roberts\u2019s argument misallocates the burden of persuasion. R.C. 2945.37(G) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">A defendant is presumed to be competent to stand trial. If, after a hearing, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that, because of the defendant\u2019s present mental condition, the defendant is incapable of understanding the nature and objective of the proceedings against the defendant or of assisting in the defendant\u2019s defense, the court shall find the defendant incompetent to stand trial and shall enter an order authorized by section 2945.38 of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">Thus, the question is not whether the state introduced sufficient evidence to prove Roberts competent, but whether a preponderance of the evidence proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>that she was <em>not </em>competent. <em>See State v. Were, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 45; <em>State v. Jordan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 216, 2004-Ohio-783, 804 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 28; <em>State v. Hicks, </em>43 Ohio St.3d 72, 79, 538 N.E.2d 1030 (1989). <em>See also Medina v. California, </em>505 U.S. 437, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 120 L.Ed.2d 353 (1992) (assigning defendant burden of proving incompetency does not violate due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">{\u00b6 85} The trial court appointed Dr. Thomas Gazley, a psychologist with the Forensic Psychiatric Center of Northeast Ohio, to conduct a competency evaluation. Dr. Gazley interviewed Roberts, had conversations with her defense attorneys and with the director of mental-health services at the Ohio Reformatory for Women, where Roberts was incarcerated, and reviewed her mental-health chart from the reformatory. Dr. Gazley was the sole witness at the hearing on Roberts\u2019s competency. After he testified, his report was admitted without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 86} Dr. Gazley testified that Roberts had the ability to \u201cunderstand the sentencing process and * * * to understand what the alternatives available are to her as well as * * * to provide her counsel with any mitigating circumstances, should she desire to do so.\u201d He concluded that based on her ability to interact with him and to provide information and a coherent account of her perceptions about the situation, she would be able to do so with her defense counsel as well. Dr. Gazley further testified: \u201c[W]hen I saw [Roberts] earlier this year, she was very coherent, her comments and responses to my questions were very relevant and * * * to the point.\u201d Dr. Gazley noted in his report that Roberts\u2019s \u201cmemory for both recent and remote events is intact\u201d and that she \u201cmaintains the capacity for abstract thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">{\u00b6 87} Dr. Gazley knew that Roberts had been involved in a number of automobile accidents and had had several head injuries. He also knew that she had been diagnosed with depression and that she had engaged in suicidal thinking, which he attributed to her depression. However, Dr. Gazley testified that Roberts\u2019s depression had responded to treatment; by the time he saw her, her symptoms were in remission, and \u201c[s]he was progressively getting better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">{\u00b6 88} Dr. Gazley\u2019s report states that his opinion, reached \u201cwith reasonable psychological certainty,\u201d is that Roberts \u201ccurrently has the cognitive ability and functioning to understand, in a general way, the penalties that could or will be imposed as a result of her conviction\u201d and that she \u201chas the capacity to communicate relevant facts in mitigation to her attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">{\u00b6 89} Roberts argues that there was no testimony relevant to the issue of Roberts\u2019s ability to work with and assist counsel. Even if that were so, Roberts could not prevail, because competency is presumed and the defense bears the burden of proving incompetency. R.C. 2945.37(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>{\u00b6 90} However, Dr. Gazley\u2019s testimony was relevant to the criteria for competency, including Roberts\u2019s ability to assist counsel. Dr. Gazley testified that Roberts was able to understand the sentencing process and what alternatives were available and to provide mitigating circumstances. After interviewing Roberts, Dr. Gazley concluded that Roberts had the ability to interact with defense counsel and to provide information and a coherent account of her own perceptions about the situation to her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 91} Roberts contends that Dr. Gazley did not know her psychological history before her incarceration and that he had neither reviewed her Social Security records nor obtained a neuropsychological evaluation of the effects of her head injury. However, Dr. Gazley explained that none of this mattered to his evaluation of Roberts\u2019s competency at the time of resentencing, because that evaluation was based on his interview with Roberts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">I base my opinion * * * on the information that I receive from the subject at the time I do the interview. * * * I make my decision about the opinion based on the responses the person provides me to the questions I asked that I believe are related to the questions the Court needs to address, rather than the [past] diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">{\u00b6 92} A criminal defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial, including competency to assist in a sentencing proceeding, is a question of fact. <em>See Maggio v. Fulford, </em>462 U.S. 111, 103 S.Ct. 2261, 76 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (upholding state-court finding of competency that was fairly supported by the record); <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 33 (deferring to trial court\u2019s \u201cfactual findings\u201d that defendant was competent).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">{\u00b6 93} Dr. Gazley\u2019s testimony supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Roberts failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she was not competent to stand trial at the time of her sentencing proceeding in 2007. Because \u201cthere was some reliable, credible evidence supporting\u201d the trial court\u2019s finding that Roberts was competent, we will not disturb that finding. <em>Vrabel </em>at \u00b6 33. Roberts\u2019s sixth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">B. Competency during the 2003 Mitigation Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">{\u00b6 94} In her seventh proposition of law, Roberts contends that there was insufficient evidence to prove that she was competent to stand trial during her original mitigation hearing in 2003. Roberts also claims that the trial court failed to conduct a full evidentiary hearing into her competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">{\u00b6 95} These claims are res judicata. They are based entirely on the record of the 2003 hearing. Thus, Roberts could have, and should have, raised these issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>in <em>Roberts I. </em>She is barred from raising them now. \u201cWhere an argument could have been raised on an initial appeal, res <em>judicata </em>dictates that it is inappropriate to consider that same argument on a second appeal following remand.\u201d <em>State v. D'Ambrosio, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 141, 143, 652 N.E.2d 710 (1995). <em>See also State v.

Accordingly, we vacate the death sentence and remand this case for resentencing on the basis of the existing record. On remand, the trial court must consider all the mitigating evidence reflected in the record, including Roberts\u2019s allocution, weigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors, and file a sentencing opinion that reflects that it has complied with these instructions. In doing so, the trial court must make an independent determination of whether a death sentence is appropriate and may not give deference to the sentences previously entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b460-7\">Pfeifer, Lanzinger, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Aqy\">O\u2019Neill, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A_X\">O\u2019Donnell and Kennedy, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-14\">.

We have repeatedly recognized that the sentencer may glean relevant mitigating evidence from the guilt phase. <em>See, e.g., State v.

The trial court gave this factor \u201cvery slight weight.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b452-9\">. According to Roberts, when she went to prison and stopped taking Risperdal, she hallucinated \u201cgiant anthills.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b452-10\">. In the original appeal, Roberts alleged that she had not been asked whether she wished to make a statement in allocution and that this omission violated Crim.R. 11. Because we had vacated Roberts\u2019s original death sentence on other grounds, we held her allocution claim moot. <em>Roberts I </em>at \u00b6 165-166.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\">. The dissent suggests that drawing this inference is inconsistent with <em>Phillips. </em>Dissenting opinion at \u00b6 112-113 and 115-116. As we discussed above, <em>Phillips </em>states a general rule. But this case presents exceptional circumstances, which the dissent does not take into account, that justify a narrow exception to the general rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\">. The dissent\u2019s contention that there is no constitutional right to allocution, dissenting opinion at \u00b6 104, is beside the point. Once a capital defendant has used her state-law right of allocution to place constitutionally relevant mitigating factors before the sentencer, the Eighth Amendment does not permit the sentencer to disregard that mitigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\">. The dissent states that we have \u201cconfusefd] allocution \u2014 which is not evidence \u2014 with the opportunity to present an unsworn statement in the penalty phase of the trial and the right to present mitigating evidence to the jurors or fact-finders.\u201d Dissenting opinion at \u00b6 114. We have not. We simply disagree with the dissent\u2019s conclusion that because an allocution is unsworn, it is irrelevant to sentencing. Indeed, if that were so, there would have been no reason to remand in <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Green.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b454-9\">. <em>Davis </em>called the defendant\u2019s penalty-phase statement an \u201callocution,\u201d consistent with Colorado precedent deriving the right to make an unsworn statement to the jury in a capital ease from the right to allocution provided in Colorado\u2019s version of Crim.R. 32. <em>See </em>794 P.2d at 191, citing <em>People v.

Our previous remand order required the trial court to \u201cafford Roberts her right to allocute, * * * personally review and evaluate the evidence, weigh the aggravating circumstances against any relevant mitigating evidence, and determine anew the appropriateness of the death penalty as required by R.C. 2929.03.\u201d <em>State v. Roberts, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168, \u00b6 167. I believe that order was sufficient on its face, but .unfortunately it was not followed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">{\u00b6 98} As Justice O\u2019Donnell points out, a capital defendant\u2019s statutory right to make an unsworn statement in mitigation under R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) is \u201c \u2018not an allocution under the rule.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis deleted.) Dissenting opinion at \u00b6 110, quoting <em>State v. Campbell, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 320, 326, 738 N.E.2d 1178 (2000). And if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>we were addressing this issue in the first instance, the dissent might well be correct in concluding that the defendant\u2019s allocution \u201chas no significance in establishing any mitigating factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 116. But our previous remand order was not limited to permitting allocution \u2014 it required the court to evaluate \u201cany relevant mitigating evidence\u201d and make its sentencing decisions \u201canew.\u201d I would hold that the trial court failed to comply with this remand order in that it failed to accept and evaluate relevant mitigation evidence, including the unsworn statement offered by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">{\u00b6 99} Given the clear language in our prior mandate, the trial court clearly erred by refusing to accept the defendant\u2019s evidence in mitigation. Even if I were to accept that the defendant had attempted to \u201cupdate mitigation\u201d with evidence of her good prison conduct and that such evidence was improper, majority opinion at \u00b6 37, the trial court expressed no opinion on the relevance of that evidence and did not render a sentencing decision \u201canew\u201d as directed. But I must also note that the majority\u2019s characterization here is inaccurate. As the majority observes, the defendant proffered four items in mitigation, only one of which dealt with her conduct in prison. And it is apparent that even the defendant\u2019s prison records, like her other proffered evidence, were submitted to demonstrate her continued mental illness, not her conduct. Moreover, as the majority itself recognizes, its analysis on this point is likely to be set aside by the federal courts on collateral review. <em>See </em>majority opinion at \u00b6 31-33, citing <em>Davis v. Coyle, </em>475 F.3d 761 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">{\u00b6 100} Therefore, I concur in the court\u2019s judgment vacating the death sentence and remanding this case for resentencing, but I dissent as to the limitations placed on that resentencing by the majority. The defendant should be permitted to offer a case in mitigation, in accordance with both our prior remand and the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment in similar cases. And given both my opinion that capital punishment violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Article I, Section 9 of the Ohio Constitution, <em>see State v. Wogenstahl, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1437, 2013-Ohio-164, 981 N.E.2d 900, \u00b6 2 (O\u2019Neill, J., dissenting), and the fact that the record as currently constituted provides strong evidence of the defendant\u2019s severe mental illness, I would hold that on remand the trial court is precluded from imposing the death penalty upon the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b461-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AuX\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">{\u00b6 101} Respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">{\u00b6 102} The principal focus of this appeal concerns whether a trial court commits reversible error if it fails to include in its statutorily mandated capital-offense sentencing opinion a statement that it has considered the allocution of a convicted murderer. However, allocution is a statutory right, not a constitutional one, and it necessarily follows that the court\u2019s failure to affirmatively state that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>considered the allocution does not rise to the level of constitutional error. Further, this court has never required the trial court to discuss in its sentencing opinion every consideration that factors into its sentence. Rather, our precedent establishes that any such error is cured by our independent sentence evaluation. Accordingly, this court should independently review the allocution and the sentence and determine whether the penalty imposed is in conformity with others in which the death penalty has been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Allocution</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 103} The purpose of allocution is \u201cto permit a convicted defendant an opportunity to plead personally to the court for leniency in his sentence,\u201d <em>United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1518 (11th Cir.1996), based on the consideration that \u201c[t]he most persuasive counsel may not be able to speak for a defendant as the defendant might, with halting eloquence, speak for himself,\u201d <em>Green v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 301, 304, 81 S.Ct. 653, 5 L.Ed.2d 670 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., plurality opinion). Thus, courts recognize that \u201c[t]he right to allocute is no more than the defendant\u2019s \u2018right to stand before the [sentencer] and ask in his own voice that he be spared.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v. Davis, </em>794 P.2d 159, 192 (Colo.1990), quoting <em>State v. Zola, </em>112 N.J. 384, 430, 548 A.2d 1022 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 104} There is no recognized constitutional right to allocution. In <em>Hill v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 428, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962), the Supreme Court rejected a claim that the Constitution requires the trial court to invite an accused represented by counsel to make a statement before sentencing, explaining that the failure to do so \u201cis an error which is neither jurisdictional nor constitutional. It is not a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice, nor an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\u201d And in <em>MeGautha v. California, </em>402 U.S. 183, 91 S.Ct. 1454, 28 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971), <em>judgment vacated sub nom. Crampton v. Ohio, </em>408 U.S. 941, 92 S.Ct. 2873, 33 L.Ed.2d 765 (1972), the court noted that \u201cOhio has provided for retention of the ritual of allocution, albeit only in its common-law form, precisely to avoid the possibility that a person might be tried, convicted, and sentenced to death in complete silence. We have held that failure to ensure such personal participation in the criminal process is not necessarily a constitutional flaw in the conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">{\u00b6 105} The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has also held that \u201c[t]here is no constitutional right to allocution under the United States Constitution,\u201d <em>Pasquarille v. United States, </em>130 F.3d 1220, 1223 (6th Cir.1997), and that federal law does not require Ohio to afford the accused an opportunity to make an unsworn statement, <em>Bedford v. Collins, </em>567 F.3d 225, 237 (6th Cir.2009). Notably, the Sixth Circuit is not alone; almost every federal circuit court has held that allocution is not a constitutional right. <em>See United States v. Picard, </em>464 F.2d 215, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>220 (1st Cir.1972), fn. 9; <em>United States v.

It is only the Ninth Circuit that concludes that \u201cthe denial of the right to allocute is a due process violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Doblan, </em>205 Fed.Appx. 620, 622 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">{\u00b6 106} This court has previously suggested that the Constitution does not require allocution at the sentencing hearing. In <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, we rejected a claim that the trial court violated the constitutional rights of the accused by denying his request to give his statement through questioning by counsel, explaining that \u201cthe majority view [regarding the right to allocution] does not support a holding that a defendant has a constitutional right even to make an unsworn statement, let alone an unsworn statement in a question-and-answer format.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 103. And in <em>Lancaster v. Green, </em>175 Ohio St. 203, 192 N.E.2d 776 (1963), we denied a writ of habeas corpus to an offender who claimed that the trial court\u2019s failure to include the allocution in the sentence invalidated it, stating that \u201cthe failure to include the allocution in the certificate of sentence did not void the sentence. In fact, the absolute failure to accord petitioner this right is not a ground for relief by habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, citing <em>Hill, </em>368 U.S. 424, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Confusion Regarding Allocution</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 107} The term \u201callocution\u201d has been used to refer to different statements made by an offender. For example, a statement made by a defendant at the time of a plea has been described as an allocution. Such a statement can give a court a factual basis to adjudicate guilt. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>587 F.3d 509, 514 (2d Cir.2009) (explaining that the trial court may examine the accused\u2019s plea allocution in determining whether a sufficient factual basis supports the plea); <em>State v. Jones, </em>6th Dist. Sandusky No. S-08-034, 2010-Ohio-1780, 2010 WL 1633340, \u00b6 17 (\u201cA plea allocution is conducted only after the individual has been fully apprised of and waived a litany of constitutional rights, including Fifth Amendment rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 108} In Ohio, R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) permits an accused to make a statement to the jury or fact-finder during the penalty phase of a capital-murder trial and further provides that such a statement is not subject to cross-examination unless the accused makes the statement under oath. This unsworn statement permits the accused to address the jury or fact-finder in an effort to influence the penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>recommendation and is sometimes referred to as allocution, but in fact, it is a part of the penalty phase of the trial. <em>State v. Campbell, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 320, 326, 738 N.E.2d 1178 (2000); <em>State v. Roe, </em>41 Ohio St.3d 18, 26, 535 N.E.2d 1351 (1989) (noting that the statute provides that all mitigating evidence must be presented before the jury makes a recommendation in the penalty phase of trial; \u201c[a] defendant may not wait for an unfavorable jury recommendation before presenting all relevant evidence in mitigation of sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 109} The foregoing examples of statements are not implicated in this case. Rather, the common-law right to allocution applicable in capital and noncapital cases is contained in Crim.R. 32(A)(1), which directs the trial court, prior to imposing sentence, to afford counsel an opportunity to speak on behalf of the defendant and to address the defendant personally and ask if he or she wishes to make a statement in his or her own behalf or present any information in mitigation of punishment. This statement is not made under oath, is not subject to cross-examination, and is not evidence \u2014 but it can be considered by the court in imposing its sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 110} We distinguished the right to make an unsworn statement afforded by R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) from the allocution before sentence is pronounced in <em>Campbell, </em>where we said, \u201cNo authority requires a trial court to inform a capital defendant of his right to make an unsworn, penalty-phase statement. Crim.R. 32(A)(1) does not apply, because <em>an unsworn statement under R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) is not an allocution under the rule.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 326. Thus, a penalty-phase statement may be relevant to weighing whether the aggravating circumstances were sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors, but an allocution is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 111} In this case, pursuant to our order on remand, the trial court allowed Roberts to allocute prior to reimposing sentence. And before it imposed the sentence, the court stated that it had considered the record and the oral statements, which included her allocution. In my view, no reasonable inference may be drawn from the failure of the trial court to specifically incorporate the content of the allocution made by Roberts in its sentencing opinion. Obviously, because we remanded for that right to be accorded before sentencing, the trial court listened to Roberts and was aware of what she presented. In this case, then, \u201c \u2018[t]here is no showing of irregularity to contradict the presumption of regularity accorded all judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Raber, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 350, 2012-Ohio-5636, 982 N.E.2d 684, \u00b6 19, quoting <em>State v. Sweet, </em>72 Ohio St.3d 375, 376, 650 N.E.2d 450 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 112} We have previously held that in considering mitigating factors in a capital-offense sentencing opinion, the failure to incorporate and discuss all of them in its sentencing opinion does not mean that the trial court did not consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>them and that such a failure is not reversible error. <em>E.g., State v. Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 363; <em>State v. Phillips, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 72, 102, 656 N.E.2d 643 (1995). In <em>Phillips, </em>we considered the argument that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion fail[ed] to give effect to all of the mitigation evidence offered by appellant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">[Phillips] erroneously assumes that evidence that is not specifically mentioned in an opinion was not considered. While a sentencing court must consider all evidence of mitigation, it need not discuss each factor individually. <em>Parker v. Dugger </em>(1991), 498 U.S. 308, 314-315, 111 S.Ct. 731, 736, 112 L.Ed.2d 812, 822. Further, even if \u201cthe trial court in this case should have more explicitly analyzed the mitigating evidence,\u201d this court\u2019s independent reweighing will rectify the error. <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 171-172, 555 N.E.2d 293, 305.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\"><em>Id. </em>We therefore rejected that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 113} This case is less egregious than <em>Phillips, </em>because the allocution statement made by Roberts before sentencing is not evidence; rather it is an opportunity for the defendant to make a personal statement in her own behalf or to present any information in mitigation of punishment, such as an apology, a request for mercy, or an appeal for leniency. A trial court may exercise its discretion in considering the allocution when imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">{\u00b6 114} The majority confuses allocution \u2014 which is not evidence \u2014 with the opportunity to present an unsworn statement in the penalty phase of the trial and the right to present mitigating evidence to the jurors or fact-finders, and it concludes that the sentence of death violated the Eighth Amendment, specifically because the allocution contained relevant mitigating evidence. It is true that a sentencer cannot refuse to consider mitigating evidence before imposing the death penalty, <em>see, e.g., Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 113-114, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982), but in this case, Roberts had waived her right to present mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">{\u00b6 115} More significantly, however, an unsworn statement in allocution is not evidence. <em>Biddinger v. State, </em>868 N.E.2d 407, 413 (Ind.2007); <em>People v. Davis, </em>794 P.2d at 192. Nor is allocution intended to prove or disprove facts relevant to sentencing. <em>State v. Lord, </em>117 Wash.2d 829, 897, 822 P.2d 177 (1991); <em>Davis </em>at 192. Thus, an allocution statement made prior to sentencing pursuant to Crim.R. 32(A)(1) is not admissible evidence. <em>See </em>Evid.R. 603; <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Rule, </em>64 Ohio St.2d 67, 69, 413 N.E.2d 796 (1980) (\u201cSection 7 of Article I of the Constitution of Ohio requires an oath or affirmation as a prerequisite to the testimony of a witness\u201d [footnote omitted]); <em>Stores Realty Co. v. Cleveland, </em>41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Ohio St.2d 41, 42, 322 N.E.2d 629 (1975) (\u201cit is error for unsworn testimony to be admitted in evidence\u201d); <em>Clinton v. State, </em>33 Ohio St. 27 (1877), paragraph two of the syllabus (\u201cevery one offered as a witness in a court must take an oath or affirmation before giving testimony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">{\u00b6 116} I therefore disagree with the conclusion of the majority that Roberts\u2019s statement \u201ccontained much information whose relevance as mitigation was clear.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 57. Because the allocution offered by Roberts prior to the imposition of sentence is not evidence, it has no significance in establishing any mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 117} Neither the United States nor the Ohio Constitution requires a trial court to permit allocution by a person convicted of a crime. Rather, in Ohio, the legislature has allowed a capital defendant to make a penalty-phase statement on his own behalf and to provide any information relevant to the penalty that should be imposed. But an unsworn allocution statement made after the penalty phase is not mitigating evidence. The omission of any reference to what Roberts said during allocution in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion does not permit an inference that the court failed to consider those statements, nor does it constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 118} Even if the failure to refer to the allocution in the sentencing opinion did constitute error, \u201c[o]ur independent sentence evaluation and reweighing can cure the effect of errors in previous death-penalty sentencing decisions.\u201d <em>State v. Bey, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 487, 505, 709 N.E.2d 484 (1999). Although the sentencer\u2019s consideration of mitigating evidence is mandated by the Constitution, <em>Eddings, </em>455 U.S. at 113-114, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1, we have held that our independent review can cure a trial court\u2019s failure to explain how it weighed that evidence, <em>State v. Hill, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 195, 210, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996). And we have recognized that \u201c \u2018[w]hile a sentencing court must consider all evidence of mitigation, it need not discuss each factor individually.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 363, quoting <em>Phillips, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 102, 656 N.E.2d 643. Tellingly, in <em>Clemons v. Mississippi, </em>494 U.S. 738, 750, 110 S.Ct. 1441, 108 L.Ed.2d 725 (1990), the court explained that the sentencer need not make written findings concerning mitigating circumstances in order for an appellate court to perform an independent sentence evaluation. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion here, the failure to discuss the allocution does not hinder our independent review of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 119} And if it is not reversible error to fail to explain how a court weighed mitigating evidence, how can it be reversible error to fail to refer to the allocution in a sentencing opinion when that allocution is not evidence?</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AWt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Dennis Watkins, Trumbull County Prosecuting Attorney, and LuWayne Annos, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ADz\">David L. Doughten and Robert A. Dixon, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">{\u00b6 120} Accordingly, there is no reason for this court to reverse the sentence based on the trial court\u2019s failure to expressly mention in its sentencing opinion that it had considered Robert\u2019s unsworn statement. I would overrule proposition of law II and address the remaining propositions of law on the merits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b467-5\">Kennedy, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
