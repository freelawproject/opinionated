The Franklin County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) reduced the auditor\u2019s valuation of the property in response to a valuation complaint, but on appeal, the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) remanded with instructions that the BOR dismiss the valuation complaint for lack of jurisdiction because the complaint misidentified the owner of the subject property. A successor owner of the property now argues that the BTA erred in concluding that the BOR lacked jurisdiction. We agree. Therefore, we reverse and remand this matter to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">{\u00b6 2} On March 31, 2009, the John W. Messmore Living Trust filed a valuation complaint, seeking a reduction of the Franklin County auditor\u2019s valuation of a 3.781-acre self-storage facility in southeast Columbus for tax-year 2008. The valuation complaint consists of a preprinted form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. <em>See </em>R.C. 5715.30. Attorney James Hunter, who is identified as the complainant\u2019s agent and the owner\u2019s attorney, signed the complaint on the trust\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>behalf. The complaint identifies the trust as the \u201c[ojwner of property\u201d and does not identify anyone as \u201c[cjomplainant if not owner.\u201d The line of the complaint labeled \u201cComplainant\u2019s relationship to property if not owner\u201d is blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 3} In response to the trust\u2019s complaint, the Groveport Madison Local Schools Board of Education (\u201cBOE\u201d) filed a countercomplaint, requesting retention of the auditor\u2019s valuation of $2,167,100.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 4} At a hearing before the BOR, the trust submitted an appraisal, which valued the property at $1,600,000 as of January 1, 2008. Contrary to the trust\u2019s identification of itself as the owner of the subject property, the appraisal and the auditor\u2019s property record, which was also submitted to the BOR, identify the owner of the property as Hamilton-33 Partnership. The cover letter to the appraisal is addressed to John Messmore, Hamilton-33 Partnership. Both the appraisal and the property record list the property owner\u2019s address as 3540 LaRochelle Drive in Columbus, the same address listed for the trust on the valuation complaint. Despite these inconsistencies regarding the identity of the property owner, the BOE did not contest the trust\u2019s standing or the BOR\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the valuation complaint. On May 27, 2010, the BOR ordered a reduction of the property value to $1,600,000, as requested by the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">{\u00b6 5} The BOE appealed the BOR\u2019s order to the BTA. The BOE\u2019s notice of appeal identifies the trust as the complainant and Hamilton-33 Partnership as the owner of the subject property. On May 29, 2012, Hunter notified the BTA that the subject property had been sold at sheriffs sale and that the new property owner was Public Storage of Glendale, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">{\u00b6 6} On July 29, 2012, the BOE moved the BTA to remand this matter to the BOR with instructions to dismiss the trust\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The BOE argued that \u201cthe Complaint fails to meet a core procedural requirement and must be dismissed,\u201d because it did not identify Hamilton-33 Partnership as the owner of the property. Public Storage opposed the BOE\u2019s motion. It conceded that the trust did not hold legal title to the property when the complaint was filed, but argued that the trust had standing to file the valuation complaint under R.C. 5715.19(A), as the owner of other property in Franklin County. Public Storage submitted screen shots from the Franklin County auditor\u2019s website, purporting to show the trust\u2019s ownership of three other properties in Franklin County as of the date of the valuation complaint. The screen shots identify the owner of those properties as \u201cMessmore John W Tr.\u201d Public Storage also argued that the trust was a party affected by the valuation, as required by R.C. 5715.13(A), because it held an ownership interest in Hamilton-33 Partnership. The BOE did not expressly contest the trust\u2019s standing, but instead focused on the BOR\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction. It argued that \u201c[tjhe sole jurisdictional issue raised in this matter centers around the fact that the face of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the Complaint as filed fails to identify the legal title holder of record for the Subject Property at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 7} The BTA granted the motion to remand for dismissal, holding that the BOR lacked jurisdiction over the trust\u2019s complaint because the complaint did not correctly identify the legal owner of the subject property. The BTA refused to address Public Storage\u2019s arguments regarding the trust\u2019s standing. It stated that those arguments \u201chave no bearing on whether the property owner, as listed on line 1 of the complaint, was proper.\u201d BTA No. 2010-A-1290, 2012 WL 3279121, at *2 (July 31, 2012). Public Storage appealed to this court pursuant to R.C. 5717.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 8} This case presents an issue regarding the jurisdictional sufficiency of the trust\u2019s valuation complaint. We review that issue of law de novo. <em>Akron Centre Plaza, L.L.C. v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 145, 2010-Ohio-5035, 942 N.E.2d 1054, \u00b6 10, citing <em>Toledo Pub. Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 490, 2010-Ohio-253, 924 N.E.2d 345, \u00b6 14, fn. 2, and <em>State v. Consilio, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 295, 2007-Ohio-4163, 871 N.E.2d 1167, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">{\u00b6 9} A county board of revision\u2019s jurisdiction to hear and rule on complaints is defined by statute. <em>Elkem Metals Co., Ltd. Partnership v. Washington Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 683, 686, 693 N.E.2d 276 (1998), citing R.C. 5715.01 and 5715.11. R.C. 5715.01(B) requires each county to have a board of revision, \u201cwhich shall hear complaints and revise assessments of real property for taxation.\u201d R.C. 5715.11 provides that the boards of revision \u201cshall hear complaints relating to the valuation or assessment of real property * * * and may increase or decrease any such valuation or correct any assessment complained of, or * * * order a reassessment by the original assessing officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">{\u00b6 10} In hearing and ruling on complaints, a board of revision must first examine the complaint to determine whether it meets the jurisdictional requirements set forth in R.C. 5715.13 and 5715.19. <em>Elkem </em>at 686. The board must dismiss any complaint that does not meet those requirements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 5715.19(A) \u201cestablishes the jurisdictional gateway to obtaining review by the boards of revision.\u201d <em>Toledo Pub. Schools Bd. of Edn. </em>at \u00b6 10. Although a complaint for a decrease in valuation is most frequently filed by the owner of the subject property, R.C. 5715.19(A) provides that \u201c[a]ny person owning taxable real property in the county * * * may file such a complaint regarding any such determination [including valuation] affecting any real property in the county.\u201d R.C. 5715.13(A) directs that \u201cthe county board of revision shall not decrease any valuation unless a party affected thereby or who is authorized to file a complaint under section 5715.19 of the Revised Code makes and files with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the board a written application therefor, verified by oath and signature, showing the facts upon which it is claimed such decrease should be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">{\u00b6 12} This court has generally treated full compliance with R.C. 5715.19 as an indispensible prerequisite to a board of revision\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction. <em>Worthington City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 27, 2009-Ohio-5932, 918 N.E.2d 972, \u00b6 17, citing <em>Stanjim Co. v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>38 Ohio St.2d 233, 235, 313 N.E.2d 14 (1974) (\u201cfull compliance with R.C. 5715.19 and 5715.13 is necessary before a county board of revision is empowered to act on the merits of a claim\u201d), and <em>Cardinal Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>44 Ohio St.2d 13, 336 N.E.2d 433 (1975), paragraph one of the syllabus. <em>But see Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Lake Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 591, 593, 687 N.E.2d 723 (1998) (reversing BTA\u2019s dismissal when the appellants substantially complied with R.C. 5715.13 and 5715.19); <em>Shinkle v. Ashtabula Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 227, 2013-Ohio-397, 985 N.E.2d 1243, \u00b6 17 (considering whether a requirement in R.C. 5715.19 to state a dollar amount for the reduction in value was mandatory and thus jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Stanjim, </em>we found that a prior version of the complaint form used here was \u201cclearly designed to elicit information required by R.C. 5715.19 and 5715.13\u201d and that it constituted a \u201clawful interpretation of the minimal, data requirements\u201d of those statutes. <em>Stanjim </em>at 236. There, we affirmed a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction when the complainant did not complete a portion of the complaint form entitled \u201cpertinent facts,\u201d despite the statutory requirement that a complaint include facts supporting a decrease in valuation. R.C. 5715.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 14} The board of revision\u2019s jurisdiction, however, does not hinge on complete, technical compliance with the complaint form, and errors in completing the complaint form do not necessarily bar the board of revision from exercising jurisdiction. <em>Toledo Pub. Schools Bd. of Edn., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 490, 2010-Ohio-253, 924 N.E.2d 345, at \u00b6 15. Notably, failure to provide information requested by the complaint form is not a jurisdictional defect when the requested information does not fulfill a specific statutory or constitutional requirement. <em>Knickerbocker Properties, Inc. XLII v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 233, 2008-Ohio-3192, 893 N.E.2d 457; <em>Nucorp, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>64 Ohio St.2d 20, 21, 412 N.E.2d 947 (1980).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">While this court has never encouraged or condoned disregard of procedural schemes logically attendant to the pursuit of a substantive legal' right, it has also been unwilling to find or enforce <em>jurisdictional </em>barriers not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>clearly statutorily or constitutionally mandated, which tend to deprive a supplicant of a fair review of his complaint on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">(Emphasis added.) <em>Nucorp </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 15} <em>Knickerbocker </em>is particularly relevant to this case. There, the BTA rejected the property owner\u2019s argument that the board of education had failed to invoke the board of revision\u2019s jurisdiction because the complaint listed an incorrect address for the property owner. We acknowledged that \u201c[w]hen a <em>statute </em>specifically requires a litigant to perform certain acts in order to invoke the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal (or the jurisdiction of a court to review an administrative decision), the performance of such acts usually constitutes a prerequisite to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Knickerbocker </em>at \u00b6 10. R.C. Chapter 5715, however, contains no requirement that a valuation complaint include the property owner\u2019s correct address.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. Chapter 5715 does place statutory obligations on the board of revision to notify a property owner in certain circumstances. For example, R.C. 5715.12 requires the board of revision to notify the property owner of a hearing before increasing the valuation of the owner\u2019s property. In <em>Knickerbocker, </em>however, we did not equate those obligations with a statutory requirement that the complainant furnish the property owner\u2019s correct address. Rather, we emphasized that the responsibility for providing notice lies with the board of revision, not with the complainant. We also noted that \u201cthe BOR, through its statutory secretary, the auditor, has direct access to the information concerning where to send the notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13. Because there was no statutory requirement that a complaint set forth a correct, current address for the property owner, we concluded that a complainant\u2019s failure to use an appropriate address did not deprive the board of revision of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">{\u00b6 17} The BOE has not identified a statutory requirement that a complainant correctly identify the legal owner of the subject property in its valuation complaint, and we find no such requirement in R.C. Chapter 5715. Consistent with <em>Knickerbocker, </em>we reject the contention that the BOR\u2019s statutory duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>notify the property owner creates a jurisdictional requirement that the complainant correctly identify the owner on the face of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">{\u00b6 18} Here, as in <em>Knickerbocker, </em>the BOR has direct access to the identity of the property owner. Under R.C. 5715.09, the county auditor is the secretary of the BOR, and in conjunction with the requirement of R.C. 5301.25 that deeds and conveyances be recorded, the auditor processes conveyance-fee statements submitted by grantees and furnishes indorsements that permit the recording of conveyances. R.C. 317.22; R.C. 319.202. The auditor is also responsible for adopting and using property-record cards pursuant to R.C. 5713.03. Indeed, the property record in this case, which correctly identified Hamilton-33 Partnership as the owner of the property, was part of the record before the BOR. The BOR\u2019s knowledge of the correct owner is further evident from its certification of the transcript of proceedings to the BTA, which identified Hamilton-33 Partnership as the property owner. Moreover, the BOE itself correctly identified Hamilton-33 Partnership as the owner in its notice of appeal to the BTA. Inasmuch as the BOR could be expected to use the information at its disposal to determine where to send notice, it can likewise be expected to consult the relevant property-record card and any other information at its disposal to determine whether notice is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">{\u00b6 19} The BOE argues that identification of the property owner in the complaint is necessary to invoke the BOR\u2019s jurisdiction because it \u201c \u2018runs to the core of procedural efficiency.\u2019 \u201d This court first discussed the \u201ccore of procedural efficiency\u201d in <em>Akron Std. Div. of Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc. v. Lindley, </em>11 Ohio St.3d 10, 12, 462 N.E.2d 419 (1984), to distinguish between jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional statutory filing requirements. We have subsequently applied a core-of-procedural-efficiency test in the context of tax-valuation proceedings. <em>See, e.g., 2200 Carnegie, L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 284, 2012-Ohio-5691, 986 N.E.2d 919, \u00b6 24 (notification requirement in R.C. 5715.19(B) is jurisdictional because it runs to the core of procedural efficiency); <em>Princeton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 66, 74, 760 N.E.2d 375 (2002) (information not required by statute does not run to the core of procedural efficiency); <em>Austin Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>46 Ohio St.3d 192, 194, 546 N.E.2d 404 (1989) (appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the statutory requirement to file a notice of appeal with both the BTA and the board of revision \u201cruns to the core of procedural efficiency and is essential to the proceeding\u201d); <em>Salem Med. Arts &amp; Dev. Corp. v. Columbiana Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 621, 623, 687 N.E.2d 746 (1998) (filing one notice of appeal with the board of revision runs to the core of procedural efficiency).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">{\u00b6 20} This court recently addressed the jurisdictional requirements for contesting a property valuation. <em>See Shinkle, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 227, 2013-Ohio-397, 985 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>N.E.2d 1243. We cited the general rule that the exercise of a right to appeal conferred by statute \u201c \u2018is conditioned upon compliance with the accompanying mandatory requirements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 17, quoting <em>Zier v. Bur. of Unemp. Comp., </em>151 Ohio St. 123, 84 N.E.2d 746 (1949), paragraph one of the syllabus. We went on to state that <em>Zier\u2019s </em>reference to \u201cmandatory requirements\u201d points to the importance of distinguishing a mandatory statutory requirement from a directory statutory requirement. <em>Id. </em>To draw that distinction, courts ask whether the statutory requirement runs to the core of procedural efficiency. <em>Id. </em>If a statutory requirement runs to the core of procedural efficiency, then compliance is mandatory and is a jurisdictional prerequisite to pursuing the administrative case.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Shinkle, </em>the complaint did not state the reduction in value sought, as required by R.C. 5715.19(D). Compliance with R.C. 5715.19(D) permits the auditor to determine whether it is required to send notice of the complaint to interested persons pursuant to R.C. 5715.19(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notice from the auditor, in turn, affords interested persons the right to file a countercomplaint. We concluded that the statutory requirement of stating the amount of value on which the complaint is based runs to the core of procedural efficiency and is, therefore, a jurisdictional requirement. Unlike the statutes we examined in <em>Knickerbocker, </em>which placed obligations upon the board of revision and the auditor, R.C. 5715.19(D) \u201cexplicitly requires the complainant to state the amount of value he is putting at issue \u2014 and only the complainant can supply that information.\u201d <em>Shinkle </em>at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">{\u00b6 22} The cases in which this court has applied a core-of-procedural-efficiency test to conclude that a requirement is jurisdictional have one factor in common: they involve a failure to comply with a requirement imposed by statute. The distinction between statutory and nonstatutory requirements is evident in <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co., </em>80 Ohio St.3d 591, 687 N.E.2d 723, in which we addressed jurisdictional challenges based on the manner in which the complainants answered questions on the complaint form. The relevant questions involved the increase or decrease in taxable value sought (question seven) and the complainants\u2019 justification for the requested increase or decrease (question eight). We held that question eight did not elicit factual information required by R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>5715.13, but instead sought an argument in support of a change in taxable value. Accordingly, we did not consider whether question eight ran to the core of procedural efficiency. <em>Id. </em>at 595 (summarily stating that \u201cR.C. 5715.13 does not require a response to Question 8\u201d). Question seven, on the other hand, sought statutorily required information because R.C. 5715.19(D) requires complaints to state the amount of overvaluation or undervaluation claimed. Therefore, we went on to consider whether the complainants\u2019 \u201csomewhat vague\u201d responses to that question affected procedural efficiency. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">{\u00b6 23} Because there is no statutory requirement that a complainant correctly name the property owner in a valuation complaint, we need not determine whether the failure to correctly name the property owner runs to the core of procedural efficiency. The procedural importance of particular information cannot make the provision of that information a jurisdictional barrier absent a statutory or constitutional requirement. <em>See Nucorp, </em>64 Ohio St.2d at 22, 412 N.E.2d 947. Thus, the trust\u2019s failure to identify Hamilton-33 Partnership as the property owner does not constitute a jurisdictional defect that precludes the BOR from reviewing the trust\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">{\u00b6 24} Although we conclude that it is not a jurisdictional requirement to correctly name the owner of the subject property in -a valuation complaint, our de novo review mandates that we also consider whether the trust otherwise invoked the BOR\u2019s jurisdiction, when the only basis for standing asserted on the face of the complaint is the trust\u2019s erroneous identification of itself as the titled owner of the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">{\u00b6 25} The BOE argues that the issue of the trust\u2019s standing is separate and distinct from the BOR\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction and that standing is not at issue here because the BTA addressed only subject-matter jurisdiction. Subject-matter jurisdiction refers to the statutory or constitutional authority to adjudicate a case. <em>Pratts v. Hurley, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 81, 2004-Ohio-1980, 806 N.E.2d 992, \u00b6 11. Lack of standing, on the other hand, challenges a party\u2019s capacity to bring an action, not the subject-matter jurisdiction of the tribunal. <em>State ex rel. Tubbs Jones v. Suster, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 70, 77, 701 N.E.2d 1002 (1998). But, the General Assembly has incorporated the requirement for standing into the jurisdictional requirements for filing a valuation complaint, as set forth in R.C. 5715.13 and 5715.19. \u201cA complaint filed by a person who is not identified by [R.C. 5715.19(A)] as one who may file a complaint does not vest jurisdiction in the board of revision to review the auditor\u2019s valuation.\u201d <em>Toledo Pub. Schools Bd. of Edn., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 490, 2010-Ohio-253, 924 N.E.2d 345, at \u00b6 10. <em>See also Victoria Plaza Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 181, 183, 712 N.E.2d 751 (1999), quoting <em>State ex rel. Tubbs Jones </em>at 77, fn. 4 (\u201cStanding is jurisdictional in administrative appeals \u2018where parties must meet strict standing require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>ments in order to satisfy the threshold requirement for the administrative tribunal to obtain jurisdiction\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">{\u00b6 26} Standing is determined as of the commencement of the action. <em>Fed. Home Loan Mtge. Corp. v. Schwartzwald, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 13, 2012-Ohio-5017, 979 N.E.2d 1214, \u00b6 24. The parties do not dispute that the trust was required to have had standing when it filed its complaint in order to invoke the BOR\u2019s jurisdiction. To establish standing as a property owner under R.C. 5715.19(A), the complainant must own taxable real property in the county at the time the complaint is filed. <em>Soc. Natl. Bank v. Wood Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 401, 403, 692 N.E.2d 148 (1998). The question here is whether a complainant\u2019s failure to accurately assert the basis for its standing on the face of its complaint subjects the complaint to dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. We hold that it does not. If the complainant\u2019s standing is challenged, the complainant may prove its standing without being bound by what it asserted on the face of its valuation complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">{\u00b6 27} Public Storage argues that the trust had standing to file a valuation complaint even though it did not hold legal title to the subject property. It contends that the trust had standing, pursuant to R.C. 5715.19(A), as the owner of other real property in Franklin County, and it submitted documentation to the BTA in support of that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Soc. Natl. Bank, </em>this court addressed the relationship between standing and the board of revision\u2019s jurisdiction. Society National Bank filed a complaint on January 12, 1996, seeking a reduction in the assessed value of property for tax-year 1995. Society owned the subject property from at least January 1, 1995, through December 29, 1995. Thus, Society owned the property on the tax-lien date but not when it filed its complaint. Society\u2019s complaint identified the owner of the property as \u201cSociety National Bank f.n.a. Toledo Trust Company [Owner as of 1-1-95].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401. In response to the request on the complaint to identify the complainant, \u201cif other than owner,\u201d Society responded, \u201cN/A.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">{\u00b6 29} When a person files a complaint against the property of another, the burden to establish standing lies with the complainant. <em>Soc. Natl. Bank, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 403, 692 N.E.2d 148. Although a complainant\u2019s assertion of standing in its complaint may constitute a prima facie showing of standing, the BTA challenged Society\u2019s standing based on Society\u2019s admission in its complaint that it had sold the property in question. The BTA held that Society lost standing to file a valuation complaint once it no longer held title to the property. <em>Id. </em>at 402. Looking to R.C. 5715.19(A), we determined that the only classification under which Society might have standing was as \u201c \u2018[a]ny person <em>owning taxable real property in the </em>county.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>at 403. Because Society did not own the subject property when it filed its valuation complaint, \u201cit became Society\u2019s burden to prove that it owned other taxable real property in the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>at the time it filed its complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404. Society\u2019s complaint did not indicate that it owned any other real property, but we did not hold that Society\u2019s failure to establish standing on the face of its complaint was determinative. Had Society\u2019s failure to correctly identify the property owner and to establish its ownership of other property in the county at the time it filed the complaint been fatal, we would have affirmed the dismissal of Society\u2019s complaint with no further analysis and looked no further than the face of Society\u2019s complaint. Instead, we looked to all the evidence in the record to determine whether Society met its burden of establishing standing. Ultimately, we concluded that \u201cSociety did not offer any evidence <em>at the BOR hearing or before the BTA </em>to prove that at the time it filed its complaint it owned other taxable real property in the county.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>Because Society never presented evidence that it met the threshold standing requirement of R.C. 5715.19(A), it failed to invoke the board of revision\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">{\u00b6 30} <em>Soc. Natl. Bank </em>refutes the notion that a failure to accurately identify the basis of the complainant\u2019s standing on the face of a valuation complaint precludes the board of revision\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction. Like the trust in this case, Society alleged standing as the owner of the subject property but was not the owner when it filed its complaint. In light of the challenge to its standing, Society\u2019s subsequent failure to offer evidence at the board of revision hearing or before the BTA led us to conclude that Society failed to meet its burden of proving standing. <em>See also Village Condominiums Owners Assn. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 223, 2005-Ohio-4631, 833 N.E.2d 1230, \u00b6 9 (reviewing the auditor\u2019s property records, a declaration of condominium ownership, R.C. Chapter 5311, and statements of counsel while considering whether the complainant owned taxable real property in the county for purposes of standing).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">{\u00b6 31} As in <em>Soc. Natl. Bank, </em>a challenge to the trust\u2019s standing required that evidence be submitted to establish the trust\u2019s right to maintain the valuation complaint. To that end, Public Storage submitted documentation to the BTA to demonstrate that the trust owned three properties in Franklin County when it filed its complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Unlike in <em>Soc. Natl. Bank, </em>the record contains evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the trust qualified as an entity entitled to file a valuation complaint pursuant to R.C. 5715.19(A). Whether the submitted evidence is sufficient to establish the trust\u2019s standing is a question to be determined, in the first instance, by the BTA. At oral argument before this court, the BOE\u2019s counsel questioned the sufficiency of the evidence, but the BTA did not consider the parties\u2019 arguments in that regard, and Public Storage was not given the opportunity to clarify or present additional evidence to eliminate any ambiguity in the evidence because the BTA erroneously concluded that the trust\u2019s failure to accurately identify the titleholder of the subject property in its complaint was an insurmountable jurisdictional defect. In any event, the complaint\u2019s mischaracterization of the basis of the trust\u2019s standing is not a jurisdictional defect, and Public Storage must be afforded the opportunity to establish the trust\u2019s standing as of the date that the trust filed its complaint.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AvF\">Sleggs, Danzinger &amp; Gill Co., L.P.A., Todd W.

Accordingly, the BTA erred in concluding that the complaint\u2019s misidentification of the property owner divested the BOR of jurisdiction. Moreover, once Public Storage submitted evidence that the trust owned other real property in Franklin County when it filed its complaint, the BTA should have determined whether the trust had standing to file its complaint. We therefore reverse the BTA\u2019s decision, and we remand this matter to the BTA to determine whether the trust had standing, pursuant to R.C. 5715.19(A), and, if so, to determine the BOE\u2019s appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Decision reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b486-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b486-8\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-9\">. <em>Knickerbocker </em>did not leave the property owner unprotected. Despite .finding no jurisdictional impediment, we held that the board of revision lacked authority to increase the value of the subject property without first complying with its statutory obligation to notify the owner and to do so in a manner, and at an address, reasonably calculated to reach him, consistent with due process. Because the board of revision failed to comply with the statutes requiring it to notify the property owner when it sent notice to an incorrect address, we held that the board of revision\u2019s order increasing the value of the property was invalid. Accordingly, we reversed and remanded the matter for a new hearing to determine the value of the property after appropriate notice to the property owner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">. R.C. 5715.19(B) provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">[T]he auditor shall give notice of each complaint in which the stated amount of overvaluation, undervaluation, discriminatory valuation, illegal valuation, or incorrect determination is at least seventeen thousand five hundred dollars to each property owner whose property is the subject of the complaint, if the complaint was not filed by the owner or the owner\u2019s spouse, and to each board of education whose school district may be affected by the complaint.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">. Public Storage has also consistently argued that the trust held an ownership interest in Hamilton-33 Partnership. R.C. 5715.19(A) provides that in addition to \u201c[a]ny person owning taxable real property in the county,\u201d a partner of a partnership owning taxable real property in the county has standing to maintain a valuation complaint. Public Storage has not expressly argued that the trust\u2019s interest in the partnership establishes its standing, instead relying on that interest to establish that the trust was affected by the valuation of the subject property, as required by R.C. 5715.13. Nevertheless, were the evidence to establish that the trust was a partner in the Hamilton-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>33 Partnership, that evidence would also establish the trust\u2019s standing to maintain the valuation complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
