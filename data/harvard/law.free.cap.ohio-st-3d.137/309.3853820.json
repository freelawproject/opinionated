Wesson appeals from a judgment of a three-judge panel that convicted him of two counts of aggravated murder with death penalty specifications in connection with the death of Emil Varhola, two counts of attempted murder in connection with the stabbing of Mary Varhola, two counts of aggravated robbery, and one count each of having a weapon while under a disability and tampering with evidence. The court merged allied offenses, imposed capital punishment for the aggravated murder of Emil Varhola while committing an aggravated robbery, and sentenced Wesson to an aggregate term of 26 years\u2019 imprisonment for the noncapital offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">{\u00b6 2} Count Three, aggravated murder, and one specification associated with Count Two, the other aggravated murder charge, required proof that Wesson was under detention at the time of the murder; but because the original sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>entry that imposed postrelease control on Wesson placing him under detention is void, we reverse the convictions for Count Three, the specifications related to that count, and Specification One related to Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">{\u00b6 3} However, we affirm the remaining convictions, including the aggravated murder conviction related to Count Two and its death penalty specification, the imposition of capital punishment, and the consecutive aggregate sentence of 26 years as imposed by the three-judge panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 4} On February 25, 2008, Wesson\u2019s girlfriend, Mildrian Ford, filed a police report against him following a dispute. Because Wesson was serving a three-year term of postrelease control following his release from prison in 2007, Ford also notified his parole officer, Julie Clark, of the incident. Clark, together with another parole officer and members of Akron\u2019s fugitive task force, began searching for Wesson.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">{\u00b6 5} That evening, Wesson went to the home of 81-year-old Emil Varhola and his 77-year-old wife, Mary, who lived near Ford and knew Wesson from the neighborhood. Wesson sometimes talked to Emil, who occasionally gave him money or hired him to do odd jobs. Wesson knocked on their door and asked if he could come inside while he waited for Ford\u2019s bus to arrive, and they accommodated him. Emil, who used a portable oxygen tank to breathe, offered Wesson coffee, and the two sat together at the kitchen table. Mary returned to the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">{\u00b6 6} Mary then heard a whistling sound coming from the kitchen. When she returned to the kitchen, she saw Emil lying on the floor in a pool of blood with the whistling sound coming from his windpipe and Wesson rifling through Emil\u2019s pockets. Mary confronted him, and he admitted that he killed Emil, and then he attacked her. He demanded \u201cthe gun,\u201d explaining that he needed it to kill his girlfriend. Mary refused to tell him where Emil kept his handgun, even as Wesson beat and stabbed her. According to Mary, he stopped assaulting her only when he thought she was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">{\u00b6 7} Wesson fled the home, taking a rifle and the cup from which he had drunk and throwing them in a bush in the front yard. He also took Mary\u2019s jewelry and Emil\u2019s wallet containing approximately $800.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">{\u00b6 8} When he left, Mary contacted her son, Paul, who called 9-1-1 to report the incident. When officers arrived, they found Emil dead in the kitchen and Mary hardly able to stand or speak, but she was able to show police where Emil kept his pistol, in a hollowed-out book in the living room. She had multiple stab wounds on her chest and upper abdomen, bruises, and lacerations on her hands and fingers. Her right cheek had a large gash in it with the skin peeled back, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>exposing bone. Emergency personnel transported Mary to the hospital, where she lost consciousness and remained unconscious and on a respirator for more than a month before awaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 9} Officers found blood pooled on the kitchen floor, splattered on the curtains, smeared on the refrigerator, and splashed on the dining room wall and carpet. They noted other signs of a struggle, including objects strewn about and a set of dentures on the floor. The gun cabinet stood open, and one long gun appeared to be missing. Investigators did not find any weapon near Emil\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">{\u00b6 10} Police followed a trail of bloody footprints leading to a bush in the front yard of the home, where they discovered Emil\u2019s long gun and the cup. They subsequently located Emil\u2019s wallet \u2014 which had no money in it \u2014 under the porch of a home several blocks away.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">{\u00b6 11} Based on Mary\u2019s statements, the police began to look for Wesson. With Ford\u2019s assistance, officers located him at the Akron home of Christopher Conley, his cousin, in the early morning hours of February 26, 2008. On a dresser in the room where the police found Wesson, they discovered a straight-edged steak knife with what appeared to be dried blood on it. When they arrested Wesson, they observed blood-soaked bandages on his hands and what appeared to be blood on his sneakers and pants and on a jacket found in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">{\u00b6 12} At the police station, Wesson waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and two detectives interviewed him. He admitted stabbing Emil and Mary, but claimed that he acted in self-defense. He related that he and Mary had an ongoing sexual relationship and that Emil usually watched, but on this occasion he became upset watching them have unprotected sex on the kitchen floor. According to Wesson, Emil threatened him with a long gun and attacked him with a knife, but Wesson was able to disarm and stab Emil. Then, he claimed, he stabbed Mary after she hit him on the head with her cane. Based on Wesson\u2019s assertion that he had engaged in intercourse with Mary, investigators had the hospital perform a rape-kit examination on her, but samples tested negative for semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">{\u00b6 13} An autopsy revealed that Emil had been stabbed eight times \u2014 four times in the torso, once in the neck, and three times in the back' \u2014 -and it revealed defensive wounds on his hands. Dorothy Dean, a deputy medical examiner for the Summit County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, concluded that the stab wounds in Emil\u2019s neck and torso caused his death, and she testified that Emil\u2019s injuries could have been caused by the knife seized at the time of Wesson\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">{\u00b6 14} A grand jury indicted Wesson for three counts of aggravated murder: aggravated murder with prior calculation and design, R.C. 2903.01(A); aggravated murder while committing aggravated robbery, R.C. 2903.01(B); and aggravated murder while under detention, R.C. 2903.01(D). Each count carried three capital specifications: aggravated murder while under detention, R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>2929.04(A)(4)(b); aggravated murder as \u201cpart of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons by the offender,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); and aggravated murder while committing aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). The indictment also charged Wesson with three counts of attempted aggravated murder, two counts of attempted murder, three counts of aggravated robbery, one count of having weapons while under a disability, and one count of tampering with evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 15} Wesson pled not guilty to all charges, waived his right to trial by jury, and elected to be tried by a three-judge panel. Notably, he did not object when the judge presiding over the trial appointed the other two members of the three-judge panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 16} Prior to trial, Wesson moved to suppress his statement to police, alleging that his intoxication at the time of questioning rendered his <em>Miranda </em>waiver invalid, that the warnings had not been properly given, and that police had coerced his statement. The court found, however, that he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily had waived his constitutional rights. Also,' the state filed a motion in limine to exclude an audio recording that Wesson made retracting his statements to police; the trial court granted that motion and excluded the recording as hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">{\u00b6 17} At trial, the state argued that Wesson came to the Varholas\u2019 home looking for a gun to kill his girlfriend and then murdered Emil and attempted to murder Mary. In contrast, the defense presented a theory of a friendly encounter that turned bad, stating that the Varholas had invited Wesson into their home so he would not have to wait for a bus in the cold, but that Emil began to behave erratically, and Wesson, who knew that Emil owned guns, thought Emil had threatened him. Thus, the defense asserted that Wesson stabbed Emil in self-defense and assaulted Mary only when she attacked him with her cane.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 18} At the close of the state\u2019s case, the panel acquitted Wesson of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">{\u00b6 19} In Wesson\u2019s case-in-chief, the defense called a single witness, Akron Police Detective Joseph Urbank, who testified that he had interviewed a woman named Linda Fields about her observations of Wesson on February 25, the date of the murder. Fields died before trial, and by agreement of the parties, the defense played an audio recording of Urbank\u2019s interview with her. On the recording, she claimed that Wesson was at his cousin\u2019s residence, where she had been staying, from 5:00 p.m. until 8:00 p.m. on February 25. He left around 8:00 p.m. and did not return until 10:00 p.m. At that time, he had fresh cuts on his hands and she gave him bandages for the cuts. Fields also told Urbank that she had left the knife on the bedroom dresser earlier that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Following its deliberation on the case, the three-judge panel returned guilty verdicts on the remaining two counts of aggravated murder and on all three specifications for each count. In addition, the panel found Wesson guilty of two counts of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated robbery, one count of having a weapon while under a disability, and one count of tampering with evidence. The trial court merged the two aggravated murder convictions, the two attempted murder convictions, and the two aggravated robbery convictions. The state then elected to have Wesson sentenced for aggravated murder while committing aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 21} After the sentencing hearing, the three-judge panel unanimously found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and sentenced Wesson to death for aggravated murder and to an aggregate term of 26 years in prison for the other convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">{\u00b6 22} On direct appeal to this court, Wesson presents 12 propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AdG\">\n<em>The Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">{\u00b6 23} In proposition of law I, Wesson argues that his due process rights were violated because the indictment did not state the requisite mens rea for aggravated robbery in Count Two, which charged aggravated murder during the course of an aggravated robbery, R.C. 2903.01(B), Counts Seven and Thirteen, which charged aggravated robbery, R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) and (3), or the felony-murder specifications in Counts Two and Three that list aggravated robbery as the basis for the felony-murder specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). But because he did not raise these objections at trial, Wesson has waived error. <em>State v. Horner, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 466, 2010-Ohio-3830, 935 N.E.2d 26, \u00b6 46 (\u201cfailure to timely object to a defect in an indictment constitutes a waiver of the error\u201d). Thus, we conduct a plain-error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">{\u00b6 24} Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution guarantees that \u201cno person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous, crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury.\u201d As we recently explained in <em>Horner,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">[t]he purpose of a grand jury indictment has always been to give notice to the accused: \u201c[A] criminal offense must be charged with reasonable certainty in the indictment so as to apprise the defendant of that which he may expect to meet and be required to answer; so that the court and jury may know what they are to try, and the court may determine without unreasonable difficulty what evidence is admissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 10, quoting <em>Horton v. State, </em>85 Ohio St. 13, 19, 96 N.E. 797 (1911). Thus, we have recognized that even when an indictment fails to charge the mens rea of the offense, it is not defective as long as it \u201ctracks the language of the criminal statute describing the offense,\u201d because that suffices to \u201cprovide} ] the defendant with adequate notice of the charges against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 25} In this case, Count Two of the indictment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">[The grand jurors find that] HERSIE R. WESSON * * * did commit the crime of AGGRAVATED MURDER in that he did purposely cause the death of Emil Varhola, while committing or attempting to commit, or while fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery, in violation of section 2903.01(B) of the Revised Code</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">(Capitalization and boldface sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">{\u00b6 26} Count Two identifies the mens rea for aggravated felony murder as \u201cpurposefully.\u201d <em>See State v. Fry, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-1017, 926 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 40. It is unnecessary for this count to charge the elements of the predicate offense \u2014 aggravated robbery \u2014 because \u201cit is the predicate offense itself and not the elements of the predicate offense that is an essential element of the charged offense.\u201d <em>State v. Buehner, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 403, 2006-Ohio-4707, 853 N.E.2d 1162, \u00b6 12. However, Wesson contends that the indictment for this count is defective because it names the predicate offense \u2014 aggravated robbery\u2014 without citing the Revised Code section for that offense. Yet he cites no authority for this proposition; moreover, the indictment charged aggravated robbery in Counts Seven and Thirteen, and those counts do cite the code section. Thus, \u201c[r]eading the felony-murder counts in pari materia with the related felony counts provided ample notification of the elements of the underlying felonies * * * that the state had to prove.\u201d <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 29. The indictment therefore provided sufficient notice of the predicate offense charged in Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">{\u00b6 27} Wesson also claims that the felony-murder specifications attached to Counts Two and Three alleging that Wesson was the principal offender of an aggravated murder while committing aggravated robbery should have charged the mental state of recklessness. However, as we explained in <em>Fry, </em>capital specifications provided in R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) \u201cdo[ ] not include a mens rea component.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 51. Thus, this indictment is not defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">{\u00b6 28} Regarding Count Seven, Wesson asserts that the indictment did not include the reckless mens rea for aggravated robbery, R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). Count Seven of the indictment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>[The grand jurors find that] HERSIE R. WESSON * * * did commit the crime of AGGRAVATED ROBBERY in that he did, in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, have a deadly weapon, to wit: a knife, on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control and either display the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender possesses it, or use it, in violation of Section 2911.01(A)(1) of the Revised Code * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">(Capitalization and boldface sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">{\u00b6 29} Recklessness is not an element of the charged offense. R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) applies only to persons \u201cattempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code,\u201d and incorporates the mens rea of the underlying theft offense. <em>Horner, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 466, 2010-Ohio-3830, 935 N.E.2d 26, at \u00b6 49; <em>see also Buehner, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 403, 2006-Ohio-4707, 853 N.E.2d 1162, at \u00b6 10-12. And as we explained in <em>State v. Lester, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 396, 2009-Ohio-4225, 916 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 32-33, the mens rea of recklessness does not apply to the element of displaying, brandishing, indicating possession of, or using a deadly weapon, because the General Assembly imposed strict liability as to that element, and therefore \u201cthe state is not required to charge a mens rea for this element of the crime of aggravated robbery under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1).\u201d In any case, because the indictment tracks the language of the criminal statute describing the offense, it provides adequate notice of the charges. <em>Homer </em>at \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">{\u00b6 30} Wesson raises a similar objection to Count Thirteen of the indictment, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">[The grand jurors find that] HERSIE R. WESSON * * * did commit the crime of AGGRAVATED ROBBERY in that he did, in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, <em>recklessly </em>inflict, or attempt to inflict, serious physical harm on another, to wit: Emil Varhola and/or Mary Varhola, in violation of Section 2911.01(A)(3) of the Ohio Revised Code * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">(Capitalization and boldface sic; italics added for emphasis.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">{\u00b6 31} As discussed with regard to Count Seven, R.C. 2911.01(A)(3) applies only to persons \u201cattempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>2913.01 of the Revised Code,\u201d and R.C. 2911.01 thereby incorporates the mens rea of the underlying theft offense. But as to the element involving physical harm, Count Thirteen of the indictment tracks the language of the statute, and in any case, it identifies recklessness as the requisite mens rea.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 32} Hence, Wesson has failed to demonstrate plain error, and we therefore overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Miranda <em>Waiver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">{\u00b6 33} Proposition of law Y argues that Wesson did not validly waive his rights in accordance with <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and therefore his motion to suppress his statement to the police should have been granted. Wesson received <em>Miranda </em>warnings and orally waived each <em>Miranda </em>right before making a statement to police. He nonetheless claims that \u201cthe combination of the lack of sleep, the alcohol, the coercive nature of the setting and defendant\u2019s lack of education combined to render [his] waiver invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">{\u00b6 34} When a suspect is questioned in a custodial setting, the Fifth Amendment requires that he receive <em>Miranda </em>warnings to protect against compelled self-incrimination. <em>Miranda </em>at 478-479. A suspect may then knowingly and intelligently waive these rights and agree to make a statement. <em>Id. </em>at 479. If a defendant later challenges a confession as involuntary, the state must prove a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver by a preponderance of evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 475; <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 168-169, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">{\u00b6 35} To determine whether a valid waiver occurred, we \u201cconsider the totality of the circumstances, including the age, mentality, and prior criminal experience of the accused; the length, intensity, and frequency of interrogation; the existence of physical deprivation or mistreatment; and the existence of threat or inducement.\u201d <em>State v. Edwards, </em>49 Ohio St.2d 31, 358 N.E.2d 1051 (1976), paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>see also Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 285, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991). We have held that a waiver is not involuntary <em>unless </em>there is evidence of police coercion, such as physical abuse, threats, or deprivation of food, medical treatment, or sleep. <em>State v. Cooey, </em>46 Ohio St.3d 20, 28, 544 N.E.2d 895 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">{\u00b6 36} At the suppression hearing, the trial court heard testimony from an expert witness called by the defense, Dr. Robert Bellotto <em>Jr., </em>who used the Widmark Method to estimate Wesson\u2019s blood-alcohol level at the time of his statement based on information given to him by the defense. Some of the factors he considered included height, weight, age, gender, amount and type of alcohol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>and food consumed, alcohol-elimination rate, and history of alcohol use. Bellotto stated that a 50-year-old male chronic alcoholic who is five feet, seven inches tall and weighs 147 pounds, who consumed a large bottle of Mogen David wine (18 percent alcohol) and six to eight beers (5.5 percent alcohol) between early afternoon and 11:00 p.m., and who slept from approximately 11:15 p.m. to 3:15 a.m. would have a blood-alcohol level of .17 grams per deciliter at 4:00 a.m. But he conceded that he did not know how much alcohol or food Wesson had actually consumed on February 25 or Wesson\u2019s alcohol-elimination rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">{\u00b6 37} During his testimony at the suppression hearing, Wesson claimed that he drank a \u201cfifth\u201d of Mogen David wine and a considerable amount of beer throughout the day on February 25, but that he did not drink any alcohol between 11:00 p.m. that evening, when he went to bed, and 4:00 a.m. the next morning, when police questioned him. He further claimed to have been intoxicated and falling from his chair during the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">{\u00b6 38} In response, the state presented testimony from four law enforcement officers who interacted with Wesson on the morning of February 26, 2008, each of whom testified that he did not observe any signs of intoxication or smell alcohol on his breath, and the three officers Wesson spoke to that morning testified that they did not detect any slurring of his speech. Wesson had had no trouble sitting upright or walking, and he responded appropriately to the questions asked. The officers who had questioned Wesson denied that he had fallen out of his seat during the interview. The state also presented the testimony of Steve Perch, a toxicologist from the Summit County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, who questioned Bellotto\u2019s finding and stated that it would not be possible to correctly estimate Wesson\u2019s blood-alcohol level without knowing his elimination rate, his food consumption that day, or his typical alcohol consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">{\u00b6 39} The court denied the motion to suppress and found \u201cthe detectives\u2019 testimony credible and supported by the recording of [Wesson\u2019s] interview.\u201d After considering all the circumstances, the court determined that Wesson \u201cmade a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his constitutional rights, and that his statement to police was voluntarily made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">{\u00b6 40} As we explained in <em>State v. Burnside, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, \u201c[a]ppellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and is therefore in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8. And we also stated: \u201c[A]n appellate court must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. * * * Accepting these facts as true, the appellate court must then independently determine, without defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ence to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">(\u00b6 41} Wesson argues that his intoxication, lack of sleep, and lack of education, in addition to the coercive nature of the interview setting, rendered the waiver of his constitutional rights invalid. Here, however, the trial court finding that Wesson validly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights is supported by competent and credible evidence, consisting of the testimony of the four police officers and the audio recording of Wesson\u2019s statement. Wesson\u2019s claim of a limited education may evidence \u201clow mental aptitude,\u201d but that alone does not demonstrate involuntariness. <em>State v. Hill, </em>64 Ohio St.3d 313, 318, 595 N.E.2d 884 (1992), citing <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. at 164, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473. Notably, Wesson\u2019s prior criminal record shows familiarity with the criminal process, and he himself recited the <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the suppression hearing. This record does not support his allegation of police coercion, as neither the audio recording of the statement nor the testimony from the suppression hearing indicates any physical abuse, threats, or efforts to deprive Wesson of food, medical treatment, or sleep. The actions of the detectives in seating him in a fixed chair and handcuffing him to a steel table in an interrogation room while they questioned him for less than one hour do not amount to police coercion. <em>See McCall v. Dutton, </em>863 F.2d 454 (6th Cir.1988) (no coercion when officers handcuffed a defendant and placed him on the ground, then numerous armed officers surrounded and yelled at him); <em>State v. Brewer, </em>48 Ohio St.3d 50, 58, 549 N.E.2d 491 (1990) (\u201cfinding] nothing improper in the \u2018length, intensity, and frequency\u2019 of the questioning\u201d when there was no evidence of deprivation or mistreatment and \u201cthe actual interview took up only about three hours\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">{\u00b642} Based on the totality of the circumstances presented here, Wesson validly waived his Miranda rights, and we reject this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\n<em>Selection of the Three-Judge Panel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">{\u00b6 43} In proposition of law IV, Wesson argues that the trial court violated R.C. 2945.06 and his due process rights because Judge Teodosio, the judge assigned to hear Wesson\u2019s criminal trial, selected the other two judges who served on the three-judge panel that adjudicated his guilt and imposed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">{\u00b6 44} R.C. 2945.06 provides the procedure for appointing judges when the accused in a death penalty case waives the right to trial by jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">[The accused] shall be tried by a court to be composed of three judges, consisting of the judge presiding at the time in the trial of criminal cases and two other judges to be designated by the presiding judge or chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>justice of that court, and in case there is neither a presiding judge nor a chief justice, by the chief justice of the supreme court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">{\u00b6 45} Wesson waived his right to a jury trial and elected to have the case tried to a three-judge panel. After reviewing our decision in <em>State v. Eley, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 174, 672 N.E.2d 640 (1996), Judge Teodosio concluded that as the judge presiding over the case, he had the authority to designate the other judges to serve on the panel. Wesson executed an amended written waiver, consenting to be tried by a panel \u201cconsisting of Judge Thomas A. Teodosio, presiding at this time, and two other judges to be designated pursuant to law.\u201d Judge Teodosio then appointed Judges Brenda Burnham Unruh and Robert M. Gippin to the panel and docketed a journal entry confirming that the court had constituted the panel as \u201cselected and approved by counsel for Defendant.\u201d Wesson never objected to Judge Teodosio\u2019s decision to appoint the panel nor sought to withdraw the jury waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 46} The term \u201cpresiding judge,\u201d as used in R.C. 2945.06, does not refer to the judge to whom a capital case has been assigned, but rather refers to the presiding judge of the common pleas court. The statute requires the court to be composed of three judges: the judge presiding at the time in the case and two others to be designated by the presiding judge or chief justice of the common pleas court, and when there is neither, then by the chief justice of the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the General Assembly had intended to allow the judge assigned to preside over a capital murder trial to appoint the other two judges of the three-judge panel, then there would be no need to designate the chief justice of the Supreme Court to appoint the judges when there is neither a presiding judge nor a chief justice of the common pleas court, because there would always be a judge presiding over the capital case. Thus, the term \u201cpresiding judge,\u201d as used in R.C. 2945.06, does not refer to the judge presiding over the assigned capital case. Instead, it refers to the judge who serves as the presiding judge over a multiple judge common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 47} We realize that the trial court here reviewed and relied on our statement in <em>Eley, </em>paraphrasing R.C. 2945.06 as \u201cproviding] that the three-judge panel is to be composed of three judges: the judge presiding at the time in the trial of criminal cases and two judges to be designated by that judge or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>presiding judge or chief justice of that court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184. However, that language is dicta, as <em>Eley </em>presented no question regarding the authority to appoint members of the three-judge panel, and it is inconsistent with the plain meaning of R.C. 2945.06. We disavow our statement in <em>Eley </em>that the judge presiding over the capital case may designate the other two judges, and we clarify that when a person charged with a capital offense waives a jury, the panel hearing the case shall be composed of three judges, two of whom shall be designated by the presiding judge or the chief justice of the common pleas court, and if no one holds either position, then they shall be designated by the chief justice of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">{\u00b6 48} Accordingly, the judge presiding over Wesson\u2019s trial, who was neither the presiding judge nor the chief justice of the Summit County Common Pleas Court, lacked authority to designate the other two members of the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 49} We have held that trial courts must strictly comply with R.C. 2945.06 and convene a three-judge panel when the accused in a capital case waives a jury. <em>See State v. Pless, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 333, 658 N.E.2d 766 (1996), paragraph one of the syllabus (holding that the jury-waiver requirements in R.C. 2945.05 must be strictly observed); <em>Pratts v. Hurley, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 81, 2004-Ohio-1980, 806 N.E.2d 992, \u00b6 14 (requiring strict compliance with statutory procedures for three-judge panels). Further, in <em>Pratts, </em>we noted that strict compliance with the mandate for a three-judge panel may not be voluntarily waived and the failure to strictly comply with the mandate is always reversible error on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 50} However, we have never held that error in the selection of the three-judge panel is per se reversible error nor that such an error could not be waived. Rather, we have recognized that not every trial court error in applying R.C. 2945.06 is automatically reversible error. In <em>State v. Turner, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 331, 2005-Ohio-1938, 826 N.E.2d 266, for example, we considered the requirement that the three-judge panel \u201cexamine the witnesses\u201d to determine the accused\u2019s guilt. There, the court had failed to comply with R.C. 2945.06, admitting evidence through agreed stipulations of facts rather than through live testimony, but we declined to hold that the error was reversible. Quoting our prior decision in <em>State v. Post, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 380, 393, 513 N.E.2d 754 (1987), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">\u201cAgreements, waivers and stipulations made by the accused, or by the accused\u2019s counsel in his presence, during the course of a criminal trial are binding and enforceable. * * * Although R.C. 2945.06 requires the court to \u2018examine the witnesses\u2019 in determining whether the accused is guilty of aggravated murder, we find that appellant was bound by the agreed-upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>procedure wherein the state would proffer a statement of .facts in lieu of witnesses or other evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><em>Turner </em>at \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 51} Here, Wesson accepted the court\u2019s method of appointing the members of the three-judge panel. He executed an amended jury waiver in open court immediately after Judge Teodosio explained that he would designate the members of the panel, and the journal entry confirmed that the court had constituted the panel as \u201cselected and approved by counsel for Defendant.\u201d And because Wesson never objected to the procedure followed by Judge Teodosio to select the panel members nor objected to the panel members, he has forfeited all but plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 52} Reversal for plain error \u201cis warranted only if the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different absent the error.\u201d <em>State v. Hill, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 191, 203, 749 N.E.2d 274 (2001). But here, Wesson makes no argument \u2014 and therefore does not demonstrate \u2014 that the appointment of different members to the three-judge panel would have changed the outcome of the proceeding. Further, both of the panelists served as members of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas. Nothing suggests that either was ineligible or unqualified to hear the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">{\u00b6 53} Because Wesson fails to demonstrate plain error, this proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">\n<em>Right to Present a Complete Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">{\u00b6 54} Proposition of law III asserts that the trial court violated Wesson\u2019s due process rights when it refused to admit a recording of his retraction of the statement he made to police on the day of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">{\u00b6 55} When confronted by detectives, Wesson initially claimed that he and Mary had a sexual relationship, that Emil regularly watched them engage in intercourse, and that he and Mary were having sex when Emil became angry and threatened him with a gun and a knife. He further stated that in response to the threat, he stabbed Emil, and because Mary struck him with her cane, he also stabbed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">{\u00b6 56} Prior to trial, defense counsel notified the court that Wesson \u201crepudiates the statement made by him on the day of his arrest to Detective Harrah\u201d and submitted an audio recording of the repudiation, asserting that the tape \u201ccall[ed] into question the admissibility of his arrest day statement\u201d by proving that it was \u201cuntrustworthy and unreliable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">{\u00b6 57} The state moved to exclude the repudiation recording from trial, arguing that it constituted inadmissible hearsay. The trial court excluded the recording, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>concluding that Evid.R. 801(D)(2) does not permit a party to offer his <em>own </em>out-of-court statement as an admission by a party opponent.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">{\u00b6 58} Wesson concedes that the Rules of Evidence bar admission of his repudiation. <em>See State v. Cunningham, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, \u00b6 105 (\u201cA party may not introduce his own statement under Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(a)\u201d); <em>In re Coy, </em>67 Ohio St.3d 215, 218, 616 N.E.2d 1105 (1993). However, he asserts that applying the hearsay rule in these circumstances deprived him of the constitutional right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c[T]he Constitution guarantees criminal defendants \u2018a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crane v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 683, 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986), quoting <em>California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 485, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984). However, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s right to present relevant evidence is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restriction.\u201d <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998). And states have a legitimate interest in ensuring that triers of fact are presented with reliable evidence and have \u201cbroad latitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials\u201d to further that goal. <em>Scheffer </em>at 308, 309. Such \u201crules do not abridge an accused\u2019s right to present a defense so long as they are not \u2018arbitrary\u2019 or \u2018disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve\u2019 \u201d and if they do not \u201cinfringe[ ] upon a weighty interest of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308, quoting <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 56, 58, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 60} Ohio\u2019s rule excluding hearsay statements offered by a party to advance that party\u2019s own interests is neither arbitrary nor disproportionate. The general rule excluding hearsay, \u201cwhich has long been recognized and respected by virtually every State,\u201d traditionally excludes \u201c[o]ut-of-court statements * * * because they lack the conventional indicia of reliability: they are usually not made under oath or other circumstances that impress the speaker with the solemnity of his statements; the declarant\u2019s word is not subject to cross-examination; and he is not available in order that his demeanor and credibility may be assessed\u201d by the trier of fact. <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 298, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973), citing <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970). This rule is \u201cbased on experience and grounded in the notion that untrustworthy evidence should not be presented to the triers of fact,\u201d <em>id., </em>and therefore, excluding self-serving hearsay statements that are not subject to cross-examination or made under circumstances ensuring their reliability is neither arbitrary nor disproportionate to the purposes the rule is designed to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>{\u00b6 61} In this case, Wesson has failed to demonstrate that applying the hearsay rule to his statement \u201cinfringed upon a weighty interest of the accused.\u201d <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. at 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413. Although he asserts that excluding his repudiation undermined his ability to combat the prejudicial effect of his statement to police, he does not explain how it impaired his ability to offer any particular defense. Moreover, he could have repudiated his statement to police at trial, if he were willing to do so under oath and subject himself to cross-examination, but he chose not to do so, and he is precluded from introducing his own inadmissible hearsay repudiation as a substitute for that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">{\u00b6 62} For these reasons, this proposition is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\n<em>Conviction for Committing Aggravated Murder While Under Detention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 63} Proposition of law II asserts that Wesson\u2019s conviction for committing aggravated murder while under detention and his convictions for the specifications charging that he committed aggravated murder while under detention are invalid because the sentence imposing the postrelease control that caused him to be under detention is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">{\u00b6 64} At trial, the state proved that Wesson had been convicted in 2003 of burglary, violating a protection order, criminal damaging or endangering, and domestic violence. Pursuant to R.C. 2967.28(B)(2), Wesson\u2019s conviction for burglary, a second-degree felony, required the trial court to impose a prison sentence and a mandatory three-year term of postrelease control, but the trial court mistakenly sentenced him to a three-year discretionary term of postrelease control to be served at the discretion of the Adult Parole Authority. In May 2007, the Adult Parole Authority released him from prison subject to a three-year term of postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">{\u00b6 65} Within a year of his release, Wesson murdered Emil, and the state charged him with committing aggravated murder while under detention. Relying on the 2003 sentencing entry and Wesson\u2019s postrelease-control order, the three-judge panel found Wesson guilty of committing aggravated murder while under detention (Count Three) and of two specifications for committing aggravated murder while under detention (Specification One to Count Two and Specification One to Count Three).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">{\u00b6 66} In <em>State v. Billiter, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 103, 2012-Ohio-5144, 980 N.E.2d 960, we concluded that an offender could not be convicted of escape when his term of postrelease control was void. In that case, Billiter had been convicted of aggravated burglary and domestic violence and sentenced to imprisonment and postrelease control in 1998. After he served his prison term and the Adult Parole Authority placed him on postrelease control, Billiter violated the terms of his release, and he subsequently pled guilty to escape in 2004. He did not appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>but in 2010, he filed a motion to vacate the escape conviction, seeking to invalidate his 2004 guilty plea because his 1998 postrelease-control sentence was void. The trial court denied the motion and the court of appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 67} Reversing the appellate court, we held that Billiter\u2019s 1998 sentence was void because it imposed an incorrect term of postrelease control, that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s incorrect sentence for postrelease control in 1998 was insufficient to confer authority upon the Adult Parole Authority to impose up to three years of postrelease control on Billiter,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 12, and that he \u201c[was] not barred by res judicata from arguing that his plea [to the escape charge] is void,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 68} Here, Wesson\u2019s 2003 sentence failed to impose a mandatory three-year term of postrelease control, and so that part of the 2003 sentence is void. <em>See </em>R.C. 2967.28(B)(2); <em>Billiter </em>at \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Fischer, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, 942 N.E.2d 332, \u00b6 26. Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Billiter, </em>we reverse the conviction for (1) Count Three, (2) the specifications to Count Three, and (3) the specification to Count Two that Wesson committed aggravated murder while under detention. For the reasons explained in our independent sentencing evaluation below, Wesson\u2019s sentence of death for Count Two is unaffected by this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>Allied Offenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">{\u00b6 69} Proposition of law VI contends that aggravated robbery (Count Seven) and tampering with evidence (Count Ten) are allied offenses of similar import because both involved Wesson\u2019s carrying a gun and a cup out of the Varholas\u2019 house and discarding them in the bushes in the front of the house. According to Wesson, his \u201canimus for taking the items from the house was the same as the animus for making these items unavailable to the prosecution.\u201d The trial court sentenced Wesson to nine years for the robbery conviction and four years for tampering with evidence, to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">{\u00b6 70} R.C. 2941.25(A) states: \u201cWhere the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.\u201d But pursuant to R.C. 2941.25(B), \u201cwhere his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\u201d Thus, as we explained in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061, \u201c[w]hen determining whether two offenses are allied offenses of similar import subject to merger under R.C. 2941.25, the conduct of the accused must be considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>{\u00b6 71} Wesson\u2019s allied offenses claim fails because the same conduct is not the basis of both convictions. Wesson tampered with evidence when he removed the cup and the long gun from the Varhola home and concealed them in the bushes. He committed other conduct supporting the aggravated robbery conviction when he stole Emil\u2019s wallet and Mary\u2019s jewelry. Notably, the trial court referred to the stolen wallet when discussing the aggravating circumstance of the aggravated robbery in its sentencing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">{\u00b6 72} Because the aggravated robbery and the tampering with evidence involve separate conduct and different property, they are not allied offenses and Wesson can be separately sentenced on each conviction. We therefore reject this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\n<em>Victim-Impact Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">{\u00b6 73} In proposition of law VII, Wesson claims that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated by the introduction of four victim-impact statements that were given before the trial court issued its sentencing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">{\u00b6 74} The Eighth Amendment does not bar the admission of victim-impact evidence. <em>Payne v. Tennessee, </em>501 U.S. 808, 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991). Rather, as the court explained in <em>Payne, </em>each \u201c[s]tate may legitimately conclude that evidence about the victim and about the impact of [a] murder on the victim\u2019s family is relevant to the [fact-finder\u2019s] decision as to whether or not the death penalty should be imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And in <em>State v. Smith, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-Ohio-6659, 780 N.E.2d 221, we held: \u201cVictim-impact evidence is permitted where it elicits the effect that the victim\u2019s death has had on family members. * * * However, victim-impact evidence that expresses an opinion as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed is inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">{\u00b6 75} In this case, Paul Varhola\u2019s statement reflected on his father\u2019s military service and character, the heinous nature of the crime, and the impact that his mother\u2019s injuries had on the family. His wife explained the impact of the crime on her family, described Wesson as having taken advantage of Emil\u2019s friendship and generosity, and expressed her wish that Wesson be sentenced to death so he could not hurt anyone else. The victims\u2019 nephew, Dennis Woods, explained how Emil\u2019s murder and Mary\u2019s injuries had affected their family, neighbors, and friends. Woods called Wesson a liar, \u201ca menace to society,\u201d \u201ca pathetic coward with no respect for human life,\u201d and among \u201cthe worst scum of any society\u201d because he \u201cprey[s] on the weak and the defenseless.\u201d Woods said that it had been proved \u201cbeyond a shadow of a doubt that justice can only be served if Hersie R. Wesson is sentenced to death.\u201d And in a recorded statement, Mary described Wesson as a liar who took advantage of her husband, explained how the crime had ruined her finances and home, and expressed her wish that the court sentence Wesson to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>{\u00b6 76} The foregoing demonstrates that the trial court improperly permitted statements about punishment for the crime, specifically, statements recommending that capital punishment be imposed; however, these statements were presented to a three-judge panel, not a jury, and we have recognized that when an improper victim-impact statement is conveyed only to judges, \u201cit is not reversible error unless there is some indication that the judge actually considered it in sentencing the defendant to death.\u201d <em>State v. Franklin, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, \u00b6 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 77} Nothing in this record suggests that the panel relied on the victim-impact statements in reaching its sentencing decision, and Wesson admits that the sentencing opinion does not refer to the victim-impact statements. <em>See State v. Goodwin, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 331, 343, 703 N.E.2d 1251 (1999) (finding no improper influence where the judge heard an improper victim-impact statement but the sentencing opinion did not refer to the statement); <em>State v. Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 460, 489, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001) (holding that no reversible error occurred where the court did not refer to the \u201cimproper sentencing recommendation either orally at sentencing or in the court\u2019s written sentencing opinion\u201d). Notably, here, the victim-impact statements were presented to the court only after the panel had decided to impose a death sentence and had announced that it \u201cunanimously finds by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aggravating circumstances the Defendant was found guilty of committing outweighed the mitigating factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 78} Wesson asserts that because the panel was authorized to change its sentencing decision after hearing the victim-impact statements, it may have been improperly influenced by the statements into maintaining its original decision. This speculation does not show improper influence, and Wesson points to nothing demonstrating that the statements affected the decision to impose capital punishment. Thus, as we explained in <em>State v. Hale, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, when there is no indication that the trial court considered the victim-impact statements in arriving at its sentencing decision, \u201c \u2018[t]his court will presume that a trial court considered only the relevant, material, and competent evidence in arriving at its judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 148, quoting <em>State v. Myers, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 335, 2002-Ohio-6658, 780 N.E.2d 186, \u00b6 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">{\u00b6 79} Therefore, this proposition lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">{\u00b6 80} In proposition of law VIII, Wesson claims ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial. He identifies five instances of allegedly deficient performance, each of which recasts one of his substantive propositions of law as an ineffective-assistance claim. He also makes a blanket claim that counsel rendered deficient performance with respect to \u201carguments addressed elsewhere in [his] brief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>{\u00b6 81} To establish his claim, Wesson bears the burden to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d as determined by \u201cprevailing professional norms\u201d and to demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). When performing this analysis, courts \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 82} Three of Wesson\u2019s ineffective assistance claims may be denied for the same reasons that we rejected the errors asserted in propositions I, VI, and VII.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Counsel did not perform deficiently (1) by \u201cfailing] to object to the improper indictment which did not include the <em>mens rea </em>for Aggravated Robbery,\u201d because the indictment was not defective, (2) by failing to request merger of the aggravated robbery and tampering counts, because they were based on different conduct, or (3) by failing to object to victim-impact statements, because Wesson suffered no prejudice and there is no indication that the court relied on these statements in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 83} Wesson also asserts ineffective assistance because counsel failed to object to Judge Teodosio\u2019s appointment of the three-judge panel. We have clarified that as the judge presiding over the trial, Judge Teodosio should not have appointed the other members of the panel. Nonetheless, Wesson fails to demonstrate any reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s failure to object, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland </em>at 694. Nothing in the record or Wesson\u2019s brief indicates that different judges would have been appointed or that had different judges been appointed, the outcome of the trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">{\u00b6 84} Wesson\u2019s claim that counsel provided ineffective assistance by not contesting the state\u2019s proof that he committed the murder while under detention is mooted by our resolution of proposition of law II.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">{\u00b6 85} For the foregoing reasons, we reject this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">\n<em>Cumulative Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">{\u00b6 86} In proposition of law IX, Wesson raises cumulative error. According to Wesson, the trial court deprived him of a fair trial due to a combination of errors that violated the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>{\u00b6 87} The cumulative error doctrine provides that \u201ca conviction will be reversed when the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the numerous instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute cause for reversal.\u201d <em>State v. Powell, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, \u00b6 223, citing <em>State v. DeMarco, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 191, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">{\u00b6 88} Here, Wesson cannot point to \u201cmultiple instances of harmless error.\u201d <em>State v. Garner, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 49, 64, 656 N.E.2d 623 (1995). Nor does Wesson explain how the alleged errors collectively deprived him of a fair trial, and as we explained in <em>State v. Bethel, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 416, 2006-Ohio-4853, 854 N.E.2d 150, \u201cit is not enough simply to intone the phrase \u2018cumulative error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 89} Accordingly, this proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\n<em>Settled Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">{\u00b6 90} In propositions X, XI, and XII, Wesson presents 12 constitutional challenges to Ohio\u2019s capital punishment scheme. We summarily reject these claims, as we have done in prior decisions. <em>See, e.g., Fry, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-1017, 926 N.E.2d 1239, at \u00b6 215-216; <em>State v. Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 381-383; <em>State v. Carter, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607-608, 734 N.E.2d 345 (2000). As we explained in <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 473 N.E.2d 264 (1984), paragraph one of the syllabus, \u201cOhio\u2019s statutory framework for imposition of capital punishment, as adopted by the General Assembly effective October 19, 1981, and in the context of the arguments raised herein, does not violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution or any provision of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 91} Wesson also argues that Ohio\u2019s death penalty statutes violate international law and treaties and therefore offend the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. However, we have \u201crejected the argument that Ohio\u2019s death penalty statutes are in violation of treaties to which the United States is a signatory, and thus offend[ ] the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Bey, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 487, 502, 709 N.E.2d 484 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">{\u00b6 92} These propositions of law are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">INDEPENDENT SENTENCING EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">{\u00b6 93} Because we affirm Wesson\u2019s conviction for aggravated felony murder, R.C. 2903.01(B), we are required to independently review the sentence of death imposed by the trial court. R.C. 2929.05(A). In doing so, we must determine whether the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding of aggravating circumstances, whether the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and whether Wesson\u2019s death sentence is proportionate to those affirmed in similar cases. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\n<em>Aggravating Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 94} The court convicted Wesson of specifications alleging that he (1) murdered Emil Yarhola as \u201cpart of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons by the offender,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and (2) was \u201cthe principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder\u201d and committed that murder while \u201ccommitting, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit * * * aggravated robbery,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). The evidence at trial supports the finding of both aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 95} First, the evidence establishes that Wesson\u2019s murder of Emil and attempted murder of Mary were purposeful and part of a single course of conduct. <em>See </em>R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). Wesson used the same knife to stab both victims, and the attacks were linked in time and place. <em>See State v. Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 52 (factors such as time, location, and murder weapon can establish the factual link proving a course of conduct). The evidence also supports the conclusion that Wesson acted purposefully. He stabbed Emil eight times, inflicting two fatal wounds, and when Mary discovered Wesson standing over her husband\u2019s body, he stabbed her several times in the chest and upper abdomen. According to Mary\u2019s testimony, Wesson stopped attacking her only when she pretended to be dead. The evidence supports the trial court finding that Wesson is guilty of the specification set forth in R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">{\u00b6 96} Second, the evidence also proves that Wesson committed the crime as the principal offender and murdered Emil in the course of committing aggravated robbery. <em>See </em>R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Wesson acted alone and took a gun, a cup, Emil\u2019s wallet, and Mary\u2019s jewelry from the home when he left. This evidence supports the trial court finding that Wesson is guilty of the specification set forth in R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">{\u00b6 97} The trial court also found Wesson guilty of a third specification, committing the offense while under detention as a result of a prior conviction pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(4)(b). We reverse that finding of guilt based on the improper imposition of postrelease control in 2003. We further conclude that the trial court erred by considering that specification as an aggravating circumstance. However, we cure that error by excluding that specification from our independent review of Wesson\u2019s sentence. <em>State v. Davis, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 107, 115, 666 N.E.2d 1099 (1996) (affirming death sentence after reversing a conviction for an attempted-rape specification and \u201cindependently reweigh[ing] the remaining aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors\u201d); <em>see Clemons v. Mississippi, </em>494 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>U.S. 738, 745, 110 S.Ct. 1441, 108 L.Ed.2d 725 (1990); <em>Stringer v. Black, </em>503 U.S. 222, 230-231, 112 S.Ct. 1130, 117 L.Ed.2d 367 (1992). In accord with the foregoing authority, we exclude this third specification \u2014 that Wesson committed the offense while under detention as a result of a prior conviction \u2014 from our independent sentencing evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\n<em>Mitigating Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 98} We are further required to determine whether the aggravating circumstances of which Wesson has been convicted \u2014 excluding the commission of the offense while under detention \u2014 outweigh the mitigating factors in this case beyond a reasonable doubt. In doing so, we consider whether there is anything mitigating about the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense, [or] the history, character, and background of the offender.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B). In addition, we consider the specific mitigating factors set forth in R.C. 2929.04(B): (B)(1) (victim inducement), (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation), (B)(3) (mental disease or defect), (B)(4) (youth of the offender), (B)(5) (lack of a significant criminal record), (B)(6) (accomplice only), and (B)(7) (any other relevant factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">{\u00b6 99} During the penalty phase of the trial, defense counsel argued that two of the statutory mitigating factors are present in this case. One, a claim that Wesson has a mental condition affecting his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. <em>See </em>R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). Two, a variety of other factors relevant to whether Wesson should receive a death sentence pursuant to the catchall mitigation provision contained in R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). In support, Wesson presented two mitigation witnesses and made an unsworn statement in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">{\u00b6 100} Wesson\u2019s older sister, Yvette Wesson, testified about Wesson\u2019s family background and his formative years. She testified that he has two full siblings, several half-siblings, children, and many grandchildren, and that he has the support of his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">{\u00b6 101} His mother, Barbara Wesson, worked multiple jobs and often relied on family, friends, and neighbors to help out during Wesson\u2019s youth. The family moved frequently, living in various homes in the Cleveland and Detroit areas. The Wessons\u2019 house burned down when Wesson was five years old, and the family moved in with Wesson\u2019s paternal grandmother. The children were later separated and lived with different family members for a while before their mother was able to care for them again. The Children\u2019s Services Board periodically monitored the family throughout Wesson\u2019s youth.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">{\u00b6 102} Yvette considered herself his primary caregiver for the first five or six years of his life. She recalled an incident when her mother and grandmother wanted to go out but lacked a babysitter, so they locked the children in the closet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>with a baby bottle filled with milk and gin (for Wesson, then an infant) and a bottle of beer (for Yvette, then two and one-half years old). When Wesson drank the bottle, he passed out and Yvette thought he had died.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 103} Wesson\u2019s parents were both alcoholics, and Barbara drank alcohol during her pregnancies. His father, Hersie Wesson Sr., turned violent when drunk, regularly beating the children with instruments like razor straps, bed slats, electric cords, belts, and switches. His father gave him a particularly hard time, telling Wesson that he did not have his father\u2019s blood \u2014 Wesson had received a blood transfusion at birth \u2014 and regularly belittling and beating him for stuttering.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 104} His father moved out of the family home when Wesson was five or six years old, and his mother hired a babysitter to care for the children while she worked. She also began dating a violent man named Marino. The babysitter mistreated Wesson, and Marino regularly beat Barbara in front of him \u2014 one time severely enough to cause a miscarriage. Another time, the children watched Marino tie their mother up, put her in the bathtub, and beat her.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 105} During his preteen years, Wesson lived with his maternal grandmother, Evelyn Williams, in Akron, Ohio. Williams, a functional alcoholic, regularly beat him with her cane, but her brother, Eugene, intervened to protect him from abuse. Yvette described Eugene as the children\u2019s \u201csavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">{\u00b6 106} Yvette also testified that Wesson suffered several head injuries. As an infant, he fell down the stairs and \u201ccracked his head open,\u201d but he received no treatment. As a teenager, he suffered injuries to the back of his head when he was beaten during a robbery. And later in life, Wesson\u2019s younger brother smashed a 30 to 40 pound lead-glass basket over his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">{\u00b6 107} Yvette noted that until February 2008, Wesson had complied with his parole and worked with her in a bakery.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">{\u00b6 108} Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon, a clinical and forensic psychologist, evaluated Wesson. He discussed Wesson\u2019s family background and his \u201cchaotic\u201d childhood, noting that Wesson moved frequently \u2014 often between relatives\u2019 homes \u2014 and received minimal supervision as a child. Children mocked Wesson at school, especially for his lifelong stuttering problem, and he quit school after seventh grade, spending a lot of his adolescence in the juvenile system.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">{\u00b6 109} Smalldon testified that Wesson told him he \u201chad a bad childhood\u201d but Smalldon noted that Wesson did not dwell on his parents\u2019 alcoholism or his own physical abuse. Wesson\u2019s father physically abused him and ridiculed him for stuttering, and he once pointed a gun at Wesson. And Wesson regularly witnessed acts of violence as a child, which included observing the shooting death of his father\u2019s girlfriend. Smalldon opined that these experiences led Wesson to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>see physical violence as an acceptable way to resolve conflicts and contributed to his sense of vulnerability.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 110} Smalldon also noted that Wesson had suffered serious head injuries. As a teenager, police officers hit the back of Wesson\u2019s head with the butt of a gun. Years later, Wesson\u2019s brother hit him over the head with a glass object, and though he lost consciousness, he received no medical treatment. Wesson also reported falling from a tree as an adult and striking his head. Smalldon testified that even relatively mild head injuries can be associated with impulsivity and poor judgment, but he could not corroborate the injuries Wesson reported with either hospital records or results from independent neuropsychological testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 111} In addition, Smalldon administered a range of tests during his evaluation of Wesson, who cooperated with most tests and appeared motivated to do well and anxious to be deemed mentally fit and motivated. On the Wide-Range Achievement Test, Wesson functioned at a third-grade level for word recognition, a sixth-grade level in spelling, and a second-grade level in arithmetic. Wesson\u2019s performance on a standardized IQ test yielded an estimated full-scale IQ of 76. On the Trail Making Test, Wesson scored in the normal range for visual scanning and speed, but badly faltered on the part of the test that required mental flexibility, which might indicate brain impairment. He demonstrated deficits on the Aphasia Screening Test, which might also indicate impaired brain functioning. However, Wesson performed well on the Rey\u2019s 15-item Visual Memory Test, a screening mechanism for assessing the subject\u2019s motivation to give his best effort, and did reasonably well on the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test, a test designed to assess brain impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">{\u00b6 112} Wesson completed two self-report symptom checklists, both of which indicated clinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and feelings of inadequacy and low self-worth. Wesson had also been diagnosed with major depression in 2007, when he lost his job and his criminal background impeded his finding new work.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">{\u00b6 113} According to Smalldon, Wesson fathered five children by three different women. His adult relationships with women were fraught with conflict and alcohol issues. He stated that Wesson seemed to have become frantic whenever he thought he was going to be rejected and abandoned by a woman, largely due to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">{\u00b6 114} Wesson began drinking at an early age, abused alcohol regularly as an adult, engaged in episodes of binge drinking, and was diagnosed with alcohol dependence in 2008. Smalldon opined that prenatal alcohol exposure may have caused Wesson to suffer deficits such as an inability to assess the consequences of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>his behavior, an inability to respond appropriately to subtle social cues, and weak language skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">{\u00b6 115} Smalldon diagnosed Wesson with (1) depressive disorder (not otherwise specified), (2) borderline intellectual functioning, (3) alcohol dependence, and (4) a personality disorder with passive-aggressive, narcissistic, and antisocial features. According to Smalldon, these aspects of Wesson\u2019s personality make him impulsive and likely to overreact to perceived slights.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">{\u00b6 116} Smalldon opined that Wesson\u2019s limited intellectual ability, struggles at school, difficulty with stuttering, and lack of support at home may have rendered him unable to successfully adapt to the circumstances of his childhood and adolescence. He also indicated that Wesson\u2019s limited intellectual ability, personality, history of depression, and alcohol exposure may have compromised his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. Nonetheless, Smalldon testified that he believed that Wesson had understood the criminality of his behavior. And on cross-examination, he acknowledged that most people with issues similar to Wesson\u2019s do not commit crimes and that Wesson had received mental health treatment while in the juvenile justice system and while on parole as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 117} In an unsworn statement, Wesson expressed his fondness for the Varholas. He had visited with Emil Varhola approximately 12 times in the yard outside the Varhola home and had been in the home once before. He stated that on that occasion, Emil came to the door holding a handgun, but he put it in his pocket when he recognized Wesson.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">{\u00b6 118} Wesson said he did not intend to rob or hurt the Varholas when he went to their house on February 25, 2008. Rather, he knocked on the their door around 6:40 p.m., to ask if he could wait there for his girlfriend\u2019s bus to arrive at 7:43 p.m. He claimed the Varholas let him in and offered him food, coffee, and beer. Emil showed Wesson his guns, taking a long gun out of the living-room gun cabinet and handing it to Wesson.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 119} Wesson said that he went upstairs to use the restroom, and when he returned, he saw Mary watching television in the living room and Emil in the kitchen. According to Wesson, Emil then made a comment about his wife\u2019s chest, and when Wesson said he did not like the comment, Emil stood up, grabbed a knife, and walked toward him. Wesson claimed that he took the knife from Emil and stepped back, but when he saw Emil reach into his pocket, he thought Emil might be reaching for the handgun Emil sometimes carried. Wesson then \u201creacted to that threat\u201d and stabbed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">{\u00b6 120} After Emil fell to the ground, Wesson felt Emil\u2019s pockets and realized he did not have a gun. He then panicked, asking Mary, \u201cWhere is the gun?\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>When Mary hit Wesson with her cane, he \u201cturned on her,\u201d but he stopped the attack when Mary begged him not to kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 121} Wesson spoke about his having respect for his elders and admitted that \u201cmaybe [he] reacted too quickly.\u201d He also expressed sorrow for his actions, saying that he believed the Varholas were nice people, but he then immediately stated, \u201cOnce I feel my life is threatened, I\u2019m going to react,\u201d explaining that after the childhood he had had, he \u201cwill never let anyone ever hurt [him] again.\u201d And ultimately, Wesson failed to accept responsibility for his crimes, blaming Emil by claiming that he would not be on trial and Emil \u201cwouldn\u2019t be up in heaven with God right now\u201d if Emil had not reached into his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 122} Wesson insisted that he did not need to rob or kill anyone for money or a gun. According to Wesson, he was not pressed for money and he could easily have secured a gun from friends on the east side. Wesson admitted that he took the gun and cup from the house because he knew the gun had his fingerprints on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 123} Wesson acknowledged the love and support of his family members, and he concluded his statement by telling the panel that he does not use crack, dresses nicely, is polite, and is sorry.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\n<em>Weighing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">{\u00b6 124} We now assign weight to Wesson\u2019s mitigating evidence and determine whether the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">{\u00b6 125} As an initial matter, we find nothing mitigating in the nature and circumstances of the offense. R.C. 2929.04(B). Wesson murdered an 81-year-old man and attempted to murder his 77-year-old wife in their own home. The victims had befriended Wesson and extended him hospitality, even on the day of the murder. No evidence supports Wesson\u2019s unsworn claim that Emil threatened him with a knife or a gun. At most, Wesson knew that Emil owned guns, including a handgun, but far from posing a legitimate threat to Wesson, these victims had serious medical problems and limited mobility, and he responded to a perceived threat by stabbing the Varholas repeatedly with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">{\u00b6 126} We find that five of the statutorily enumerated mitigating factors do not apply. We give no weight to Wesson\u2019s unsworn and unbelievable claims that Emil and Mary induced, facilitated, or provoked the crime. <em>See </em>R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) and (B)(2). An offender\u2019s youth is a mitigating factor pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(B)(4), but Wesson was 50 years old at the time of the crime. And Wesson cannot point to a lack of significant criminal history, <em>see </em>R.C. 2929.04(B)(5), or other offenders who participated in the crime, <em>see </em>R.C. 2929.04(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>{\u00b6 127} We give limited weight to evidence Wesson presented to show that a mental disease or defect affected his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. <em>See </em>R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). Dr. Smalldon testified that Wesson\u2019s ability to conform his conduct to the law may have been compromised at the time of the murder based on (1) his limited intellectual ability, (2) his personality disorder with passive aggressive, narcissistic, and antisocial features, (3) his history of depression, and (4) his history with alcohol. But neither long-term depression nor Wesson\u2019s personality disorder meets the requirements for a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). <em>See Bey, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 507-508, 709 N.E.2d 484 (finding no mental disease or defect where defendant suffered from long-term depression and a serious personality disorder with antisocial and paranoid features); <em>State v. Fox, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 183, 192, 631 N.E.2d 124 (1994) (finding no mental disease or defect after defendant established a personality disorder). Accordingly, Smalldon\u2019s opinion deserves only limited weight under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">{\u00b6 128} This evidence is also relevant to the catchall mitigation provision contained in R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), and when it is viewed alongside other mitigating evidence presented by Wesson, we find that he has presented mitigating evidence that is entitled to significant weight pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 129} Wesson presented evidence of a long history of contact with alcohol. Prenatal alcohol exposure may have affected his ability to assess the consequences of his behavior, his ability to respond appropriately to social cues, and his language skills. In addition, Wesson consumed alcohol at a young age, was alcohol dependent, and engaged in bouts of binge drinking. However, Wesson did not present evidence of alcohol impairment at the time of the murder, though he claimed that he had been impaired the next day, when he spoke to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 130} Wesson has limited intellectual ability and may have suffered brain impairment caused by head injuries. He has a low IQ and tested at elementary school level in arithmetic, word recognition, and spelling. Smalldon testified that Wesson\u2019s low performance on certain tests could indicate brain impairment, although he could not confirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 131} Further, according to Smalldon, Wesson struggles with depression, has significant feelings of inadequacy and low self-worth, and is prone to overreacting, caused in part by his unstable childhood. As a young child, his older sister regularly cared for him, and he was shuttled between various relatives. His alcoholic father physically abused him, and Wesson witnessed serious violence in the home. Wesson also had a severe stutter, and his own father and peers mocked him.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 132} This evidence is tempered, however, by testimony that relatives and friends helped the family during his childhood. In fact, he still enjoys the love <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>and support of numerous family members, and some of them were present in the courtroom at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">{\u00b6 133} Considering all of this evidence, we conclude that Wesson\u2019s background, history with alcohol, and mental difficulties are mitigating pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) and entitled to significant weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 134} Nonetheless, the weight of Wesson\u2019s mitigation evidence is substantially outweighed by the weight of the aggravating circumstances in this case. After full consideration of the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating factors, we conclude that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\n<em>Proportionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">{\u00b6 135} Finally, we conclude that the death penalty is appropriate and proportionate compared to death sentences affirmed in other robbery-murder cases. <em>See Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31 (elderly victim murdered in home robbery); <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836 (one murder and one attempted murder in home robbery); <em>State v. Dennis, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 421, 683 N.E.2d 1096 (1997) (one murder and one attempted murder in separate armed robberies). It is also proportionate to death sentences upheld for other course-of-conduct murders. <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038 (one murder and two attempted murders); <em>Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836 (one murder and one attempted murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">{\u00b6 136} Accordingly, we reverse Wesson\u2019s conviction for aggravated murder in Count Three, the specifications related to that count, and the specification to Count Two alleging that he committed the murder while under detention. However, we affirm the remaining convictions, the imposition of capital punishment on Count Two, and the imposition of consecutive terms of imprisonment on the noncapital offense convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-11\">Pfeifer, Acting C.J., and Vukovich and Kennedy, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b546-12\">French, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b546-13\">Lanzinger, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b546-14\">O\u2019Neill, J., dissents without opinion.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b546-15\">Joseph J.

On this point, I agree with Justice Lanzinger; Wesson\u2019s 2003 sentence was not void, and he committed the murder while under postrelease control. In all other respects, I concur. _</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b547-7\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_Z\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">{\u00b6 138} I respectfully dissent. For the reasons expressed in my opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in <em>State v. Billiter, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 103, 2012-Ohio-5144, 980 N.E.2d 960, I would not find void any portion of Wesson\u2019s 2003 sentence. As the mistake was solely in the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in imposing postrelease control (imposing three years of discretionary, rather than three years of mandatory, postrelease control), the sentence was merely voidable. Since the error was not raised on appeal within 30 days, res judicata applies and Wesson remained under the supervision of the Adult Parole Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">{\u00b6 139} I also dissent from the majority\u2019s judgment affirming the remaining capital convictions. I would vacate the convictions and remand the case to the trial court for the proper selection of a three-judge panel in this case as precedent demands. Although it acknowledges the requirement of strict compliance with R.C. 2945.05 and 2945.06 when a defendant waives a jury in a capital case, the majority nonetheless declares that Wesson forfeited the right to challenge the way that the three-judge panel was selected because he assented to the procedure followed by Judge Teodosio in appointing the members of the panel. This holding is inconsistent with our decisions in <em>State v. Parker, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 524, 2002-Ohio-2833, 769 N.E.2d 846; <em>State v. Filiaggi, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 230, 239, 714 N.E.2d 867 (1999); <em>State v. Pless, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 333, 658 N.E.2d 766 (1996); and <em>Pratts v. Hurley, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 81, 2004-Ohio-1980, 806 N.E.2d 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">{\u00b6 140} In <em>Parker, </em>the defendant in a capital case waived his right to a trial by jury, waived his right to a three-judge panel, and pled guilty to aggravated murder. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 2. We affirmed the court of appeals\u2019 decision to vacate the conviction, holding that the defendant could not waive the right to a three-judge panel. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 11. In <em>Filiaggi, </em>the defendant had waived his right to a trial by jury. <em>Id. </em>at 238. The three-judge panel entered convictions only on the aggravated-murder charge and specifications, and the presiding judge decided the noncapital charges. <em>Id. </em>at 239. We reversed the judgment and remanded the case for the three-judge panel to render verdicts on the noncapital charges, holding that because we have consistently required strict compliance with R.C. 2945.06, \u201cthe presiding judge did not have sole authority to enter a verdict on the noncapital charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240. Here, Wesson executed a jury waiver, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>consenting to be tried by a panel \u201cconsisting of Judge Thomas A. Teodosio, presiding at this time, and two other judges to be designated <em>pursuant to law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Wesson thus did not waive his rights under R.C. 2945.06 to the following of the proper procedure in selecting his three-judge panel. <em>Parker </em>and <em>Filiaggi </em>would not allow him to do so in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">{\u00b6 141} Furthermore, the majority\u2019s opinion in this case is yet another example of the inconsistent holdings of this court in cases in which the trial-court judge acted contrary to a statutory mandate. The majority reverses Wesson\u2019s conviction for aggravated murder while under detention and for the corresponding specification on Count Two due to a postrelease-control error. So on the one hand, the majority collaterally declares a portion of Wesson\u2019s 2003 sentence void because the trial judge imposed three years of discretionary rather than mandatory postrelease control. Then on the other hand, although the trial judge did not have authority to appoint the other two judges of the three-judge panel in this capital case, the majority affirms Wesson\u2019s remaining capital convictions. Apparently, a postrelease-control error is more important than a procedural error in a capital case. I cannot agree with this inconsistency. I would hold that any error in the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction is voidable rather than void.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">{\u00b6 142} As we held in <em>Pratts,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">[t]he failure of a court to convene a three-judge panel, <em>as required by R.C. 2945.06, </em>does not constitute a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction that renders the trial court\u2019s judgment void ab initio and subject to collateral attack in habeas corpus. It <em>constitutes an error in the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction </em>that must be raised on direct appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">(Emphases added.) 102 Ohio St.3d 81, 2004-Ohio-1980, 806 N.E.2d 992, at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">{\u00b6 143} Wesson raised this error on direct appeal. I would therefore vacate the convictions and remand the case for a new trial in accordance with the mandatory capital procedures within R.C. 2945.06. Because I would not hold any portion of the 2003 sentence to be void, Wesson would still be eligible to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>convicted of Count Three and the specification to Count Two for aggravated murder while under detention.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AmBr\">Sherri Bevan Walsh, Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, and Richard S.
