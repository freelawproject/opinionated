Contracts, \u00a7 117<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when not void for mistake of fact. Not every mistake, even of material facts .will suffice to avoid a contract. Where the means of information are open to both parties and where each is supposed to exercise his own skill, diligence and judgment, a mistake of judgment on the part of either or both of the parties will not render the undertaking void.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b595-9\" pgmap=\"595\">2. Building and construction contracts, \u00a7 2<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when not void for mutual mistake of fact. Where a company contracted to furnish certain iron doors for a building under a contract that the doors should be acceptable in all respects to the architects and the board of fire underwriters, held that the fact that the doors would not pass the tests of the underwriters would not avoid the contract on the ground that there was a mutual mistake of fact.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b595-10\" pgmap=\"595\">3.
