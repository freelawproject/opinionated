Coyne and Richard Coyne, trading as Coyne Brothers, and George C. Bower and P. H. McDermand, trading as Montcalm Potato Company, against Grand Rapids and Indiana Railway Company to recover damages occasioned by delay of defendant in transporting two cars of potatoes from Big Rapids, Michigan to Chicago. The plaintiffs recovered a verdict and judgment against the defendant for $252.88 damages, the amount of the verdict approximating the difference between the market value in Chicago of the potatoes in the condition they should have been delivered and the market value in the condition in which they were delivered. To reverse the judgment, defendant prosecutes error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b458-8\" pgmap=\"458\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b458-9\" pgmap=\"458\">1.

A condition appearing on the back of a shipping order and bill of lading that a claim for loss or damage to property shall be computed on the basis of the value of the property at the place and time of shipment, cannot be availed of by the carrier where the claim for damages resulted from failure to deliver the shipment at the destination to which it was received for shipment.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b458-11\" pgmap=\"458\">3.
