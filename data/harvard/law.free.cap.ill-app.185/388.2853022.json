Randall and T. F. Randall, trading as G. W. Randall &amp; Company, against R. Whittingham to recover for goods sold and delivered by plaintiffs to the defendant on an open account, consisting of 3,707 pounds of chickens at 6 cents per pound, amounting to $222.42, on which a credit of $50 was allowed. Defendant, in his affidavit of defense, admitted the purchase of the chickens at 5 cents per pound and alleg\u2019ed that \u201cabout one-third\u201d were delivered to him in an unwholesome and unsaleable condition. The court, deeming such allegation as an admission of a portion of the claim, entered judgment for $86.66, reserving the rest of the claim for future consideration. To reverse the judgment, defendant brings error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-11\" pgmap=\"414\">Victor A. G. Murrell, for plaintiff in error; P. W.
