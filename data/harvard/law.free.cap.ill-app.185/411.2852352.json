Helmer Johnson, as administrator of the estate of William Peat, deceased, against Chicago City Railway Company and Schwarzschild &amp; Sulzberger Company to recover for the wrongful death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate caused by a collision between the car upon which deceased was a passenger and a vehicle owned by defendant Schwarzschild &amp; Sulzberger Company. It was undisputed that: The deceased was riding on the front right-hand step of the car in question, as it was being run westward on 47th street in the city of Chicago, and that at a point from thirty to seventy-five feet west of State street it collided with the wagon of the Schwarzschild &amp; Sulzberger Company, and that in the collision the deceased received injuries from which he died.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-10\" pgmap=\"437(19) 438(391)\">A decided preponderance of the evidence showed that: At a point about fifty feet west of the west curb line of State street the team of the Schwarzschild &amp; Sulzberger Company stood hitched to a large wagon; that the rig consisting of this team and wagon was approximately thirty feet in length; that the wagon stood near the north curb line of 47th street with its rear end to the east; that the front end of the wagon was slightly farther from the north curb of the street than its rear end was, but far enough from the street car track to permit the car to pass with safety to the passengers thereon, including those standing on the steps of the car; that the horses were turned with their heads in a northwesterly direction and with their front feet on the sidewalk; that the deceased came south on a State street car, and when that car stopped on the north side of 47th street he alighted therefrom and ran south and west to the front step of the car on which he received the injuries complained of, which car was then passing westwardly; that he got upon the step of the car when the car was in motion and when it was from five to fifteen feet east of a point south of the wagon of Schwarzschild &amp; Sulzberger Company; that at approximately the moment he gained the step the driver of the team in question, who had driven the same to a point on the north side of 47th street, immediately north of where the deceased met his injuries, and had left it standing there unhitched and unattended while he went into an adjacent saloon to get a drink, had his attention called to the fact that the team had gotten upon the sidewalk and that he then went out and in attempting to back them off from the sidewalk forced the wagon against the deceased and the. car on which he was riding, inflicting the injuries from which he died; that the motorman did not have time after the wagon began to back into the street and before it struck the car and the deceased to prevent the collision by the use of any means within his power; and that he had no warning or reason to expect that the wagon was about to be backed into the street or moved.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b439-8\" pgmap=\"439\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b439-9\" pgmap=\"439\">1. Cabbiebs, \u00a7 381<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when carrier not liable for death of passenger due to collision with vehicle. Where the driver ot a venicle in backing his horses off the sidewalk caused the rear end of the wagon to collide with a street car causing injury to a passenger standing on the front step, which resulted in his death, and the evidence showed that the motorman did not have time to, prevent the collision by checking the car after the wagon began to back, it was held that a verdict against the street railway company could not be sustained.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b439-10\" pgmap=\"439\">2.
