Automobiles and garages, \u00a7 5<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when proprietor of garage not entitled to a lien. The proprietor of a garage is not entitled to a lien on an automobile for keeping and caring for same in his garage, nor for supplies such as gasoline and oil furnished by him to the owner while the machine was being kept in the garage.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b452-9\" pgmap=\"452\">2. Chattel mortgages, \u00a7 161<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014priority as against mechanics\u2019 liens. While a mortgagor cannot by contract create a lien in behalf of a mechanic so as to give it priority over a previously recorded chattel mortgage, the mortgagee\u2019s authority for the creation of such a lien may be implied where the property is to be retained and used by the mortgagor, and is of such a character as to involve the occasion for the making of ordinary repairs thereto as a reasonable incident to its reasonable and customary use.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b452-10\" pgmap=\"452\">3. Mechanics\u2019 liens, \u00a7 125<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when may he asserted against third persons.

Mechanics\u2019 liens, \u00a7 135<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when surrender of possession does not toaive lien on chattel. As between the immediate parties, a change of possession does not defeat the right of a mechanic claiming a lien on personalty to assert his lien, unless by surrendering possession he can fairly be understood as waiving his lien.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b452-12\" pgmap=\"452\">5.
