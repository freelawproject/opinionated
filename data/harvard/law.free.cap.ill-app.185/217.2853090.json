An insurance company does not waive nor is it estopped from interposing a defense other than a forfeiture for nonpayment of assessment, because it based its refusal to pay solely upon that ground with full information as to other facts constituting a forfeiture, where it does not appear that the plaintiff was misled or influenced to her injury by failure to assign other reasons.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b244-5\" pgmap=\"244\">3.

Plaintiff, on appeal, cannot urge that a defense was not specially pleaded where the record shows that during the trial he did not object to a statement made by the court: \u201cLet the record show that it is agreed by counsel for both parties that there may be introduced in evidence in this case any evidence in support of any plea which might properly be pleaded to the declaration.\u201d</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b244-8\" pgmap=\"244\">4.
