Burke against the City of Chicago to recover interest on local improvement bonds, tried by the court without a jury upon a stipulation stating in substance that when the plaintiff\u2019s bonds matured he demanded payment and the City paid him the interest which was due at that time, but did not then pay the principal \u201cbecause on said date there was a deficiency in the special assessment fund provided for the payment of the same;\u201d that subsequent to December 31, 1901, thq, plaintiff made frequent demands for payment and that the City made several payments on account, but that the principal was not paid in full until December 31, 1909, \u201cbecause there had not been funds in said special assessment fund between the date of maturity and said date of payment available for the payment of the same in full;\u201d that no interest was paid subsequent to December 31, 1901, and that the total amount of such interest on the unpaid portions of the principal of said bond, computed at the rate of five per cent, per annum from December 31, 1901, to December 31, 1909, is $1,961.42; that when the last payment of principal was made on December 31, 1909, there remained to the credit of said warrant (i. e., the special assessment fund) on the city comptroller\u2019s books, the sum of $10.29, after which a \u201csurplus began to accrue\u201d which, on April 22, 1912, amounted to $3,086.92; \u201cthat at no time from 1901 to 1909 did any money remain to the credit of said warrant in the office of said comptroller without being applied pro rata to the payment of all the bonds issued under said warrant;\u201d that the total amount collected up to April 22, 1912, upon the special assessment levied to defray the cost of the improvement was $593,935.86; that after collecting part of the assessment and prior to December 31, 1897, the City \u201crebated\u201d or paid back to property owners, before paying the cost of the improvement, $2,962.20; that in the assessment proceeding, the City of Chicago was assessed for public benefits $1,200, and said assessment was confirmed September 18, 1895, but that the City never paid the amount so assessed for public benefits into the special assessment fund.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b255-9\" pgmap=\"255\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b255-10\" pgmap=\"255(153) 256(15)\">1.

Where the stipulated facts showed that owing to a deficiency in the special assessment fund the City was unable to pay interest on local improvement bonds held by plaintiff for a period of eight years; that as payments came in they were applied pro rata to the payment of the bonds, the principal of plaintiff\u2019s bonds having been paid in full, but no interest was paid for eight years prior to the payment of the principal and that before paying for the cost of the improvement the City rebated to property owners a sum in the aggregate more than sufficient to pay the amount of interest due on the bonds held by plaintiff, it was held that the City was liable for the interest claimed by plaintiff, since but for its wrongful act in rebating to the property owners before paying for the improvement it would have had on hand sufficient funds to meet the interest payments.</headnotes><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-5\" pgmap=\"255\">From a judgment for plaintiff for $1,961.42, which the trial court on motion refused to vacate, defendant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-6\" pgmap=\"255\">Philip J.
