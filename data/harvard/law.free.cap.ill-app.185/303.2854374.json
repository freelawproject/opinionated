Mclnerney for the use of J. W. Williamson and Mary Williamson against Andrew J. Graham, doing business as Graham &amp; Son, as garnishee. An affidavit was filed by J. W. Williamson alleging that a judgment was rendered in the Municipal Court against Mclnerney in favor of the Williamsons; that an execution had been issued and returned unsatisfied, and that the garnishee was indebted to the judgment debtor Mclnerney. A final judgment was entered against the garnishee for $452.70. To reverse the judgment, Mclnerney sues out a writ of error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b330-8\" pgmap=\"330\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b330-9\" pgmap=\"330\">1.

When no bill of exceptions is filed it cannot be urged that a final judgment against the garnishee is unwarranted because there is in the record no recital of evidence or finding of the judgment against the nominal plaintiff in favor of the beneficial plaintiff. In the absence of anything answering to a bill of exceptions it cannot be presumed that no evidence of such judgment as recited in the scire facias was given before the court.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b331-6\" pgmap=\"331\">5.

In a suit in garnishment to recover money deposited with the garnishee by the judgment debtor, the fact that Circuit Court had issued an injunction against the payment by the garnishee to the judgment debtor in favor of his wife in divorce proceedings, held no defense to the garnishee against the rights of the judgment creditor.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b331-7\" pgmap=\"331\">6.
