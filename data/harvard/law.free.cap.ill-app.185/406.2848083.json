In an action against a contractor to recover damages for breach of a building contract which was in writing and apparently full and complete, the specifications as to the work being made a part of the contract, letters written by defendant to plaintiff weeks before the contract was entered into relating to entirely different plans, and plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to conversations had with defendant prior to the making of the contract concerning the contemplated work, held improperly admitted in evidence.</headnotes><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-4\" pgmap=\"433\">Statement of the Case.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\" pgmap=\"433\">Action by Mary Raphael against J. W. McGraw to recover damages for breach of a building contract wherein defendant agreed to build for plaintiff; a flat building for $4,500, of which $2,000 was to be paid when the building was under roof, $1,000 when plastered and $1,500 when finished. The defendant commenced performance of the contract and continued work on the building until, as he claims, the same was plastered, when he demanded the $1,000 according to the terms of the contract. The $2,000 to be paid when the building was under roof was duly paid, but a controversy arose between the parties when the sum of $1,000 was not paid as demanded and resulted in the defendant abandoning the job. The building was completed by the plaintiff, and this suit was brought to recover $488.50, which plaintiff claims it cost her to complete the building according to the specifications, in excess of the contract price. The jury found the issues for plaintiff and assessed her damages at $394.52. To reverse a judgment entered on the verdict, defendant prosecutes a writ of error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-6\" pgmap=\"433\">Fred H. Atwood, Frank B.
