Defendant had employed a detective to investigate lost shipments and the detective suspecting that the theft had been committed by the plaintiff, an employe of defendant, had plaintiff arrested.

Plaintiff recovered a judgment for one thousand five hundred dollars, from which defendant appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b599-7\" pgmap=\"599\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b599-8\" pgmap=\"599\">1.
