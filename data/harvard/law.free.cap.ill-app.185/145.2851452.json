An instruction that if defendant Elevated Railroad Company failed to maintain a flagman at the intersection of a street railroad, in violation of ordinance, and such failure contributed proximately to a collision with a street car, it would be liable, is prejudicial error where negligence in that respect was not charged in the declaration and the evidence tended to show that the proximate cause of the accident was an improper signal given by a policeman who, with an employe of the street railway company, acted as watchman, the regular watchman of the elevated company being absent at dinner.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b173-5\" pgmap=\"173\">6.
