Plaintiff and defendant entered into a contract under which the former agreed to supply the latter with one thousand cabinets for match vending machines. It was understood .that the cabinets were to fit castings constituting the front of the machines to be supplied by defendant. After more than half of the cabinets had been delivered to, defendant the latter complained that they did not fit the castings. Plaintiff then took back all but twenty-five, making certain alterations which he claimed remedied the defects, but claimed that defendant refused to receive them, or any more cabinets under the contract.
