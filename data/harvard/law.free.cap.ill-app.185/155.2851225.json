It was alleged that the injury was caused by the negligence of the defendant in permitting iron doors or sidewalk lifts in the public sidewalk to remain open and unguarded in front of premises owned and controlled by the defendants, and that in consequence of such negligence such doors fell or closed down upon the leg of plaintiff causing permanent injuries. From a judgment in favor of plaintiff for four thousand dollars, defendants appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-8\" pgmap=\"181\">George E. Gorman, Thomas J.

Negligence, \u00a7 45<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence shows joint liability for attractive nuisance. In an action for personal injuries sustained by a minor by the falling of an open iron door maintained in a sidewhlk in front of premises occupied and controlled by the defendants, evidence held sufficient to show that the defendants were jointly in possession and control of the premises and that they were charged with knowledge that the open iron doors constituted an attractive nuisance.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b182-5\" pgmap=\"182\">3. Negligence, \u00a7 218<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when requested instruction properly refused for assuming facts.

Damages, \u00a7 123<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when recovery for injured leg not excessive. A verdict of four thousand dollars for injury to the leg and knee of a child five years of age held not excessive, it appearing that the injury is permanent, that the injured limb is smaller and shorter than the other, that the circulation and nerve supply are permanently exhausted, and that as a result there will be a deformity of the pelvic bones</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b182-8\" pgmap=\"182\">6.
