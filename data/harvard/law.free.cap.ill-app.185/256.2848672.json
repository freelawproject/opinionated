On a motion to vacate a default judgment where the only evidence offered to support the motion was an affidavit of an employe of defendant, held that denial of the motion was not an abuse of trial court\u2019s discretion, there being no proper showing that defendant had a meritorious defense or that he was not guilty of negligence from failing to plead in apt time.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b283-6\" pgmap=\"283\">4.
