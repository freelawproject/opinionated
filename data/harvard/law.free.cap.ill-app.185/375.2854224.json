Where in an action on an oral agreement substituted for a prior written contract the statement of claim alleged the \u201ccancellation\u201d of the written contract and plaintiff\u2019s property was to he \u201cappraised,\u201d an objection that there was no proof of either is untenable where the record clearly showed that the terms \u201ccancellation\u201d and \u201cappraised\u201d were understood as meaning \u201cterminated\u201d and \u201cestimated,\u201d respectively, and the case was tried on that theory, and defendant admitted the termination of the written contract, taking issue upon the fact as to the agreed valuation of the property.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b401-14\" pgmap=\"401(67) 402(17)\">2.

Evidence, \u00a7 94<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence immaterial. Where the statement of claim alleged that under the contract sued on plaintiff\u2019s property was to he appraised at a certain sum, \u201cas a reasonable cash value thereof,\u201d proof that such sum was the reasonable cash value of the property is immaterial.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b402-5\" pgmap=\"402\">4. Contracts, \u00a7 71<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what constitutes sufficient, consideration for a novation. Where a written contract providing for the payment by defendant to plaintiff of a certain sum per month for livery service was, because defendant was losing money thereunder, terminated by the parties by a parol agreement, under the terms of which plaintiff\u2019s equipment was to be sold at public auction, defendant \u00abagreeing to pay the difference between the estimated value and the amount realized on the sale, together with the costs of the sale, plaintiff to be appointed one of its managers at a fixed salary, it was held that the new agreement was founded on a sufficient consideration.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b402-6\" pgmap=\"402\">5. Trial, \u00a7 68<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when court may require showing of relevancy of items of books of account. Under a general offer of books of account and a bundle of loose sheets therefrom it is not error for the court to require counsel to point out the specific items deemed relevant as a condition to their admission in evidence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b402-7\" pgmap=\"402\">6. Trial, \u00a7 68<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when materiality must be shown on offer of proof. The court is not required to receive proof offered in such form that its materiality cannot be determined.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b402-8\" pgmap=\"402\">7. Evidence, \u00a7 265<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when memoranda by auctioneer\u2019s clerk admissible. Pads made by an auctioneer\u2019s clerk containing original memoranda of an auction sale held pursuant to an agreement between plaintiff and defendant are admissible in behalf of plaintiff to show the amount of the sale where there is evidence that the clerk acted as agent of both parties.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b402-9\" pgmap=\"402\">8. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1473<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when admission of erroneous evidence harmless. The admission of improper evidence as to an undisputed fact fully proved by competent evidence is harmless error.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b402-10\" pgmap=\"402\">9. Contracts, \u00a7 377<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when prior contract admissible in action upon substituted agreement. In an action upon a parol contract between the parties terminating a prior written contract between plaintiff and defendant\u2019s predecessor in business, whose obligations it had assumed, such prior contract is relevant upon the question of the consideration for the subsequent agreement and is admissible against defendant, although the latter was not a party thereto.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b402-11\" pgmap=\"402\">10. Trial, \u00a7 270<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when special findings properly refused. Special findings which do not call for the finding of an ultimate or controlling fact are properly refused.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
