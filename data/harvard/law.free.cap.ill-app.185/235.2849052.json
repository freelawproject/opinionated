Rubenstein for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff falling into the basement of defendant\u2019s store. The facts are substantially as follows:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-12\" pgmap=\"261(137) 262(132)\">About five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, April 8, 1911, plaintiff and her sister-in-law, Mrs. Hilda Burns, were walking in a southerly direction on Milwaukee avenue, Chicago, looking for a flat to rent. When they reached the store, then owned and occupied by defendant and known as No. 1907 Milwaukee avenue, they noticed on the front of the store a sign reading \u201cFlat to Rent, Inquire Within. \u2019 \u2019 Above the store were two additional stories which were arranged to be occupied as flats, and on one side of one of the windows of the store was a door to a hall leading from the street to the stairways to the flats above. Plaintiff entered the store for the purpose of making inquiries as to the flat for rent, Mrs. Burns remaining on the sidewalk outside. Plaintiff saw no person in the store, and thinking that some one might be back of the partition walked towards the rear of the store, calling out as she advanced that she desired some one to wait upon her. Before she reached the partition she fell through an unguarded opening or stairway into the basement below and suffered the injuries complained of. A boy had been left in charge of the store, but at the time of the accident was out on the street. The defendant and several other witnesses for him testified that the \u201cFor Bent\u201d sign was on the hall door. Plaintiff and Mrs. Burns, however, testified that the sign was either on the door of the store or on one of the two front windows of the store.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b262-9\" pgmap=\"262\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b262-10\" pgmap=\"262\">1.
