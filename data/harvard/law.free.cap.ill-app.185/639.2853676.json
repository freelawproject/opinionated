Cummins, administrator of the estate of Francis Mnlvihill, deceased, against the Sanitary district of Chicago and the Commonwealth Edison Company to recover damages for wrongfully causing the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate. The facts show that the Sanitary District was excavating a ditch in a street near a wooden pole supporting electric wires and belonging to the Commonwealth Edison Company, that the pole needed bracing and that the deceased, an employe of the Sanitary District, was ordered to climb the pole to spike a timber to the post, and while doing so he came in contact with a grounded iron pipe and was electrocuted. Plaintiff recovered a verdict and judgment against the Sanitary District for $8,000. The defendant Commonwealth Edison Company was found not guilty. From the judgment, the Sanitary District appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b666-8\" pgmap=\"666\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b666-9\" pgmap=\"666\">1. Master and servant, \u00a7 191<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when duty of master to warn servant. In an action for wrongful death of a servant resulting from ordering the servant to climb an electric light pole for the purpose of spiking a brace to the same, held that the master was chargeable with knowledge of the defective and dangerous condition of the cut-out box and that it was incumbent upon it to warn the deceased of such defect and danger, it appearing that deceased was merely a common laborer unfamiliar with the special hazards incident to the place he was directed to work.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b666-10\" pgmap=\"666\">2. Master and servant, \u00a7 126<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014duty to furnish safe place to work. In an action for wrongful death of a servant, held the fact that the work was performed on the premises of another did not relieve the master of the obligation to inspect nor of his duty to furnish a safe place to work.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b666-11\" pgmap=\"666(71) 667(18)\">3. Master and servant, \u00a7 777<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when refusal of requested instruction proper. In an action for wrongful death of a servant, an instruction requested by defendant held properly refused, for the reason that it wholly ignored the duty of the defendant to warn deceased?' of the dangers incident to the place he was directed to work, and also for the reason that it singled out a particular fact in the case and directed the jury as a matter of law that such fact did not warrant a recovery.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b666-5\" pgmap=\"666\">Robert J.
