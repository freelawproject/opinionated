Where a note given to an individual is made payable on its face to the order of a bank and such person writes his name on the back of the note and sells it to the bank, by indorsing the note, the transaction comes within the rule that where a person not the payee of a note places his name on the back thereof the legal presumption is that his liability is that of a guarantor.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-9\" pgmap=\"138\">2.
