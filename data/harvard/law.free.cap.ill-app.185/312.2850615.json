In an action to recover for the contract price of onions, it appeared that the defendant agreed to purchase plaintiff\u2019s entire onion crop at a certain price, that defendant postponed delivery of the onions until he should notify plaintiff, that plaintiff stored what he could in his cellar and that those he had no room for therein or elsewhere were frozen, and that there was no market for onions where the plaintiff lived. Held that a finding of the trial court that defendant was liable for the contract price of the onions which were frozen but that plaintiff could not recover for those which were stored in the cellar, as he should have tried to reduce the damages .by finding a market for them, will not be disturbed.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-5\" pgmap=\"339\">Charles Daniels, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-6\" pgmap=\"339\">Fred A.
