Negligence, \u00a7 198<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when contributory negligence is a question of law. Contributory negligence is not a question of law merely because the facts are not disputed. Not only must the evidentiary facts be undisputed, but all reasonable minds must agree as to the conclusion to be drawn therefrom before such a question can be said to be one of law.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b344-14\" pgmap=\"344(66) 345(55)\">2. Landlord and tenant, \u00a7.259<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when question of contributory negligence of tenant injured by board walk is for jury. In an action against landlords for injuries sustained by a tenant caused by a defective board walk on the premises, the facts showed that plaintiff had knowledge of the defective condition of the walk and had complained of it to defendants, who made no promise to repair, and that plaintiff on returning home in the evening tripped on a loose hoard which caused her to fall forward, stepping heavily upon a board which broke. Held that the question of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was for the jury, and that refusal of' court to direct a verdict for defendant was not error.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-6\" pgmap=\"344\">Error to the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.
