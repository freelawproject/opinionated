Relator Olson filed his petition in the Circuit Court, March 16, 1912, against the appellants and certain other defendants for a mandamus.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-4\" pgmap=\"309\">The petition avers that the relator and the defendants other than Sweitzer, the county clerk, were republican candidates for nomination for State\u2019s Attorney of Cook county at the primary election of April 9, 1912; that relator\u2019s petition was the first petition presented to the County Clerk on February 9, 1912, the first day that petitions could be filed under the act relating to primary elections, and the clerk was requested to indorse the petition as filed before the filing of the petitions of the other candidates for said office, but that he indorsed the petition of Einaker as the first filed, the petition of Ettelson as the second filed, and indorsed the petition of the relator as filed after the petitions of Einaker, Ettelson and four other candidates had been filed; that the county clerk had published a list purporting to show the order in which petitions for nomination on the republican ticket were filed, and that on such list the name of the relator appears as the seventh in order among the petitions filed for nomination as State\u2019s Attorney.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\" pgmap=\"309\">The prayer of the petition is that a writ of mandamus issue directing Sweitzer, as county clerk, to correctly indorse on the petition of relator the time of the filing thereof, so that it should have precedence in the matter of the time of filing over the petitions of the other candidates, to the end that on the ballot the name of the relator should appear ahead of and preceding the names of the other candidates for the office of State\u2019s Attorney. Einaker and Ettelson demurred to the petition, their demurrers were overruled and an order entered directing Sweitzer, as county clerk, to indorse the petitions in accordance with the prayer of the petition. From this order Einaker, Ettelson and Sweitzer, as county clerk, took separate appeals, which have been consolidated for hearing.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-4\" pgmap=\"310\">Gustav E.

Conley, 20 R. I. 381; W. C. T. Co. v. Marshall, 49 Tenn. 121; People ex rel. Seeberger v. Rose, 164 Ill. App. 159.</p> <p id=\"b310-10\" pgmap=\"310\">In Ex parte Nash, 19 Q. B. 92, 69 E. C. L. 92, Lord Campbell said: \u201cThe writ of mandamus is most beneficial ; but we must keep its operation within bounds, and not grant it at the fancy of all mankind. We grant it when that has not been done which a statute orders to be done; but not for the purpose of undoing what has been done. We may on application for a mandamus entertain the question whether a corporation, not having affixed its seal, is bound to do so; but not the question whether, when they have affixed it, they have been right in doing so.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b310-11\" pgmap=\"310\">Here the county clerk had acted in a matter committed by law solely to him before the petition was filed. He had indorsed on each petition the time it was filed and prepared and published a list stating the order in which petitions for nominations on the republican ticket for State\u2019s Attorney had been filed, and the writ did not lie to compel him to undo what he had done.</p> <p id=\"b311-4\" pgmap=\"311\">We think that the demurrers to the petition should have been sustained, and the judgment will therefore be reversed, but as a mandamus would now be unavailing, the cause will not be remanded.</p> <p id=\"b311-5\" pgmap=\"311\">In each case the order will be that the judgment be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b311-6\" pgmap=\"311\">Reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
