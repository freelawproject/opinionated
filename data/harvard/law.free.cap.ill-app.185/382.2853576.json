Where a second mortgage contains an express provision that it is subject to a prior mortgage it conveys nothing more than an equity of redemption.

A second mortgagee acquires no lien-or the right to possession of mortgaged goods and chattels superior to the rights given by a prior mortgage because an affidavit of extension of the first mortgage, duly recorded and filed with the clerk of the Municipal Court, was not entered on the docket or record of said court, it also appearing that when the second mortgage was given, the first mortgagee was in possession consistent with the terms of the mortgage, of which the second mortgagee had full notice, and the second mortgage contained an express provision that it was subject to the prior mortgage.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b409-10\" pgmap=\"409\">3.

Facts held insufficient to show an unreasonable delay of the first mortgagee to enforce his mortgage so as to give the second mortgage a prior lien, it appearing that the second mortgage was not due, and that the first mortgagee undertook to enforce his claim on the first day after the expiration of the extension of his mortgage.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-4\" pgmap=\"409\">Theodore Johnson, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-5\" pgmap=\"409\">McInerney, Power &amp; Byrnes, for defendant in error.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b409-11\" pgmap=\"409\">Seo Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
