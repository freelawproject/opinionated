Stines praying for letters of administration to be issued to her in the estates of her father and mother who died intestate leaving Vada C. Stines and Annie E. Brock their only heirs at law. Annie E. Brock filed objections and petitioned to have some disinterested person appointed administrator of each estate, and subsequently filed a petition to have herself appointed administratrix of the estates. The County Court overruled the objections and appointed Vada C. Stines administratrix of each estate. Annie E. Brock appealed from the orders of the County Court to the Circuit Court where the appeals were consolidated, and upon a hearing the court ordered letters to be issued to Vada C. Stines in the estate of the father, and to Annie E. Brock in the estate of the mother. From this order, Vada C. Stines brings error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b49-8\" pgmap=\"49\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b49-9\" pgmap=\"49\">Executors and administrators, \u00a7 32<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when issuance of letters to daughters to administer estates of father and mother not an abuse of trial court\u2019s discretion. Where a father and mother died intestate leaving two daughters as the only heirs at law, the father leaving personal property consisting chiefly of a promissory note executed to him by the husband of the elder daughter, and the mother leaving personal estate consisting only of her share as widow in the estate of her deceased husband, the younger daughter intending to file a claim against the mother\u2019s estate for services rendered, held that the appointment of the elder daughter as administratrix of the father\u2019s estate, and of the younger daughter as administratrix of the mother\u2019s estate was no abuse of discretion of the trial court, that it was eminently reasonable and fair to appoint the elder daughter administratrix of the father\u2019s estate in order to collect the assets of that estate and to appoint the younger daugher administratrix of the mother\u2019s estate so she could defend against the claim of her sister.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-5\" pgmap=\"49\">M.
