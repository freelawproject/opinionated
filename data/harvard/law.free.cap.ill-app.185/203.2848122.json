In an action against a street railway company to recover for personal injuries and for damages to plaintiff\u2019s automobile resulting from a collision with a street car, erroneously permitting plaintiff, over objection, to prove the difference between the market value of the automobile before and after the accident, held not reversible error where the proof of the personal injuries plaintiff received might alone justify the verdict and judgment, and there was no contention that the damages recovered are excessive.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b230-10\" pgmap=\"230\">3.

Street railroads, \u00a7 148<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when erasures in modified instruction not misleading. An instruction tendered in effect told the jury that proof of failure of defendant street railway company to give warning was not of itself sufficient to entitle plaintiff to recover, and then stated what plaintiff must prove in order to recover on that ground ending with the sentence \u201cand plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that at the time and place of the accident he was in the exercise of ordinary care for his own safety.\u201d The court gave the instruction after striking out the last sentence. Held, the fact that the words stricken out remained legible was not misleading as causing the jury to believe due care on part of plaintiff was unnecessary, the jury being otherwise instructed and the instruction not directing a verdict.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-4\" pgmap=\"230\">Warner H.
