A complaint filed in the Municipal Court in a bastardy proceeding need not bear the indorsement of the judge of said court that he had examined the complaint and was satisfied that the warrant should issue, where it appears from an order of court entered of record on the day the complaint was presented that the presiding judge examined the complaint and also examined the relatrix under oath and was satisfied that^ there was probable cause for filing the complaint, and an objection for want of such indorsement cannot be first urged on review.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b507-11\" pgmap=\"507\">3.
