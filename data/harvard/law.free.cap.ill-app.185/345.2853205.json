From a decree stating the account between the parties, finding that the deduction of a twenty per cent, premium without complying with law rendered the loan usurious, that defendant was chargeable with only the amounts actually advanced, and the insurance, taxes and interest thereon paid by complainant, that the amount paid by defendant together with the earnings on his stock was in excess of the amount with which he was chargeable, and forfeiting all interest on the amount actually advanced to defendant, complainant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-11\" pgmap=\"371\">A former appeal in this case is reported in Trainor v.
