It is maintained in support of such errors assigned: (1) That the evidence fails to show any negligence on the part of appellant; (2) that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were proximately caused by risks which he assumed; and (3) that if any negligence contributed to his injuries it was that of fellow-servants.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b148-9\" pgmap=\"148\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b148-10\" pgmap=\"148\">Masker and servant, \u00a7 191<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence shows master liable for injury to servant resulting from negligent order of foreman. In an action by a servant to recover for personal injuries sustained by being burned by hot flue dust, the evidence showing that while plaintiff was shoveling the dust from a car the defendant\u2019s foreman caused the car to be dumped by negligently issued orders to other servants to release the appliance at the bottom of the car without warning plaintiff, held that the court did not err in refusing to direct a verdict for defendant, that the evidence did not show that the injuries were approximately caused by the risks which he assumed or by the negligence of fellow-servants, and that a verdict for plaintiff was sustained by the evidence.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-6\" pgmap=\"148\">Ralph F.
