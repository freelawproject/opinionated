Sales, \u00a7 817<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when buyer cannot refuse to accept consignment on account of price charged,. An order was sent by mail to a paint company for a barrel of paint suitable for painting boats with directions to ship at once, without any reference to the price. The paint company accepted the order by letter and delivered the paint to the railroad company for transportation. Upon arrival of the paint at destination the buyer refused to accept the same. In an action for the price the buyer urged as a defense that the price charged was greater than that quoted to him by the company\u2019s agent for such paints several months before he sent the order. Held that the contract of sale was complete and that the buyer was liable, it appearing that there were different qualities of paint for painting boats, that the paint company had no knowledge of the quotations made by the agent and that no mention was made of the agent\u2019s quotations in the written order for the paint.</headnotes><p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-4\" pgmap=\"36\">Statement of the Case.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\" pgmap=\"36\">Action by E.
