An instruction that: \u201cThe preponderance of evidence in a case is not necessarily alone determined by the number of witnesses testifying to a particular fact or state of facts. In determining upon which side the preponderance of evidence is, the jury should also take' into consideration, so far as shown by the evidence, the opportunities of the several witnesses for seeing or knowing, the things about which they testify, their conduct and demeanor while testifying, their interest or lack of interest, if any, in the result of the suit; the probability or improbability of the truth of their several statements, in view of all the evidence, facts and circumstances proved on the trial; and from all these circumstances, and a full consideration of all the evidence, determine upon which side is the greater iveight or preponderance of the evidence,\u201d if erroneous is not prejudicial.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b234-6\" pgmap=\"234\">3.
