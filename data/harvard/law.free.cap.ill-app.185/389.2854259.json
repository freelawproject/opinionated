Elisburg against Nellie K. Berkey and Arista W. Berkey to recover possession of a flat in an apartment building. The plaintiff, claiming right of ownership by a quitclaim deed from Nellie K. Berkey, had been in possession of the apartment building for some months, the tenants having attorned to him. One of the flats became vacant and the defendants took possession of it. At the trial an attempt was made by the defendants to have tried the question as to the ownership of the property, the claim being made that the quitclaim deed was obtained by fraud. Judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff and a writ of restitution was granted after the hearing. To reverse the judgment, defendants bring error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b416-7\" pgmap=\"416\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b416-8\" pgmap=\"416\">1.
