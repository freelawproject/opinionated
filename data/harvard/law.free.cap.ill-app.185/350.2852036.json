F. Lund for the use of J. E. Richards in which a summons was issued and served upon The Dole Valve Company as garnishee. The garnishee, after the time for answering was extended, filed an answer setting up that there were no rights, credits, etc., in his hands belonging to the said Lund, but that at the time of the commencement of the suit there was due and owing from him to Lund, on account of wag\u2019es, salary or compensation, the sum of $10.50, which was subject to a notice of assignment previously served upon him by one L. H. Bronte, which sum was paid pursuant to said notice. An order was thereupon entered making Bronte a party to the suit as adverse claimant, and he was served with notice and he appeared and filed a statement of claim, claiming the wages due by virtue of the assignment. The court found in the hands of the garnishee $169.53, of which sum it found $61 subject to the claim of Bronte and $109.53 subject to the garnishment writ. The court overruled the garnishee\u2019s objection to the finding and entered judgment. To reverse the judgment, the garnishee brings error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-9\" pgmap=\"376\">Robert E.
