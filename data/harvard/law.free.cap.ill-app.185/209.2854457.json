Plaintiff testified that he was ordered by his foreman to get a steel plate, used in lining an ore pocket, from the bottom of a number of plates piled in the pocket; that to get a tackle for that purpose he stepped on a plate which slipped causing him to fall; that he was obliged to cross the plates to reach the tackle, and that before doing so he did not pay any attention to them, did not know how high they were piled nor how many there were. Held, that plaintiff\u2019s testimony showed that the danger was known to him, or in the exercise of ordinary care would have been known, and he was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b235-14\" pgmap=\"235(34) 236(64)\">2.
