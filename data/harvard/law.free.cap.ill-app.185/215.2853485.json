Executors and administrators, \u00a7 498<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when judgment against executor in Ms representative capacity improper. In an action against executors to recover for horse feed furnished after the death of the testator for horses belonging to the estate, a judgment for plaintiff entered against the defendants as executors to be paid in due course of administration, held improper.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b242-11\" pgmap=\"242\">2. Executors and administrators, \u00a7 489<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when executor must be sued in Ms individual capacity. No action will lie against an executor in his representative character upon a claim which accrued subsequent to the death of the testator. The general rule is that no action will lie aguinst an executor or administrator in his representative character except upon some claim or demand which existed against the testator or intestate in his lifetime, and if a claim or demand accrues in the time of the executor or administrator he is liable therefor only in his personal character.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b242-12\" pgmap=\"242\">3. Executors and administrators, \u00a7 115<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014personal liability on contracts for benefit of estate. Contracts of executors and administrators, although made in the interest and for the benefit of the estate they represent, if made upon a new and independent consideration moving between their promisee and themselves, are their personal contracts, which do not hind the estate, and they must be sued thereon in their individual capacity. The fact that they are described in a contract as representatives does not affect the rule.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-5\" pgmap=\"242\">Samuel A.
