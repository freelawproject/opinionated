Burdick to recover for rental for certain street lamps installed by the plaintiff. The action was based on an instrument in writing1 purporting on its face to be a contract between a certain \u201cBusiness Men\u2019s Association\u201d and the plaintiff Company, wherein the plaintiff Company agreed to furnish and install certain lamps for street lighting and the association agreed to pay for the lamps at the rate of \u25a0 sixty dollars per post per year in monthly payments. The instrument was never executed by the Association but was duly executed by the plaintiff Company. Between the attesting clause and the signature of the plaintiff Company a list containing the names of forty persons and business houses appeared, and following the signature a second list of names of persons appeared, the last name on the list being that of defendant. There was no evidence in the record to show how any of the names came to be on the list, excepting that of the defendant. As to her name it appeared that the chairman of a committee of the association procured her signature. The proof showed that she was not a member of the association and there was nothing in the record to support a finding that the persons composing the lists signed as and for an unincorporated association of individuals. To reverse a judgment recovered against the defendant for thirty dollars, defendant brings error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b651-8\" pgmap=\"651\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b651-9\" pgmap=\"651\">Contracts, \u00a7 207<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>-\u2014when person signing written instrument not bound thereby.
