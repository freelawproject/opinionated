Evidence, \u00a7 436<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014sufficiency of hypothetical questions. A party is not obliged in his hypothetical question to assume all the facts in evidence that may bear on the answer sought; the course is always open to the other party to supply, on cross-examination, an omission deemed material.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b404-6\" pgmap=\"404\">3. Witnesses, \u00a7 210<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>'\u2014when hypothetical questions do not invade province of jury.

Witnesses, \u00a7 220<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when cross-examination of experts limited to inquiry on direct examination. In an action for personal injuries, where one of plaintiff\u2019s attending physicians testified to objective symptoms found by him upon examination of plaintiff, counsel for defendant on cross-examination cannot obtain opinions as to the consequences of such symptoms if they were not inquired of on direct examination.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b404-9\" pgmap=\"404\">6.

Witnesses, \u00a7 183<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014sufficiency of answers. In an action for personal injuries, certain lay witnesses testified to the general appearance of plaintiff after the accident. The defendant objected on the ground that they should be required to state his appearance as they observed it on each specific occasion. Held that the answers contained nothing the witnesses might not properly testify to, and did not preclude defendant from making a more specific inquiry.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b404-11\" pgmap=\"404(52) 405(43)\">8.

In an action for personal injuries, a witness for plaintiff testified he \u201cfelt the jar\u201d of the collision. On cross-examination he characterized it as a \u201cslight jar.\u201d Later, when recalled for cross-examination for impeachment, he was asked if lie did not in a written statement call it \u201ca very slight bump\u201d and the court sustained an objection to the question and refused to receive the statement in evidence. Held, that the statement presented no material contradiction of his previous testimony.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b405-5\" pgmap=\"405\">9. Witnesses, \u00a7 210<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when question improper as assuming facts.
