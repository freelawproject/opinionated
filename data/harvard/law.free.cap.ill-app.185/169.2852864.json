In an action for personal injuries plaintiff claimed that while in the employ of defendant in a coal yard owned and controlled by him he was injured through the negligence of the latter in the management of coal cars therein. Defendant in special pleas denied ownership of the yard and plaintiff\u2019s employment by him. Beyond testimony that he was employed in defendant\u2019s coal yard, plaintiff introduced no evidence on the subject, while defendant\u2019s uncontradicted evidence showed that signs above the yard, pay rolls, and receipts for wages bore the name of another, defendant\u2019s name appearing merely as agent. It was held that plaintiff failed to meet the burden imposed upon him by the special pleas and a verdict in his favor was against the manifest weight of evidence.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\" pgmap=\"195\">Appeal from the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon.

Where the record fails to show an exception to the refusal of a peremptory instruction to find for defendant the latter cannot contend, on appeal, that the instruction should have been given on the theory that there was no evidence tending to sustain allegations of the declaration as to issues raised by special pleas.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b196-6\" pgmap=\"196\">4.

Where the summons in an action was served twenty-eight days before the first day of the term at which it was returnable and the declaration was filed nearly a year before such return day, a petition to remove the cause to the federal court filed on the seventeenth day of the term is not in apt time under the act of Congress requiring the petition to be filed in the State court \u201cat the time, or any time before the defendant is required by the laws of the State or the rule of the State court in which such suit is brought to answer or plead to the declaration or complaint of the plaintiff,\u201d since, although the statutes providing for a continuance where the summons is not served and the declaration filed ten days before the first day of the term do not expressly provide that the defendant must appear and plead on the return day of the summons where the summons is so served and the declaration so filed, such is their clear intent and meaning.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
