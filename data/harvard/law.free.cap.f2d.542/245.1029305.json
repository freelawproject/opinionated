The Ford Motor Credit Company, plaintiff-appellee, was listed as a secured creditor. The appellant subsequently filed a petition under Chapter XIII of the Bankruptcy Act, seeking to effect a plan to pay his creditors. The appellee rejected the appellant\u2019s plan and filed its complaint to recover possession of the automobile. The appellant counterclaimed, alleging violations of Regulation Z and the Truth in Lending Act based on the fact that the acceleration clause in the contract he had signed was not on the face but the reverse side of the contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The appellee filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaim, which the Bankruptcy Judge denied. On appeal the District Court reversed and directed that an order be issued dismissing the counterclaim. The court held that the provisions of the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z do not require disclosure of an acceleration clause on the face of the contract. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In <em>Martin v. Commercial Securities Company, Inc., </em>539 F.2d 521 (5th Cir. 1976), we held that in' the absence of a regulation expressly requiring it, failure to disclose an acceleration clause and the lender\u2019s rebate policy with respect thereto in an installment credit transaction does not give rise to a claim for statutory damages. We said that the creditor\u2019s right to acceleration and the creditor\u2019s failure to provide for a rebate of unearned interest in the event of acceleration did not result in \u201ccharges\u201d under \u00a7 128(a)(9) of the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638(a)(9), and \u00a7 226.8(b)(4) of Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(b)(4). <em>See also Meyers &amp; Clearview Dodge Sales, Inc., </em>539 F.2d 511 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Grant v. Imperial Motors, </em>539 F.2d 506 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Because the presence of an acceleration clause in the contract in the case at bar did not give rise to a \u201ccharge\u201d under the Act as construed in <em>Martin, supra, </em>there was no duty to disclose the provision on the face of the contract. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\">.
