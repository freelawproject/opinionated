He raises numerous assignments of error. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Pena, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, who had been intermittently living in the United States for a number of years, was apprehended November 6, 1975, in Disney World by its security officials for passing counterfeit $20 bills. A Secret Service agent was called to the scene and advised Pena of his rights with a standard form which was translated into Spanish by a Disney interpreter. Pena signed the form, as well as a consent-to-search form for his car and locker. The searches of his locker and car revealed more counterfeit currency and notes as well as a quantity of merchandise which had been purchased with the counterfeit money. Despite Pena\u2019s assertion that he had unknowingly received the counterfeit money when he had sold a car in Santo Domingo, he was convicted by a jury of all counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"> Pena argues that the district court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a bill of particulars, after a hearing before a United States magistrate. But \u201c[t]he grant or refusal of the defendant\u2019s motion for a Bill of Particulars is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and will not be disturbed on appeal except for a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baggett, </em>5 Cir. 1972, 455 F.2d 476, 477. Pena based his defense on his alleged lack of knowledge of the counterfeit nature of the obligations; he did not deny that he had indeed passed the bills at the date and place specified in the indictment. In these circumstances, Pena could hardly have been surprised by the government\u2019s proof at trial. Nor has he been able to indicate how his defense was hampered by the denial of the requested material. There was no abuse of discretion. In effect his motion amounted to an attempt to obtain a list of witnesses. He has no right to such a list under Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Treatman, </em>W.D.La.1975, 399 F.Supp. 264, 265-66. 8 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 7.06 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Pena\u2019s next objection is that the court prevented him from introducing evidence which would have helped his case. However, neither the proffered evidence of his bail status, nor the testimony by defendant\u2019s wife about what amount of currency she had declared at Customs, had any probative value. Again there was no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of irrelevant evidence that could only have served to confuse the jury about the issues in the case. <em>United States v. Isaacs, </em>5 Cir. 1975, 516 F.2d 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Pena\u2019s next objection is to the admission of the items found in the warrant-less searches of the locker and his car. He argues that his consent to the search was not voluntarily given because, with his language difficulties, he did not understand what he was doing. The record clearly reveals the contrary. Defendant was repeatedly warned of his rights in Spanish as well as English. He stated that he understood that he did not have to answer the security agent\u2019s questions, and that he did not have to consent to the searches. There was no coercion. This consent search was a constitutionally proper exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States v. Watson, </em>1976, 423 U.S. 411, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598; <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>1973, 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Pena raises several further evidentiary objections. First, he argues that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s initial admission in evidence of certain counterfeit bills and subsequent withdrawal of those items from evidence. However, the court\u2019s cautionary instructions to the jury adequately safeguarded the defendant\u2019s rights, and he has failed to show how the trial court\u2019s ruling could have resulted in prejudice. Pena also argues that the district court should not have permitted the government to cross-examine him about his prior failure to declare $5000 cash when he had passed through Customs. Although he made no objection to this line of interrogation at trial, he argues that this ruling constitutes \u201cplain error\u201d under Rule 52(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. We disagree. The evidence clearly was probative of the defendant\u2019s intent and knowledge that his currency was counterfeit. See <em>United States v. Blewitt, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 538 F.2d 1099; <em>United States v. Hatcher, </em>5 Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 1086, rehearing denied April 16, 1970, cert. denied 1970, 400 U.S. 848, 91 S.Ct. 35, 27 L.Ed.2d 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Next Pena asserts error in the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a defense motion for judgment of acquittal. There was however sufficient evidence from which a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to commit the offense. <em>United States v. James, </em>5 Cir. 1975, 510 F.2d 546, 551 \u2014 52, rehearing en banc denied 1975, 513 F.2d 629. Finally we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of a new trial based on Pena\u2019s lack of character witnesses at trial. He does not deny that he never mentioned the alleged witnesses at all; he never subpoenaed them nor requested a continuance so they could be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
