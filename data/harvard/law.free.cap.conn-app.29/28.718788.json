Don Smith and Eileen Smith, appeal from the trial court\u2019s decision affirming the denial of their subdivision application by the zoning board of appeals of the town of Greenwich.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the trial court correctly upheld the denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 subdivision application. The trial court found that the application conformed to all the stated subdivision regulations, but that it \u201cdid not meet the purposes of the subdivision regulations .... It does not conform to the town of Greenwich plan of development in that it does not meet the basic objectives of preservation of historic and architectural resources. Furthermore, it does not preserve the natural features of the landscape: namely the historic streetscape.\u201d We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">The relevant facts are as follows. The plaintiffs reside at and are owners of property located at 35 Strickland Road in Greenwich. The property is located in an R-7 zone and contains 33,032 square feet. The minimum lot size for this zone is 7500 square feet. The property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>is also located in an historic district. In January, 1987, the plaintiffs submitted a subdivision application to the planning and zoning commission of the town of Greenwich (commission), seeking to subdivide the property into three lots. In April, 1987, the commission conducted a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application and advised them to proceed to a final subdivision plan, subject to the resolution of a number of specified issues prior to the final application submission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The plaintiffs subsequently proposed a final subdivision plan. On November 22, 1988, the commission denied the subdivision application by the following resolution: \u201cWHEREAS, the Town of Greenwich Plan of Development, 1984 states as a basic development objective the preservation of historic and architectural resources; and</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u201cWHEREAS, the subject lot is contained within the duly established Mill Pond Historic District; and</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u201cWHEREAS, the Commission recognizes that the existing streetscape, which is defined by the open space of the subject tract in relation to adjoining historical properties, structures, and open spaces is a significant element of the historic district in terms of visual appearance as well as historic use and occupancy of the land; and</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u201cWHEREAS the subdivision would permit construction of a house in the previously defined, significant open space, thereby disrupting an essential characteristic of the historic district; and</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u201cWHEREAS a stated purpose of the Subdivision Regulations of the Town is to \u2018Further the orderly development of the Town in accordance with the Town Plan of Development\u2019; and</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u201cWHEREAS, the Commission finds that there are other zoning options for development of the property which would provide for the same or greater number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>of dwelling units while preserving the site\u2019s open space and natural features which are significant components of the historic streetscape;</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u201cTHEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that final Subdivision #1066 of E. Don Smith and Eileen Smith owners of property located on Strickland Road consisting of a record sheet prepared by J. A. Kirby Company dated March 17,1988, revised September 26,1988, is hereby denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The plaintiffs appealed the decision of the commission to the defendant zoning board of appeals of the town of Greenwich (board). The board then conducted a de novo public hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 final subdivision plan pursuant to \u00a7 103 of the Greenwich Municipal Code. The proposed subdivision called for three lots, the first containing the plaintiffs\u2019 residence, the second containing the plaintiffs\u2019 barn, and the third the presently unimproved area in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 residence. At the public hearing, the chairman of the historic district commission urged the board of appeals to reject the subdivision, stating that the historic district commission would not allow any structure to be built on the third lot. After a lengthy hearing, the board denied the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal on the following grounds: \u201cThe proposed subdivision did not meet the purposes of the Subdivision Regulations as provided in Section 6-260, thereof. It does not conform to the Town of Greenwich Plan of Development in that it does not meet the basic objectives of preservation of historic and architectural resources. Furthermore, it does not preserve the natural features of the landscape; namely, the historic streetscape.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u201cApplicants\u2019 plan proposed in an Historic District was opposed in testimony and in writing by the Historic District Commission which among other things, oversees erection and alteration of buildings in said district. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>plan was also opposed by residents in the District. The Board finds that the integrity of the Historic District would be violated and the appearance and historic character of the Historic District would be impaired by this plan. The residents who voted to form an Historic District were given assurances of preservation of their historic neighborhood even though they knew certain freedoms of future development would be regulated and restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u201cThe applicants were aware of the property\u2019s location in the Historic District since that fact is stated in their deed and they formerly resided in this District at another address. The Board concluded that the applicants\u2019 development rights were not deprived because other alternatives for development are available.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u201cThe property is located in the Coastal Zone of the Town. Therefore, it is subject to the requirements of the <em>Coastal Area Management Act. </em>The Board finds that the proposed subdivision plan would have an adverse impact on coastal resources because of the alteration of <em>natural features of vistas.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The plaintiffs appealed the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (2) (b). The trial court upheld the board\u2019s decision, ruling against the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the proposal met the requirements of the subdivision regulations as written and that the town plan of development is not a regulation. The trial court further found, however, that the board\u2019s conclusion, based on the Coastal Area Management Act, was not based on substantial evidence and was not a sufficient reason to deny the subdivision application.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The court found in relevant part as follows. \u201cSection 6-260 of the Greenwich Municipal Code provides that one of the purposes of the subdivision regulations is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>to \u2018further the orderly development of the town in accordance with the town plan of development.\u2019 The town plan of development has as one of its \u2018Basic Objectives\u2019 the preservation of historic resources. The town plan of development also provides that \u2018Greenwich has a rich . . . historical heritage that should be protected for the benefit and enlightenment of future generations,\u2019and that\u2018conserving the Town\u2019s . . . historical resources is a notably effective land use tool for preserving the essential character and spirit of the community.\u2019 Other references to the importance of historic factors appear in the town plan of development. An evaluation of historical factors is specifically mentioned in the Greenwich Subdivision Regulations, \u00a7 6-266 (a) 19, governing subdivisions in the coastal zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u201cIt is the opinion of the court that the plaintiffs\u2019 position is without merit. Not only do the subdivision regulations mention historic factors, but they state as a purpose the development of the town in accordance with the town plan of development, which has preservation of historic resources as a basic objective. Further, given the established public policy favoring historic preservation, see General Statutes \u00a7 7-147a et seq. and Greenwich Municipal Code \u00a7 6-307, and the plaintiffs\u2019 deed restriction, it is found that the board did apply standards contained in the regulations to the subdivision, and plaintiffs had notice that historic factors would be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u201cThe board\u2019s finding that the proposal would impair the historic streetscape is supported by the record. The Smiths\u2019 side of Strickland Road is characterized by homes on lots with sweeping front lawns. The plaintiffs plan to convert their front lawn into a building lot and construct thereon a house with a thirty feet by forty feet footprint, and setbacks of twenty-five feet from the front properly line, twenty feet from the south property line, and fifteen feet from a line of trees. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>exhibits show that construction of a house on the front lawn would drastically alter the streetscape, and support the board\u2019s conclusion in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u201cThe board also cited the opposition of the historic district commission, which, among other things, oversees erection and alteration of buildings in the historic district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The trial court ultimately concluded that the board\u2019s consideration of and decision based on historic factors was proper and that the evidence on the record was sufficient to support the board\u2019s decision that the proposed subdivision would impair the appearance of the historic streetscape. The plaintiffs appealed from the trial court\u2019s dismissal of their appeal after we granted certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">We disagree with the trial court for the following reasons: (1) the enabling statutes on subdivisions did not give the defendant the authority to include historical factors in its regulations; (2) the terms \u201ctown plan of development,\u201d \u201chistoric factors\u201d and \u201chistoric street-scape\u201d are not known and fixed standards required for subdivision regulations; (3) the Greenwich town charter forbids the board from denying a subdivision application based on the plan of development; and (4) it is the duty of the historic district commission, not the planning and zoning commission or the board of appeals, to decide whether a building should be erected in a historic district.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u201c Tt has been said that the whole field of subdivision regulation is peculiarly a creature of legislation. It is therefore imperative that before subdivision regulations may be made operative, the necessary statutory authorization for such regulation must exist. ... In other words, in order to determine whether the regulation in question was within the authority of the commission to enact, we do not search for a statutory prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>against such an enactment; rather, we must search for statutory authority for the enactment.\u2019 ...\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Finn </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 540, 545, 244 A.2d 319 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Substantive subdivision requirements are set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 8-25 and procedural subdivision requirements are set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 8-26.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The subdivision regulations are required to conform to local zoning regulations. Subdivision regulations cannot impose minimum lot size, shape, width and depth requirements greater than those required under the zoning regulations for the zone where the property is to be subdivided or deny approval of lots that meet all zoning requirements. <em>Christofaro </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>217 Conn. 103, 107, 584 A.2d 1168 (1991). Also, subdivision regulations can have provisions to meet the general test in \u00a7 8-25 that the land to be subdivided shall be of such character \u201cthat it can be used for building purposes without danger to health or the public safety.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the definition of subdivision in the regulations must conform with the definitions of subdivision and resubdivision set forth in General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u00a7 8-18. <em>Peninsula Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>151 Conn. 450, 451, 199 A.2d 1 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The enabling statutes do not allow a planning or planning and zoning commission to promulgate subdivision regulations based on historic and architectural concerns, historic streetscape or the integrity and historic character of a historic district. The parties stipulated, and our review of the regulations confirms, that the application conformed to all of the regulations of an R-7 zone. At oral argument, the board\u2019s counsel conceded that if the subject property was not located in an historic district, but in another R-7 zone, the application would have been approved because it met all of the regulations not concerned with \u201chistoric.\u201d The reliance by the board in a subdivision application on matters \u201chistoric\u201d is outside the enabling statute and is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u201cWhen a municipal planning commission considers the approval or disapproval of a subdivision plan, it is acting in an administrative capacity rather than in a legislative capacity. <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 431, 433, 544 A.2d 1213 (1988). \u2018The planning commission, acting in its administrative capacity herein, has no discretion or choice but to approve a subdivision if it conforms to the regulations adopted for its guidance.\u2019 Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe designation of a particular use of property as a permitted use establishes a <em>conclusive presumption </em>that such use does not adversely affect the district and <em>precludes further inquiry into its effect on traffic, municipal services, property values, or the general harmony of the district. \u201d </em>\u2019 (Emphasis added.) <em>TLC Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>215 Conn. 527, 532-33, 577 A.2d 288 (1990).\u201d <em>Sowin Associates </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>23 Conn. App. 370, 374, 580 A.2d 91 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201cSubdivision regulations cannot be too general in their terms and must contain known and fixed standards that apply to all similar cases. <em>Sonn </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>172 Conn. 156, 159-60, 374 A.2d 159 (1976). A commission\u2019s regulations must be reasonably precise in subject matter and reasonably adequate and sufficient to give both the commission and those affected by its decision notice of their rights and obligations. <em>American Power &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, </em>329 U.S. 90, 105, 67 S. Ct. 133, 91 L. Ed. 103 (1946); see <em>Sonn </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>supra, 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u201cGeneral policy statements gleaned from subdivision regulations regarding compliance with public health and safety regulations do not provide a sufficient basis for rejection of a subdivision permit. <em>TLC Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 530 n.2. Furthermore, the conclusive presumption set forth in <em>TLC Development, Inc., </em>precludes a commission\u2019s reliance on a proposed subdivision\u2019s failure to coincide with the general harmony of the district. Id., 533.\u201d <em>Sowin Associates </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In the present case, the reasons given by the board for the denial of the subdivision application, even if \u201chistoric,\u201d was part of the enabling act, were not based on fixed and known standards that could apply to all similar subdivisions. At best they were general policy statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The board made the following findings that demonstrate this point. First, \u201c[t]he proposed subdivision did not meet the purposes of the subdivision regulations as provided in Sec. 6-260 thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>policy statement. Section 6-260 of the Greenwich municipal code subdivision regulations sets forth general purpose statements, no standards and does not mention the words \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201chistoric street-scape.\u201d They are not mentioned in this section or any other section of the subdivision regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Second, \u201c[the proposed subdivision] does not conform to the Town of Greenwich Plan of Development in that it does not meet the basic objections of preservation of historic and architectural resources.\u201d This is a general purpose statement without any fixed and known standards. In addition, \u00a7 98 of the Greenwich town charter specifically provides that the commission shall not refuse approval of any subdivision on the ground that such subdivision creates or will tend to create a use of land contrary to that shown on the plan of development.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Third, \u201c[the proposed subdivision] does not preserve the natural features of the landscape; namely, the Historic streetscape.\u201d There is neither a general nor a specific definition of \u201chistoric streetscape\u201d in the regulations, let alone a known or fixed standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Finally, the board found that \u201cthe integrity of the Historic District would be violated and the appearance and historic character of the Historic District would be impaired by this plan.\u201d There is nothing in the subdivision regulations that has anything to do with the historic district. The land in question is located in an R-7 zone, and the plaintiffs\u2019 subdivision application in every way conforms to the zoning and subdivision requirements of the R-7 zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Our disagreement with both the board and the trial court is the confusion of the planning and zoning commission\u2019s duties and functions as to subdivision regulations and applications with the historic district commission\u2019s duties as an administrative board to hear and decide applications for certificates of appropriateness as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 7-147d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Professor Tondro states, \u201c[t]he historic district commission\u2019s regulatory tool is the certificate of appropriateness. No building can be erected or altered within the district until the commission has issued a certificate. The municipality may not issue a building or demolition permit for any structure until a certificate has first been granted by the commission. Even outdoor advertising signs and bill posters need a certificate. Nor may any area within the district be used for parking, other than residential, without a certificate from the commission (Section 7-147d).\u201d T. Tondro, Connecticut Land Use Regulation (1983 Sup.) p. 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The plaintiffs met all the requirements of the subdivision regulation of the town of Greenwich.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the property is located in an historic district, the plaintiffs must obtain a certificate of appropriateness from the historic district commission before they may build <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>in accordance with their subdivision plan. The plaintiffs are entitled to a fair hearing on their application before a neutral and unbiased historic district commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment sustaining the appeal and ordering the granting of the subdivision application.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b52-6\"> In particular, the commission requested the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">\u201c1.
