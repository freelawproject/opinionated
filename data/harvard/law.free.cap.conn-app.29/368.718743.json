The plaintiff\u2019s argument that such modification was prohibited because the change was contemplated ignores the plain language of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 as amended by Public Acts 1990, No. 90-213, \u00a7 46, which provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]fter the date of judgment, modification of any child support order issued before or after July 1,1990, may be made upon a showing of such substantial change of circumstances, whether or not such change of circumstances was contemplated at the time of dissolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The plaintiff also argues that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215b, which creates the rebuttable presumption that the amount of child support determined by the application of the child support guidelines is the amount to be ordered, is not retroactive and therefore is not applicable to the order entered by the trial court. This argument overlooks the recent decision of our Supreme Court in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 718, 595 A.2d 297 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
