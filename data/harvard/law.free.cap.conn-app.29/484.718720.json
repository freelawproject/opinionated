The plaintiff cross appeals from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the trial court\u2019s decision to confirm the arbitration award without adding interest retroactively from the date of the arbitration award to the date the trial court confirmed the award. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. During the academic year 1987-88, the plaintiff lived at the university she attended and her permanent residence was in Darien where her mother, Carol Lawrence, lived in an apartment. Just before the plaintiff returned home for spring break on March 25, 1988,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she received a telephone call from her mother\u2019s sister, Sherry O\u2019Gata, advising her not to return to Darien. The plaintiff was instructed by her aunt to come instead to Bridgeport to the O\u2019Gata residence where the plaintiff\u2019s aunt lived with her husband, Baron, and their two children. After the plaintiff arrived, she was told that her mother had been hospitalized for injuries resulting from an attack by a male coworker. The plaintiff\u2019s aunt invited her to stay at the O\u2019Gata residence instead of returning to Darien, and the plaintiff moved into the O\u2019Gata residence. She had her own room, and ate her meals at the O\u2019Gata residence. She slept there and received correspondence and telephone calls there. Most of the plaintiff\u2019s personal belongings were kept at her aunt\u2019s house. When the plaintiff\u2019s mother was subsequently discharged from the hospital, she moved directly into the O\u2019Gata home. The plaintiff and her mother intended to reside permanently at the O\u2019Gata home and had no intention of returning to Darien for fear of another attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The plaintiff resided continuously at the O\u2019Gata residence until April 8, 1988. On that date, after running errands for her mother, she was injured in an automobile accident involving a 1986 Chrysler station wagon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>that the plaintiff\u2019s mother was in the process of purchasing from the estate of the plaintiff\u2019s grandfather, Willis C. Lawrence. The driver of the motor vehicle, Robert Putzig, Jr., was at fault for the accident in which the motor vehicle hit a tree. The plaintiff was taken to Norwalk Hospital where she was treated for her resulting injuries. As a result of the collision, the plaintiff incurred medical bills of $206,507.78.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">After approximately three months in the hospital, the plaintiff was able to return to the O\u2019Gata home where she remained until late October, 1988, when she and her mother moved to Maryland. During the summer of 1989, they returned to Connecticut briefly to move their furniture out of the Darien apartment. Later that summer, they moved to Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">At the time of the collision, the station wagon was insured by The Hartford Insurance Company under a policy with a bodily injury limit of $100,000 per person, the total amount of which was disbursed to the plaintiff because of Putzig\u2019s negligence. The O\u2019Gatas were insured by the defendant under an insurance policy that covered two vehicles and afforded uninsured-underinsured motorist coverage of $500,000 per vehicle up to an aggregate total of $1,000,000. The plaintiff filed a claim against the defendant under this policy. The dispute was brought before a three person arbitration panel as provided by the insurance policy and General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 38-175c,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> now recodified in General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>By memorandum dated March 8,1991, a majority of the arbitration panel<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> found that the plaintiff was an insured under the O\u2019Gata\u2019s insurance policy and a resident of the O\u2019Gata household. The plaintiff was awarded $650,000 ($750,000 less the $100,000 disbursed to the plaintiff by The Hartford Insurance Company). Subsequently, the defendant moved to vacate the arbitration award under General Statutes \u00a7 52-418. The defendant also moved for modification or correction of the award under General Statutes \u00a7 52-419. The plaintiff moved to confirm the arbitration award on April 5, 1991. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motions, and confirmed the arbitration award without allowing the plaintiff to recover retroactive interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court and the arbitration panel improperly concluded that the plaintiff was an insured covered by the O\u2019Gata\u2019s uninsured motorist insurance policy, (2) the trial court and the arbitration panel improperly concluded that the plaintiff was a resident of the O\u2019Gata household under the insurance policy issued to Sherry and Baron O\u2019Gata, and (3) the trial court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for correction or modification of the arbitration panel\u2019s award because it found that the collateral source offset provisions of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 52-225a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were inapplicable. The plaintiff cross appeals claiming that she was entitled to recover interest on the arbitration award from the date of the arbitration panel\u2019s decision to the date on which the award was confirmed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In its first two claims, the defendant challenges two conclusions drawn by the arbitration panel and the trial court with regard to the coverage of the uninsured motorist insurance policy. First, the defendant argues that the plaintiff was not an insured under the O\u2019Gata\u2019s insurance policy. Second, the defendant maintains that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the plaintiff was not a resident of the O\u2019Gata household whose injuries were covered by the uninsured motorist insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Our Supreme Court has determined that the substantial evidence test is the appropriate standard for the review of factual determinations of an arbitration panel in cases, such as this, involving compulsory arbitration proceedings required by General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c. <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 656, 591 A.2d 101 (1991). The substantial evidence test in the context of arbitration requires that a court determine whether substantial evidence exists in the \u201crecord to support the [arbitration panel\u2019s] findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Substantial evidence will be found to exist if the . . . record supplies a substantial basis of fact from which the court reasonably can infer the fact in issue.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 660-61 n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court abused its discretion when it determined that the arbitration panel correctly found that the plaintiff was an insured entitled to coverage under the uninsured motorist insurance policy issued to the O\u2019Gatas. The arbitration panel and the trial court found that the plaintiff did not fall within the \u201cowned motor vehicle\u201d exclusion under the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The defendant relies on the first exception to the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d in the insurance policy issued to the O\u2019Gatas. This exception provides that an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d does not include \u201cany vehicle or equipment . . . owned by or furnished or available for your regular use.\u201d The defendant maintains that the station wagon involved in the accident fell within this exception despite the fact that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>tiff and her mother were not restricted in their use of the station wagon. The defendant maintains that because the plaintiff and her mother were residents of the O\u2019Gata household when they enjoyed such unrestricted use of the station wagon, the station wagon fell within the exception. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u201cWhere the language of an insurance policy is clear and unambiguous, the terms of the policy must be given their natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Horak </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>181 Conn. 614, 616, 436 A.2d 783 (1980). The policy at issue in this case is not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Clauses of an insurance contract which limit liability for uninsured or underinsured motorists \u201c \u2018must be construed most strongly against the insurer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 675, quoting <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 196, 530 A.2d 171 (1987); <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middle-sex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>219 Conn. 371, 375, 593 A.2d 498 (1991). The O\u2019Gata\u2019s insurance policy defined \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d as referring to: \u201cThe \u2018named insured\u2019 shown on the declaration; and . . . The spouse if a resident of the same household.\u201d The declaration names both Sherry and Baron O\u2019Gata. It is evident, given the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour,\u201d that the exception applies only to a motor vehicle \u201cthat is owned by or furnished or available for the regular use of\u201d Baron and Sherry O\u2019Gata. The station wagon was used by the plaintiff and her mother, not by the O\u2019Gatas. On the date of the collision, for example, the plaintiff had been running errands for her mother, not for the O\u2019Gatas. Therefore, substantial evidence existed on the record to support the decision of the arbitration panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the arbitration panel and the trial court improperly determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>that the plaintiff was a resident of the O\u2019Gata household whose injuries were covered by the insurance policy. After reviewing the record of the arbitration proceedings, the trial court ruled that \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d supported the arbitration panel\u2019s determination that the plaintiff was a resident of the O\u2019Gata household.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Our analysis hinges upon the construction given to \u201cresidence of the same household\u201d by our Supreme Court in <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>167 Conn. 450, 356 A.2d 94 (1975). Our Supreme Court quoted Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary which defined \u201chousehold\u201d as: \u201c \u2018[TJhose who dwell under the same roof and compose a family: a domestic establishment; specif: a social unit comprised of those living together in the.same dwelling place.\u2019 \u201d Id., 454; <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>218 Conn. 681, 686, 590 A.2d 957 (1991). On the basis of this definition, our courts have determined that there are two criteria that must be met for a person to qualify as a \u201cresident of the same household.\u201d The first requires that we determine whether the evidence in this case was sufficient to establish that the plaintiff had a close, family-type relationship with the members of the O\u2019Gata household. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>supra. The second requires that we consider whether the facts in this case were sufficient to establish that the plaintiff actually lived in the O\u2019Gata home. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The defendant does not dispute that the plaintiff is related to the members of the O\u2019Gata household.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, the defendant contends that the plaintiff does not satisfy the second criteria that she actually lived in the O\u2019Gata home. Our determination as to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tiffs status as a resident of her aunt\u2019s household rests on a conglomeration of factors. Id., 687. While the intent of the plaintiff to reside in the O\u2019Gata home is one factor to be considered, it is not the controlling one. Id. We must also consider the frequency of the plaintiff\u2019s contact with the members of the O\u2019Gata household. Id., 686-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Here, the plaintiff and her mother intended to live at the O\u2019Gata home permanently to avoid any possible confrontation with her mother\u2019s attacker. Furthermore, the plaintiff had frequent contact with the O\u2019Gata family. The plaintiff took her meals with the O\u2019Gata family. She slept in a room she maintained on the third floor where she kept most of her personal belongings. The plaintiff received her mail at the O\u2019Gata residence as well. After the plaintiff was hospitalized, she returned to the O\u2019Gata residence with the intent to remain there. Therefore, we agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that substantial evidence supported the arbitration panel\u2019s decision that the plaintiff was a resident of the O\u2019Gata household covered under the uninsured motorist insurance policy when the collision occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly failed to offset the arbitration award under General Statutes \u00a7 52-225a by the amount paid by collateral sources to the plaintiff. On April 29,1991,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendant filed a motion for modification or correction under General Statutes \u00a7 52-419 (a) (l)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in which it requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>that the court reduce the award by the amount of collateral source payments under \u00a7 52-225. The trial court found that \u00a7 52-225a was inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u201c[Wjhere judicial review of compulsory arbitration proceedings required by \u00a7 38-175c (a) (1) is undertaken under General Statutes \u00a7 52-418, the reviewing court must conduct a de novo review of the interpretation and application of the law by the arbitrators.\u201d <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 191, 530 A.2d 171 (1987); <em>Bodner </em>v. <em>United Services Automobile Assn., </em>222 Conn. 480, 486, 610 A.2d 1212 (1992). \u201cAlthough the language of \u00a7 52-419 (a) can be read narrowly, the court\u2019s role of reviewing the legal determinations of arbitrators de novo and their factual determinations under the substantial evidence standard requires that the statute be given a more expansive meaning . . . .\u201d <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 679. The trial court has the authority to modify the arbitration award to reflect the arbitration panel\u2019s factual findings and proper legal determinations to give effect to \u201cthe intent of the award as it should have been rendered under the law and to promote justice between the parties. General Statutes \u00a7 52-419 (b). Otherwise, the legislature\u2019s purposes in entrusting uninsured motorist coverage matters to compulsory arbitration under \u00a7 38-175e would be frustrated.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Our Supreme Court has set forth three factors that we must consider to determine whether a trial court possessed the authority to modify an arbitration panel\u2019s decision pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-419. Id., 679-80. First, we must determine whether the issue of collateral source offsets was considered by the arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>tration panel. Id., 679. Next, we must consider whether either party contested the offset in the trial court. Id., 679-80. Finally, we must determine whether the modifications required only undisputed mathematical calculations allowed by \u00a7 52-419.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id., 680. We find that the trial court properly determined that it did not have the authority to modify the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The arbitration clause of the O\u2019Gata\u2019s insurance policy is the submission that defined that arbitration panel\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The parties agreed in the insurance policy that the arbitration panel had the authority to reduce the award by amounts paid by various specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>sources to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, the arbitration panel reduced the award by the $100,000 paid to the plaintiff by The Hartford Insurance Company for the negligence of Putzig. No other offset was brought before the arbitration panel for its consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Both parties agreed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-416<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that the arbitration panel\u2019s authority over this case would end thirty days after the arbitration panel convened to decide the outcome of this case. The panel convened on February 18, 1991. Therefore, the period ended on March 18, 1991. Within this time period, the defendant did not submit any request for collateral source offsets. Thus, the first criterion requiring that the arbitration panel consider the offsets by which the defendant moved to reduce the award was not satisfied because the arbitration panel did not possess the authority to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>As to the second factor, the plaintiff, before the trial court, contested the award reduction sought by the defendant in its motion for modification or correction of the arbitration award. In its motion, the defendant requested that the award be reduced by collateral source offsets that were not before the arbitration panel when it had authority to determine the matter. The trial court could not modify the award to reflect the factual findings made by the arbitration panel because the motion for modification requested relief that was not within the factual findings of the arbitration panel. See <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 679. The defendant\u2019s motion did not satisfy the third criterion because the defendant\u2019s motion for modification did not involve \u201cundisputed mathematical calculations,\u201d which could have been determined based on the submissions and findings of the arbitration panel, as was the case in <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra. The trial court did not have the authority under General Statutes \u00a7 52-419 (a) (1) to reduce the plaintiffs arbitration award by collateral source offsets in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-225a.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In her cross appeal, the plaintiff claims that she was entitled to recover interest of $44,163.84 on the arbitration award that accrued under General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a from the date of the award on March 13,1991, to the date the trial court rendered judgment on November 15, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a confers on the trial court the discretion \u201cto award prejudgment interest on an arbitration award retroactively to some date prior to the date of the trial court\u2019s judgment affirming the award. . . . Implicit in that determination is the conclusion that the prior date may be the date of the arbitration award.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 675-76. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a allows recovery of interest accrued where the award has been improperly withheld. We will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision without a clear abuse of discretion. Id., 676. \u201cIn determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, this court must make every reasonable presumption in favor of [the trial court\u2019s] action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Walton </em>v. <em>New Hartford, </em>223 Conn. 155, 169, 612 A.2d 1153 (1992); 1 B. Holden &amp; J. Daly, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 IOC (2), p. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">It is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine whether interest must be paid for wrongfully withholding the award, and, if so, the amount thereof. <em>Middle-sex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>supra, 701-702; <em>Metcalfe </em>v. <em>Talarski, </em>213 Conn. 145, 160, 567 A.2d 1148 (1989). We must not determine only whether the money is payable but also \u201c \u2018whether the detention of the money is or is not wrongful under the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>supra, 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the award was not wrongfully withheld by the defendant. Therefore, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in deciding not to award prejudgment interest under \u00a7 37-3a.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> The spring break lasted until April 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 38-175c (a) (1) provides: \u201cEvery such policy shall provide insurance, herein called uninsured motorist coverage, in accordance with such regulations, with limits for bodily injury or death not less than those specified in subsection (a) of section 14-112, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles and underinsured motor vehicles and insured motor vehicles, the insurer of which becomes insolvent prior to payment of such damages, because of bodily injury, including death resulting therefrom, provided each insurer licensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>to write automobile liability insurance in this state shall provide such uninsured motorists coverage with limits requested by the named insured upon payment of the appropriate premium, but such insurer shall not be required to provide such coverage with limits in excess of the limits of the bodily injury coverage of such policy issued to such named insured. . . .

The court had ample authority under \u00a7 52-419 (a) (1), as we have construed it, to include those calculations in its modification.\u201d Id., 679-80.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\"> The arbitration clause provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">\u201cA.
