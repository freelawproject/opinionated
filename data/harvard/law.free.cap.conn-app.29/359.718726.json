On May 16, 1991, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to the first count of an original information charging sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b). He was also charged in the same information with conspiracy to distribute narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-277 (a) and 53a-48, but this charge was nolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The defendant\u2019s plea stems from his involvement in a cocaine sale that occurred on October 24,1989. The defendant initially retained Attorney Wesley S. Spears to represent him and subsequently retained Attorney M. Donald Cardwell. On May 15,1991, Cardwell filed an appearance on behalf of the defendant. His appearance was struck by the trial court the following day because he was unable to appear for jury selection. The trial court ordered that jury selection be conducted by Spears, who was present, and that the commencement of the taking of evidence be deferred to allow Card-well to represent the defendant at trial. Before jury selection began, the defendant decided to plead guilty. The trial court held a subsequent hearing that day where the defendant entered a guilty plea pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine. The trial court accepted the defendant\u2019s plea after determining that it was made knowingly and voluntarily in accord with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 711 and 712.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>On July 9,1991, Cardwell filed a second appearance with the court. At the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing on August 23, 1991, the trial court heard arguments on the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea in which he claimed that the plea was involuntary and was accepted without substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 711. The defendant maintained that he was coerced into pleading guilty by the trial court in its canvass because the trial court stressed that the defendant would have received a sentence of twenty years had he gone to trial and been convicted. The defendant argued that this coercion rendered the plea involuntary. The trial court disagreed and denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant was then sentenced to eight years in the custody of the commissioner of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit him to withdraw his guilty plea was improper (1) because the plea was accepted without substantial compliance with the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 711; see Practice Book \u00a7 721 (1); and (2) because his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made. See Practice Book \u00a7 721 (2). We find the defendant\u2019s claims to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea was improper because he had satisfied the first ground for withdrawal under Practice Book \u00a7 721. \u201cAfter a guilty plea is accepted but before the imposition of sentence the court is obligated under [Practice Book \u00a7 720] to permit withdrawal upon proof of one of the grounds in \u00a7 721.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>197 Conn. 358, 361, 497 A.2d 402 (1985). It is the defendant\u2019s burden to demonstrate a plausible reason for the withdrawal of a guilty plea. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crenshaw, </em>210 Conn 304, 309, 554 A.2d 1074 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Risk, </em>17 Conn. App. 447, 451, 553 A.2d 1145, cert. denied, 211 Conn. 802, 559 A.2d 1137, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 818, 110 S. Ct. 71, 107 L. Ed. 2d 38 (1989). The trial court determined that none of the grounds set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 721 had been established by the defendant to justify withdrawal of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u201c \u2018[0]nce entered, a guilty plea cannot be withdrawn except by leave of the court, within its sound discretion, and a denial thereof is reversible only if it appears there has been abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crenshaw, </em>supra, 308-309, quoting <em>Szarwak </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>167 Conn. 10, 23, 355 A.2d 49 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>23 Conn. App. 1, 7, 579 A.2d 560 (1990). Practice Book \u00a7 721 (1) provides that a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty may be granted if the court failed to comply substantially with Practice Book \u00a7 711. The defendant asserts that the purpose of \u00a7 711 was not satisfied when the court accepted his guilty plea because of certain statements made by the trial court during its canvass of the defendant. The defendant\u2019s claim is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">It is important to note that the defendant does not claim that the trial court failed to comply with a spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>tifie subsection of \u00a7 711. Instead, he asseverates that, contrary to the purpose underlying \u00a7 711, the trial court on three occasions indicated that the defendant would receive a sentence of twenty years if he elected to proceed to trial and was convicted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our Supreme Court has stated that the purpose underlying Practice Book \u00a7 711 is to ensure that a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is knowing and voluntary pursuant to the principles embodied in <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969). <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 418, 512 A.2d 160 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>182 Conn. 353, 356-57, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S. Ct. 1741, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981). The defendant contends that \u00a7 711 requires that he understand the range of possible sentences. This purpose was not fulfilled, according to the defendant, because the trial court\u2019s suggestion, allegedly made during the plea canvass, that there was no possibility that he would receive less than the maximum sentence if he was found guilty at trial was \u201csubtly coercive.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">It is evident from the record before us that the defendant was not misled or coerced by the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>statements. In fact, the trial court explained the full range of possible sentences facing the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the record does not support the defendant\u2019s claim that he was induced to believe that a range of sentencing was not available to him. After careful consideration of the record and the transcripts, we conclude that the defendant was not coerced, subtly or otherwise, into pleading guilty as a result of the court\u2019s statements, and that the trial court substantially complied with \u00a7 711. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The defendant next claims that his guilty plea was not made knowingly and voluntarily as is required by Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 712, 720 and 721. The defendant argues that through those same three statements; see footnote 6, supra; the trial court \u201csubtly\u201d coerced him into believing that if he did not plead guilty, he would definitely receive a twenty year sentence. Pursuant to \u00a7 721 (2), a trial court may allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea if it was not made knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u201c \u2018It is axiomatic that unless a plea of guilty is made knowingly and voluntarily, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore voidable.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Ramos, </em>supra, 3, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 119, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983). The record must dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>close that a plea of guilty was made voluntarily and intelligently. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasher, </em>190 Conn. 259, 265, 460 A.2d 970 (1983). This is necessary because a defendant who pleads guilty waives certain constitutional rights, including his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to trial by jury, and his right to confront his accusers. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>supra, 120. Because of the effect of the guilty plea, courts must ensure that defendants grasp the meaning and consequences of such a plea. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 243-44; <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u201c \u2018A determination as to whether a plea has been knowingly and voluntarily entered entails an examination of all of the relevant circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crenshaw; </em>supra, 309, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>207 Conn. 276, 287, 542 A.2d 299 (1989). Our review of the record and transcripts of the May 16, 1991 plea hearing demonstrates that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered his <em>Alford </em>plea. The court personally addressed the defendant and conducted a thorough canvass. The court displayed concern about the defendant\u2019s decision to change his plea to guilty. The defendant assured the court that the plea was not being made because Cardwell was unavailable to represent him for jury selection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The trial court repeatedly asked the defendant whether anyone was forcing him to plead guilty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ing the canvass, the defendant acknowledged that he understood the charge to which he was pleading guilty, that he understood he was waiving his constitutional rights by pleading guilty,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that he had discussed the plea with his attorney. The defendant also acknowledged that the state had enough evidence to convict him as is required under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On the basis of this canvass, the trial court found that the defendant\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">While it is true that \u201c[t]he length of time a defendant may have to spend in prison is clearly crucial to a decision of whether or not to plead guilty\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>176 Conn. 7, 9-10, 404 A.2d 871 (1978); the defendant has failed to establish that the court\u2019s statements caused him to plead guilty involuntarily or unknowingly. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s plea was knowingly and voluntarily made pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 721 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\"> The defendant actually filed a motion to vacate his plea under Practice Book \u00a7 720, the purpose of which was the same as a motion to withdraw the guilty plea.
