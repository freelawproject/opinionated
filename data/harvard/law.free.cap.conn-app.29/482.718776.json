No evidence of fraud was offered at this hearing, and the trial court made no finding of fraud. Nevertheless, the trial court opened the judgment on the basis that \u201c[i]t may be that the parties were not fully heard with respect to the issue of the amount of allocation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u201c \u2018Unless otherwise provided by law and except in such cases in which the court has continuing jurisdiction, any civil judgment . . . rendered in the superior court may not be opened . . . unless a motion to open ... is filed within four months succeeding the date on which it was rendered or passed.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a; Practice Book \u00a7 326. Unless the parties waive this time limitation, the trial court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a motion to open filed more than four months after a decision is rendered.\u201d <em>Van Mecklenburg </em>v. <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 517, 518, 494 A.2d 549 (1985). \u201cAfter the expiration of the four month period ... a judgment may not be vacated upon the sole ground that it is erroneous in matter of law, except by a court exercising appellate or revisory jurisdiction, unless such action is authorized by statute or unless the error is one going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>to the jurisdiction of the court rendering the judgment. . . . The court does have inherent authority, however, at any time to open and modify a judgment rendered without jurisdiction.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Misinonile </em>v. <em>Misinonile, </em>190 Conn. 132, 134-35, 459 A.2d 518 (1983). In addition, a judgment maybe opened after the expiration of the four month period if the judgment was obtained by fraud. <em>Kenworthy </em>v. <em>Kenworthy, </em>180 Conn. 129, 131, 429 A.2d 837 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Here, the trial court made no finding of fraud and found that it in fact had jurisdiction to grant the motion to allocate. The trial court, therefore, lacked jurisdiction to grant the motion to open the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In addition to granting the motion to open, the trial court awarded counsel fees to the plaintiff to defend this appeal. The defendant amended his appeal to challenge the propriety of this award of counsel fees but did not brief this issue. Consequently, we consider this issue to be abandoned. <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>28 Conn. App. 64, 65 n.1, 609 A.2d 1052, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 924, 614 A.2d 820 (1992); <em>Saradjian </em>v. <em>Saradjian, </em>25 Conn. App. 411, 418, 595 A.2d 890 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The award of counsel fees is affirmed. The granting of the motion to open is reversed and the matter is remanded with direction to deny the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
