He claims that the trial court improperly (1) refused to strike the entire testimony of the state\u2019s key witness pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 755 and General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) determined that the prosecutor struck the first two minority jurors for neutral reasons, and then refused to seat those two jurors when it later determined that the prosecutor engaged in purposeful discrimination, and (3) determined that the mitigating factors submitted by the defendant could not constitute a significant impairment of mental capacity pursuant to \u00a7 21a-278 (b). We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On January 6,1988, the New Haven police street crime narcotics task force conducted an undercover narcotics operation in the Hill section of New Haven. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Officer Frank Roberts, a member of the task force, was assigned to make undercover narcotics purchases from dealers on the street. Two surveillance teams were assigned as backups to Roberts, one of which included Officer Joseph Pettola.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">By approximately 12:15 p.m., Roberts had been driving around the Hill area for nearly two hours, and had already made several undercover narcotics purchases. Pettola and his partner were parked at the intersection of Sylvan Avenue and Ward Street. At that time, Roberts stopped his car at the intersection of Elliot Street and Sylvan Avenue for approximately five to seven seconds. He saw two persons begin walking up Sylvan Avenue toward his car and one of them was waving his arms at Roberts. Roberts noted at the time that both individuals were black and were wearing beige jackets. Roberts then drove around the block so as to proceed to the intersection of Sylvan Avenue and Asylum Street where he had seen the two men, which was one block away from Pettola\u2019s surveillance position.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">When Roberts reached the intersection, he saw two black men standing on the corner, and he pulled his car over to the curb next to them. The first black male approached Roberts and asked him what he wanted. Roberts replied, \u201cI will take one twenty cent piece.\u201d The first male asked, \u201cjust one?\u201d Roberts replied affirmatively to the question, and the first male then yelled and gestured to the second male to get \u201cone piece.\u201d The second male then walked down Asylum Street to a tree, reached down and retrieved a small, yellow glassine envelope from a brown paper bag. The second male then proceeded to Roberts\u2019 car with the envelope. While the second male dealt with Roberts, the first male moved away from the car and looked up and down Sylvan Avenue. Roberts handed the second male twenty dollars, took possession of the envelope, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>drove away. The entire transaction lasted no more than one minute, and Pettola and his partner witnessed the entire transaction from their vantage point.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">As Roberts drove away from the scene, he made written notes containing general descriptions of the two men, including their height, weight, clothing description, outstanding marks, age and skin color. Immediately thereafter, he radioed Pettola and gave him a description of the two men. Roberts described them as one wearing a knit hat with \u201cMercedes-Benz\u201d written on it and the other wearing a similar hat with \u201cBMW\u201d on it. Pettola and his partner remained in surveillance of the two men, who did not leave the area. After waiting long enough so as not to disclose Roberts\u2019 cover, Pettola and his partner drove up the street to the two men and exited their car. They identified themselves as police officers and asked the two men for identification. Pettola recognized one of the men as Darryl Spears, and the other man, the defendant, produced a picture identification card and stated that his name was Roy Jones. Jones gave them his social security number and his home address, 74 Asylum Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Pettola and his partner left the scene without making an arrest or retrieving the alleged bag of narcotics near the tree. Later that same day, Pettola and Roberts met at the police station, where Roberts gave the yellow envelope to Pettola, who was to have it tested to determine if it contained a narcotic substance. While at the station, Pettola conducted a search of New Haven police department records for any information about Jones and Spears. The search indicated that Jones had previously been arrested for disorderly conduct, criminal mischief and breach of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">On January 6, the same day that he gave the envelope for testing to Pettola, Roberts proceeded to dictate a police report, using his notes to refresh his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>recollection concerning the chain of events earlier in the day. When the dictation was completed, he gave it to a secretary for transcription. On January 29,1988, twenty-three days after Roberts made the dictation, the typist returned the typed report to Roberts, along with the dictation tape. The typed report indicated the heights for both Jones and Spears as \u201c6'.\u201d Roberts testified that when he read the typed report on January 29, he noticed two mistakes in it, which he had confirmed by checking his field notes from January 6. Roberts then crossed out both typewritten heights, and handwrote \u201c5'10\"\u201d as the height for Jones and \u201c5'9\"\u201d as the height for Spears. Roberts initialed both cross-outs. Roberts then signed the typed report, dating it January 6, 1988, the date he had dictated it. Roberts testified that he had dictated \u201c5'10\"\u201d and \u201c5'9\"\u201d as the heights for Jones and Spears, respectively, but that the typist must have incorrectly heard \u201c6'\u201d in both instances. Roberts also admitted that the typed report contained biographical information about Jones and Spears of which he had no knowledge at the time he wrote his field notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The defendant was arrested on February 26, 1988. Roberts testified that after the arrest he threw away his notes because the sting operation had been completed. He also testified that, pursuant to department policy, the tape was erased so that it could be used for other dictation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">At trial, the state\u2019s only witnesses were Roberts, Pettola and a toxicologist who testified that the yellow envelope contained cocaine. Upon the completion of Roberts\u2019 direct testimony, the defendant moved, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 752, for production of all statements made by Roberts concerning this incident that the state had in its possession. The state gave the defendant a copy of Roberts\u2019 typewritten police report with Roberts\u2019 handwritten changes. When the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>failed to produce either Roberts\u2019 dictation tape or his field notes from January 6, the defendant moved, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 755, to have Roberts\u2019 entire testimony stricken. After hearing argument by counsel outside the presence of the jury, the trial court determined that it would strike only the in-court identification made by Roberts. The defendant objected to this sanction. Thereafter, without withdrawing his objection to the court\u2019s failure to strike Roberts\u2019 entire testimony, the defendant requested that since the court refused to strike all of Roberts\u2019 testimony, the court should prohibit all of the other state\u2019s witnesses from making in-court identifications of Jones, and should give an adverse inference instruction when it charged the jury. The trial court ruled that it would prohibit all of the other state\u2019s witnesses from making in-court identifications of the defendant. It reserved decision, however, on the defendant\u2019s request for an adverse inference instruction until it was time to instruct the jury. Subsequently, the trial court declined to give the instruction requested by the defendant, and he was convicted as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly refused to strike Roberts\u2019 entire testimony. He claims that Practice Book \u00a7 755 and General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b require that a state\u2019s witness\u2019 entire testimony be stricken when the court determines that the state\u2019s failure to produce \u201cstatements\u201d is harmful. The state concedes that the dictation tape is a \u201cstatement\u201d for purposes of Practice Book \u00a7 749.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state argues, however, that the defendant was not harmed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>destruction and nonproduction of the tape, and thus urges our affirmance of the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Whereas the facts of this case necessitate this court\u2019s return, yet again, to the New Haven police department\u2019s policy of destruction of taped statements, we do so this time in a slightly different setting. Typically, we are presented with a case in which the trial court has found that the state satisfied its burden of proving harmlessness, and thus we must decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in making that finding. Here, however, the trial court has already determined that (1) the dictation tape contained a \u201cstatement\u201d for the purpose of Practice Book \u00a7 749 et seq., (2) that the New Haven police destroyed the tape intentionally, although not maliciously or with the intent to deprive the defendant of the evidence contained therein, and (3) that the state failed to meet its burden of proving that the destruction of the tape was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the basis of those findings, the trial court precluded the other state\u2019s witnesses from the New Haven police depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ment from making in-court identifications of the defendant, but it declined the defendant\u2019s request to give an adverse inference instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">It has been recognized that the failure to provide material to which the defendant is entitled under Practice Book \u00a7 752 et seq. \u201c \u2018may adversely affect a defendant\u2019s ability to cross-examine government witnesses and thereby infringe upon his constitutional right of confrontation.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>212 Conn. 6, 20, 562 A.2d 470 (1989). \u201cIn such a case, a court would be warranted in strictly applying the harmless error doctrine to require the state to prove harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>215 Conn. 257, 269, 576 A.2d 139 (1990). Here, although the trial court did not expressly find that the nonproduction of the tape infringed upon the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation, we believe that such a finding is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u201cIn determining the effect of the state\u2019s nonproduction on a defendant\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine, we have considered such factors as the trial or reviewing court\u2019s access to the unproduced material, the declarant\u2019s adoption of a counterpart transcript within a short time after making the statement, and the extent to which the defendant\u2019s conviction rested on the testimony of the witness whose pretrial statement had been destroyed.\u201d Id., 269-70. In this case, neither we nor the trial court had access to the unproduced material. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Roberts\u2019 adoption of a \u201ccounterpart\u201d transcript was made twenty-three days after he dictated his report, during which time he had ample opportunity to check department records for the accuracy of his report. Additionally, Roberts did not \u201cadopt\u201d the entire counterpart transcript, as evidenced by the two changes regarding the heights of the suspects he made on the typewritten report. Finally, the defendant\u2019s conviction rested largely on the testimony of Roberts, who was the only witness who testified regarding the details of the alleged drug deal, and without whose testimony the state would not be able to establish a complete chain of custody concerning the narcotics he allegedly purchased from the defendant and his partner. The trial court, therefore, properly required the state to prove that the destruction of the tape was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The state does not challenge the findings of the trial court as incorrect but appears to base its argument on the premise that the court never made these findings. It is the position of the state that the failure of the trial court to give an adverse inference charge should be interpreted as a finding that the nonproduction of the tape was harmless. A thorough examination of the record leads us to conclude that the findings were in fact made by the trial court, which conclusion is further evidenced by the fact that the trial court imposed sanctions by precluding in-court identifications of the defendant by the New Haven police officers involved in this matter. The state may not now challenge these findings of the trial court as they have failed to raise such a challenge properly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>The narrow issue with which we are presented, therefore, is whether the trial court was required, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 755 and General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b, to strike a state\u2019s witness\u2019 entire testimony when the trial court has found that the state\u2019s failure to produce \u00a7 749 pretrial statements of the particular witness harmed the defendant. \u201cThe appropriate sanctions for the state\u2019s failure to comply with discovery are set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 755. That section requires the trial court either to strike the testimony of the state\u2019s witness or \u2018upon motion of the defendant\u2019 to declare a mistrial if \u2018the interests of justice require.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>201 Conn. 244, 251, 513 A.2d 1202 (1986). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 28, the court held that because the defendant was harmed by the destruction of the statement, the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in not striking the entire testimony of the witness whose statement had been destroyed. In <em>In re Jesus C., </em>21 Conn. App. 645, 652, 575 A.2d 1031 (1990), we held that where the state failed to prove the harmlessness of the nonproduction of the statements of two particular witnesses, the trial court abused its discretion by not striking the entire testimony of those two witnesses. Here, the trial court abused its discretion by failing to strike Roberts\u2019 entire testimony after it had concluded that the destruction of the tape of Roberts\u2019 statement harmed the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We find unpersuasive the state\u2019s argument that the jury was aware of the erasure of the tape and that the defendant cross-examined Roberts at length concerning the inconsistency. The jury\u2019s awareness of the era<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>sure is irrelevant to the question of whether the defendant has been harmed, a question already decided by the trial court in the defendant\u2019s favor, and the jury\u2019s possible speculation as to the contents of the unproduced material is not entitled to any weight. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 27-28. \u201cIndeed . . . a conclusion that the defendant has not been prejudiced solely because defense counsel utilized other impeachment sources and was given wide latitude in cross-examination would penalize defendants for the best representation their counsel could provide with the available information.\u201d Id., 26. Furthermore, this argument goes to the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant was harmed by the nondisclosure of the tape, a finding that the state has failed to challenge properly on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">^ Because the trial court, having concluded that the failure to produce the tape was harmful to the defendant, was required either to strike the entire testimony of Roberts or to declare a mistrial, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to strike Roberts\u2019 entire testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The judgment of conviction is set aside and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In this opinion Foti, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 755 provides: \u201cIf the prosecuting authority elects not to comply with an order of the judicial authority to deliver to the defendant any statement of a witness who has testified or such portion thereof as the judicial authority may direct, the judicial authority shall strike from the record the testimony of the witness, and the trial shall proceed unless the judicial authority, in his discretion, upon motion of the defendant, determines that the interests of justice require that a mistrial be declared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b provides: \u201c(a) In any criminal prosecution, after a witness called by the prosecution has testified on direct examination, the court shall on motion of the defendant order the prosecution to produce any statement oral or written of the witness in the possession of the prosecution which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified, and the court shall order said statement to be delivered directly to the defendant for his examination and use.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u201c(b) If the prosecution fails to comply with the order of the court, the court shall strike from the record the testimony of the witness and the trial shall proceed unless the court in its discretion shall determine that the interests of justice require that a mistrial be declared.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\"> Because we agree with the defendant on his first issue, we need not address the defendant\u2019s other appellate issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 749 provides: \u201cThe term \u2018statement\u2019 . . . means: \u201c(1) A written statement made by a person and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him; or</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u201c(2) A stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by a person and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\"> The trial court stated, in this regard: \u201cThe reason credibility of this particular witness is so important . . . is because he is the only one that heard the alleged conversation. There is no other testimony. I didn\u2019t hear anything about him being wired or anybody else. So his credibility is of utmost importance. To deprive the defendant of the opportunity to severely test his credibility in an easily identifiable method of cross-examination leads me to the conclusion that <em>I cannot make a finding that this destruction is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. </em>I can\u2019t say it is harmless because it does not just reflect on identification. It reflects on credibility. [The defendant\u2019s] contention is that . . . he is entitled to explore the possibility that this police officer changed the report after he knew the measured heights of these two individuals to bolster his credibility. It is apparent to me that would be a temptation. I am not saying that the police officer succumbed to it because I don\u2019t have to make a determination in that regard, but clearly it is something that counsel is entitled to explore and cannot now explore because the tape and the notes do not exist. That\u2019s just restating why I believe that I can\u2019t find that the destruction of this tape and notes is harmless, and the court, I believe, it is a difficult decision to apply, but the court seems to acknowledge that when material is destroyed and I can\u2019t see it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>and the Appellate Court can\u2019t see it, it just makes the decision all the more harder; the finding of harmless beyond a reasonable doubt all the more harder or difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">\u201cThis is not the end of the state\u2019s case. I am only going to strike that portion of the officer\u2019s testimony that relates to identification. The other portions of the testimony are not tainted.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>212 Conn. 6, 562 A.2d 470 (1989), for a discussion of the necessary findings to be made by a trial court, as well as the appropriate burden of proof to be imposed on the proper party, when considering a motion to strike pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 755.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b334-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a) (1) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf any appellee wishes to (A) present for review alternate grounds upon which the judgment may be affirmed . . . that appellee shall file a preliminary statement of issues within fourteen days from the filing of the appellant\u2019s preliminary statement of the issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The state\u2019s claim also does not warrant plain error review.

While I agree with the judgment reversing the conviction and ordering a new trial, I do not agree with the legal analysis or legal conclusions contained in the majority\u2019s opinion. Because I would reverse on different grounds, I write separately to express my departure from the reasoning of the court and my reasons therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">In my opinion, a new trial is required not because Officer Frank Roberts\u2019 testimony should have been stricken, but because the trial court failed to grant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>defendant an appropriate remedy after determining that the prosecutor had engaged in purposeful racial discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges in violation of <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">At the outset, I note that the majority\u2019s analysis rests on the trial court\u2019s application of an improper burden of proof under the harmless error inquiry our Supreme Court requires in the context of violations of Practice Book \u00a7 752. Because the majority fails to recognize this error, it unnecessarily reaches the question of whether all or part of Roberts\u2019 testimony should have been stricken.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In my view, application of the proper bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>den of proof results in a finding that the tape\u2019s destruction was harmless. The judgment should be reversed, however, on the ground of the trial court\u2019s failure to grant an appropriate remedy for the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct in the exercise of peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Destruction of Tape Recording</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">At trial, the court found that the tape was a \u201cstatement\u201d within the meaning of Practice Book \u00a7 749 et seq. and that it was not destroyed in \u201cbad faith\u201d as that term is defined in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>212 Conn. 6, 562 A.2d 470 (1989).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Having found that the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>did not disclose the tape to the defendant, the court then failed to hold the state to the proper burden of proof in determining whether the defendant was prejudiced by nonproduction of the tape. The court held the state to the standard of proving harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. In my view, the state should have been required to prove lack of prejudice under the more probable than not standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">REVIEWABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">As a threshold matter, it should be noted that although the state objected to the trial court\u2019s finding of harmfulness, it has not challenged that decision on appeal. Nevertheless, this court may exercise its discretion and notice plain error.

Our Supreme Court has said that when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>defendant\u2019s ability to cross-examine is at issue, \u201cwe have considered such factors as the trial or reviewing court\u2019s access to the unproduced material, the declarant\u2019s adoption of a counterpart transcript within a short time after making the statement, and the extent to which the defendant\u2019s conviction rested on the testimony of the witness whose pretrial statement had been destroyed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>supra, 269-70; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 173-74.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, where the court found that it would not have been improper to apply the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra; the court \u201crelied on several factors that indicated that Williamson\u2019s opportunity to impeach the state\u2019s witness was so impaired that the nonprod\u00faction of that witness\u2019 pretrial statement violated [the defendant\u2019s] constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him: \u2018This is not a case in which either the trial court or a reviewing court has access to the unproduced material. . . . Further . . . this is not a case in which the declarant read and adopted a counterpart transcript within a short time after making the statement. . . . Moreover, the defendant\u2019s convicti\u00f3n obviously rested on [the testimony of the witness whose pretrial statement had been destroyed].\u2019 \u201d Id., 174, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 22-23; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>supra, 269-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">By contrast, the court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 175, and in <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>supra, 271, determined that the more probable than not standard was appropriate. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>the witness read and signed a transcription made from the destroyed tape three days after giving the statement, and the defendant\u2019s conviction was not based solely on that witness\u2019 testimony but on circumstantial evidence from other witnesses as well. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 174. Similarly, in <em>Belle, </em>both witnesses reviewed and signed transcriptions of their taped statements shortly after giving them, and the defendant\u2019s conviction also did not rest solely on their testimony but on circumstantial evidence from another source. <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>supra, 270-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In this case, careful review of the record discloses that the court failed to apply properly the criteria used in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 22-23.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although it stated that it did not have access to the tape, the trial court failed to consider that Roberts adopted the transcription a short time after the crime.

Although neither the trial court nor this court has had access to the destroyed tape, Roberts adopted the transcript a mere twenty-three days after receiving it from the typist.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As in <em>Belle </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>both adoptions occurred a short time after the crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>supra, 272 (transcripts reviewed and adopted a short time after taped statements given); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 176 (transcript reviewed three days after taped statement given); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>205 Conn. 578, 589, 534 A.2d 1175 (1987) (typed transcript signed five days after tape-recorded statement); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 10-11 (fact that transcript of tape not reviewed by witness until seven months after alleged crime significant in determining that state had not proven harmlessness).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Further, as <em>in Belle </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>the defendant\u2019s conviction was not based solely on Roberts\u2019 testimony. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>also was based on the testimony of officer Pettola and was integrally dependent on the state toxicologist\u2019s testimony. Both provided direct and circumstantial evidence, consistent with Roberts\u2019 testimony, that linked the cocaine and the defendant to the crime. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 174; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 23 (defendant\u2019s conviction rested solely on testimony of witness whose statement was destroyed). Under these circumstances, it is clear that the majority\u2019s analysis makes \u201ca constitutional mountain out of [a] . . . molehill.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>215 Conn. 1, 11, 574 A.2d 188 (1990). The state\u2019s failure to produce the tape did not rise to the level of a denial of the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation. Accordingly, I would find that the trial court improperly required the state to prove harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt when it should have required proof under the more probable than not standard. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>supra, 271; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 175; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>23 Conn. App. 28, 40, 579 A.2d 1083, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 829, 582 A.2d 207 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">APPLICATION OF BALANCING TEST TO DETERMINE HARMFULNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In applying the balancing test set forth previously, we must weigh the state\u2019s culpability for the tape\u2019s destruction against the prejudice suffered by the defendant to determine whether the trial court should have applied the sanction of striking Roberts\u2019 testimony as mandated by Practice Book \u00a7 755. Roberts destroyed the tape deliberately, though not in bad faith. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 16. Turning to the question of prejudice, \u201c[wjhere there are critical inconsistencies between trial testimony and prior statements ... a defendant may be prejudiced by the absence of the tape recording. . . . Where all indications are, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>that the witness has given consistent statements, we have been reluctant to find that the defendant suffered prejudice.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 175-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In this case, I would find that the defendant was not prejudiced by the tape\u2019s destruction. This conclusion is buttressed by several undisputed facts the significance of which the majority ignores. First, Roberts dictated the tape using his written notes only hours after encountering the defendant at the intersection of Sylvan Avenue and Asylum Street. Second, the tape was not in his possession during the twenty-three days it took to have the transcript typed. Third, when he received the transcription, he made only two minor handwritten changes, which he initialed for all to see. Thus, it follows that because Roberts could not have altered the tape\u2019s contents, the transcript cannot be anything other than a highly reliable, \u201csubstantially verbatim recital\u201d of what he dictated. Practice Book \u00a7 749 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Although the majority\u2019s approach leads it to seize on the twenty-three day gap, this is irrelevant to the defendant\u2019s ability to test effectively Roberts\u2019 credibility without the tape. The majority contends that in those twenty-three days, Roberts could have gone to the police records room to check the accuracy of his report. Even if he had done so, this would say nothing about his inability to alter the tape, which was not in his possession during those twenty-three days. Further, had the officer truly been eager to \u201cclean up\u201d his report, it would have made more sense to have the two page transcription retyped than for Roberts to make handwritten, initialed changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In addition, several other factors mitigate strongly against any prejudice to the defendant. First, the defendant was provided with a transcription, which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>as noted above, was a highly reliable, substantially verbatim account of what Roberts dictated. Second, the defendant used that transcription to cross-examine Roberts and failed to disclose any critical inconsistencies between his trial testimony and the transcribed statement. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 25 (several critical inconsistencies between witness\u2019 transcribed statement and witness\u2019 recollection of what she told police). Third, although Roberts\u2019 testimony was important to the state, the majority\u2019s assertion that the defendant\u2019s conviction \u201crested largely\u201d on that testimony is hyperbole.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">When other testimony corroborates that of the witness who destroyed a statement, our Supreme Court has found it improper to impose a sanction pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 755. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Milum, </em>197 Conn. 602, 618, 500 A.2d 555 (1985). Here, the majority completely ignores that Pettola\u2019s testimony corroborated that of Roberts. Pettola testified that he witnessed the incident at Sylvan Avenue and Asylum Street, and that \u201cseconds\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> after Roberts drove away, Roberts radioed to him descriptions of the defendant and Spears. Pettola farther testified that he then drove to the scene, spoke with the defendant and Spears, both of whom identified themselves by name, and noticed that they matched the descriptions. Thus, Pettola corroborated Roberts\u2019 testimony in all important respects. Further, the majority gives short shrift to the toxicologist\u2019s testimony identifying as cocaine the substance the defendant sold to Roberts. This simply is not a case where \u201c 'the appellant\u2019s conviction rests heavily on the credibility of a single [witness].\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 21, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>848 F.2d 1464, 1471 (9th Cir. 1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>20 Conn. App. 586, 593, 569 A.2d 551 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>In sum, since Roberts could not have altered the tape during the twenty-three day interval, the transcript constitutes a substantially verbatim recital of the tape\u2019s contents. In dictating the tape, Roberts relied on his written notes, which he made only hours earlier. He adopted the transcription of the tape a short time after the incident in question, finding only two minor inaccuracies that he corrected and initialed in his own handwriting for all to see. Moreover, two other witnesses provided direct and circumstantial evidence that was consistent with Roberts\u2019 testimony and report. It strains credulity to believe that preservation of the tape for cross-examination purposes would have \u201c \u2018tipped the balance of persuasion in [the defendant\u2019s] favor.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 21, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>supra, 1472; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">I, too, appreciate the importance of protecting an accused\u2019s ability to conduct effective cross-examination, \u201cthe principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony\u201d are measured. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>206 Conn. 512, 524, 539 A.2d 80 (1988). Nevertheless, the majority finds harm where none exists. Although the seemingly intractable behavior of the New Haven police department with respect to witness\u2019 statements<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is deeply dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>turbing, not every violation of Practice Book \u00a7 752 merits a sanction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 13. Such is the case here because, under the circumstances, destruction of the tape was harmless, and the result of the trial would not have been different had it been preserved. <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>supra, 268. For these reasons, I would find that the trial court\u2019s rulings with respect to the destruction of the tape do not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Racial Discrimination in Jury Selection</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In my view, then, the dispositive issue is whether the trial court granted the defendant an appropriate remedy after finding that the prosecutor\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge against a black veniremember was based on purposeful racial discrimination. Because I believe that the court failed to remedy adequately the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, I would reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction and remand this case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s rulings on a prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges, we must examine the factual record of the jury selection process. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Conn. 1, 12-15, 608 A.2d 63 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>206 Conn. 391, 393, 538 A.2d 210 (1988). Here, the defendant is black. Jury selection took place over four days, with a new venire of fifteen members being summoned each day. In all, there were sixty people in the jury pool, including five blacks and two Hispanics. The state and the defendant each were allowed six peremptory challenges. The defendant used all six of his challenges to excuse white veniremembers; the state used three against the blacks, two against the Hispanics and one against a white.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>On the first day, ten members of the venire, including three blacks, were voir dired. The parties selected one juror that day, a white woman. The only peremptory challenges the prosecutor employed were used to excuse the three blacks.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court determined that the first two were excused for nonracial reasons, but that the prosecutor had engaged in purposeful racial discrimination in striking the third. As a remedy for the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, the court seated the third black veniremember and granted the defendant four additional peremptory challenges. Subsequently, the defendant was convicted by a jury of six.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The only minority juror was the black veniremember whom the court seated.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">On appeal, the defendant maintains that he was deprived of a fair trial, in violation of rights guaranteed to him by the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, and by article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 8,19 and 20, of the Connecticut constitution, because of purposeful racial discrimination in the selection of the petit jury that convicted him.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant argues that when the court determined that the prosecutor had engaged in purposeful racial discrimination in striking the third black <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>veniremember, it should have reviewed the first two peremptory challenges, found the reasons for them to be pretextual, and then recalled and seated the first two black veniremembers.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Because the defendant\u2019s claim raises heretofore undecided issues concerning a matter of \u201cvital importance to our real and perceived adherence to the rule of law\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 645-46, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 10-11; it is important first to review the procedures by which a court determines if there has been purposeful racial discrimination in a prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATING USE OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">A defendant who challenges the state\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it was based on purposeful racial discrimination. <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 94 n.18, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986). Under <em>Batson, </em>once the defendant establishes a prima facie case of purposeful racial discrimination,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the state then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>must advance a neutral explanation for the peremptory strike. Id., 97. The defendant then has the opportunity to show that the state\u2019s articulated reasons are insufficient or pretextual. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 11; <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, the Connecticut Supreme Court departed from <em>Batson, </em>ruling that the accused need not first make out a prima facie case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court determined that once a defendant asserts a <em>Batson </em>claim, the prosecutor should then provide \u201ca prima facie case response consistent with the explanatory mandate of <em>Batson.\u201d </em>Id., 645-46. This requires the prosecutor to give a neutral \u201cclean and reasonably specific\u201d explanation that relates to the particular case to be tried. <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 98 n.20. The explanation \u201cneed not rise to the level justifying exercise of a challenge for cause.\u201d Id., 97. After the state presents its reasons, the defendant has the opportunity to show that they are insufficient or pretextual. <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">To satisfy his burden of showing purposeful discrimination, \u201cthe defendant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that, but for the prosecutor\u2019s invidious purpose, the juror would not have been challenged. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>. . . The defendant need not show that the peremptory challenge of every juror of the defendant\u2019s race was due to an impermissible motive; rather, under <em>Bat-son, </em>the striking of even one juror on the basis of race violates the equal protection clause, even when other jurors of the defendant\u2019s race were seated and even when valid reasons for the striking of some of the jurors of the defendant\u2019s race were shown.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 399-400.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Recently, the United States Supreme Court clarified how an appellate court must scrutinize a trial court\u2019s implementation of <em>Batson. Bee Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>500 U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1991). A prosecutor\u2019s explanation for his actions is to be reviewed as a legal issue;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> id., 1866; and the court\u2019s ultimate factual ruling on whether he intentionally discriminated is subject only to clear error review. Id., 1868-69. This accords with the Connecticut Supreme Court\u2019s view that on appellate review, a trial court\u2019s determination as to whether there has been intentional discrimination is afforded \u201c \u2018appropriate deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 641. Although the Connecticut Supreme Court has not yet had occasion to articulate what constitutes \u201cappropriate deference\u201d in a <em>Batson </em>context, it has indicated that the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> is appropriate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on the ultimate question of whether a prosecutor has acted with forbidden intent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 644-45 (trial court\u2019s ruling that defendant failed to establish racial animus in prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenge \u201cnot erroneous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">EXPLANATION REQUIREMENT AND PRETEXT INQUIRY</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">As mentioned, the legal issue on which a reviewing court focuses is whether the prosecutor\u2019s proffered neutral explanation is violative of the equal protection clause as a matter of law. A neutral explanation \u201cmeans an explanation based on something other than the race of the juror. At this step of the inquiry, the issue is the <em>facial validity </em>of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 1866. If this reason, however, is \u201cwithout regard to the particular circumstances of the trial or the individual responses of the jurors, [it] may be found by the trial judge to be a pretext for racial discrimination.\u201d Id., 1873. Thus, <em>Hernandez </em>requires a nexus between the prosecutor\u2019s challenge to the characteristic of the prospective juror and that juror\u2019s possible approach to the trial at hand. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>959 F.2d 820, 825 (9th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Here, because the prosecutor\u2019s proffered reasons for striking the first two black veniremembers were race <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>neutral on their faces, the issue is whether the defendant has shown that the reasons were pretextual, and whether he has met his burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the prosecutor engaged in purposeful racial discrimination with respect to those venir emembers.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Although neither <em>Batson </em>nor <em>Hernandez </em>spells out specific criteria a defendant may use to establish pretext, the court in <em>Hernandez </em>stated that disparate impact, although not conclusive in the race neutrality step of the <em>Batson </em>inquiry, \u201cshould be given appropriate weight in determining whether the prosecutor acted with a forbidden intent.\u201d <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 1867. \u201cIf a prosecutor articulates a basis for a peremptory challenge that results in the disproportionate exclusion of members of a certain race, the trial judge may consider that fact as evidence that the prosecutor\u2019s stated reason constitutes a pretext for racial discrimination.\u201d Id., 1868. Additionally, the court recognized that at this stage of the inquiry, \u201c \u2018invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>426 U.S. 229, 242, 96 S. Ct. 2040, 48 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Our Supreme Court, however, has discussed some of the types of evidence that might help unmask pretext. These include whether the prosecutor\u2019s reasons are related to the case or are based on a group bias inapplicable to the prospective juror; whether the prosecutor questioned the juror, did so only perfunctorily, or asked questions not asked of other jurors so as to elicit a particular response; whether jurors of different races but similar characteristics were treated differently; and whether a disproportionate number of peremptory challenges were used to strike from the veniremembers of one particular race. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Because the court has recognized that these examples \u201care by no means exhaustive\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra; other factors may be considered in evaluating whether peremptory challenges have been used in a discriminatory manner. <em>Ex Parte Branch, </em>526 So. 2d 609, 625 (Ala. 1987). One such factor is whether there has been disparate treatment of veniremembers who answer a question in the same or similar manner. Id., 623; <em>Slappy </em>v. <em>State, </em>503 So. 2d 350, 352 (Fla. App. 1987). Although this criteria has been applied in situations involving members of different races, it is no less applicable when multiple minority veniremembers who are challenged give the same or very similar answers to the same inquiry, and only some are challenged on the basis of their responses. Selective and inconsistent reasoning in the use of peremptory challenges against members of the same race or ethnic background, in my view, can raise an inference of purposeful discrimination. A prosecutor\u2019s questions and statements during voir dire also can be indicative of pretext; <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 96-97; <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 642; especially when the voir dire lacks any meaningful questions designed to ascertain whether the prosecutor\u2019s assumptions about the veniremember are correct. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>State, </em>775 S.W.2d 13, 15 (Tex. App. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Similarly, an inference of purposeful discrimination is raised when the prosecutor uses all or most of his peremptory challenges to remove blacks; <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 93; <em>Ex Parte Branch, </em>supra; or when peremptory challenges are used to dismiss all or most of the black veniremembers. Id.; <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>42 Cal. 3d 711, 724-26, 726 P.2d 102, 230 Cal. Rptr. 656 (1986); <em>Slappy </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 354. Statistical analysis of the percentage of the minority membership on the sworn jury as compared with the percentage of minority members in the jury pool also can be indica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>tive of pretextual explanations for peremptory challenges. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peete, </em>919 F.2d 1168, 1179 (6th Cir. 1990); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sangineto-Miranda, </em>859 F.2d 1501, 1521-22 (6th Cir. 1988). Finally, the most basic element in any determination of whether there was purposeful discrimination is the voir dire proceedings themselves. \u201cFrequently, the most probative evidence of intent will be objective evidence of what actually happened . . . <em>Washington v. Davis, supra, </em>253 (Stevens, J., concurring). It is against this precedential backdrop that we now turn to the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges of the black veniremembers.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">prosecutor\u2019s use op peremptory challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Veniremember Simmons</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">At trial, the prosecutor used his first peremptory challenge to strike Marion Simmons, a black woman who was the third veniremember to appear for voir dire. When questioned by the defendant, Simmons stated that she had been the victim of a crime four years earlier. A man, who was never apprehended, stole her pocketbook or other personal belongings near the train station in downtown New Haven. Had the police responded faster, Simmons said, they could have apprehended the perpetrator. She said her feelings would not affect her evaluation of the police officers\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Under questioning by the prosecutor, Simmons stated that she had seven brothers and sisters with whom she stayed in contact \u201c[sjometimes. We try to stay in touch.\u201d She said a younger brother had been in trouble with the law in New Haven about three years earlier, although she was unsure what charges he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>have faced. She said he had sold drugs and had been a substance abuser, but that he was now employed in the Job Corps in Boston. Simmons also stated that she knew other people who use drugs and alcohol. When asked if she thought those accused of narcotics crimes should be vigorously prosecuted, she said: \u201cWell, in my opinion, I feel if it\u2019s going to help the person \u2014 if this person is going to be put in a situation where they\u2019re going to rehabilitate themselves, but not if they\u2019re not going to keep . . . going in and out of the court system. They\u2019re going to be charged and then they\u2019re going to be back here and charged and back here again. Then in my opinion, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helping the situation at all. And to my brother that \u2014 the one that\u2019s in Boston now ... he was a \u2014 I think he sold drugs before and he was a substance abuser, but it shows a change can be made. So you know, you really can\u2019t\u2014 I \u2014 I really can\u2019t base it on that.\u201d Simmons then reiterated that her dissatisfaction over the police response would not affect her evaluation of police testimony. She further stated that she could return a guilty verdict if the state proved its case and she thought the defendant would be incarcerated rather than rehabilitated.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The prosecutor then exercised his first peremptory challenge to excuse her.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Yeniremembers Murphy and Connor</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The second black veniremember was Warren Murphy, the eighth <em>member </em>of the venire to be questioned. When the defendant asked if Murphy had any strong personal opinions about drug use, he responded, \u201cNo, not really. I figure an individual is going to do what he\u2019s going to do so, you know, I keep to myself, really.\u201d When the court stated, \u201cMeaning someone else\u2019s business is their business,\u201d Murphy replied, \u201cYes. Yes.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the defendant asked Murphy if he is \u201cthe kind of person that would stand by [his] own opinion even if [he was] in the minority\u201d during jury deliberations. Murphy replied, \u201cYeah, quite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">During voir dire by the prosecutor, Murphy disclosed that his brother was a deputy sheriff, and his stepfather was a retired police officer who had advised him to stay out of trouble. When asked about his views on drug use, Murphy replied, \u201c[Y]ou can\u2019t tell [people] what to do because they\u2019re going to do what they want, you know, regardless. So, I just kind of mind my business and keep to myself, you know.\u201d He also stated his belief that people should be arrested and vigorously prosecuted for drug offenses, and punished if found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>When inquiring about the state\u2019s burden of proof, the prosecutor asked Murphy several lengthy and complex questions about whether he would hold the state to proving guilt \u201cbeyond all doubt\u201d or \u201cbeyond a shadow of a doubt.\u201d When Murphy replied affirmatively, the court cautioned the prosecutor about the use of these terms and advised that he define them. The prosecutor then told Murphy that proof beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cdoes not mean beyond all doubt,\u201d and that \u201cyou can actually find someone guilty if you\u2019re not absolutely certain that they\u2019re guilty.\u201d This prompted the court to tell the prosecutor, \u201cYou\u2019re on a slippery slope there, counselor.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the prosecutor twice more asked Murphy if the state should have to prove guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt or beyond all doubt. The court then interjected and explained to Murphy in layman\u2019s terms the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, after which Murphy twice stated that he would apply that standard of proof.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>After the prosecutor used his second peremptory-challenge to strike Murphy, the court granted the defendant\u2019s request for explanations as to why Murphy and Simmons were stricken. The prosecutor stated that Murphy had a problem understanding the state\u2019s burden of proof, and that because his attitude toward drug use was that \u201cit\u2019s somebody else\u2019s business or somebody else\u2019s problem,\u201d he would not be inclined \u201cto take an active stand\u201d in jury deliberations since he is \u201ckind of a loner [who] would stay out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Regarding Simmons, the prosecutor expressed concern about how she would evaluate police testimony and her attitude toward drug offenses. He focused on her feelings about the failure of the police to respond more quickly when she was robbed, stating that Simmons had \u201csaid something to the effect that she could have been treated a little bit more justly.\u201d The prosecutor also stated that Simmons\u2019 statements about rehabilitating criminals reflected a perception that the judicial system is merely \u201ca revolving door.\u201d Further, he characterized her attitude toward drug crimes as \u201ca bit cavalier\u201d and noted that when he asked about her brother, who he believed had been arrested a few years earlier by the New Haven police,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> he was bothered that Simmons \u201cdidn\u2019t really display any overt concern\u201d about drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In its ruling, the court declined to find that the peremptory challenges against Simmons and Murphy were based on purposeful racial discrimination. The court stated that \u201cneither one of [them] on the face of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>it were unacceptable, but that\u2019s not the test, my own personal opinion is not the test here. The test involves the credibility of [the prosecutor].\u201d The court also stated that \u201cmy findings with regard to these two jurors are subject to review . . . possibly throughout the case. And let me say that although I find nonracial reasons for the excusal of these two jurors . . . I think it\u2019s a very close call, a rather extremely close call. . . . If I see a pattern here, the panel is going to be dismissed, or [the defendant] is going to be granted additional challenges here or some other appropriate action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Shortly thereafter, the tenth person to appear for questioning was Thomas Connor, the third black veniremember. When presented by the defendant and the court with examples involving application of the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, Connor exhibited hesitancy and confusion. Regarding drugs, he testified that he knew people who had been involved with them, adding, \u201cIlet them live their own life. . . . I let them go their own way.\u201d He stated that while he does not want to be involved with people who sell drugs, he does not try to avoid all contact with them \u201c[b]ecause if you did that, you might as well stay in the house because everywhere you go, you got people that do it.\u201d Con-nor also testified that despite the ubiquitous nature of drug abuse, narcotics trafficking is wrong and those engaged in it should be incarcerated. After using his third peremptory challenge to strike Connor, the prosecutor explained that Connor \u201chad a cavalier attitude towards the drug problem.\u201d The court then ruled that Connor had been stricken on the basis of race.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>3</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Review of Prosecutor\u2019s Reasons for Challenging Veniremember Simmons</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Although the prosecutor felt Simmons might be unable to evaluate fairly police testimony, his reasons were speculative and unconvincing, thus permitting an inference of pretext. The prosecutor explained that when he asked about narcotics offenses, Simmons \u201cdidn\u2019t really display any overt concern.\u201d A veniremember\u2019s failure to react emotionally to voir dire questions, however, is not a reasonably clear and specific explanation for striking her from the jury. <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>State, </em>511 So. 2d 762, 764 (Fla. App. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Similarly, the prosecutor\u2019s questions and statements during voir dire were brief and perfunctory. <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 398. They lacked any meaningful inquiry designed to ascertain whether his assumptions about her were correct. See Lewis v. <em>State, </em>supra. Mere intuitive judgment or suspicion by a prosecutor is insufficient to rebut a presumption of discrimination. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra. When the prosecutor\u2019s reasons are not supported by the voir dire record, they maybe seen as speculation. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>548 So. 2d 501, 506 (Ala. Crim. App. 1988). In this case, the failure of the voir dire testimony to support the prosecutor\u2019s assumptions about an alleged lack of concern over drug offenses is evidence pointing toward a finding that his proffered explanation constitutes a cloak for racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">With respect to Simmons\u2019 brief encounter with the New Haven police four years earlier, while it might be true that prosecutors commonly seek to avoid seating jurors who have had negative experiences with the police; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 14; this does not translate into a carte blanche right to strike jurors based on <em>any </em>kind of unpleasant experience with the authorities. In <em>Smith, </em>where the prospective juror had an arrest record, our Supreme Court upheld the peremptory challenge. Id., 14-15. In this case, however, Simmons not only had no arrest record, but she had been the victim of a crime herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Contrary to the state\u2019s claims, it is more plausible to believe that she might have been sympathetic to the state as a result of her experience, since the state was the party seeking to combat the spread of drugs so as to prevent the victimization of innocent people such as Simmons. See, e.g., <em>McCray </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>750 F.2d 1113, 1133 (2d Cir. 1984), vacated and remanded, 478 U.S. 1001, 106 S. Ct. 3289, 92 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1986) (being a crime victim is \u201can experience that one might think would make [a veniremember] identify more with a complaining witness than with a defendant\u201d). More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>over, during voir dire, Simmons told both the defendant and the prosecutor in no uncertain terms that her experience with the authorities would not affect her ability fairly to evaluate police testimony. Given that nothing to the contrary exists in Simmons\u2019 voir dire testimony, the prosecutor\u2019s concern about her experience with the police constitutes speculation and thus further indicia of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Similarly, the record also fails to support the prosecutor\u2019s explanation relating to the legal entanglements of Simmons\u2019 brother. Although federal courts have found that a prosecutor does not engage in purposeful discrimination when he peremptorily strikes a veniremember whose relative has been incarcerated; see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>941 F.2d 1102, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>914 F.2d 1050, 1052 (8th Cir. 1990); or who is \u201cin trouble with the law\u201d at the time of voir dire; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>816 F.2d 1006, 1009-10 (5th Cir. 1987); the situation here is quite different.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Contrary to the prosecutor\u2019s belief, no evidence existed that Simmons\u2019 brother had been arrested or incarcerated. Simmons only said that he had been \u201cin trouble with the law\u201d and that she was \u201cnot really sure\u201d what charges he may have faced. She also said that she was not extremely close to her siblings, with whom she stayed in contact only \u201csometimes.\u201d Moreover, Simmons said her brother\u2019s troubles occurred <em>three years ago, </em>that he no longer uses drugs and that he now is in the Job Corps in Boston. Given the changed circumstances and the fact that her brother\u2019s difficulties occurred long before Simmons\u2019 voir dire, the prosecutor\u2019s concern about her brother also amounts to no more than speculation wholly unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Finally, I fail completely to see what connection the prosecutor divined between Simmons\u2019 statement about the rehabilitation of criminals and the possible lack of fitness to serve as a juror at the defendant\u2019s trial. Rehabilitation and reformation of criminals have long been recognized goals of the penological system. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 248, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed 1337 (1949); <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>200 Conn. 453, 463, 512 A.2d 183 (1986). Simmons\u2019 voir dire testimony indicated no more than an awareness of the rampant recidivism among convicted criminals and the profound difficulties it poses for the criminal justice system and society at large. Just as the mere fact that a prospective juror\u2019s residence in a high crime area does not necessarily mean the juror will be less interested in law enforcement; <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>493 U.S. 945, 947, 110 S. Ct. 351, 107 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1989) (Marshall, J., dissenting from the denial of certiorari); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>supra; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 506; it also does not necessarily follow that one who exhibits awareness of the need to rehabilitate criminals has a \u201ccavalier\u201d attitude about drug offenses and thus will be unable fairly to determine the guilt or innocence of one accused of such an offense. Indeed, unless \u201ca defendant is . . . serving a criminal sentence there is no rehabilitation process\u201d with which to be concerned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>14 Conn. App. 244, 249, 540 A.2d 395 (1988). Here, the prosecutor failed to demonstrate any nexus between Simmons\u2019 views about rehabilitation and her possible approach to the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In my view, Simmons\u2019 responses reflect the kind of fair minded, intelligent, introspective thinking any attorney would want devoted to the merits of a case. Nothing in the record indicates she was incapable of impartially evaluating the testimony of police officers and, if warranted, returning a verdict of guilty. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the prosecutor\u2019s explanation for challenging her is unsupported by the \u201cobjective evidence of what actually happened\u201d; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 253 (Stevens, J., concurring); I would find that his reasons were insufficient, based on mere intuition and speculation, and thus a pretext for purposeful racial discrimination as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Review of Prosecutor\u2019s Reasons for Challenging Veniremember Murphy</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s reasons for excluding veniremember Murphy are no less tainted. The prosecutor expressed concern about Murphy\u2019s under standing of the state\u2019s burden of proof and claimed he would be unlikely \u201cto take an active stand\u201d in jury deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">It is unquestioned that a prosecutor has a legitimate interest in seating jurors who will adhere to the governing burden of proof. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Conn. 1, 12, 608 A.2d 63 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 404-405. In both <em>Smith </em>and <em>Gonzalez, </em>peremptory challenges were deemed proper because the veniremembers were indecisive or equivocal in their commitment to applying the proper standard of proof. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 404; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Tappin, </em>20 Conn. App. 241, 249, 566 A.2d 709 (1989) (peremptory challenge proper in part because veniremember equivocated about whether drug use was a societal problem). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 12, for example, the veniremember said regarding the state\u2019s burden of proof, \u201c T think I am understanding that. I am trying to.\u2019 \u201d After the prosecutor explained the concept for the third time, the veniremember responded, \u201c T am not sure I understand.\u2019 \u201d Id. The Supreme Court found that a peremptory strike against the prospective juror was proper because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u201cexpressed equivocation about the applicable quantum of proof, <em>even after receiving further clarification of that standard. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Here, no such equivocation occurred. Unlike the veniremember in <em>Smith, </em>Murphy readily stated that he would apply the proper standard after hearing it explained in language comprehensible to a layman. He did so first when the defendant explained clearly and concisely the proper burden of proof in simple layman\u2019s terms. He was again firm in his commitment to applying the proper measure of proof when the court itself explained and clarified the standard in layman\u2019s language.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The record clearly shows that any misunderstanding on Murphy\u2019s part stemmed from the differing, unexplained terms and standards contained in the prosecutor\u2019s often lengthy and complex questions about the proper burden of proof. Twice, the court cautioned the prosecutor about the content of his inquiries. After the prosecutor asked if Murphy would expect the state to \u201cprove guilt beyond all doubt, beyond a shadow of a doubt,\u201d the court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going with that question because none of those terms are defined. I mean, you throw in there that it might be a higher burden, but you\u2019ve got to expand on that.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the prosecutor told Murphy that guilty beyond a reasonable doubt means that \u201cyou can actually find someone guilty if you\u2019re not absolutely certain that they\u2019re guilty.\u201d This prompted the court to state, \u201cYou\u2019re on a slippery slope there, counselor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">A prosecutor who confuses a veniremember with complex questions involving legal concepts should not be heard to complain about the prospective juror\u2019s lack of understanding. \u201c[Jjurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of life, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>which are relatively easily understood by lawyers and judges.\u201d <em>McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>464 U.S. 548, 555, 104 S. Ct. 845, 78 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1984). After scrupulous review of the voir dire transcript, I find no support for the prosecutor\u2019s explanation that Murphy was unable to understand the state\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Similarly, the record does not support the prosecution\u2019s explanation that Murphy would be disinclined to participate actively in jury deliberations because of an allegedly laissez faire attitude toward drug abuse. Murphy clearly and unequivocally stated his belief that drug offenses should be vigorously prosecuted. He forcefully declared that he would voice his opinion in deliberations and stand by it even if he were in the minority. Further, Murphy disclosed that he had relatives and a friend who were involved in law enforcement, and that he had been advised to stay out of trouble with the authorities. Ordinarily, veniremembers with law enforcement ties in their backgrounds are more preferable as jurors to the state than they are to defendants. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Radi, </em>578 P.2d 1169, 1175 (Mont. 1978) (noting \u201cthe natural inclinations of [a prospective juror] whose life is committed to law enforcement\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>124 N.J. 559, 565, 592 A.2d 194 (1991) (criminal defendants unlikely to want member of law enforcement community on jury). Although this is not necessarily true, in combination with Murphy\u2019s direct and forceful answers, it serves to undercut the prosecutor\u2019s explanation and points toward pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In light of Murphy\u2019s testimony, it was pretextual for the prosecutor to strike him based on speculation that he is \u201ckind of ... a loner\u201d who would not \u201ctake an active stand\u201d in jury deliberations and enforce the law because of his personal reluctance to intervene in the daily course of human events. Although Murphy\u2019s atti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>tude, like that of Camus\u2019 Meursault,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is one of detached indifference toward those whose daily behavior he sees as beyond his power to influence, it does not necessarily follow that unfitness to serve as a juror results merely because one views certain aspects of human behavior as intractable or not easily susceptible to change. \u201c[N]o juror enters into his temporary judicial service stripped of his background and emotions.\u201d <em>Commonwealthv. Mutina, </em>366 Mass. 810, 819, 323 N.E.2d 294 (1975). Indeed, a person\u2019s desire <em>not </em>to get involved in the sordid or illegal affairs of his fellow citizens is every bit as much his prerogative as it is to engage their attentions. Not every man wants to be his brother\u2019s keeper.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Although the trial court recognized this when the prosecutor attempted to strike Connor,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> it failed to perceive this when Murphy was stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Seen in this light, the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for striking Murphy are generic, group based presuppositions applicable in all criminal trials to those who encounter crime and drug trafficking where they work or live. By implicitly equating a person\u2019s encounters with crime and drug use with his acceptance of these activities, such reasons amount to little more than an assumption that one who chooses to mind his own business does so because he is anesthetized to the surrounding chaos and thus could not fairly try a black defendant accused of such crimes. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>supra, 825 (striking of black resident of poor, violent community because she may be \u201c \u2018anesthetized to such violence\u2019 \u201d amounts to mere assumption when residence not linked to specific facts of defendant\u2019s trial). What matters, however, is not <em>whether </em>Murphy possesses such an attitude, but <em>how, </em>if at all, it affects his ability to judge fairly the merits of the defendant\u2019s trial. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>prosecutor failed to establish this critical link, his reasons are surrogates for racial discrimination and thus run afoul of equal protection guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s challenge against Murphy strikes at the very heart of what it means to be tried by an impartial jury. In discussing the sixth amendment requirement that juries be selected from a fair cross section of the community, the Supreme Court of California stated that this mandate is necessary \u201cto achieve an overall impartiality by allowing the interaction of the diverse beliefs and values the jurors bring from their group experiences. Manifestly if jurors are struck simply because they may hold those very beliefs, such interaction becomes impossible and the jury will be dominated by the conscious or unconscious prejudices of the majority.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>22 Cal. 3d 258, 276, 583 P.2d 748, 148 Cal. Rptr. 890 (1978); see <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Kiff, </em>407 U.S. 493, 503-504, 92 S. Ct. 2163, 33 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1972);<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Tillman, </em>220 Conn. 487, 510, 600 A.2d 738 (1991) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting) (purpose of a jury is to make available the commonsense judgment of the community as a hedge against the overzealous or mistaken prosecutor and in preference to the professional or perhaps overconditioned or biased response of a judge). Whether Murphy\u2019s views are his own or representative of the many who must live in close daily proximity to the increasingly violent world of drug use, they are not grounds to exclude him from jury service when a prosecutor\u2019s reasons amount to no more than intuition. In today\u2019s world, where crime and illicit drugs have become so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>much a part of urban life, the average citizen may indeed feel overwhelmed and acutely concerned with avoiding them in the interest of self-protection. To exclude blacks from jury service on this basis would be to ensure virtually that few, if any, blacks could serve at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Further indicia of pretext lie in the inconsistent and contradictory nature of the prosecutor\u2019s explanations. Both Murphy and Connor expressed a \u201clive and let live\u201d attitude toward those they encounter who are involved with drugs. Yet in challenging only Connor did the prosecutor perceive the presence of a \u201ccavalier attitude towards the drug problem.\u201d Similarly, both Murphy and Connor initially exhibited some confusion about the legal concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Although both said they would be able to apply the standard after hearing the court explain it, the prosecutor was troubled by only Murphy\u2019s response. Such disparate treatment of veniremembers who give the same or similar answers to the same question undercuts the legitimacy of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons and signals that they are pretextual. <em>Ex Parte Branch, </em>supra, 623; <em>Slappy </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The pattern of peremptory strikes against blacks also raises an inference of pretext. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tindle, </em>860 F.2d 125, 128 (4th Cir. 1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 642. Here, the prosecutor\u2019s challenges against every black in the first day\u2019s venire created a pattern of strikes that resulted in a disparate impact on the members of one race; <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 1868; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 399; thus providing further salient evidence that his explanations were pretextual. <em>Ex Parte Branch, </em>supra; <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>supra; <em>Slappy </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 354. This comports with the results of a comparison of the percentage of blacks on the jury with that in the venire pool. When the percentage of minority members in the final sworn jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>is significantly less than the percentage in the venire from which they were chosen, an inference of discrimination is warranted. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peete, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sangineto-Miranda, </em>supra, 1521-22. Here, of the sixty members of the four venire panels, five, or 8.3 percent, were black.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Discounting Connor, the black veniremember whom the court seated, there were no blacks on the sworn jury \u2014 zero percent. An inference of discrimination is warranted.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Finally, although a <em>Batson </em>inquiry focuses on the credibility of the prosecutor; <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 98 n.21; and not on the personal opinions of the trial court, credence may be given to the court\u2019s remarks in determining if peremptory challenges were improperly employed. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>941 F.2d 1102, 1109 (10th Cir. 1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 405. Although the court here noted that the prosecutor\u2019s challenges against Simmons and Murphy represented \u201ca very close call, a rather extremely close call,\u201d I find it quite telling that on at least four occasions the court remarked that Simmons and Murphy \u201cseemed to be perfectly acceptable\u201d and that \u201cthey were well qualified to be jurors.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra (court\u2019s observation that voir dire yielded troubling responses given consideration on review in deciding if prosecutor had stated neutral reason for peremptory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>challenge). Further, the court itself questioned Simmons and Murphy, and found their answers to be satisfactory. It also noted, in disallowing the challenge against Connor, that the prosecutor had indicated he would accept two white males who appeared to have substantially more reasons for being excused than did the three blacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">After exhaustive review of the record in this case, the totality of the direct and circumstantial evidence available leaves me \u201cwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 1871, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S. Ct. 525, 92 L. Ed. 2d 746 (1948). I would find that the reasons for striking Simmons and Murphy were pretextual as a matter of law, and that the trial court\u2019s ultimate factual ruling that the prosecutor did not act with forbidden racial animus was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Remedy for Improper Use of Peremptory Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Having determined that the prosecutor engaged in purposeful discrimination in striking Simmons and Murphy, the remaining question is whether seating Connor and granting the defendant four additional peremptory challenges was an appropriate remedy. The defendant claims it was not and argues that the court instead should have seated Simmons and Murphy, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>addition to Connor, and resumed the selection process. Under the circumstances of this case, however, I find neither approach proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">After disallowing the challenge to Connor, the court and the defendant engaged in colloquy about a remedy. The court first indicated that it would dismiss the single juror the parties had previously chosen and begin the process anew the next day with a fresh venire panel. The defendant, however, indicated that future venires might not contain any minorities. He asked for time to consider the matter and stated that he did not want Connor dismissed. The court then seated Connor, agreed not to dismiss the other juror and recessed the proceedings. The next day, the defendant asked that Simmons and Murphy be recalled and seated. The court declined to do so, citing the \u201cone day, one jury\u201d rule,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and instead granted the defendant four additional challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The United States Supreme Court has stated that because the equal protection clause is central to the fourteenth amendment\u2019s ban on discriminatory conduct by the state; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>443 U.S. 545, 554-55, 99 S. Ct. 2993, 61 L. Ed. 2d 739 (1979); it is \u201cthe duty of the courts to apply the Equal Protection Clause with special vigor in the area of racial discrimination.\u201d Id., 575 n.1, (Stewart, J., concurring). The court has repeatedly and unequivocally made clear that courts are under nothing less than an affirmative duty to eradicate racial discrimination \u201croot and branch\u201d; <em>Green </em>v. <em>School Board of New Kent County, </em>391 U.S. 430, 437-38, 88 S.

See, e.g., <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Bowman Transportation Co., </em>424 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>U.S. 747, 770, 96 S. Ct. 1251, 47 L.

See <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Jury Commission of Greene County, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>McCollum, </em>261 Ga. 473, 477, 405 S.E.2d 688 (Benham, J., dissenting), rev\u2019d and remanded, 505 U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 2348, 120 L. Ed. 2d 33 (1992) (a court has a \u201cduty to defend and protect the integrity of the judicial process and, as a necessary part of it, the jury selection process\u201d); E.

Rev. 31, 47-48 (1990) (an appellate court has an \u201cexclusive and venerable independent duty\u201d to review a trial court\u2019s finding involving the right to an impartial jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Although the <em>Batson </em>court did not express any view about appropriate remedies, it made clear that racially motivated juror strikes must be eradicated in order to enforce the mandate of the equal protection clause and maintain public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system. <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 99. The Connecticut Supreme Court\u2019s view of an appropriate <em>Batson </em>remedy accords with this mandate. See <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 400 (if the defendant carries his burden of proof, \u201cthe trial court must then dismiss the jurors thus far selected and the remaining venire, and begin anew the jury selection process\u201d). Although the court\u2019s statement was dictum, under the circumstances here, this remedy is appropriate in order to give effect to the mandate of <em>Batson </em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Once it had determined that the prosecutor acted with racial animus in striking Connor, the court should have reviewed the strikes against Simmons and Murphy, as it had indicated it might, and found that they, too, were impermissible. At that point, the court should have \u201cremedied on the spot\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Biaggi, </em>909 F.2d 662, 679 (2d Cir. 1990); this \u201cshameful practice of racial discrimination in the selection of juries\u201d; <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 102 (Marshall, J., concurring); by dismissing Connor and the juror previously selected, as well as the entire remaining jury pool, and beginning the process anew. Nothing less was required because of the devastating harm caused not only to the defendant, but to the judicial system and the community at large. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>McCray </em>v. <em>New York, </em>461 U.S. 961, 968, 103 S.

Ed. 2d 411 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Had Simmons and Murphy been seated and the selection process continued, the chance that they, along with Connor, might speculate about the circumstances surrounding their seating would have left open the possibility of the trial\u2019s being infected by the specter of racial bias. See A. Alschuler, \u201cThe Supreme Court and the Jury: Voir Dire, Peremptory Challenges, and the Review of Jury Verdicts,\u201d 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 153, 177 n.98 (1989) (\u201c[although neither the prosecutor\u2019s explanation for the prospective juror\u2019s exclusion nor the court\u2019s ruling that this explanation was inadequate might have occurred within the hearing of the juror, a person excluded from a jury and then restored might well infer the situation\u201d). \u201cThe rationale behind striking the entire jury pool is to provide the complaining party with a proper venire and not one that has been partially or totally stripped of potential jurors through the use of discriminatory peremptory challenges.\u201d <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>State, </em>595 So. 2d 38, 40 (Fla. 1992). \u201c[Ajnything less than an impartial jury is the functional equivalent of no jury at all.\u201d <em>Miami </em>v. <em>Cornett, </em>463 So. 2d 399, 402 (Fla. App. 1985); <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>supra, 266. Under the circumstances of this case, wiping the slate clean was the <em>only </em>measure that would ensure that the defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to an impartial jury would not be compromised<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>at the same time, give effect to the affirmative duty our courts are under to eradicate the scourge of racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">This conclusion is mandated as well by other vitally important concerns that go to the heart of our democratic system of government. In condemning racial discrimination in the jury selection process, the United States Supreme Court has highlighted not only the harm done to the accused, but also the harm done to the individual juror and to society as well. In determining recently that citizens have a constitutional right not to be racially discriminated against in the jury selection process; <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 1370; the court stated that along with voting, jury service affords ordinary citizens \u201ctheir most significant opportunity to participate in the democratic process.\u201d Id., 1369. When a veniremember is excluded because of racial bias, \u201csuch exclusion produces \u2018injury to the jury system, to the law as an institution, to the community at large, and to the democratic ideal reflected in the processes of our courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCray </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, quoting <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>329 U.S. 187, 195, 67 S. Ct. 261, 91 L. Ed. 181 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The right to serve on a jury invests ordinary citizens with a sense of empowerment derived from \u201c \u2018a conscious duty of participation in the machinery of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 1368, quoting <em>Balzac </em>v. <em>Porto Rico, </em>258 U.S. 298, 310, 42 S. Ct. 343, 66 L. Ed. 627 (1922). It is not only a duty but \u201c \u2018a privilege of citizenship.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tillman, </em>supra, 498 n.5, quoting <em>Thiel </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>328 U.S. 217, 224, 66 S. Ct. 984, 90 L. Ed. 2d 1181 (1946). Although jury duty is regarded by many today as a nuisance, it is imbued with a greater importance for those who have historically been shut out of decision making positions in the institutions that shape our society, and denied justice and equality before the law. This continued dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>qualification is nothing less than one of the \u201cbadges and incidents\u201d of second class citizenship, signifying the subordinate status African-Americans have endured for much of their history in this country. See generally, D. Colbert, \u201cChallenging the Challenge: Thirteenth Amendment as a Prohibition Against the Racial Use of Peremptory Challenges,\u201d 76 Cornell L. Rev. 1, 12 n.39 (1990). Moreover, excluding prospective jurors based on race undermines the dignity of minority groups and carries with it the unspoken suggestion that they are in some way incapable of fulfilling their duties as citizens. See, e.g., L. Magid, \u201cChallenges to Jury Composition: Purging the Sixth Amendment Analysis of Equal Protection Concepts,\u201d 24 San Diego L. Rev. 1081, 1101 (1987) (\u201cexcluded jurors are branded with a stamp of inferiority\u201d). For black citizens to be \u201csingled out and expressly denied ... all right to participate in the administration of the law, as jurors, because of their color ... is practically a brand upon them, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority.\u201d <em>Strauder </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>100 U.S. 303, 308, 25 L. Ed. 664 (1880). Indeed, it is nothing less than a stigma of dishonor and second class citizenship. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Given the profound and far reaching effects of racial discrimination in the use of the peremptory challenge, it is important that our courts attempt to fashion remedies that both vindicate the accused\u2019s constitutional rights to an impartial jury and protect the public\u2019s interest in the integrity of the jury selection system, the very bedrock of our truth seeking process. The day is simply long gone when the peremptory challenge can be regarded as \u201can arbitrary and capricious species of challenge\u201d; 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 353; to be employed for any reason or for no reason at all.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>talismanic justifications for the avoidance of judicial oversight may have been acceptable in times when women, blacks and other minorities were unwelcome within the corridors of the legal system, but they are no longer valid in the pluralistic, race conscious society we inhabit today. For we must not forget that until only recently, our brothers and sisters of color did not even possess the right to sit on a jury in this state.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We must not forget, too, that since the beginning of slavery in this nation, it has been the specter of the all white jury that has signified the ultimate, impenetrable obstacle to justice for African-American criminal defendants. Since colonial days, when our forebears fought to free themselves from the grip of a foreign power, the right of \u201ctrial by juries <em>impartially </em>selected\u201d has been among the \u201cprinciples [that] form the bright constellation which has gone before us, and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 3 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 322 (Mem. Ed. 1905). Racial bias in jury selection, this courtroom \u201cvestige of slavery\u201d; D. Colbert, supra, 6; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>not only thwarts the exercise of that right, but \u201cviolates our Constitution and the laws enacted under it [and] is at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>311 U.S. 128, 130, 61 S. Ct. 164, 85 L. Ed. 84 (1940). \u201c[I]n such a war the courts cannot be pacifists.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>supra, 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Accordingly, I concur only in the court\u2019s judgment reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-6\"> Even if this question were properly before us and I agreed that destruction of the statement was not harmless, I would disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court \u201cabused its discretion\u201d in failing to strike Roberts\u2019 testimony. I would find that the failure to apply one of the two sanctions permitted by Practice Book \u00a7 755 constitutes plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Contrary to the trial court\u2019s statement that \u201cthe findings [as to whether a violation occurred] are within my discretion <em>as are the </em>sanctions(emphasis added); our Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 752 and 755, which \u201c \u2018repeatedly [employ] the word \u201cshall,\u201d are mandatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>212 Conn. 6, 13, 562 A.2d 470 (1989), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>186 Conn. 426, 432, 441 A.2d 852 (1982). The same principle applies with equal force to General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b (b), which also requires that the court \u201cshall\u201d strike the witness\u2019 testimony or declare a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">\u201c[A] trial court\u2019s failure to follow the mandatory provisions of a statute prescribing trial procedures or to follow a procedural rule is plain error.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 171 n.10, 571 A.2d 79 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Guckian, </em>27 Conn. App. 225, 246, 605 A.2d 874, cert. granted, 223 Conn. 907, 612 A.2d 57 (1992). Similarly, it is plain error where a trial court fails to adhere to a clearly applicable Practice Book rule. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>26 Conn. App. 293, 300, 600 A.2d 1040 (1991); <em>In re Jonathan P., </em>23 Conn. App. 207, 211, 579 A.2d 587 (1990). The only discretion a trial court has in applying \u00a7 755 lies in deciding whether to strike the witness\u2019 testimony or to declare a mistrial. Because the trial court applied a remedy <em>not called for </em>by \u00a7 755, it committed plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that \u00a7 755 requires striking the witness\u2019 <em>entire </em>testimony. First, the cases the majority relies on do not support this assertion. Neither <em>In re Jesus C., 21 </em>Conn. App. 645, 575 A.2d 1031 (1990), nor <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, hold that the witness\u2019 entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>testimony must be stricken. Phrases such as \u201centire testimony\u201d or \u201call the testimony\u201d do not even appear in these decisions. In fact, <em>In re Jesus C., </em>supra, cuts against the majority\u2019s holding. There, this court said that \u201cin appropriate circumstances, <em>the affected testimony </em>may be struck as a sanction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Second, a per se rule requiring that the witness\u2019 entire testimony be stricken would work an injustice in many instances where evidence unrelated to the incident at issue also would be stricken, thereby requiring the state to drop its charges. The only situation in which this is a proper result is when the witness\u2019 <em>entire </em>testimony relates <em>only </em>to the alleged incident. It should not be forgotten that the purpose of \u00a7 755 is to deter police misconduct. By applying the sanction of \u00a7 755 more broadly than necessary, a court effects an untoward result that overcompensates for that misconduct and undermines the public\u2019s confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">Third, the majority\u2019s position finds a paucity of support in federal case law. When our Supreme Court has not yet spoken on a \u00a7 755 issue, we look to the federal judiciary for guidance because \u00a7 755 is derived from the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 13. Among the federal courts, only the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has said that the witness\u2019 entire testimony must be stricken or a new trial ordered when a Jencks violation has been made out.

Because I would find that the court failed to take appropriate action when Connor was stricken, the issue of whether reversal is required when a party induces error of constitutional proportion need not be addressed.

This is grounded on two reasons: 1. As every one must be sensible, what sudden impressions and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the bare looks and gestures of another; and how necessary it is that a prisoner . . . should have a good opinion of his jury . . . the law wills not that he should be tried by any one man against whom he has conceived a prejudice even without being able to assign a reason for such dislike. 2. Because, upon challenges for cause shown, if the reason assigned prove insufficient to set aside the juror, perhaps the bare questioning his indifference may sometimes provoke a resentment; to prevent all ill consequences from which, the prisoner is still at liberty, if he pleases, peremptorily to set him aside.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>146 U.S. 370, 376, 13 S.
