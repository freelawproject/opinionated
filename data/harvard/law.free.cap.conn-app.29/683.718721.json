We disagree, and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The trial court could reasonably have found the following facts. On August 21, 1991, Shirleen Jones (Jones) and her four year old son Carl were driven to the defendant\u2019s home in Norwalk by her boyfriend. The defendant is the child\u2019s father and Jones\u2019 husband. Jones and the defendant were involved in a divorce and custody suit at the time these events took place. Jones asked her boyfriend to park the car a few blocks from the defendant\u2019s house to avoid an encounter between the defendant and her boyfriend. Jones and her son walked to the defendant\u2019s house and went inside. The defendant asked her if they could speak about Carl and they went into another room where the defendant allegedly hit Jones in the face and told her she could not leave until he was ready for her to leave. When she went to say goodbye to Carl, the defendant allegedly threw her onto the bed, began choking her, and made threatening remarks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>As Jones eventually left the house, the defendant said he would lead her and her boyfriend back to the parkway with his car. When Jones arrived at the car, she said to her boyfriend, \u201cLet\u2019s get in the car and let\u2019s go.\u201d Her boyfriend got in the driver\u2019s side, while she got in the passenger\u2019s side. The defendant got into his own car, placing Carl in a car seat. The defendant attempted to block the way of Jones and her boyfriend, and then engaged them in high speed pursuit. Eventually, the defendant caught up with Jones and her boyfriend and rammed his vehicle into their vehicle three times. No one was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Norwalk police officer Thomas Rozinski was traveling in a marked car on Connecticut Avenue in Norwalk when he observed the defendant\u2019s vehicle strike the red Mazda in which Jones and her boyfriend were riding. The Mazda drove off at a high speed, followed by the defendant. Rozinski stopped the defendant. The defendant emerged from his car and ran toward the police vehicle. The police officer told the defendant to return to his vehicle, but he refused. The officer thought he saw someone waving a pistol inside the defendant\u2019s car. He drew a weapon, and advanced towards the vehicle, only to find Carl waving a cap gun. The defendant was very agitated and generally uncooperative. Rozinski placed the defendant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Testifying on his own behalf, the defendant admitted having an animated discussion with Jones, but denied hitting or choking her. He claimed that he followed Jones because he wanted to see what her boyfriend looked like, and because he wanted to buy cigarettes. The defendant also denied ramming his car into the Mazda, claiming instead that he hit the other car only once when they were involved in an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">At the close of evidence, the court noted that it did not find the defendant\u2019s testimony credible in \u201cseveral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>respects\u201d and that it was \u201csomewhat inconsistent.\u201d The court also found the defendant\u2019s attitude at the beginning of the incident to be antagonistic, that the defendant had operated his car in an erratic manner, and that there was at least one impact confirmed by the police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Before reaching the merits of this appeal, we must first settle the question of reviewability. The state maintains that the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim of vagueness is unreviewable on appeal because it was not raised in the trial court. The state notes that the defendant did not brief his claim for entitlement to review under our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). \u201cWe conclude that, despite this procedural default, a claim of unconstitutional vagueness falls within the parameters of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and therefore warrants appellate scrutiny, because it implicates the fundamental due process right to fair warning and the record is adequate to facilitate review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>207 Conn. 456, 459, 542 A.2d 686 (1988), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>11 Conn. App. 122, 125, 525 A.2d 1374, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 806, 531 A.2d 939 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\u201cThe constitutional injunction that is commonly referred to as the void for vagueness doctrine embodies two central precepts: the right to fair warning of the effect of a governing statute or regulation and the guarantee against standardless law enforcement.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 459-60. Furthermore, \u201c[a] vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 460, quoting <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-109, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972). When considering a challenge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>a statute on vagueness grounds, we must determine whether the law \u201cforbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application . . . (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>192 Conn. 154, 158-59, 471 A.2d 632, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 801, 105 S. Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1984), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 60, 428 A.2d 322 (1980). The defendant claims that \u00a7 53-21 is so vague in its meaning as to fail to give fair warning. To determine if a statute gives adequate warning as to what activity is prohibited, we may turn to the common law, legal dictionaries, or treatises. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Section 53-21 proscribes \u201ctwo general types of behavior likely to injure physically or to impair the morals of a minor under sixteen years of age: (1) deliberate indifference to, acquiescence in, or the creation of situations inimical to the minor\u2019s moral or physical welfare . . . and (2) acts directly perpetrated on the person of the minor and injurious to his moral or physical well-being.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>150 Conn. 245, 250, 188 A.2d 65 (1963); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Falangio, </em>24 Conn. App. 300, 588 A.2d 644, cert. denied, 218 Conn. 911, 591 A.2d 813 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Trujillo, </em>12 Conn. App. 320, 531 A.2d 142, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 812, 532 A.2d 588 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>11 Conn. App. 80, 525 A.2d 1353 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>8 Conn. App. 528, 513 A.2d 1261 (1986). Under the statute\u2019s first category, it is not necessary that the defendant touch any part of the victim\u2019s body to violate \u00a7 53-21. <em>State </em>v. <em>Palangio, </em>supra, 303. \u201c[T]he creation of a prohibited situation is sufficient.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>supra, 159-60. In the present case, the defendant placed his child in his car, pursued another vehicle at high speed, and then rammed into the other vehicle. The possibilities for injury to the child were myriad.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The defendant claims that the statute does not adequately distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. On appeal, he still maintains that he had an \u201caccident\u201d with the vehicle in which his wife and her companion were riding. Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 460, in which our Supreme Court ruled that \u00a7 53-21 was void for vagueness as applied to the facts of that case, the defendant argues that \u00a7 53-21 \u201cimpermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The factual issue of whether the defendant was involved in an accident, or instead deliberately ran his vehicle into the'other vehicle was decided by the trier of fact after hearing all of the evidence. We will not disturb that finding on appeal. The facts of this case, as determined by the trier of fact, show that the defendant took actions that the statute clearly proscribes. He created a situation inimical to the child's physical welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The defendant also relies on <em>Schriver </em>in claiming that the judicial gloss on \u00a7 53-21 does not give adequate warning that the actions he took were prohibited by the statute. The <em>Schriver </em>court concluded, after reviewing several previous \u00a7 53-21 cases, that the \u201cauthoritative judicial gloss . . . limits the type of physical harm prohibited by \u00a7 53-21 to instances of deliberate, blatant abuse.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 466. Measured by that standard, the conviction of the defendant in <em>Schriver </em>could not stand. The court went on, however, to state: \u201cAt the outset, we note that the defendant in this case was charged under the second part of \u00a7 53-21. To have violated the statute, then, the defendant had to have committed acts directly perpetrated on the person of a minor, whether the alleged impairment was mental or physical. <em>Under different circumstances, the state might elect to prosecute under the first part of\u00a7 53-21, which proscribes the \u2018deliberate indifference to, acquies</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number><em>cence in, or the creation of situations inimical to the minor\u2019s moral or physical welfare </em>. . . .\u2019\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) Id., 467; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Erzen, </em>29 Conn. App. 591, 596, 617 A.2d 177 (1992). In the present case, the defendant was charged by a short form information and he did not request a bill of particulars or a statement of essential facts. The burden rests on the defendant to request a bill of particulars and a statement of essential facts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>194 Conn. 198, 205, 479 A.2d 237 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Osman, </em>21 Conn. App. 299, 310, 573 A.2d 743 (1990), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 218 Conn. 432, 589 A.2d 1227 (1991); see also Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 625 and 831. Therefore, the defendant is precluded from relying on the judicial gloss that <em>Schriver </em>gave the second part of \u00a7 53-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 provides: \u201cinjury or risk of injury to, or impairing morals OF, children. Any person who wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that its life or limb is endangered, or its health is likely to be injured, or its morals likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The defendant was also convicted on one count of breach of peace, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181. He does not challenge that conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\"> The defendant had been charged with a count of assault in the third degree, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61, as well as breach of peace, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181, and risk of injury. The court found the defendant not guilty on the assault count. At the very least, Shirleen Jones and the defendant had an animated discussion regarding Carl before she left.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
