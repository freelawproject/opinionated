Although this issue was not raised by the parties, the court has a duty to dismiss, even on its own initiative, any appeal that it lacks jurisdiction to hear.\u201d <em>Sasso </em>v. <em>Aleshin, </em>197 Conn. 87, 89, 495 A.2d 1066 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">A petition for a new trial in a civil matter is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 52-270. \u201cThe petition is instituted by a writ and complaint served on the adverse party; although such an action is collateral to the action in which a new trial is sought, it is by its nature a distinct proceeding.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>180 Conn. 141, 144, 429 A.2d 810 (1980). Here, the defendants\u2019 \u201cpetition for a new trial\u201d was not served separately by writ and complaint. The failure to bring a petition for a new trial as a separate proceeding deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>In re Clifton B., </em>15 Conn. App. 367, 370, 544 A.2d 666 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Servello, </em>14 Conn. App. 88, 101-102, 540 A.2d 378, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 811, 545 A.2d 1107 (1988). Therefore, the defendants\u2019 pleading was, in fact, an improperly brought \u201cpetition for a new trial.\u201d The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>should have dismissed it because the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>15 Conn. App. 502, 503, 545 A.2d 1150 (1988).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The form of the judgment is improper, the order denying the petition for a new trial is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-10\"> The court \u201cdenied\u201d the \u201cpetition for a new trial\u201d and, even if we conclude that the trial court treated this as a <em>motion </em>for a new trial, which is governed in a civil action by Practice Book \u00a7 320, the appeal should be dismissed for lack of a final judgment. A motion for a new trial must be brought within five days after the day judgment is rendered. The granting or denial of a motion for a new trial, however, is not an appealable final judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>180 Conn. 141, 143, 429 A.2d 810 (1980); <em>Hoberman </em>v. <em>Lake of Isles, Inc., </em>138 Conn. 573, 575, 87 A.2d 137 (1952); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>124 Conn. 639, 644, 1 A.2d 761 (1938). It therefore follows that the defendants\u2019 appeal from the court\u2019s denial, even if treated by the trial court as a motion for a new trial, is not taken from a final judgment. \u201cSince the lack of a final judgment is a jurisdictional defect, the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>167 Conn. 282, 284, 355 A.2d 255 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
