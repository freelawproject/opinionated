The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) refused to consider the child support guidelines where the modification was based on earning capacity rather than actual earnings, and (2) refused to consider the defendant\u2019s second wife\u2019s income in computing the child support to be ordered. At oral argument, the plaintiff stated that if we reverse the trial court on her first claim, she would withdraw the second claim. We reverse and remand for a new hearing on the first claim; accordingly, the second claim is deemed withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">The marriage of the parties was dissolved on December 1, 1981, at which time the defendant was ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>to pay $50 per week for support of their one minor child. At the time of the dissolution, the defendant\u2019s employment yielded him a net weekly wage of $196. After the dissolution, the defendant remarried and voluntarily left his job in order to devote time to his two businesses and household duties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In exchange for the defendant\u2019s agreement to perform household duties, his second wife agreed to provide his support.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The trial court found that when the defendant voluntarily left his employment, his annual salary was $19,596 and that, if he had not terminated his employment, his salary at the time of the modification would have been $28,386. The court also found that the defendant\u2019s current reported net income was below $135 per week. The court concluded that the defendant\u2019s termination of employment and resulting loss of employer provided medical benefits for the child, coupled with an increase in the child\u2019s medical needs, constituted a substantial change in circumstances, thereby justifying a modification of the original support order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The plaintiff relied on the child support guidelines in asserting that the support payments should be increased to $145 per week based on the defendant\u2019s earning capacity. The court held, however, that \u201cthe guidelines do not serve as an effective criteria where a support order must be predicated upon earning capacity as distinguished from actual earnings. This is especially true here where the defendant\u2019s reported income is a weekly amount below the $135 set by the Commission for Child Support Guidelines . . . .\u2019\u2019Accordingly, the court increased the support payments to $100 per week. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> created a commission charged with establishing \u201ccriteria for the establishment of guidelines to ensure the appropriateness of child support awards.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215b<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>mandates that \u201c[t]he child support and arrearage guidelines . . . shall be considered <em>in all determinations of child support </em>amounts . . . within the state,\u201d subject to a rebuttable presumption that the amount so determined is the proper figure for a support award. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Although the trial court correctly recognized that the guidelines generally are not applicable to parents with a weekly net income below the self-support reserve of $135, the trial court failed to consider the entire mandate of the guidelines. They state that <em>\u201c[ejxcept as provided under the deviation criteria, </em>the guidelines do not apply to a parent whose net weekly income is less than $135.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Connecticut Child Support Guidelines \u00a7 (b) (2). As a result, even where income does not exceed the self-support reserve, the guidelines are applicable and must be considered \u201cas provided under the deviation criteria.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Among the enumerated deviation criteria set forth in the general principles of the guidelines is the <em>\u201cpresent and potential earning capacity of a party. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Connecticut Child Support Guidelines \u00a7 (a) (3) (B). This reflects the well recognized family law principle that, in a marital dissolution proceeding, the court may base financial awards on the earning capacity rather than the actual earned income of the parties. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>181 Conn. 610, 611-12, 436 A.2d 279 (1980). This principle is particularly applicable where, as here, the person to be charged has intentionally terminated his employment thereby substantially reducing or eliminating his actual earnings. <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>180 Conn. 184, 189-90, 429 A.2d 470 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">We are unable to discern any intent in the statute or the deviation criteria that they should not be considered in a determination of a support order based on earning capacity rather than support orders based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>actual income. We recognize that while the statute requires the court to consider the guidelines, it does not require that they be rigidly applied to all determinations of child support. <em>Battersby </em>v. <em>Battersby, </em>218 Conn. 467, 468-69, 590 A.2d 427 (1991). The guidelines are the starting point for the determination of a support order. The amount derived from consideration of the guidelines is presumed to be the amount of support to be ordered. This presumption, however, may be rebutted by the trial court\u2019s finding on the record that the guideline amount would be inequitable or inappropriate in a particular case based on the deviation criteria set forth in the commission\u2019s general principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In the present case, the trial court improperly refused to consider the child support guidelines in accordance with the statutorily mandated procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s second claim is not reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The support order is reversed and the case is remanded for a new hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for modification consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-6\"> The trial court found that the defendant\u2019s two businesses were \u201cminuscule\u201d and did not contribute materially to his income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-7\"> At the time of the hearing, two children had been born into the second marriage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86, as amended by No. 91-76, \u00a7 1, of the 1991 Public Acts provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Unless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification, any final order for the periodic payment of permanent alimony or support. . . may at any time thereafter be continued, set aside, altered or modified by said court upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or upon a showing that the final order for child support substantially deviates from the child support guidelines . . . unless there was a specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate. . . .
