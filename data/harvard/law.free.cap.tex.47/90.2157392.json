An <em>ad valorem </em>tax of one fourth of one per cent., levied for general county purposes for the year 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-21\">2. A tax of one tenth of one per cent., levied to pay the interest, and to provide a sinking fund to liquidate certain bonds issued by the county of Galveston, under a special act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>of the Legislature, authorizing their issue, passed November 29,1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">3.

A county poll-tax of fifty cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">As grounds for relief, it was alleged that the poll-tax was not levied or ordered to be assessed and collected by the County Court for the year 1875; that the other taxes were assessed under a certain entry, made January 28,1875, on the record of the proceedings of the County Court of Galveston county, a copy of which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">\u201cIn the matter of Levying Taxes for the year 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-10\"><em>\u201cBe it ordered by the County Court, </em>That there shall be an annual <em>ad valorem </em>tax levied for the year 1875, of one fourth of one per cent., the same as last year, (one fourth of one per cent.;) also a special tax, to pay county indebtedness, of one tenth of one per cent.; also a road and bridge tax of one twentieth of one per cent.; also a funding county scrip tax of one eighth of one per cent.; (and the tax ordered on page 44, of one twentieth of one per cent., to create a sinking fund to pay interest on Ballinger &amp; J ack bonds.) \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-11\">This order, it was insisted, was a nullity, because the County Court met on 25th January, its regular term, and adjourned over until 27th, when there was not a quorum present, and an entry was made; adjourning over until 28th, when said order was made; it being insisted that the failure of a quorum on 27th effected an adjournment of the term, so that the action on 28th was not made in term time of said court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-12\">That the tax of one eighth of one per cent, was not apportioned by said jiretended levy according to law, and was not levied or ordered to be assessed upon property, and to be collected as an <em>ad valorem </em>tax; wherefore its collection was unauthorized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-13\">That the special tax of one tenth of one per cent, was as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>sessed for interest and sinking fund on county bonds, issued in funding the county indebtedness, under special act of the Legislature, approved November 27,1871, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\"><em>\u201cBe it enacted by the Legislature of the State of </em>Texas, That the County Court of Galveston county is authorized to issue, from time to time, interest-bearing and coupon bonds, for such sums and in such amounts, payable at such time, as such court may deem proper: <em>Provided, </em>That the bonds hereby authorized shall be issued only for the purpose of funding the present outstanding indebtedness of said county of every character whatsoever due and to be due when such bonds are issued.

On the 28th instant, the court convened; present, a quorum; and levied the taxes in question, to wit, an <em>ad valorem </em>tax of one fourth of one per cent, for general county purposes; a special tax of one tenth of one per cent, to pay county indebtedness; a tax of one eighth of one per cent, for funding county scrip.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-9\">The tax of one fourth of one per cent, was levied under the tax-act of June 3, 1873.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-10\">The tax of one tenth was levied under the special act set out in plaintiffs\u2019 petition.

The January Term, 1875, of the County Court expired on the 27th January, 1875, and the levy of the taxes on the 28th of January, 1875, was a nullity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-7\">2d. The special act did not authorize the levy of a tax.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-8\">3d. The tax of one eighth, or funding tax, was not apportioned as directed by the statute, and was not levied or ordered by the County Court to be assessed and collected as a tax upon property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-9\">4th. The figures on the pretended assessment roll of taxes do not indicate money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-10\">First, as to the validity of the levy by the County Court, on the 28th of January, 1875. The'statute declares that no county tax shall be levied by the County Court, unless at some one of the regular terms. (Gen. Laws, 2d session, 1871, page 56.) This statute prescribes that a regular term of the County Court shall commence and be held on the last Monday in January, March, May,-July, September, and November in every year; and that such terms shall be held by the presiding justice, with the assistance of any two or more of the other justices.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-11\">The Constitution of 1869, article 5, section 20, declares that the justices of the peace in each county, or any three of them, shall constitute a court, having such jurisdiction, etc., and when sitting as such court, the justice who resides at the county seat shall be the presiding justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-12\">It will thus he seen that the County Court is constituted of not less than three of the justices; that regular stated terms of the court are designated; that such terms shall be held by the presiding justice with the assistance of any two of the other justices; that no county tax shall be levied unless at some one of the regular terms.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-13\">The taxes in question were either levied at the January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Term, 1875, by a court having, jurisdiction, or the proceedings were <em>coram nonjudice, </em>and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-6\">The question, then, is, was the levy of the taxes in question, on the 28th day of January, 1875, made at a regular term of the County Court?</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-7\">It is important to bear in mind that the authority conferred upon the counties to impose burdens of any character upon persons or property is merely statutory, and that as its exercise may result in a divestiture and transfer of private property, this authority must be clearly given and strictly pursued. (Dillon on Mun. Corp., sec. 605.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-8\">Possessing, as these public corporations do, a delegated power of assessment and sale of private property, often wielded by the indiscreet and the selfish, the grossest abuses would inevitably follow, if they were not held strictly within the powers granted and the means prescribed for the execution of these powers. (Per Stuart, J., in Kyle <em>v. </em>Malin, 8 Ind., 34.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-9\">The County Court being regularly in session on the 25th day of January, 1875, adjourned regularly to meet on the 27th day of January, 1875. The court did not meet on the 27th January, 1875; no court was then in session ; K. D. Johnson and Hugo Brosig, the only two members of the court present on the 27th January, did not constitute the court; had no power to perform the functions of a court; had no power to transact any business or to do anything ou the 27th day of January, which a court might do, as, for instance, to make an order that the court do adjourn to some certain day; as well might the clerk or sheriff assume to exercise such a power, as a single member or any two members of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-10\">It will be noted that the act in question (Gen. Laws, 2d sess., 1871, page 27,) does not, as does the act of December 14, 1863, (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1247,) provide against such a dilemma as the one in question, by providing that should a quorum of the commissioners\u2019 court not appear at the time appointed, the sheriff, or in his absence the coroner, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>adjourn the court from day to day for three days, and should a quorum not appear oh the morning of the fourth day, then he shall adjourn the court until the next term in course, thus clearly indicating that without such statutory authority the court\u2014a quorum\u2014must convene at the appointed time, and be kept in session from day to day by the orders of the court, regularly made by the court as a court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-5\">A court term is a definite and fixed time prescribed by law. \" (Horton v. Miller, 38 Penn. St, 270.) Certain fixed times and places were said by Spelman to be essential to the existence of a court. (State <em>v. </em>Roberts, 8 Nev., 239.) There is no implied power in a court to adjourn. (People <em>v. </em>Bradwell, 2 Cow., 445; Wright &amp; Wallbaum, 39 Ill., 554; Cooley on Tax., 214.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-6\">H. The special act does not authorize the levy of any tax; the power to levy a tax is not given under the authority given by the act to issue bonds and to provide for their payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-7\">Towns' and counties possess no power to levy and collect taxes, unless under an express grant from the legislative power of the State. This is a principle, says Cooley on Taxation, page 244, that admits of no exception whatever. It is a principle universally declared and admitted, says Dillon on Municipal Corporations, section 605, that municipal corporations can levy no taxes, general or special, unless the power be plainly and unmistakably conferred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-8\">Those who. assume to seize the property of the citizen for the satisfaction of a tax must be able to show that that particular tax is authorized by general or special law. (Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., 518, 520; Kyle <em>v. </em>Malin, 8 Ind., 34.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-9\">In the construction of any grant of the power to tax, made \u2022 by the State to one of \u2022 its municipalities, the rule which is accepted by all the authorities is, that it should be with strictness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-10\">There are no inherent powers in the municipalities to levy taxes; they can tax only as the State in its wisdom has thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>proper to permit; and if the State has erred in the direction of strictness, the Legislature alone can correct the evil. (Cooley on Tax., 209; Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., 191, 488, 518.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-6\">A strict construction in such cases is reasonable, because, presumptively, the Legislature has given, in plain terms, all the powers it has intended should be exercised. (Cooley on Tax., 200, 209.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-7\">It is very clear, under these universally accepted rules of construction, that the special act does not authorize the County Court to provide for the payment of bonds by levying a tax for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-8\">TTT The order of the com\u2019t levying the funding-scrip tax is unintelligible, and so far.meaningless, as it gives no warrant for the assessment and collections of a tax. We submit that the levy of this tax is not only fatally obnoxious to this objection, but that the levy is in no sense made in compliance with the terms of the statute conferring the power to tax, and in no sense carries out the intent of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-9\">The act directs that the County Court shall proceed to levy a special tax on the assessed value of all the real and personal property of such county, and upon occupations and professions taxed by the State, and upon the polls in said county, prescribing a maximum rate for each of these three subjects of the tax.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-10\">Counties must conform to the mode and manner prescribed by the law under which they derive their power to tax. If not done in the manner prescribed, the act is a nullity and void. (Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., 191, 488, 518; Dillon on Mun. Corp., secs. 55, 610; Blackwell on Tax Tittles, 106, 164, 447; 20 Howard, Pr. Rep., 395; 4 Hill, 76; 1 Kansas, 432.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-11\">It is a well-settled rule of construction of delegated authority, that the authority conferred is to be strictly construed and must be closely pursued. Dillon, sec. 55; Sedgwick on Stat. and Con. Law, 466; French <em>v. </em>Edwards, 13 Wall, 506; Cooley on Tax., 175, 180, 208, 216; State <em>v. </em>Bank of Newbern, 1 Dev. &amp; Bat. Eq., 218; Blackwell on Tax Titles, 165.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>IV. Appellants submit that the figures as marked upon the consolidated assessment roll of taxes, under the head of value of property, and under the head of the different taxes, do not indicate any value in money, but are mere numerals, signifying abstract numbers, and show no assessment of property or of taxes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-5\">This proposition was sustained in Tilton <em>v. </em>'Oregon C. M. E. R., Circuit Court United States, District of Oregon, Deady, J., from Central Law Journal, vol. 1, No. 22; Hurlbutt <em>v. </em>Butenop, 27 Cal., 50; Braly <em>v. </em>Seaman, 30 Cal., 610; People <em>v. </em>Hastings, 34 Cal., 571; People <em>v. </em>San Francisco Savings Union, 31 Cal., 132.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-6\">V. Appellants submit that said inventories and the testimony of Menard was inadmissible, upon the ground that the figures on said roll exhibit a plain and obvious uncertainty, and are equally capable of different applications as to their meaning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-7\">To show by extrinsic evidence that they who made those figures intended them to mean dollars and cents, would be to make a supposed intention operate independently of any definite expression of such intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-8\">The roll shows a case of a patent, incurable ambiguity. (Stephens\u2019s Dig. of Evidence, 108; Starkie on Ev., (9th ed.,) 591; Greenl, on Ev., 342.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-9\">It is a general rule, that a patent ambiguity is always, if possible, to be removed by construction, and not by averment. (Colpoys <em>v. </em>Colpoys, 1 Jac., Eng. Chan., 451.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-10\">The words \u201c Texas, money,\u201d in Roberts <em>v. </em>Sharp, 1 Tex., 373, are not a patent ambiguity, but are capable of having a certain meaning given to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-11\">When the perusal of an instrument shows plainly that something more must be added before the reader can determine which of several things is meant by it, the rule is inflexible that no evidence to supply the deficiency can be admitted. (Gresley\u2019s Eq. Ev., 198.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-12\">In conclusion, plaintiffs proved that the county court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>not levy a poll tax for the year 1875, and yet the court below saw no ground for enjoining its collection.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-4\"><em>M.

An <em>ad valorem </em>tax of one fourth of one per cent., levied for general county purposes for the year 1875.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">2. A tax of one tenth of one per cent., levied to pay the interest, and provide a sinking fund to liquidate certain bonds issued by the county of Galveston, under a special act of the Legislature authorizing their issue, passed Hovember 29, 1871.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">3. A tax of one eighth of one per cent., levied under an act of the Legislature, to pay the interest on registered county scrip.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">4. A county poll tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">On the trial of the cause in the district court, judgment was . rendered in favor of the defendants, and the plaintiffs gave notice of an appeal; hut they failed to perfect their appeal by giving bond, with two or more securities, as required by the statute regulating appeals to this court. Ho objection, however, was made by appellee to the bond found in the record. If, therefore, the bond had been of such a character as to give the court jurisdiction of the case, it would be unnecessary for us to notice its deficiencies. \u2022 But sucji, in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>opinion, is not the character of the instrument which was filed in the District Court for the purpose of perfecting the appeal taken by the plaintiffs, and by reason of which they are asking of this court a reversal of the judgment. The pretended appeal bond copied in the transcript is signed only by three of the plaintiffs, and has no sureties to it whatever. An appeal bond is an essential requisite to the jurisdiction of the court, except in the cases in which it has been dispensed with by statute. That the individual obligation or bond of the appellants cannot be regarded as an appeal bond in the sense of the statute, is clearly dedueible from its plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The appeal not having been perfected, and this court having acquired no jurisdiction of the case, the only judgment which can he rendered by us is, that it he dismissed. However, as the questions presented by the assignment of errors have been fully discussed by counsel, and maturely considered by the court, it may, perhaps, tend to avoid future litigation for us to briefly indicate the conclusions at which we have arrived in regard to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The objection that these taxes had not been legally levied, because this had not been done at or during a regular term of the County Court., is untenable. The court convened and was duly organized at the time prescribed 'by law. \"When a court is organized and opened for a, regular term, the term continues until it is ended by order of final adjournment, or until the efflux of the time fixed by law for its continuance. The sessions or sittings of the court during term are entirely within the discretion and control of the court. And its orders in respect thereto are intended for its convenience and the convenience of parties interested in its proceedings. Hence they may be altered, revoked, or annulled from time to time, as the exigency of the business to be transacted may require. The orders of adjournment of its sessions from day to day, or to a particular horn of the day, are mere announcements of its proposed or intended order of transacting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>business to come before it during the term. But certainly the failure of the court to meet at the hour or on the day to which it had thus taken a recess, can in no way affect or put an end to its term.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The objections to the levy of the tax of one tenth of one per cent, have been considered and decided in the case of George <em>et al. v. </em>Dean, and need not be here noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The levy of the tax of one eighth of one per cent, is not so full, clear, and explicit as is appropriate in orders of the court of such character. Nevertheless, it cannot be said, when we look to the entire order, that the levy is void. The amount and character of the tax, and of the property upon which it is levied can be sufficiently inferred and understood from the order to support the levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The objection that in the levy of this tax there is a discrimination in favor of occupations, seems not to have been made in the court below. If it was in the mind of the pleader when he drew the petition, it is not set forth with sufficient clearness to call the attention of the court to it. The levy is only for one half of the amount which the court was authorized to impose upon property; and if a like tax should have been imposed on taxable occupations, it does not appear that it has not been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The levy of a county poll tax was made by the Legislature; therefore there was no necessity for a levy of it by the County Court, if it had the authority to do so. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 7711.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">It is also objected that the figures, upon the consolidated assessment roll, in the columns for the value of property, and for the different kinds of taxes, do not indicate any denominate value of money, as it cannot be told whether they indicate eagles, dollars, cents, or mills; but this, at most, is a mere defect in the form and manner of making up the roll. The proper import of these figures, however, when the assessment roll is looked at in the light thrown upon it by the different statutes in regard to the levy and assessment of taxes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>and the instructions of the comptroller upon the subject, is so obvious, that it may well be doubted whether the alleged defect is of any significance whatever. It certainly affords no ground for the interposition of a court of equity, or warrant for an injunction against the collection of the tax the amount of which is clearly and correctly shown by the assessment lists. It has no doubt been held, in cases where there were like defects or irregularities in the wai\u2019rant or authority under which property had been sold for taxes, that they were fatal to the title of the purchaser. But it is well known, unless the general rule has, as with us, been modified by statute, that it is usually held that it devolves upon the purchaser at a tax sale to show, in support of his title, the strictest compliance with every formality, not only in the levy and assessment of the tax, but likewise in the form and manner of making such sales. The question in such cases as are here referred to, is altogether different from that presented in this case, and was decided under an altogether different state of law from that applicable to like questions with us.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">There being no valid appeal bond to give this court jurisdiction of this case, it is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
