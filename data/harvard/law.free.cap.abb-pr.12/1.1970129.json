Tinney sued the New Jersey Steamboat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Company for injuries suffered by Mm while being carried as a passenger on one of the defendants\u2019 line of steamboats from Hew York to Albany. The plaintiff embarked on the defendant\u2019s boat \u201c Dean Richmond,\u201d at Hew York, and retired to sleep in a berth furnished him by the company, and to which Ms ticket entitled Mm. When the boat reached the dock at Albany, from some cause or other, the berth above that in which the plaintiff was sleeping, together with a passenger sleeping therein, fell down and injured the plaintiff\u2019s eye. On the trial, the plaintiff, in his behalf, and to prove that a permanent dimness of vision has resulted to him from the accident, called Dr. WMtbeck, who testified accordingly, but on cross-examination said, that he did not use the opthalmoscope, or stereoscope, and did not make a specialty of diseases of the eye. That if he had used the stereoscope he might have been led t.o attribute to other causes the effects which he supposed were due to dimness of vision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-5\">The defendant then called Dr. Robertson, who testified that he made a specialty of diseases of the eye, used the opthalmoscope and stereoscope, and by their aid had examined plaintiff\u2019s eye, and discovered no indications of permanent loss of vision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-6\">The defendant also called Messrs. Dumont &amp; Harcourt, who testified that they were respectively the general agent and general managing agent of the defendant, and had been so for many years, and were acquainted with the construction of berths in steamboats generally. They were then asked:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-7\">\u201cWere the berths on the Richmond constructed in the most approved manner of the best steamboats .built about their time and since ?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-8\">Plaintiff objected that the witness was not competent. Objection sustained and exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>At the close of the case, the defendant, among other things, requested the court to charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-5\">\u201c <em>Twelfth. </em>Considering the extraordinary character of the injuries alleged in this case, and the great difficulty attendant upon their proper investigation, great weight should be given by the jury to the opinion of scientific witnesses, accustomed to investigate the causes and effect of injuries to the eye, and a distinction should be made in favor of the opinion of those accustomed to use the most perfect instruments and processes, and who are acquainted with the most recent discoveries of science and most improved methods of treatment and investigation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-6\">The' court refused so to charge, saying to the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-7\">\u201cThat is all a question for you. It is not the business of the court to settle the weight of evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-8\">To this refusal defendant excepted. The jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff with five thousand dollars damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-9\">A motion by defendant upon the judge\u2019s minutes for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against evidence and on the ground of excessive damages, was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-10\">From the judgment entered on the verdict and from the order denying a new trial, defendant appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b15-11\"><em>W. P. Prentice, </em>for defendant, appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ4\">on the point that the judge erred in refusing to charge the twelfth request, cited Tucker v. Williams, 2 <em>Hilt., </em>562; Anthony <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 <em>Bosw., </em>503; Smith <em>v. </em>Gugerty, 4 <em>Barb., </em>614; Brehm <em>v. </em>Great Western R. R. Co., 34 <em>Id., </em>250).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b15-12\"><em>Beach &amp; Smith, </em>for plaintiff, respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b15-13\">By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"AgW\">We think that the judge erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>upon the trial, in the rejection of evidence, offered to prove by the witnesses Dumont &amp; Harcourt, the manner in which the berths of the steamer were constructed. The testimony was material, and bore upon the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence; and the witnesses, from their knowledge and experience, were competent to testify on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-5\">The courhcommitted an error in refusing to charge the twelfth request made by the counsel for the defendant. The proposition there laid down was correct and should have been presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-6\">There was also error in refusing the motion for a new trial upon the minutes, upon the ground that the damages were excessive. The amount on the verdict was large, and not commensurable with the character of the injury, which was merely a temporary loss of sight, if any. It evinces that the jury must have been misled, not prejudiced, and presents a case for the interference of the court for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-7\">As the grounds stated are sufficient to authorize a new trial, it is not important to examine the other questions raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-8\">The judgment and order must, be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b15-14\"> Present, Miller, P.
