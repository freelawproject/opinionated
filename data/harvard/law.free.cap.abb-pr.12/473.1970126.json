Green sued the New York Central Railroad, in the New York common pleas, to recover against the defendants, as common carriers, for the loss of plaintiff\u2019s baggage while he was a passenger on defendant\u2019 s road, which the complaint alleged extended from little Falls to New York city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-8\">On the trial, it appeared that the defendants were a corporation operating a railroad for the transportation of freight and passengers between Buffalo and Albany <em>(Laws of </em>1853, ch. 76), and also a branch line running from Schenectady to Athens, on the Hudson river. In September, 1867, plaintiff, at Little Falls, applied\" for a check for his trunk by way of Albany and the People\u2019s Line of Steamers, to New York-city, that being the way he proposed to go himself. The request was refused, on the ground that the rules of the company would not allow it, which was the fact. On the plaintiff\u2019s inquiring if an exception could not be made to oblige him, the station agent told him he would like to oblige him, but could not on account of the rules of the company; that he would check the trunk to Albany, and the plaintiff could have it rechecked there. The People\u2019s Line of Steamers was running two lines of . steamers. One boat went to Athens, and the other boat went to Albany, but not connecting-with defendant\u2019s road. The plaintiff then consented to checking the trunk to Albany; but, on examination, no Albany check could be found. The agent proposed to mark the trunk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>for Albany, but the plaintiff declined. The agent suggested that the plaintiff allow the trunk to go by the way of Athens, as it would reach New York the same time as by the way of Albany, to which the plaintiff assented, and he received a check for the trunk to New York by the way of Athens. This check was one belonging to the People\u2019s Line of Steamers, and was stamped as follows: \u201cNew York, People\u2019s Line of Steamers, No. 5, Little Falls.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-4\">It did not appear on the trial that there was any partnership or community of interest between the defendant and the People\u2019s Line of Steamers, but it was shown that the two companies were in the habit of exchanging checks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-5\">The plaintiff paid no fare or passage money nor engaged any passage at Little Falls for any place, but when on the defendants\u2019 cars, on the way to Albany, paid his fare to that place. Defendants delivered his trunk to the Peoples\u2019 Line at Athens, but it was lost or destroyed the next day by the sinking of their steamboat \u201cDean Richmond,\u201d on her passege from Athens to New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">Plaintiff first presented a claim for his loss to that line, but afterwards made a claim against the defendants for the value of his lost baggage. On the trial he was permitted to testify, against defendants\u2019 objection and exception, that on its presentation to defendants\u2019 superintendent, that person said, \u201c You (plaintiff) have a very good claim.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-7\">A motion to dismiss the complaint was made, which was denied, and an exception taken. A verdict was rendered for seven hundred and seventy-seven dollars and eighty-two cents, for the value of the lost baggage, and the exceptions ordered to be heard in the first instance at general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-8\"><em>Theron R. </em>Strong, for defendant, appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0k\">I. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The rule is well settled that independent of statute, a carrier receiving property which is to be transported beyond his own line, discharges his responsibility by carrying it over his own route, and delivering it to the next carrier on the way to its destination (Van Santvoord v. St. John, 6 <em>Hill, </em>157; Hempstead <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central R. R. Co., 28 <em>Barb., </em>485; Salinger <em>v. </em>Simmons, 2 <em>Lans., </em>325; S.

In eases of connecting railroads, it is provided by statute, that <em>\u201c </em>whenever two or more railroads are connected together, any company owning either of said roads, receiving freight to be transported to any place on the line of either of the said roads so connected, shall be liable as common carriers for the delivery of such freight at such place\u201d <em>(Laws </em>of 1847, ch. 270, p. 298). This statute recognizes the rule at common law as above stated, and was designed to modify it as to connecting railroads, to which alone it is applicable. It has no application to a case of connecting routes of transportation by other modes, or by a railroad and steamboats. Ror is this statute applicable to any case unless the facts requisite to constitute the liability are averred in the complaint (Hempstead <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central R. R. Co., 28 <em>Barb., </em>502).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>Charles M. Da Costa, </em>for the plaintiff, respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa_\">I. Whether or not the defendant\u2019s line extended all the way to Hew York was immaterial, for the rule is now well settled in our State that, when several separate carriers, owning distinct portions of a continuous route, between two termini, employ the same agents to sell passage tickets, and to receive baggage to be carried over the entire route, an action may be maintained as against one of them for loss of baggage received at one terminus to be carried on the whole route (Hart <em>v. </em>R. &amp; S. R. R. Co., 8 N. <em>Y. </em>[4 <em>Seld.], </em>37; Quimby <em>v. </em>Vanderbilt, 17 <em>Id., </em>306). See also the article entitled \u201c <em>The responsibility of common carriers beyond their own lines,\u201d </em>in the <em>Albany Law Journal, </em>vol. 3, p. 485, where all the authorities, English and American, are cited and ably commented on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-5\">IT. Whether the plaintiff did or did not pay his fare on the day in question, was entirely immaterial. The defendants would still be liable. For the delivery of a trunk into the possession of a railroad station master at his station, for transportation, and his reception of the same for that purpose, imposed upon the corporation the obligation of a common carrier, even thougli the passenger go by another conveyance. In the latter case, however, the carrier receives the baggage as freight, and has a lien for his charges thereon. In the case of the Elvira Harbeck, 2 <em>Blatchf. C. Ct., </em>336, 339, the court (Helsoe, J.) said: \u201cIn cases where the passenger accompanies his baggage, the fare charged for his passage includes compensation for its transportation, and the carrier becomes responsible for its safe delivery. If the passenger does not accompany it, the carrier may claim compensation in advance for its transportation, or may postpone his claim till the delivery, and rely on his lien, or on the personal responsibility of the owner. And I do not see why the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>of responsibility for .the safe-keeping and delivery should not be the same in both cases. The actual payment of the freight in the one case, and the actual liability and lien for its payment in the other, constitute the consideration for the undertaking.\u201d And the above doctrine was cited with approval and followed by the supreme court of Maine, in a case somewhat similar to the case at bar (Wilson <em>v. </em>Grand Trunk Railway Co. of Canada, 57 <em>Maine, </em>138).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b490-5\">By the Court. \u2014 Robinson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acy\">There was no proof to maintain the issue raised by the pleadings, that defendants were common carriers of passengers and their baggage, between Little Falls and <em>New York, </em>or that they had any authority, as a corpoartion, to contract for the carriage of passengers or their baggage by steamboat, on the Hudson river. Although forming a connecting line with the Peoples\u2019 Line of steamboats, running from Athens to Hew York, there was no evidence of the existence of any agreement between defendants and that line, by which they had any community of interest in, or management or control over, the carriage of passengers on the Hudson river, either from Albany or Athens to Hew York, by force of which, had they been carriers at large, they would, within the principle of Champion <em>v. </em>Bostwick (18 <em>Wend., </em>175), have been liable for the default of their associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">As a general rule, the responsibility of a railroad corporation (such as the defendants\u2019), established for the transportation of freight or passengers between certain places, commences when the freight or passenger is accepted for transportation, and terminates by a safe delivery at the end of the route; and it is not liable, except as a forwarder, for goods marked or shipped for a remoter point, unless it is authorized to make a contract extending its liabilities and contracts accordingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>(Redf. on Railways, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 181, 183; Burroughs <em>v. </em>N. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 100 <em>Mass., </em>26; Hempstead <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central R. R. Co., 28 <em>Barb., </em>485; Dillon <em>v. </em>N. Y. &amp; Erie R. R. Co., 1 <em>Hilt., </em>231; Johnson <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central R. R. Co., 33 <em>N. Y., </em>610; Sallinger <em>v. </em>Simmons, 2 <em>Lans., </em>497; Root <em>v. </em>Great Western R. R. Co., 45 <em>N. Y., </em>524; Straiton <em>v. </em>N. Y. &amp; N. Haven R. R. Co., 2 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>184).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In the absence of any express contract to carry the plaintiff or his baggage to Hew York, or of evidence of defendants being common carriers between Athens and Hew York, <em>via </em>the Hudson river, the mere fact of their affixing to plaintiff\u2019s trunk a baggage check of the Peoples\u2019 Line, furnished no proof by way of implication of any assumption of such duty. Ho fare was received for his passage to Hew York, nor any agreement made to carry his trunk as freight. It was accepted as baggage and as an incident to his becoming a passenger on defendants\u2019 road to Albany, and the undertaking to carry it to Athens and there deliver it to the Peoples\u2019 Line, was a substituted service agreed on by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Under the general railroad act (3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>5 ed., 634, \u00a7 34), the plaintiff might have insisted upon a check on- defendants\u2019 road to Albany, but accepted one of the steamboat company, which was only properly issuable when the passenger purchased a through ticket of that line to Hew York, on their steamboats (see subsequent act of 1868, ch. 573; 7 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>Edmond\u2019s ed., 317, which recognized previous practice and obligations). If he became a passenger on their boat at Albany, the liability of that company probably attached ; if not, he became liable to them, and not to defendants, for freight on the trunk from Athens to Hew York.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">By the act of 1847 (ch. 270, \u00a7 9), \u201c whenever two or more <em>railroads </em>are connected together, any company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>owning either of said roads receiving freight to be transported to any place on the line of either of said roads so connected, shall be liable as common carriers for the delivery of such freight at any such place.\u201d But there is no other provision of law authorizing a railroad corporation so to contract for the carriage of a passenger by any steamboat line, or vessel connecting with or starting from any place to which such railroad may run, or have indirect connection by or through other railroads. Such a construction of their ordinary powers would enable them to become common carriers over the whole globe, free from the contracted limitations of their charter, or of the general prohibition of the statute (1 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>600, \u00a7 3) against their exercising other powers than those expressly conferred by their charters, or necessary to the exercise of those enumerated and given.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In my opinion, defendants did not, and if they did, had not the power to contract for the carriage of plaintiff\u2019s trunk on the Hudson river, but fully discharged every obligation by its delivery to the Peoples\u2019 Line, at Athens.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The objection to the admission made by defendants\u2019 superintendent on presentation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for lost baggage (fol. 16), that \u201che had a good claim,\u201d was improperly overruled. The statement constituted no part of the <em>res gestee, </em>but related to a past transaction, and was inadmissible as evidence against his principal (Baptist Ch. <em>v. </em>Brooklyn Fire Ins. Co., 28 N. <em>Y., </em>153; Mallory <em>v. </em>Perkins, 9 <em>Bosw., </em>572; Green <em>v. </em>Hudson River R. R. Co., 32 <em>Barb., </em>25; Luby <em>v. </em>Hudson River R. R. Co., 17 <em>N.

Smith, </em>165).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\"> Compare, however, Perkins <em>v. </em>Portland, &amp;c.
