Pngsley, in an action in the supreme court, first district, levied it on the balance standing to his account in the Sixth National Bank, and received from the cashier a certificate that, on January 22, 1870 (the day. when the levy was made), Pngsley had to his credit in the bank the sum of one thousand and sixty-two dollars and eighty-seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>cents. Afterwards, and on April 29, 1870, judgment by default was entered for one thousand and ninety-five dollars and fifty-five cents; and, on the same day, execution was issued and levied on the funds which had been attached. The Sixth National Bank refused to pay over the money; whereupon the plaintiff, on May 9, obtained from a judge of the court (who was, during that month, holding the special term of the court at chambers, and was sitting in chambers of the court when he made the judge\u2019s orders herein mentioned), an <em>ex-parte </em>order commanding \u201c The Sixth National Bank, its officers, agents, attorneys and servants and especially the said A. E. Colson,\u201d (the cashier), to surrender to the sheriff all moneys, funds. &amp;c., belonging to Pugsley, \u201c and especially the money heretofore levied upon under the warrant of attachment,\u201d or to show cause at chambers before the judge granting the order, why they should not be punished as for a contempt of the court. The order was signed with the judge\u2019s full name merely, with the usual addition, \u201c J. SI C.,\u201d [Justice of the supreme court.] On the day appointed to show cause, the Sixth National Bank appeared and submitted the affidavit of its cashier, stating that the certificate on the attachment had been given under a mistake of facts, and that, in reality, Pugsley was indebted to the bank to a large amount in excess of his deposit. The judge thereupon made an order that the president, the cashier, and the note teller of the bank appear before him at chambers of the court, on May 14, 1870, and submit to an examination as to the credit of Pugsley with the bank, and that the examination so taken be used on the further hearing of the motion, which was adjourned until two days after the examination. That order was entitled : \u201cAt chambers, New York, May 12, 1870,\u201d but was signed with the judge\u2019s initials only, followed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>word \u201c enter,\u201d as if it had been an order of the court, and was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-5\">The examination was had accordingly, and the judge being of opinion that the Sixth national Bank had no claims upon the money, as against the plaintiffs, made an order, dated September 29, 1870, commanding \u201cthe officers\u201d of the bank to pay over the moneys within twenty-four hours after service of a copy of the order, or be committed as for a contempt. The order recited the fact that the motion had been made \u20181 on the part of the sheriff;\u201d it was entitled at special term of the court, was signed with the judge\u2019s initials and the direction to \u201center,\u201d and was entered with the clerk as an order of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-6\">Upon service of that order, the Sixth Hation\u00e1l Bank obtained from another judge of the court, an order that the plaintiff and sheriff show cause before \u201cone of the justices of this court, at chambers, at a special term of this court,\u201d why the order last mentioned and also that of May 9, should not be set aside and vacated. On the hearing at special term, the motion to set aside the orders was denied, and an order of the court to that effect was entered October 11, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-7\">From that order the Sixth national Bank appealed to the general term of the court for the first department, where the appeal was dismissed, upon the ground that, in the opinion of the court, the order appealed from was not appealable,\u2014not affecting a substantial right,\u2014and that, if the appellants intended to appeal at all, they should have appealed from the order of September 29. The present appeal to the court of appeals was thereupon taken from that order of dismissal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-8\"><em>Burton </em>N. Harrison, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHC\">I. The order appealed from is appealable to this court. That an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>order dismissing an appeal to the general term, of the supreme court is appealable to this court, is well settled (Bates <em>v. </em>Voorhees, 20 N. <em>Y., </em>525; Maltby <em>v. </em>Green, 1 <em>Keyes, </em>548; and In the Matter of Duff, 10 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>N. <em>S., </em>410). And, as this is an appeal from an order after judgment, and not from a judgment, the facts are reviewable in this court as well as the law (Gillig <em>v. </em>Maass, 28 N. <em>Y., </em>197; Griscom <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c., 12 <em>Id., </em>590). This appeal brings up the entire merits of the order (Bates <em>v. </em>Voorhees, 20 N. <em>Y., </em>527-8).</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-5\">II. The orders moved to be set aside were made under section 297 of the Code. The Sixth National Bank, appellants, were not a party to the action after judgment in which the orders were made, and the judge had no authority to order them to surrender the amount of the pretended credit, to the sheriff, upon the writ of execution, though it was alleged to be the property of the judgment debtor, until they had first been made a party to the proceeding authorized by section 294,' and had an opportunity to be heard in answer to the allegation. When such a proceeding was afterwards instituted, and the appellants\u2019 officers examined, they denied the alleged indebtedness, and claimed an absolute title and interest in the property in the appellants, adverse \"to the judgment debtor. By the Code (\u00a7 299), in such a case the indebtedness is recoverable only in an action by a receiver of the property of the judgment debtor (Edmonston <em>v. </em>McLoud, 19 <em>Barb., </em>362; Tompkins County Bank <em>v. </em>Trapp, 2L <em>How. Pr., </em>20 ; Rodman v. Henry, 17 N. <em>Y., </em>484, citing many authorities). The authority of the cases quoted has never been questioned ; it is conclusive. It is only undisputed property of the judgment debtor, Which the judge can order to be surrendered in this proceeding. He can never make an order, under section 297 of the Code, where the indebtedness or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>amount of the indebtedness alleged to be due from the thh\u2019d person is either disputed or uncertain. The assertion of claim by the third party puts an immediate stop to the proceedings. The judge cannot try the validity of the claim in this proceeding\u2014there must be a formal trial in a new action, in which the third party is defendant, and a receiver of the property of the judgment debtor is plaintiff (7 <em>Robt., </em>64 ; 1 Hilt., 505 ; 10 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>103 ; 9 <em>How. Pr., </em>97; 13 <em>Id., </em>137; 12 <em>Id., </em>139; 22 <em>Id., </em>3; 12 <em>Id., </em>307; 5 <em>Id., </em>16; 23 <em>Id., </em>423; 26 <em>Id., </em>155; 34 <em>Id., </em>333 ; 40 <em>Barb., </em>242). Before the adoption of the Code, the remedies of a judgment creditor, against third parties who were supposed to haye the property of the judgment debtor which should be'applied on the judgment, were to be pursued only after filing a \u201ccreditor\u2019s bill\u201d in chancery and the appointment thereupon of a receiver of the property of the judgment debtor\u2014and, if the third party disputed the claim of the judgment creditor that the property belonged to the judgment debtor, that question was an issue to be tried by a jury in a proceeding in which the third party himself was necessarily a defendant (2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>174, \u00a7\u00a7 38, 39; 2 <em>Barb. Ch. Pr., </em>153 ; Robeson <em>v. </em>Ford, 3 <em>Edw. Ch., </em>442); and, \u201cThe trial by jury in all cases in which it has been heretofore used, shall remain inviolate forever\u201d <em>(Const. of N. Y., </em>Art. 1, \u00a72).</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-5\">III. The order, from which the appeal was taken to the general term of the supreme court, was an order of the court at special term denying the motion of the Sixth national Bank for an order vacating \"and setting aside the orders of May 9, and September 29, 1870, which were both orders of a judge merely, sitting as a judge and not as the court. 1. That those were judge\u2019s orders only, is evident with regard to the first from an inspection of it. It is not entitled\u2014it is signed with the judge\u2019s full name\u2014cause is to be shown be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>fore the judge himself, not before \u201c one of the justices of the court\u201d\u2014and, throughout, the judge speaks in the first person. We might rest there, inasmuch as the proceeding having been instituted before a judge out of court, and by him' ordered, as judge merely, to continue before him as judge, and not before the court\u2014the court could have no functions to perform in the premises until specially moved, which was not done until appellant\u2019s motion was made, October 1, and denied October 11. And although the order next in succession, that of May 12, which adjourned the hearing, is drawn with less accuracy and precision in some of its details, it is still avowedly an order of the judge merely. It is entitled not as an order of the court, but as a judge\u2019s order, made out of court, \u201cat chambers, New York, May 12, 1870.\u201d It requires appellants\u2019 officers to appear before the judge who made it, to be examined, not before the court or \u201cone of the justices of the court.\u201d And it shows that it is still the same proceeding which was before the judge, by referring to it throughout as \u201cthis <em>motion,\u201d\u2014i. </em>e., the motion under the order of May 9. It was entered with the clerk ; but that was merely because the judge, who-was holding special term of the court during that month, inadvertently 'signed it with his initials and the usual direction to enter. The motion being thus before a judge and not before the court, the order in which it resulted should have been so drawn as to express the fact that it was a judge\u2019s order merely. The order of September 29 is therefore incorrect as drawn,, in that it is entitled as an order of the court. It should, by its title, recitals and form of order, have avowed itself an order of the judge, made out of court\u2014which in effect it was. AM it must be so regarded and ' treated by this court. The books are full of cases, in proceedings similar to this, in which it has been-expressly ruled that the mere order of a judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>does not change its character or acquire any new force or effect, from entitling and entering it as an order of the court. The title does not change the fact, or make the order an order of the court (Wickes v. Dresser, 13 <em>How. Pr., </em>336; see, also, 18 <em>How. Pr., </em>245 ; 22 <em>Id., </em>309 ; Matter of Knickerbocker Bank, 19 <em>Barb., </em>602, at N. Y. general term; Dresser v. Van Pelt, 15 <em>How. Pr., </em>19; 5 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>53 ; 10 <em>How. Pr., </em>425; Bitting v. Vandenburg, 17 <em>Id., </em>80; Carter v. Clarke, 7 <em>Robt., </em>497; Matter of Smethurst, 2 <em>Sandf., </em>724). 2. Whether these orders are avowedly a judge\u2019s orders or not, this court will hold it to be a fact that they are such, and that they could be nothing else, for the Sixth National Bank, the appellants, were not parties to the action, after judgment in which the obnoxious orders were made, but were third parties, and section 297 of the Code, which, in a proper case, is the authority to a <em>judge </em>to make orders like those moved to be vacated, does not give any such power to the court\u2014and the court cannot claim it from any other source (Miller v. Rossman, 15 <em>How. Pr., </em>11; Davis v. Turner, 4 <em>Id., </em>190; Bitting v. Vandenburg, 17 <em>Id., </em>80; Carter v. Clarke, 7 <em>Robt., </em>497 ; Hawes v. Barr, <em>Id., </em>454; Kelly v. McCormick, 2 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>503; Matter of Smethurst, 2 <em>Sandf., </em>726; Fenner v. Sanborn, 3 <em>Id., </em>613; Joyce v. Holbrook, 2 <em>Hilt., </em>95; 13 <em>How. Pr., </em>435, 470). There has never been, then, any difficulty or hesitation about holding that such orders as those of May 9 and May 12 in this case are and must be treated as orders of a judge merely, and not of the court\u2014however entitled. And, 3. In the common pleas and Hew York superior court there has never been any doubt as to the rule that such an order as that of September 29,\u2014which is an order that appellants\u2019 officers be committed as for contempt if they continue to disobey the order of May 9,\u2014can be made only by the judge <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7 302) whose order has been disobeyed, and not by the court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>And, although, in a few reported cases in several of the districts of the supreme court, there occur unguarded expressions which seem to indicate that some of the justices have supposed that the order of commitment <em>may, </em>upon occasion, be made by the court, as well as by the judge\u2014reference to such cases will ascertain the fact that they all refer to and rely upon the decision of Justice Clerks in Wickes <em>v. </em>Dresser (13 <em>How. Pr., </em>331) as the authority which, excuses them from an inquiry into the reasons for the opinion. But an examination of that decision shows that, although the learned judge there gives what he considered several reasons which, in a case requiring it, would induce him to hold that the court may punish as for contempt of a judge\u2019s order, he expressly says that he did not then pretend to so decide, because it was unnecessary to pass upon the point in the case before him, and his decision of the case went upon another and very different ground. And even his reasoning upon the question was discredited in the later case, between the same parties, where it was relied upon by one of the counsel (reported in 14 <em>How. Pr., </em>465), when, as Justice lxgraham says (45 <em>Barb., </em>344), \u201cthe contrary rule was adopted\u201d\u2014and where the court expressly held that the court has no power to make even the order of commitment. \u201c The court, as such, cannot punish, because no contempt is shown to its authority, and no power is given to it to punish for contempt of the orders of the judge\u201d (Matter of Smethurst, <em>2 Sandf., </em>726, with which agrees Kelly <em>v. </em>McCormick, 28 <em>N. Y., </em>320); and the rule is now established (People <em>v. </em>Brennan, 45 <em>Barb., </em>344). If, therefore, the order of September 29 is indeed an order of the court, it is null and void as being <em>ultra vires. </em>2 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>(535, 536), prescribes the powers of punishing for contempts, and shows that the only case in which the court can punish for contempt of \u00e1 mere judge\u2019s order is that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>which the order directs an attorney or other officer of the court to pay moneys, and in which no one but the disobedient officer himself can be so punished. Notwithstanding the title, therefore, and form, of the order of September 39, it, too, must be regarded and treated, if as of any effect at all, as a judge\u2019s order merely, and not as an order of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-5\">IY. 1. There is no such thing, under our Code, as a direct <em>appeal </em>from a mere judge\u2019s order, whether made <em>ex-parte </em>or on notice. Unless the order is an order of the court at special term, there is no appeal from it to the general term. The Code, in section 37, and elsewhere, distinctly recognizes the fact that there is necessarily a large volume of judicial business which not only may but must be done by judges not only out of the court room, but when they are \u201cnot engaged in holding court.\u201d Instead of an appeal, section 334 expressly allows a motion to the court to set it aside and vacate it, as a means of correcting a judge\u2019s order made <em>ex-parte </em>in transacting such business. And as there is no express prescription of the method to be pursued to correct a judge\u2019s order in such business made upon notice, we are referred for it, by section 469, to the \u201crules and practice\u201d which.regulated that matter at the time the Code went into operation. 3. In some \u00f3f the earlier cases, argued soon after the Code went into operation, it was suggested by counsel that, to correct judges\u2019 orders like those herein complained of, there should be <em>certiorari </em>to the judge who made them, to bring the proceedings into court; because it was thought that, although such orders were made by a person who chanced to be a judge of the very court from which it was proposed that the writ should issue, they were made by him as a special statutory tribunal exercising functions required to be performed by him as such, and not as a judge of the court. That suggestion went upon the theory under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>which it was once the practice in the old supreme court to issue <em>certiorari </em>to the judges themselves, in order to review proceedings had before them in assessment cases and others, in which it was suggested that they had acted as commissioners and not as the court or as judges of the court. But that practice in the old supreme court was discredited by, and has never been followed by any court in this State since, the decision of the court of errors in Striker v. Kelly (2 <em>Den., </em>323), in 1845. Gardiner, President, there stigmatized it as \u201cincongruous,\u201d for the reasons that <em>certiorari </em>cannot issue except to a subordinate court or inferior tribunal; and that the supreme court could not deal with any of its own justices as an inferior tribunal, because the constitution of the State expressly provided that they should \u201cnot hold any other office or public trust,\u201d\u2014 which it was in that case held, that they must be considered to be doing, if any of their orders could be reviewed by the court upon <em>certiorari. </em>That prohibition is, by article VI., section 10, of the present constitution, applied to the existing supreme court; and the present supreme court itself, in 1851, in a case exactly like ours, adopted the rule laid down by the court of errors, and decided that <em>certiorari </em>will not lie from the court to review a judge\u2019s order made by one of its own justices. See Lindsay <em>v. </em>Sherman (5 <em>How. Pr., </em>308), which has always been followed since. 3. But, to get rid of a mere <em>judge1 s order </em>made whether <em>ex-parte </em>or upon notice, the proper practice is, and always has been, to move the court, upon notice, or upon an order to show cause returnable before the court, to set it aside and vacate it. <em>(a.) </em>That has always been the practice in the English courts (2 <em>Arch. Pr. K. B.,1 </em>Am. ed., from 1 Lond. ed., p. 278; and see 1 <em>Tidd Pr., </em>3 Am. ed., 511; see, also, the decisions of Abbott, C. J., in Wood <em>v. </em>Kirk, 1 <em>Chit., </em>246, and of Lord Abinger, C. B., in Pike <em>v. </em>Davis, 6 <em>Mees. &amp; W., </em>546, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>which were cases in which the judge\u2019s order moved to be set aside had been made upon the hearing after notice by summons to attend before the judge.) Where the judge\u2019s order is made a rule of court before the motion is made, the motion should be to set aside both <em>t </em>rule of the court and the judge\u2019s order (Tindal, C. J., in Clement <em>v. </em>Weaver, 6 <em>Jurist, </em>62). (5.) That was the proper practice in our own courts, before the Code was adopted (1 <em>Burr. </em>Pr., 348-350 ; 1 <em>Dunl. </em>Pr., 307-309). And the books are full of reported cases in which it was enforced (2 <em>Wend., </em>627; 6 <em>Id., </em>555; 9 <em>Id., </em>470 ; 2 <em>Cow., </em>587; <em>Id., </em>463; 3 <em>Id., </em>73; 3 <em>Hill, </em>455). It was the same whether the judge\u2019s order to be got rid of was made by him <em>ex-parte </em>or upon the hearing on an order to show cause returnable before him, which is equivalent to the summons to attend before the judge in England (1 <em>Burr. Pr., </em>350; 1 <em>Dunl. Pr., </em>307; 2 <em>Paine &amp; D. Pr., </em>50; 1 <em>Johns. Cas., </em>245; 4 <em>Cow., </em>539). (c.) And it is always held that it is still the proper practice in our courts since the Code went into operation, whether the judge\u2019s order complained of is <em>ex-parte </em>or made after a hearing upon an order to show cause returnable before him. The latest reports of practice cases are full of examples : <em>e. g., </em>Follet <em>v. </em>Weed, 3 <em>How. Pr., </em>361; Blake v. Locy, 6 <em>Id., </em>109; Lindsay <em>v. </em>Sherman, 5 <em>Id., </em>308; in which last case, the learned and lucid decision of Justice Hand, in 1851, is solely to that one point. The rule was exhaustively discussed, and firmly established in the proceedings in Bank of Genesee <em>v. </em>Spencer. Like Lindsay v. Sherman, that was a review of an order in \u201c supplementary proceedings,\u201d similar to those in our case. An order had been made by Justice Mullet, at his chambers, but upon notice <em>(i. e\u201e, </em>upon an order to show cause), and after hearing the parties. The party aggrieved appealed to the general term of the seventh district, which dismissed the appeal on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>that' the proper practice was to move the court at special term to vacate and set aside the judge\u2019s order. Thereafter, the motion was so made and denied, on the ground that, in the opinion of the justice holding special term, the general term was in error, and the remedy was not by the motion, but by appeal. Upon appeal from that last order, the general term (in 1857) reversed the special term order, on the ground, as reported, that: \u201cto get rid of an order improperly made by a judge at chambers, the proper practice is to move the coart to set it aside\u201d (Bank of <em>Grenesee v. </em>Spencer, 15 <em>How. Pr., </em>15; see, also, Boyd <em>v. </em>Bigelow, 14 <em>Id., </em>511, decided by the Erie general term in 1857, and citing 5 <em>Id., </em>308). Those decisions were made when the Code, in section 349, was as follows: \u201cAn appeal may, in like manner, and within the same time, be taken from an order made at a special term, <em>or by a single judge </em>of the same court.\u201d In 1862 that section of the Code was amended so as to read: \u201cAn appeal may, in like manner, and within the same time, be taken from an order made <em>at a special term by </em>a single judge of the same court or county, &amp;c.\u201d \u2014which removes any doubt as to the fact that that section is strictly within the purview of part 2, title XI., chapter IV. of the Code, in which it occurs, which is entitled: \u201c Appeals <em>in </em>the supreme court and the superior court, and court of common pleas of the city of New York, from a single judge to the general term.\u201d It applies only to an order made by a single judge <em>sitting as a court, </em>whether actually in the court and during term and entered there immediately with the clerk, or (under \u00a7 350) out of court upon notice (being, by consent of parties or after an adjournment, under \u00a7 24, of the same force and effect as if made in court), and subsequently entered with the clerk as the order of the court. It must be and avow itself an order of the court, and be made in a proceeding pending in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>court, and have reference to matter in which the court, as a court, can make an order. That is the only case in which an appeal can be taken immediately to the general term. If it is an order made, whether at the court room or elsewhere, in a proceeding pending before the judge merely as such, and having reference to matter in which the judge, not the court, is authorized to make the order (which is our case here), there is no immediate appeal, and the only remedy is by moving the court to set aside the improper order of the judge. It was so held in a late case [citing Lindsay v. Sherman, 5 <em>How. Pr., </em>308; Conway v. Hitchings, 9 <em>Barb., </em>378, 387; Bank of Genesee <em>v. </em>Spencer, 15 <em>How. Pr., </em>14] : Union Bank of Troy <em>v. </em>Sargeant (53 <em>Barb., </em>424). In Thayer\u2019s case, the Onondaga general term, in 1865, held the same to be the rule \u2022, and further, that if the judge\u2019s order has been entered as an order of the court, the only remedy is still by motion to the court at special term to set it aside, and by appeal to the general term from the order of the special term denying that motion\u2014which is the English rule as shown by the cases above cited\u2014and which is exactly the practice pursued by the appellants here (Kelly <em>v. </em>Thayer, 34 <em>How. Pr., </em>168). And, that section 350 of the Code does not apply to a mere <em>judges order, </em>is shown by the facts, 1, that the orders to which it refers are \u201cincluded\u201d in \u201cthe last section\u201d (\u00a7 349), which has reference as is shown above, only to orders of the <em>court </em>/ and, 2, that it is only an order which is and is intended to be an order of the <em>court </em>which can be entered with the clerk of the court. That section was intended only to reach the case where, after an adjournment under section 24, or by consent of parties, a term of the court, for matters pending in the court, is held, not in the court room, but at some place where the clerk is not present, and where the books of the court are not accessible. If an order is made in such a case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the judge who presides hands it to the attorney of the party in whose favor it is\u2014with the expectation, of course, that he will carry it to the clerk to be entered ; but the expectation may be disappointed. Until entry is actually made, the order cannot be appealed from ; and the object of section 350 is to secure to the adverse party his remedy of appeal, by enabling him to compel the successful party to enter the order with the clerk.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-5\">Y. The papers used on appellant\u2019s motion show that they denied the alleged debt to the judgment debtor, and claimed an inter'est in the property adverse to him. That denial and claim entitled them to a trial of the issues by a jury, and to the continued possession and enjoyment of the property until taken from them by a judgment after verdict, on those issues \u2014as of strict, legal, and absolute <em>right (Code, </em>\u00a7 299). By their motion to the court to strike out the judge\u2019s orders which attempted to deprive them of that right, they have pursued the proper and only remedy known to our laws or practice, and the court below had no discretion to withhold what they demanded. The order appealed from denied that remedy, and thereby unquestionably affected a <em>substantial </em>right of appellants\u2014within the strictest definition of that term, as used in the Code (Congdon <em>v. </em>Dows, 28 <em>N. Y., </em>128; Matter of Duff, 10 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S., </em>440). It is no reply to suggest that, if the judge\u2019s orders were <em>ultra \u00f1ires, </em>they were null and void and therefore inoperative to injure the appellants ; and that there was no necessity for an order striking them out (Striker <em>v. </em>Mott, 6 Wend., 465). The case is not at all analogous to those like Bank of Genesee <em>v. </em>Spencer (18 <em>N. Y., </em>151), where the former court of appeals dismissed ah appeal from an order denying a motion to set aside an execution issued, without leave, more than five years after judgment. That was for the reason that, there, the writ on its face (unlike the order of September 29 in the case at bar), disclosed its invalidity; and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>sheriff, being so informed by the execution itself that it was null and void, would have no defense to an action for damages for a levy under it. It was unnecessary to set aside such an execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-5\">YI. The foregoing reasoning has been upon the assumption that the order of October 11 was an order in a <em>civil </em>action, though made in \u201c supplementary proceedings. But, whatever may be the nature of \u201csupplementary proceedings\u201d by the judgment creditor against the judgment debtor himself (under \u00a7 292 of the Code), both of whom were parties to the action in which the judgment was recovered\u2014it has been repeatedly held that these proceedings, so far as they are carried on by the sheriff or the judgment creditor against a <em>third party </em>(under \u00a7\u00a7 294, 297 and 299) are <em>special proceedings </em>(Davis <em>v. </em>Turner, <em>4 How. Pr., </em>192; and see Holstein <em>v. </em>Rice, 15 <em>Abb. </em>Pr., 308). And, if the definitions of a \u201ccivil action\u201d and \u201cspecial proceedings\u201d furnished by the Code itself are of any avail, it is difficult to see how there can be any difficulty about classifying them. \u201c \u00a7 2. An action is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice, by which a party prosecutes another party for the enforcement or protection of a right, &amp;c.\u201d And section 127 directs that \u201ccivil actions in the courts of record of this State <em>shall </em>be commenced by the service of a summons.\u201d But the proceedings by -the sheriff in this case, against these appellants, were certainly not by a party to any action against another party to that action \u2014they were before a judge merely, and not in any court\u2014they were very far from being ordinary proceedings\u2014and they were not commenced by the service of a summons on appellants. They have, therefore, none of the characteristics of an action, and must be classified under section 3, which declares that \u201c every other remedy is a special proceeding.\u201d The act of <em>1854 </em>(ch. 270) expressly authorizes an ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>peal to the general term from any order of the special term is a special proceeding in the court. Amidon <em>v. </em>Wolcott (15 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>314, a general term decision of the supreme court in the first district, in 1860), is directly to the point that, though the proceedings had been previously before the judge merely,1 the motion to the court to vacate and set aside Ms orders, brought the proceedings into the court. Appellants were, therefore, entitled under the statute to have their appeal from the order of October 11 (which was an order of the court at special term) entertained by the general term, whether that order affected a substantial right or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-5\">VII. The respondents do not better their case by the suggestion that the orders of May 9 and September 29 may be considered to have been made, not in what the Code calls \u201cproceedings supplementary to execution,\u201d but to assist the sheriff in the prosecution of his rights and duties under the attachment, for under the attachment, as well as under the execution, the only proceeding which can be had to determine the claims of tMrd parties to a debt which has been attached, is an action, and that whether the proceeding is instituted by the sheriff or by plaintiffs <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 232-243). \u201cAll that the sheriff could do would be to sue them for the debt\u201d (Lyman <em>v. </em>Cartwright, 3 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>117). And, under the circumstances of this case, the neglect of a third party to state his claim to an interest in the property at the time the sheriff calls on him for a certificate, is no estoppel to an assertion of it afterwards. He may be held liable in a proper action for <em>damages, </em>suffered by plaintiff by reason of Ms reliance on the certificate\u2014but neither the judge nor the court has any power, in this proceeding, to determine the measure, or to enforce the payment of damages, or to decide whether any have been suffered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-6\"><em>Hammond &amp; Pomeroy, </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>By the Court. Court.\u2014Peckham J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAB\">It is insisted that this order is not appealable, but that the appeal should have been taken from the other orders, if erroneous, instead of attempting to set them aside, upon motion to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The orders sought to be set aside were made in a sort of supplementary proceedings against defendant, Pugsley, as a judgment debtor. They were made before a judge out of court, and resulted in the order of September 29, peremptorily requiring the officers of the Sixth National Bank to pay this one thousand and sixty-two dollars and eighty-seven cents to the sheriff having the execution against Pugsley, \u201c within twenty-four hours after the service of a copy of this order, or that they be committed as for a contempt, until the said order be complied with.\u201d Both of these orders seem to be proceedings with a view to punish said defaulting bank as for a contempt in not paying said money, and the last one orders that all of the officers be sent to jail as for contempt, there to remain until they pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">As these orders were made by a judge out of court, it seems to be regular practice to move to set them aside, if erroneous, before the court. The counsel for the Sixth National Bank has cited numerous cases to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">True, the Code has provided that \u201c for the purpose of an appeal, any party affected by such order, may require it to be entered with the clerk, and it shall be entered accordingly\u201d <em>(Code, </em>as amended in 1870, \u00a7 350).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">But this does not deny the other remedy. It does not assume to deprive the party aggrieved, of his right to make a motion to the court to set aside the order of a judge, made out of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>This order then, is appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Is it right upon the merits ? I think not, upon the grounds: 1. The Sixth National Bank had denied, and under oath, that it owed anything to Pugsley, the judgment debtor:\u2014in the language of the Code, had denied \u201cthe debt.\u201d In such case the Code declares that \u201csuch interest or debt shall be recoverable only in an action against such person or corporation by the receiver\u201d <em>{Code, </em>as amended in 1849, \u00a7 299). When the bank denied owing the alleged debt to the judgment debtor, the judge had no legal right to proceed to examine in that summary way whether it did owe such debt or not He had no authority, no right whatever then, to make any such determination. The law had provided another remedy, by action by a receiver, where the rights of the parties could be determined in the usual course of a suit at law. And see Rodman <em>v. </em>Henry, 17 <em>N. Y., </em>484, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">2. These orders required the officers of the bank to pay or be sent to jail, as for contempt, and there remain until they paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">It is difficult to believe that the legislature has intended to revive, in its most offensive form, this condemned remedy of imprisonment for debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">We cannot believe, and cannot adjudge, that the legislature intended to revive this odious mode of collecting debts, unless it is plainly so declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">True, the Code provides that \u201cthe judge may order any property of the judgment debtor.....in the hands either of himself or any other person, or due to the judgment debtor,' to be applied towards the satisfaction of the judgment\u201d (\u00a7 297).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">There is another provision, that if \u201cany person, party, or witness, disobey an order of a judge . . . duly served, such person .... may be , punished by the judge as for contempt\u201d; but. . . \u201cin case of inability to perform the act required, or to endure the imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ment,\u201d he may be discharged \u201cby the court or judge committing him, or the court in which the judgment was rendered, on such terms as maybe just\u201d (\u00a7 302).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">To hold that this authority extends to the collection, by these summary proceedings, of an ordinary debt due to the judgment debtor, invests a judge with a justly dreaded power over the liberty of an embarrassed or insolvent debtor. A party in extensive business, with many debts due to him, has only to allow a judgment to be recovered against him, and he may collect his desperate debts by this severe machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">He may send the debtor to jail, and then he may discharge him, according to the sense of justice the judge may entertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Inability to pay is thus made punishable with imprisonment\u2014longer or shorter\u2019, depending upon the length of notice for discharge that the imprisoned debtor must give, the ability to reach the case in its regular order of business, the time the judge may hold the case under consideration before deciding it, and the sense of justice the judge may entertain, as to the propriety of discharging the debtor :\u2014a harsh remedy for this age.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">It is not necessary by any provision of the Code, that the debtor should be able to pay, to justify an order by the judge requiring him to do so. It is sufficient that he owes a debt to the judgment debtor. The judge may then not only order him to pay it, but commit him to jail for not doing so. Simple inability to pay, is not then ground for a discharge\u2014otherwise the act would have so declared\u2014but if utterly unable to pay, he can be then discharged only upon such terms, as, to the judge, may seem just. First send him to jail, and then let him get out by due process of law\u2014always provided that he can comply with such terms as the judge deems just.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">If these provisions as to <em>\u201cproperty </em>of the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>debtor in the hands of himself or any other person, or <em>due </em>to the judgment debtor \u201d in section 297, be confined to property other than debts, choses in action, then these proceedings are without authority. This would give authority to the judge to order a person who had possession of goods, or of specific money belonging to the judgment debtor, or as the statute says, due to him, to deliver it over to the sheriff, to be applied to the satisfaction of the judgment. It not being denied that the property did in fact belong to the judgment debtor, the refusal to deliver it over as ordered, would be a willful contempt of the judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">It is a very different principle to apply this doctrine of contempt to the collection of debts. The principle of imprisonment for debt was abolished some forty years ago in this State, deliberately, and we are not disposed to revive it by uncertain implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u25a0 Therefore, the order appealed from must be reversed, and the motion to set aside the orders of .May 12, and September 29, is granted, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">It was so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b56-9\"> The amendment of 1870 does not affect this point, hut relates only to staying proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
