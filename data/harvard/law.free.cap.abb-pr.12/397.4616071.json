The respondents were precluded from taking any exception to the validity of the assignment by Meyer to the appellant, even conceding that such assignment was invalid for any of the reasons mentioned on the motion to dismiss the complaint. 1. The statute does not render an assignment made with the intent to hinder, &amp;c., creditors, absolutely void against creditors at large, but only as against such creditors as have obtained judgment and execution. (Hall <em>a. </em>Stryker, 9 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>349; Andrews <em>a. </em>Durant, 18 <em>N. Y., </em>500; and see Jackson <em>a. </em>Caldwell, 1 <em>Cow., </em>622; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Coleman <em>a. </em>Croker, 1 <em>Ves., </em>160; Bean <em>a. </em>Smith, <em>2 Mas., </em>282.) 2. And a creditor who has not proceeded to judgment and. execution, is a mere stranger, and as much bound by the act of the debtor as the debtor himself. (Andrews <em>a. </em>Durant, 18 <em>N. Y., </em>500.) 3. The proof of the fact, that a warrant of attachment \u2022had been issued in the case against Meyer, did not supersede the necessity of the respondents\u2019 proving that judgment and execution had been obtained against him. (Hall <em>a. </em>Stryker, 9 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>350; Andrews <em>a. </em>Durant, 18 <em>N. Y., </em>500.) The attachment was issued <em>ex parte. </em>(See <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 229; Hall <em>a. </em>Stryker, 9 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>350, 351.) 4. Even if the issuing of the attachment was, as to Meyer, <em>prima fade </em>a determination that the respondents were such creditors as were entitled to attack the assignment, it is not so as against the appellant, who was no party to the action in which' the attachment was issued. 5. It cannot be said, that the suggestion, as it is termed, that judgment had been entered in the action, is an admission on the part of the appellant, that the respondents Herman were creditors who had proceeded to judgment and execution against Meyer, and that the appellant is therefore estopped from denying that the respondents are in a position to attack the assignment for these reasons. It does not appear from the case, that the appellant made any admission in regard to the facts suggested to the court. The suggestion appears to have come from the respondents\u2019 counsel. Before a party can be estopped, it must appear that he has made an admission which is clearly inconsistent with the evidence he proposes to give, or the title or claim which he proposes to set up. (Dezell <em>a. </em>Odell, 3 <em>Hill, </em>215, per Bronson, J.) The appellant might admit that the Hermans were creditors at large, and yet deny that they were such creditors as would be entitled to attack the assignment; <em>i. e., </em>that they were creditors who had proceeded to judgment and execution. (See Andrews <em>a. </em>Durant, 18 <em>N. Y., </em>500.) It is very apparent, also, that the appellant did not intend to admit (conceding that he had any part in the suggestion), that the respondents Herman had obtained a judgment and execution against Meyer, because previously it had been distinctly admitted that the judgment in the case brought by the Hermans against Meyer had not been obtained until April 3d, 1858, long after the commencement of this action. 6. The true test whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>the respondents were entitled to avail themselves of the defence set np in their answers, is: Could they, at the time of interposing such defence,'have brought an action to set aside the assignment? Clearly, they could not. They must first show that they have exhausted their remedies at law. (Mohawk Bank <em>a. </em>Allerton, 2 Paige, 54; Hastings <em>a. </em>Belknap, 1 <em>Den., </em>190 ; and cases <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-5\">II. The assignment produced upon the trial is not void upon its face. The terms \u201c manage and improve\u201d must be construed with reference to the other portion of the paragraph in which they are inserted; from which it is apparent that it was the intention of the assignor that the assignee should immediately convert the stock assigned into money. (Hitchcock <em>a. </em>Cadmus, 2 <em>Barb., </em>381; and see Meachum <em>a. </em>Stevens, 9 <em>Paige, </em>398.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-6\"><em>Brown, Hall &amp; Vanderpoel, </em>and <em>Solomon L. Hull, </em>for the respondents;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av\">\u2014The assignment is void. 1. The provision enabling the assignee \u201cto manage and improve\u201d the estate, is equivalent to empowering the assignee to carry on the business, and therefore hinders and delays creditors. (Dunham <em>a. </em>Waterman, 17 <em>N. Y., </em>17; D\u2019Ivernois <em>a. </em>Leavitt, 23 <em>Barb., </em>64; Woodburn <em>a. </em>Mosher, 9 <em>Ib., </em>255; Schufeldt <em>a. </em>Abernethy, 2 <em>Duer, </em>533; Brigham <em>a. </em>Tillinghast, 3 <em>Kern, </em>215; Jessup <em>a. </em>Hulse, 29 <em>Barb., </em>539; Ogden <em>a. </em>Peters, 21 <em>N. Y., </em>24.) 2. Authorizing the assignee to sell on credit, renders the assignment void, because it hinders and delays creditors. Authorizing the assignee to manage and improve the assigned property at his discretion (a clothing-store), equally hinders and delays creditors. (Barney <em>a. </em>Griffen, 2 <em>Comst., </em>365; Nicholson <em>a. </em>Leavitt, 2 <em>Seld., </em>510; Porter <em>a. </em>Williams, 5 <em>Ib., </em>142.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-7\">[The points made by the counsel for the respondent in respect to the effect of the attachment and judgment, as enabling the defendants to impeach the assignment, were substantially the same as those made in the case of Thayer <em>a. </em>Willet (9 <em>Ante, </em>323-7).]</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-13\"> Compare Jacobs <em>a. </em>Remsen, <em>Ante, </em>390; and Thayer <em>a. </em>Willet, 9 <em>Ib., </em>325; Hall <em>a. </em>Stryker, <em>Ib., </em>342; and see Clute <em>a. </em>Finch, 25 <em>Barb., </em>428.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b414-8\">By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014Leonard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADH\">\u2014The proceeding by attachment under the Code is <em>in rem, </em>and is collateral and auxiliary to the action. The warrant authorizes the seizure of the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>erty of the defendant therein, and creates an inchoate lien thereon. Such lien would he useless as a remedy, if it cannot be defended against false or fraudulent claims made by third parties. It is said that the attaching creditor, having no judgment, does not stand in a position to resist the claims of a fraudulent purchaser from the defendant in the attachment. If so, the remedy is useless as a means of securing the debtor\u2019s property to answer the judgment which may be recovered in such action (\u00a7 232), where the debtor has transferred it to a fraudulent vendee. Section 232 also directs the sheriff to proceed in the manner required of him by law in case of attachments against absent debtors. Under the provisions of the Revised Statutes there referred to, in case the property of the debtor seized shall be claimed by any other person, the sheriff shall call a jury and try the validity of the claim; and if found in favor of the claimant, the sheriff shall deliver the property to him, unless the attaching creditors shall indemnify the sheriff. In case the indemnity is given, then the sheriff must detain the goods. It seems very inconsistent and unreasonable that the sheriff should be required to hold the property so attached, after a trial before a sheriff\u2019s jury and a verdict in favor of the claimant, if, when a like question is raised at the circuit or elsewhere in a court of record, the sheriff shall not be permitted to assail the <em>hona fieles </em>of the title of the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">There are many other strong grounds for maintaining the right of the sheriff or the attaching creditor to contest the title to property of those claiming by transfer from the debtor in the attachment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The right of trustees appointed under the Revised Statutes in attachment proceedings against absconding, concealed, or nonresident debtors, to invoke the aid of a court of equity against all parties claiming through an alleged fraudulent title derived from the debtor, has often been maintained, although the attaching creditor could prove a demand existing only by simple contract. That proceeding is taken for the benefit of all creditors who come in and prove their demands against the debtors in the attachment, and in that respect is unlike the proceeding authorized by the Code; but I am unable to perceive that this circumstance makes any difference in the application of the principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Had there been no prior decision of the Supreme Court on this question, I should not hesitate to uphold the decision of the learned judge who presided in this case at the circuit. The case of Hall <em>a. </em>Stryker (9 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>334), decided by a very eminent justice of this court, is adverse to these views, and in a case in all respects similar I should 'defer to that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">At the trial of this action it was admitted by the plaintiff that judgment had been recovered a year previously by the attaching creditors against the debtor in the same action, wherein the warrant of attachment, which was relied on as a link in the defence of this action, was granted. Ho objection was made by the plaintiff to the introduction of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">It was not a variance by which the plaintiff was misled. It was a proper case, after the evidence was in without objection, for disregarding the omission to plead the recovery of the judgment, under the authority of section 170 of the Code. The court \u25a0evidently so considered it. If I do not mistake, the justice presiding at this trial was a member of the general term, which pronounced the judgment in Hall <em>a. </em>Stryker. The defendants might have set tip this judgment before the trial by a supplemental pleading, by leave of the court. But it is quite apparent that the plaintiff was aware of its existence, and was not surprised by the evidence, candidly admitting it without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">This fact being fairly before the court, the ground of the objection raised on the authority of Hall <em>a. </em>Stryker is obviated. The trust assignment for the benefit of creditors under which the plaintiff claimed title to the property in question, derived from the debtor in the attachment, authorized the assignee to \u201c manage and improve\u201d the assigned estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">This provision renders the assignment on its face fraudulent and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> Present, Clerke, P.
