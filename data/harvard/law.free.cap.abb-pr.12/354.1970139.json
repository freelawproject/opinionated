Each of the new contracts having been made with the plaintiff, the widow of the intestate, who had possession of the note in suit, and was acting on behalf of the intestate\u2019s estate, <em>for its benefit, </em>before letters granted, her letters of administration will relate back in order that the estate may not lose the benefit of the contract, and thus enable the plaintiff to sue upon it in her representative capacity (Bodger <em>v. </em>Arch, 10 <em>Exch., </em>333; <em>Williams on Exrs., </em>557, London ed., 1866). The distinction between the time of the vesting of the title of an executor and that of an administrator has become of no practical importance, for it is now settled beyond all question that the title of the administrator, after his appointment, vests from or relates back to the death of the intestate (3 <em>Redf. on Wills, </em>128). Thus, the administrator may recover against a wrongdoer who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>seized or converted the goods of the intestate, before letters granted, in an action of trover <em>{Com. Dig. </em>Administration, B., 10; 18 <em>Vin. Abr., </em>285; Rockwell <em>v. </em>Saunders, 10 <em>Barb., </em>473). Or, he may bring trespass, although this is an action founded on the right to possession. \u2018 \u2018 The relation fixes the possession from the beginning\u201d (2 <em>Roll. Abr., </em>554, tit. Trespass, pl. 2; <em>Year Book, </em>36 <em>Hen. VI., </em>fol. 8; Tharpe <em>v. </em>Stallwood, 5 <em>Man. &amp; Gr., </em>760). The ancient reason for this relation was, that \u201c otherwise there would be no remedy \u201d (per Rolle, Ch. J., Long <em>v. </em>Hebb, <em>Style, </em>341, A. D. 1652). The true principle, as deduced from the later cases, stands upon a broader and more symmetrical basis, viz: \u201cThe title of an administrator relates back to the death of the intestate, for the purpose of supporting the rights of the intestate, and of <em>ratifying acts for the benefit of his estate, </em>and giving a remedy where otherwise there would be none; but not to affect the rights of third persons to the estate vested intermediate the death and letters granted, or to take away those of the intestate, according to the maxim, <em>1 in fictione juris semper consista eguitas </em>\u2019 \u201d (Leber <em>v. </em>Kauffelt, 5 <em>Watts &amp; S., </em>440, 5). In the last case cited, one who had paid a claim against an intestate\u2019s estate, and afterwards took out letters of administration, was held entitled to sue in his representative capacity, on a bond given to the intestate to indemnify him against that claim. So where a note belonging to the estate of an intestate was paid to his widow who subsequently united with another in taking out letters of administration, and they then brought an action on the note in their representative capacity, the letters were held to relate back and render the payment to the widow a bar to the action (Priest <em>v. </em>Watkins, 2 <em>Hill, </em>225). While there are certain cases in which the doctrine of relation has not been allowed, yet they will be found to be those in which the fiction is set up to di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>vest some right of a third person to the estate which vested intermediate the death of the intestate and letters granted, as <em>Gilb. Eq., </em>223, or to prejudice the right of the intestate; as Morgan <em>v. </em>Thomas, 8 <em>Exch., </em>302; Murray <em>v. </em>East India Co., 5 <em>Barn. &amp; Al., </em>204; Pratt <em>v. </em>Swaine, 8 <em>B. &amp; C.</em>; Steward <em>v. </em>Edmonds, 1 <em>Wms. on Exrs., </em>4 ed., 834, note <em>u; </em>Parsons <em>v. </em>Mayesden, <em>Freeman, </em>151). The New York decisions proceed on the doctrine of the earlier English cases, and of Williams <em>v. </em>Norwith (S<em>tyle, </em>337), and hold that the grant of letters of administration relates back to the death of the intestate, and legalizes <em>all </em>intermediate acts of the administratrix <em>ab initi </em>?, whether beneficial to the estate or otherwise, in the absence of fraud or collusion (Vroom <em>v. </em>Van Horne, 10 <em>Paige, </em>549, 558; Rattoon v. Overacker, 8 <em>Johns., </em>226).</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-5\">II. Even if the payments on account of the defendant\u2019 s indebtedness to the intestate had been made by the defendant to a third person holding the note, and been received as such, the act of such third person could have been ratified by the plaintiff after letters granted, and the new promise, raised by the payments, been rendered available to the plaintiff as administratrix. The act would have been ratified by making a legal demand for the benefit of the contract thus made, by bringing suit (1 <em>Am. Lead. Cas. Hare &amp; W., </em>notes 593); and where one means to act as agent for another, a subsequent ratification by the other is always equivalent to a prior command ; nor is it any objection that the intended principal was unknown at the time (Hull v. Pickersgill, 1 <em>Brod. &amp; Bing., </em>282; Foster <em>v. </em>Bates, 12 <em>M. &amp;. W., </em>226). So where one received sums of money from an intestate\u2019s debtors, the subsequently appointed administratrix was held entitled to waive the tort, ratify the receipt of the money and recover the same in an action for money had and received to her use <em>as administratrix </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>(Welchman <em>v. </em>Sturgis, 13 <em>Q. B., </em>553). The administrator may ratify a contract made by procuration, or <em>in any other form, </em>before his appointment on behalf of the estate, so as to take the benefit of it, <em>the same as if his authority had been of a date anterior </em>(3 <em>Redf. on Wills, </em>127).</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-5\">III. The provisions of the Revised Statutes (3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>81, \u00a7 60, and <em>Id., </em>449, \u00a7 17) were not intended to work any alteration in the common law in respect to the doctrine of the relation of letters of administration (Priest <em>v. </em>Watkins, 3 <em>Hill, </em>326). At common law if one who was neither executor nor administrator inter-meddled with the goods of the deceased, or did any act characteristic of the office of executor, he thereby made himself an executor of his own wrong or <em>de son tort (Swinburne, </em>pt. 4, \u00a7 .23, pl. 1; <em>Godolph, </em>pt. 2, ch. 8, \u00a7 1; <em>Wentworth, Off. Exrs., </em>14 ed., ch. 14, p. 320). When one so acted as to become executor <em>de son tort, </em>he thereby rendered himself liable not only to an action by the rightful executor or administrator, but also to be sued as executor by a creditor of the deceased or by a legatee, for an executor <em>de son tort </em>had all the liabilities though <em>none of the privileges, </em>that belong to the character of executor (Carmichael <em>v. </em>Carmichael, 1 <em>Phill. E. C., </em>103, per Lord Cottenham.; <em>Williams on Exrs., </em>217; 2 <em>Blacks. Com., </em>495). He could not bring an action himself in the right of the 'deceased <em>{Bro. Abr., </em>tit. Administration, 8), so that even at- common law the plaintiff in this action could not be heard as executor <em>de son tort. </em>He was chargeable with the debts of the deceased, so far as assets came to his hands <em>{Dyer, </em>166), and as against creditors in general was allowed all payments made to any other creditor (1 <em>Ch. Ca., </em>33), himself excepted (5 <em>Rep., </em>30; <em>Moore, </em>527). By statute (2 <em>Rev. L., </em>p. 313, \u00a7 13, copied from 43 <em>Eliz., </em>ch. 8, 1 <em>Chitty St., </em>3 ed., 1416), an executor of his own wrong was declared liable for all assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>coming to Ms hands, with the privilege of retaining for debts due him from the intestate, and of being allowed for all proper payments made by him. 2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>81, \u00a7 60, deprived him of this <em>statutory </em>privilege. 2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>449, \u00a7 17, abolished the <em>common law liability, </em>and rendered him responsible as a <em>wrongdoer </em>to the lawful representative of the estate. The sole intention was manifestly to alter the <em>theory </em>of the <em>liability </em>of <em>third persons </em>to the rightful executor or administrator, for their <em>wrongful </em>acts, and to <em>restrict </em>this liability to such exeuctor or administrator, as trustee not only of the intestate, but also for creditors. It was not to deprive the rightful representative of his common law right to avail himself of acts done or contracts made on behalf of the estate <em>for its benefit.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b371-5\">By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 Barnard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP\">\u2014 The payment made by defendant upon the note in question, to the plaintiff, before she had taken out letters of administration on the estate of her husband, was a good payment to her as administratrix, she subsequently having taken out letters.
