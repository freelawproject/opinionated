BROWN, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">This appeal is taken by Brose from the Trial Court\u2019s dismissal, at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, of a qui tam informer\u2019s suit alleging \u201cmismarking\u201d under 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 292.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Trial Court found that Appellant failed to prove (i) falsity of the marking in issue, (ii) intent to deceive the public on the part of Sears, (iii) any marking by Sears, and (iv) that the marking was done to any \u201cunpatented article.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brose\u2019s failure to prove <em>any one </em>of the above elements would have proved fatal to his cause since the Act is penal in nature and must be strictly construed. Ansul Co. v. Uniroyal Inc., D.C.N.Y., 1969, 306 F.Supp. 541. In affirming the Trial Court\u2019s decision we limit our discussion to the critical element, stipulated by the parties to be decisive, of intent on the part of Sears to deceive the public by placing the marking on the product in issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Probably no earthshaking discovery, the case involves what some contemporary Judges nostalgically recall as the simple tool used by young boys to insert rubber bands in a bicycle tire to close a puncture and then seal it with a tube of Never Leak. Now this great art is extended to tubeless automobile tires. Sears under its own label markets a tubeless tire repair kit which Egan (successor) manufactures and packages for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">\n<em>Brose\u2019s Theory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The theory of Brose, shifting as it has been to meet the exigencies of the moment, can in the figure of the case, be quite deflated to almost flat proportions. The mismarking comes not from the fact that the kit bears the true legend \u201clicensed under U.S. Patent [Kraly] 3,-095,342.\u201d Rather, it is because Egan (Sears) although licensed by Patentee Kraly under 3,095,342, does not in the kit make a device which \u201creads on\u201d the claims of the cited patent. For the purposes of a \u00a7 292 suit this means that since the marketed device is not the one covered by the cited patent it is as though there was no patent at all and the marker (Sears through Egan) had put such a description on an admittedly unpatented article. Thus does he drag in by the back door notions \u2014 which were so baffling to the Trial Judge \u2014 of infringement, range of equivalents, invalidity and many other esoteric concepts of the world of pat\u00e9ntese. To establish the crucial element of intent to deceive the public Brose, first, in the Trial Court urged that Sears\u2019 actions and the judgment in the Illinois suit (see discussion, <em>infra) </em>showed purposeful misrepresentation and, second, in this Court contends that the physical disparity between the device sold in the kit and that described in the patent claims is so gross that Sears had to know of this, and knowing this, deliberately intended to palm off the device as a patented one.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">\n<em>Brose Not A Disinterested Private Attorney General</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Although Brose is a person entitled to bring the informer\u2019s suit with the hope of astronomical awards which continue as every day Egan turns out for Sears thousands of these suspect packages<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were he a stranger, the fact is that he is not. As is true in nearly all of the relatively few qui tam informer actions brought in the past one and a quarter century this one is used as a weapon in the arsenal of patent litigation \u2014 a factor which the Judge was entitled to regard with unusual significance not simply as a situation in which there was direct interest in the outcome of the apparently collateral patent controversy but in the prospect of high awards in the informer\u2019s suit itself, quite independent of the outcome of the underlying skirmish on patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">For the record shows that Brose likewise had a patent<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and was then pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>suing Sears (Egan) vigorously, but it turns out unsuccessfully in the adjacent Southern District of Florida by claiming that the kit infringed his patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">\n<em>The Illinois Suit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Kraly, patentee in No. 3,095,342, in 1966 sued Egan (the manufacturer) and Sears in the Northern District of Illinois claiming infringement. Egan on demand of Sears defended for both. To the usual denials, special, general or out of ignorance, Sears formally denied validity (and hence infringement) of the patent for one or more or all of the reasons which the \u201cantlike persistence of patent solicitors,\u201d Lyon v. Boh, S.D.N. Y., 1924, 1 F.2d 48, 50, could conjure up. Subsequently the parties settled the case by the payment of a fixed sum by Egan (Sears) and the execution of a non-exclusive license agreement to Egan. When the motion and agreed order of dismissal were submitted to Judge Will, with his characteristic independence he struck out the words \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d and substituted in his own hand \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The license agreement prescribed that the marking as used appear on the product manufactured by Egan.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-15\">\n<em>Estoppel by Pleading/Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b831-16\">Although not pressed with quite the vigor below the recurring theme in E-flat minor is that Sears\u2019 actions and the judgment in the Illinois suit (see note 6, <em>supra) </em>commit Sears to a binding judicial determination that Kraly was invalid and hence Sears could not in good faith have passed the kit off on the public as made pursuant to the cited license.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-18\">This rests on a hypercritical reading of the order and an argument which runs along this line. Since it is a dismissal \u201cwith prejudice\u201d it is a judicial determination that the plaintiff (Kraly) cannot prevail, and that is so because the parties (and the Judge) thereby embrace the defendants\u2019 (SearsEgan) defense of invalidity. Whatever other difficulties inherent in Brose, a non-party \u2014 non-privy to the Illinois suit, to raise this as res judicata or collateral estoppel, this misreads the order and its obvious purpose. It was a settlement, and so described. And it was a settlement of the plaintiff's (Kraly) claim and the defendants\u2019 (Egan and Sears) cross-claim. The \u201cwith prejudice\u201d simply had the effect of preventing either party from ever asserting against the other the same claims or counterclaims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>At most, the pleadings and judgment in the 1967 Illinois proceeding amounted only to an admission in the sense of action by Sears and Egan inconsistent with the current assertion. But it is only evidence, not conclusive, and the trier of the facts was entitled to disregard it as insignificant for a number of reasons, not the least of which was the plain language that all issues were compromised. Indeed, the settlement was made to avoid resolution of the contentions. The Judge, presiding over a busy Court to which more and more cases come each day, week, month and year, would hardly think the law\u2019s policy of encouraging settlements would be served by holding one party to a concession that the adversary\u2019s contention was sustained even without a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">\n<em>Was The Kit Within Kraly Patent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Before us Brose emphasizes that intent to deceive is \u201cproved\u201d by knowing that the kit did not embody any or all of the Kraly claims. That approach calls for two things. First, it must be established that from an operational mechanical sense the patent does not cover the kit. Presumably that could be done by a simple preponderance of the evidence (and a finding). Second, the differences are so plain that no one in good faith could think otherwise. It is at this point that the law \u2014 perhaps out of distaste for blood money suits \u2014compels a positive showing. For here not only are objective physical facts involved. Here are questions of motive, purpose and attitudes.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">We can assume that if a device claimed to be covered by license of a cited patent is so obviously not revealed by it as the pat\u00e9ntese world would view it, the use of such a legend would be mismarking. See, American Needle and Novelty Co. v. Schulessler Knitting Mills, Inc., D.C.Ill., 1966, 258 F.Supp. 98, modified, 7 Cir., 1967, 379 F.2d 376. But where the device is within the specific field covered by the patent and uses materials and methods similar to the technical patent disclosures, the licensee\u2019s use in good faith reliance on the license is not to be transmuted into an evil purpose to deceive the public merely on proof and finding that for one or more or all of the reasons skilled patent advocates could think up, the embodiment in question does \u201cnot read on\u201d or is not an \u201cinfringement\u201d of the cited patent. See, London v. Everett H. Dunbar Corp., 1 Cir., 1910, 179 F. 506, 509;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Zuckerman v. Pilot, D.C.N.Y.1940, 71 F.Supp. 478, 479, 1 F.R.D. 130, 131. But this pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>supposes that the private attorney general has established that the device is not within the patent. Only at that time does the good faith purpose or motive of the marker of a license to a cited patent come into question. Obviously, this is essentially a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">It is here that Brose fails completely. For the Court found as a fact that the \u201carticle [kit] is licensed under * \" * Kraly\u201d and reached the legal conclusion that the \u201caccused product is in fact licensed by\u201d Kraly. Since the contrary finding was essential as the first part of the intent to deceive element, the burden is heavy on Brose to override F.R.Civ.P. 52(a). For such \u201ca determination can be disturbed, as clearly erroneous, only in rare instances.\u201d Filmon Process Corp. v. Spell-Right Corp., 1968, 131 U.S.App.D.C. 374, 404 F.2d 1351, 1356, 158 P.Q. 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">All the record contained was testimony of Brose who, while mechanically skilled in the manipulation of the various competing types of tire repair kits, demonstrated only a difference in <em>products. </em>He did not attempt to describe how or in what manner the kit did not reflect significant elements of Kraly. Nor was his case helped any by the \u201cexpert\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> whose views the Judge received as a matter of good judicial husbandship but which he then immediately rejected on credibility choices by stating \u201c * * * it doesn\u2019t prove anything. It doesn\u2019t prove anything. It doesn\u2019t prove anything helpful to the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">The case began with emphasis on the imperative of intent to deceive. It ended both on the absence of proof which compelled such a finding and a negative finding to the contrary. And so it ends here.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-9\">. 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 292 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-10\">\u201c(a) Whoever, without the consent of the patentee, marks upon, or affixes to, or uses in advertising in connection with anything made, used, or sold by him, the name or any imitation of the name of the patentee, the patent number, or the words \u2018patent,\u2019 \u2018patentee,\u2019 or the like, with the intent of counterfeiting or imitating the mark of the patentee, or of deceiving the public and inducing them to believe that the thing was made or sold by or with the consent of the patentee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Q1\">Whoever marks upon, or affixes to, or uses in advertising in connection with any unpatented article, the word \u2018patent\u2019 or any word or number importing that the same is patented, for the purpose of deceiving the public; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE5\">Whoever marks upon, or affixes to, or uses in advertising in connection with any article, the words \u2018patent applied for,\u2019 \u2018patent pending,\u2019 or any word importing that an application for patent has been made, when no application for patent has be\u00e9n made, or if made, is not pending, for the purpose of deceiving the public\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-11\">Shall be fined not more than $500 for every such offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-12\">(b) Any person may sue for the penalty, in which event one-half shall go to the person suing and the other to the use of the United States.

The penalty was increased from $100 to $500. See, Walker on Patents (Deller\u2019s Edition) 1937, ch. XX, 1791-1799. The Trial Court sat without a jury and upon motion of the Appellee dismissed the suit after hearing Appellant\u2019s evidence under F.R.Civ.P. 41(b), which provides, \u201cAfter the plaintiff, in an action tried by the court without a jury, has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant, without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that under the facts and the law plaintiff has shown no right to relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AvL\">That the Court did not treat it as a non-jury equivalent to a motion for instructed verdict testing legal sufficiency as a prima facie case, but rather disposed of it on credibility choices is shown by the Court\u2019s filing detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law in which he found facts, Rule 41(b). As any other fact findings these come here with Buckler and Shield of F.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-17\">. Brose also brought dependent complaints for misrepresentation under 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1125 and under the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Fla.Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 817.69-817.75, F.S.A. The parties stipulated that if the cause for \u201cmismarking\u201d under 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 292 failed, the other complaints would fail also. We do not here consider any issues other than those presented by the \u00a7 292 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b829-19\">. Without so deciding we think Sears cannot so blithely escape the charge that it \u201cmarked\u201d the device. While actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>manufactured for it by Egan (or successor) it was, as is so common in today\u2019s chain store retail merchandising, packed as a \u201cSears\u201d product. And for a certainty, Sears cannot flee from whatever legal consequences attach to the judgment of dismissal in the Illinois litigation. It was a named party defendant and had demanded that Egan defend it which Egan did. Sears cannot disavow what Egan did in its name even though Sears was uninformed about what its in-demnitor was doing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b830-7\">. In colloquy below Brose replied to the Judge\u2019s inquiry on the number of \u201coffenses\u201d (see note 1, <em>supra) </em>that \u201cthere are at least\u201d 70,000 \u201cof the Sears kits involved.\u201d His share adds up to a tidy 17% million dollars although on one basis or another \u2014 limiting it to each day or week or month \u2014 a Court would find a way to prevent such a result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b830-13\">. Brose had reissue patent No. 26,368. Subsequent to argument here, Judge Atkins of the Southern District of Florida held the Brose patent valid but not infringed by Sears. In Brose v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 5 Cir., 1971, 455 F.2d 769, this Court affirmed on the issue of noninfringement. By its opinion of December 21, 1971, the Court vacated the District Court\u2019s holding of validity as not necessary to a disposition of a case. That opinion was withdrawn and in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>decision of January 25, 1972, the Court held it was unnecessary to review the Trial Court\u2019s determination that the patent was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq8o\">Brose and Kraly were fellow industrial associates and used the same patent solicitor to secure their respective patents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b831-9\">.

Old cases neither die nor fade away, Bros. Inc. v. W. E. Grace Manufacturing Co., 5 Cir., 1965, 351 F.2d 208, 209, and certainly not patent cases. While the proceedings were going on in the Middle and Southern Districts of Florida (see note 5, <em>supra) </em>Kraly (successor) sued Egan (successor) for unpaid royalties and an accounting under the license agreement. On removal to the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Court this again fell to the lot of Judge Will, presumably on <em>his </em>individual calendar for which he is a nation-wide roving ambassador and advocate. Egan raised the defense of validity \u2014 a defense which Judge Will in 1970 held could be asserted by reason of the intervening case of Lear v. Adkins, 1969, 395 U.S. 653, 89 S.Ct. 1902, 23 L.Ed.2d 610, despite the express covenant in the license that the licensee (Egan) could not challenge validity. Kraly v. National Distillers and Chemical Corporation, D.C.Ill., 1970, 319 F.Supp. 1349, 168 P.Q. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"AW5\">Brose attempts to plug his leaking theory by asserting (as Kraly did before Judge Will) that Egan\u2019s (successor) contention of invalidity in the 1970 Illinois case was contradictory of its (and Sears\u2019) claim in that the kit was manufactured pursuant to the cited license \u2014 a fact which could only be true were the patent valid. As did Judge Will, we find this effort to press logic so far unpersuasive. Not the least reason is that an article could quite literally embody the crucial elements of the cited patent under the license and yet under <em>Lear </em>its licensee would be entitled to challenge validity because of overriding public interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b832-12\">. \u201cOf course, it does not follow, from the fact that the article was unpatented, that there was necessarily a purpose to deceive the public in marking it patented. The purpose to deceive the public is an essential element of the offense, and the burden is upon the plaintiff to establish this purpose as well as the fact that the article is unpatented. The statute does not extend to one who has an honest, though mistaken, belief that upon a proper construction of the patent it covers the article which he marks. The question of guilt does not depend upon such close or exact construction of the patent as is usual upon bills for infringement where the issue is as to the extent of a patentee\u2019s right under letters patent. <em>* * * </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\"><em>London, supra, </em>179 F. at 509-510.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b833-13\">.
