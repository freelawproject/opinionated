But Wolfson had made only incidental and somewhat vague references to this allegation in his lengthy complaint and did not present the issue in the trial court as one having any substance. We are satisfied that Judge Palmieri considered and correctly resolved the claim and properly concluded that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
