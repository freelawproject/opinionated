We reverse and remand because we find there is no interference in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-18\">\n<em>The Counts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-19\">The parties\u2019 inventions are both in the field of making vitreous enamels such as are applied to bathroom fixtures, kitchen sinks, and the like having a cast iron base. The counts recite a method of making a titania-opacified porcelain enamel frit and the frit made by that method. Frit is the intermediate, particulate glass material from which the enamel is formed in situ by fusion. We reproduce only the first count (subpara-graphing and emphasis of the terminology principally in issue supplied):</p>\n<p id=\"b635-20\">1. The method of making an improved titania opacified porcelain enamel frit for dry process application which comprises</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-21\">fritting a molten silicate glass composition containing from about 8% to about 24% titanium dioxide by weight and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-22\">thereafter heat treating the frit-ted particles <em>at a temperature sufficiently above the frit softening point, but below its fusion point, </em>for a time period sufficient to cause nucleation of at least some of the titanium dioxide therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-23\">The counts are hybrids proposed by the examiner, and it was his use of the terms \u201csoftening point\u201d and \u201cfusion point\u201d which has led to this appeal. The former expression was taken from ap-pellees\u2019 specification, in which it is stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-24\">The range of heat treating temperatures extends from a temperature more than 100\u00b0F. above the <em>softening point </em>of the glass, but not more than 400 \u00b0F. above the <em>softening point </em>of the glass as <em>measured by an interferometer. </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-25\">The expression \u201cfusion point\u201d was taken from appellants\u2019 specification, in which it is stated that the heat treating of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>fritted particles takes place \u201cbetween 600\u00b0F. and 1300\u201dF., [but] below fusion point of said frit.\u201d However, appellants\u2019 specification does not define \u201cfusion point\u201d or state how the fusion point of a particular frit can be measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">\n<em>Background,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">It is now and throughout this interference has been appellant Rion\u2019s contention that the terms \u201csoftening point\u201d and \u201cfusion point\u201d are equivalent in this art. He has stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">While it is true that in the formed or flat glass industry, a distinction might be drawn between softening point and fusion point, this does not extend to porcelain enamels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Pursuant to this contention, Rion brought three separate motions to dissolve the interference. The first was on the ground that the counts \u201care vague and indefinite constituting an informality in the declaration of such nature as to preclude a proper and adequate determination of the question of priority.\u201d The second was on the ground that the counts \u201care unpatentable as being barred by * * * printed publications and patents * * * which * * * stand as a bar under 35 USC 102(b) and 35 USC 103 to patentability of the counts herein.\u201d The third was on the ground that \u201cthe parties Ault et al. cannot make the counts because the disclosure of the parties Ault et al., as to the specific limitations of the count, is so vague and indefinite as to fail to support same.\u201d However, as the primary examiner held in denying all three motions, the second and third motions were \u201cbased on the assumption that the party Rion succeeded in establishing in the motion to dissolve on ground (1), the equivalency of the terms as used in the counts viz \u2018softening point\u2019 and \u2018fusion point\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">The primary examiner held, without citation of authority, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">The art knows from observation and experience that the interferometer point applies to the point at which the glass <em>begins to soften, </em>and fusion flow <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> applies to the point at which the softened glass becomes molten and flows. [Emphasis in the original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVp\">The primary examiner also pointed to the statement in Ault\u2019s specification that \u201cFor best results, the temperature should be below the point where tackiness occurs in the glass,\u201d stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">\u201cTackiness\u201d describes a sticky or adhesive state, which when said of Ault\u2019s glass would be recognized by one practicing Ault\u2019s teaching as a softened state in which the glass is close to but below the fusion point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-P\">Rion\u2019s request for reconsideration was granted, but their motions were again denied. The opinion of the different examiner who rendered the decision thereon noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-12\">In a further effort to clarify their position they [Rion et al.] include a chart at page 3 by which they seek to persuade that they operate at mutually exclusive heating ranges from the party Ault * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq1V\">but concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-13\"><em>Since both disclosures show reheating at 1100\u00b0F. </em>(Ault at page 8 and Rion at page 15), the Rion chart is not found to have a basis illustrative of the facts as disclosed. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">However, it should be pointed out, first, that the composition of the frit which Ault heat treated at 1100 \u00b0F. was not the same as the composition of the frit which Rion heat treated at 1100\u00b0F. and, second, that Ault heat treated the frit at that temperature for six minutes while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Rion heat treated the frit at that temperature for \u201cabout ten minutes.\u201d Note that the counts relate temperature to \u201csoftening point\u201d and \u201cfusion point\u201d and that different compositions may have such point or points at different temperatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Rion thereafter- petitioned the Commissioner, asking him to dissolve the interference in the exercise of his supervisory authority. This the First Assistant Commissioner declined to do on the ground that the primary examiner\u2019s decision involved no \u201cmanifest error or abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">At final hearing, Rion again contended that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">* * * the expressions \u201cfusion point\u201d and \u201csoftening point\u201d define the same temperature and since Ault et al. disclose heat treatment only at temperatures above the softening point of the fritted enamel particles, Ault et al\u2019s. process neither supports the counts <em>nor is directed to the same process defined by Rion et al. </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The board\u2019s original opinion, however, treats only the first part of Rion\u2019s contention :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">The heat treatment of the counts defines a temperature range or the transition between a point where the glass begins to soften and where it becomes molten. This is the definition placed on the counts by the Primary Examiner who, in drafting said counts for interference purposes, set forth the bounds to which the priority proofs of the parties would be limited. Under the circumstances of this case, particularly in view of the fact that neither party sought to change or modify the language of the counts, the definition of the terms of the counts by the Primary Examiner is controlling notwithstanding any alleged inconsistency with the technical definitions of the softening point and fusion point not found within the disclosures of the applications involved. Since the counts, as drafted and defined by the Primary Examiner, are broad enough to include within their scope the invention disclosed by the Ault et al. application, Ault et al. have the right to make the counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">In response to Rion\u2019s petition for reconsideration, the board further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1G\">With regard to Rion et al.\u2019s contention that there is no definition of the express limitations \u201cfusion point\u201d and \u201csoftening point\u201d in the record and that the only discussion by the Primary Examiner thereof is found on pages 6 and 7 of his Decision on Motions, we remain of the opinion that the Primary Examiner\u2019s decision when considered in its entirety (especially pages 4 and 5 as well as 6 and 7) clearly and unambiguously defines the meaning of \u201cfusion point\u201d and \u201csoftening point\u201d insofar as the invention involved herein is concerned. Furthermore, as correctly pointed out by Ault et al. in their reply, the question of the definiteness of the counts is not ancillary to priority. The interference counts must be given the broadest interpretation their language will reasonably support; we have found the Primary Examiner\u2019s interpretation thereof to be reasonable and broad enough to include the inventions as defined by both parties in their respective applications. Note Kropa v. Robie et al., [187 F.2d 150] 38 CCPA 858, and Ludwig v. Sohn et al., [324 F.2d 1004] 51 CCPA 796, cited by us in our decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">I. <em>Motion to Dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">A preliminary matter requires comment before we come to the merits of this controversy. Appellees moved in this court to dismiss this appeal on the ground that the gist of appellants\u2019 complaint was that the counts are <em>indefinite, </em>that that issue is not ancillary to priority, and that the Patent Office\u2019s determination that the counts are not indefinite was therefore not reviewable by this court. Appellants opposed that motion, it was denied, and appellants now argue that appellees can no longer question the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>jurisdiction of this court to hear this appeal because that issue \u201chas already been decided.\u201d However, questions of jurisdiction can be raised at any time, and the denial of appellees\u2019 motion must be regarded as inherently without prejudice to raising the question at final hearing. It has been so raised in appellees\u2019 brief, and we regard the jurisdictional issue as before us again.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">II. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"avq-dedup-1\">Appellees argue that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"awu-dedup-0\">If one were to accept * * * [appellants' interpretation of the terms \u201csoftening point\u201d and \u201cfusion point\u201d], one would no longer have a count to interpret because the count presupposes the existence of a range of temperatures between \u201csoftening point\u201d and \u201cfusion point\u201d. Accepting the appellants\u2019 interpretation of the counts, therefore, would make the counts completely indefinite * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"arq-dedup-0\">and they cite many authorities<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the proposition that the question of the indefiniteness of the counts is not ancillary to priority, is therefore not within the statutory jurisdiction of the Board of Patent Interferences, and therefore is not within our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We disagree with the premise, at least,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of this multistep argument. The issue here is the existence of an interference in fact,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and we think that it can no longer be questioned that both the Board of Patent Interferences and this court have jurisdiction over that issue. Brailsford v. Lavet, 318 F.2d 942, 50 CCPA 1367 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">III. <em>Interference in Fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"alh-dedup-0\">Appellants' specification does not define the term \u201cfusion point\u201d nor does it explain how the fusion point of a given frit may be measured. Instead, they maintain that the term has a generally accepted meaning in the porcelain enamelers\u2019 art, and that their specification must be interpreted as it would be by one skilled in that particular art, and that to one so skilled the term means precisely the same thing as the term \u201csoftening point.\u201d In support of this argument, they have referred to the treatise Porcelain Enamels (2d ed. 1961) by the late Dr. A. I. Andrews, who seems to have been an eminent authority in the field. At page 465, in Chapter 12, entitled \u201cEnamel Properties and Tests,\u201d the following paragraph appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-11\">The Interferometer Test. In determining the coefficient of expansion of glasses by means of the interferometer, the expansion curve reverses when the enamel begins to soften (Figure 12). This offers a method for determining the fusion point of enamels, but it requires considerable equipment and technique, which limits its field of application. It is reproducible within 10\u00b0 F. and is a definite value, which makes possible the comparison of different enamels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">On cross-examination, Van Dolah, one of the appellees, conceded that Dr. Andrews <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>had stated in this paragraph that \u201cfusion point is the same as interferometer softening point * * Mr. Van Dolah also stated that it was his belief that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">* * * if you would take a cross-section of the people in the porcelain enamel industry and ask them what \u201cfusion point\u201d is, * * * you will find the majority would not say \u201csoftening point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">However, appellants\u2019 expert witness, a Professor of Ceramic Engineering and head of the Department of Ceramic Engineering at the University of Illinois, speaking with respect to a given glass or frit and the temperature at which the interferometer softening point occurs and the temperature at which the fusion point occurs, testified unequivocally that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Oq\">There isn\u2019t any difference. They are identical. Fusion point and softening point are one and the same thing. Sometimes it is called the fusion temperature or softening temperature, but they are identical.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">On the basis of this record, we conclude that the two terms refer to the same temperature for a given frit and that therefore the parties did not make the same invention. Appellants\u2019 invention involves heat treating particular frit <em>below </em>the fusion-softening point thereof, while appellees\u2019 invention involves heat treating such frit more than 100\u00b0F. <em>above </em>the softening-fusion point thereof. On the face of the matter and without any evidence to the contrary, we cannot believe that, if the two terms in controversy mean the same thing, the difference in temperature ranges is an \u201cimmaterial\u201d difference. Thus we conclude that there is no interference in fact between the applications of the parties,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and we accordingly <em>reverse </em>the decision of the board implicitly holding such an interference to exist and <em>remand </em>this case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">IV. <em>Taxation of Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\"> There remains the question of taxing costs for two additions to the record requested by appellees. The first consists of 247 pages of testimony by appellees\u2019 witnesses, predominantly on the issue of priority. Appellees argue that appellants should pay for this addition in its entirety because their reasons of appeal indicated that they would appeal the adverse determination of priority below and, in the alternative, that appellants should at least pay for the printing of Van Dolah\u2019s testimony because they relied on it in their brief. On the first point, appellants argue that appellees should have to pay for the printing of their priority evidence because they knew in advance that they would not have to rely on it because appellants did not include in the record for appeal any of their testimony on the question of \u201cdate\u201d priority. On the second point, they argue that they \u201cneed not have relied on any of appellee\u2019s [sic] voluminous, and for the purposes of this appeal, useless, testimony, since the equivalency of fusion and softening point were well established by Drs. Andrews * * * and Friedberg.\u201d We agree with appellants on the first point but with appel-lees on the second. Thus, appellants are to pay for the printing of Mr. Van Do-lah\u2019s testimony, but appellees are to pay for the rest of the first addition.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The second addition consists of the file history of appellants\u2019 parent application. For the reasons given in the previous section, we think that the contents of this file history are irrelevant here, and we accordingly assess the cost of printing it against appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">WORLEY, C. J., took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-15\">.

It should be noted that the primary examiner referred to \u201cfusion flow\u201d rather than to <em>the </em>\u201cfusion point.\u201d Appellants concede that, as one of the appellees testified, fusion <em>flow </em>takes place at temperatures above that of the interferometer softening point (which appellants maintain is likewise the interferometer <em>fusion, </em>point), but appellants contend that \u201cthere is absolutely no connection between fusion flow * * * and <em>fusion point\u201d </em>and that the word \u201cpoint\u201d \u201cmay <em>not </em>be disregarded in the counts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\">.

It must be conceded that appellants have not expressly so characterized their grounds of appeal but argue it, rather, on the basis of support for the counts or right to make them.

Appellees have not argued that their evidence established an art-recognized meaning of the term \u201cfusion point\u201d which differs from the definition advanced by appellants. Instead, they have relied on their contention, rejected supra part II of this opinion, that this court has no authority to review the Patent Office\u2019s decision on this point and on the contention that \u201cThe Definition of \u2018Fusion Point\u2019 Now Urged by Appellants Is Inconsistent With the Statements Made In Their File History.\u201d Essentially, it is their contention on this point that the term \u201cfusion point\u201d was new matter <em>when it was introduced into appellants\u2019 parent application. </em>If that is so, it may be grounds for rejecting their application ex parte, on the basis of intervening art, but it avails appellees nothing in this proceeding. All we have determined is that the inventions which the two parties are <em>now </em>claiming are different, not that either one is patentable to the party claiming it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
