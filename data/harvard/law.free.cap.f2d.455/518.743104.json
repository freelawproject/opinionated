The order was issued by the Board on August 25, 1970 and reported at 185 N.L.R.B. # 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-16\">The Board found that \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) of the Act had been violated. The Board ordered Respondent to cease and desist from interfering with its employees\u2019 Section 7 rights and to offer Employee Emilee Dixon reinstatement with back pay from January 28, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-17\">We believe that substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s finding that the Respondent\u2019s conduct violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) of the Act. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). We believe, however, that the evidence justifies an award of back pay to Emilee Dixon, only from March 1, 1969 rather than from the earlier date specified in the order. We modify the order accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-21\">As so modified, enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
