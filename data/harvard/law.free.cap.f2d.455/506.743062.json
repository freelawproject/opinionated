The stolen goods consisted of a truck trailer that apparently was coupled with the truck tractor when both were stolen. The appellant contends that the trailer was not goods but merely a part of the motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-20\">This contention is refuted by the definition of a motor vehicle as a \u201cself-propelled vehicle.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2311. Since the trailer is not self-propelled, it is goods rather than a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-21\">Accordingly, the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
