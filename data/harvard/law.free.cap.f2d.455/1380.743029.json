Judge Hufstedler\u2019s stay of the district court\u2019s order of March 14, 1972, committing petitioner, is extended to and including Monday, March 27, 1972, to permit petitioner to apply to Circuit Justice William O. Douglas for a stay pending the filing of a petition for cer-tiorari.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1444-35\">CHAMBERS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AEHd\">(concurring and dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-36\">In the holding of the majority that counsel\u2019s claim for immunity was not well taken I concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-37\">In my view the \u201cstay\u201d heretofore issued was improvidently granted. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>should be terminated immediately. I do not think we should invite the trial court to follow a course that will permit counsel to extricate himself from his mistaken notions of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-4\">We should have ere now removed any restraints on the district court. I cannot vote to continue any. Ordinarily we commit egregious error when we interfere midway in the trial of a case. There may be now and then a case where we should do so. This is not it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
