Sieracki, 1946, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099, the sole question presented is whether a shipowner\u2019s violation of a safety regulation for longshoring which resulted in the undisputed unseaworthiness of his vessel was a proximate cause of a longshoreman\u2019s personal injury. The trial court held that it was not and denied recovery. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-22\">Longshoreman Denny was engaged with fellow workers in the discharge of cargo from the S.S. SALVONIJA to a barge lying on its offshore side in the Port of New Orleans. A Jacobs ladder, provided by Denny\u2019s employer, Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc., was hung over the offshore rail of the vessel down to the barge to provide access by the longshoremen between the barge and the deck of the ship. At the end of the day, Denny ascended the ladder from the barge to depart the ship, and upon reaching the rail of the ship\u2019s bulwark, hurriedly vaulted over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-23\">It was established that on the ship\u2019s side of the rail about six feet of excess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>ladder was laid flat on a walking and working area of the deck. Denny claimed that after vaulting the rail his right foot landed on one of the ladder\u2019s rungs, which turned causing him to injure his right ankle. While finding that the method used by Denny to vault the rail was one method commonly used by longshoremen of the port, the court also found that two other methods commonly used were more prudent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">The court concluded that the position of the excess ladder on the ship\u2019s deck violated a safety regulation for long-shoring promulgated by the Department of Labor, Safety and Health Regulations for Longshoring 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1504.91(a), pursuant to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 et seq. There was thus a finding of unseaworthiness that is undisputed here. Nevertheless, the court dismissed the claim on the ground that Denny\u2019s negligence, not the vessel\u2019s unseaworthiness, was the sole and proximate cause of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">In Manning v. M/V Sea Road, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 603, we held that a violation of a safety regulation was a cause of a longshoremen\u2019s injury because the injury could not have occurred without the breach of the regulation. This was found to be so regardless of the presence or absence of other considerations which might affect the degree of fault. <em>See </em>United N. Y. &amp; N. J. Sandy Hook Pilots Ass\u2019n v. Halecki, 1959, 358 U.S. 613, 79 S.Ct. 517, 3 L.Ed.2d 541; Socony-Vacu-um Oil Company v. Smith, 1939, 305 U. S. 424, 59 S.Ct. 262, 83 L.Ed. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\"> The trial court distinguished <em>Manning </em>from the facts of this case by finding that <em>Manning </em>was intended only to prevent the imposition of the entire loss on the longshoreman where there was a flagrant violation of a safety regulation, not where there was, as here, what it termed a technical violation. We do not read <em>Manning </em>with such myopic vision. These regulations were meant to eliminate \u201cthe risk of injury to all longshoremen, not just longshoremen who are 100%-plus prudent.\u201d <em>Manning, supra, </em>417 F.2d at 609. <em>See </em>Burrage v. Flota Mercante Grancolumbiana, S.A., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 1229, 1232. Once it is established that the injury could not have occurred without the breach of the regulations, as here and as in <em>Manning, </em>the district court must determine the comparative fault of the parties and apportion the damages accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-8\">We reverse and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
