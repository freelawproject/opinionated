The questioned order denied a petition wherein thirteen shareholders of Penn Central Co. sought to intervene generally in the reorganization proceeding. Penn Central Co. owns all of the stock of the debtor, Penn Central Transportation Co., and is a party in the reorganization of its subsidiary. The appellants own less than one tenth of one percent of the stock of Penn Central Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-24\">The only relevant language of section 77 appears in subsection (c) (13) and provides that \u201c. . . any other interested party may be permitted to intervene.\u201d On its face this language makes the allowance of intervention discretionary rather than mandatory, and we so construe it. <em>Accord, </em>Boston &amp; Providence R.R. Stockholders Development Group v. Smith, 2d Cir.1964, 333 F.2d 651. Thus the question here is whether the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-27\">No evidence was tendered to show special circumstances that might support the petition to intervene. On the present record and for the justifying reasons stated in the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion, we hold that the denial of appellants\u2019 petition reflected a proper and allowable exericse of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-28\">Order No. 261 will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
