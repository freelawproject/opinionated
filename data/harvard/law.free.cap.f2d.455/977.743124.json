The alleged error is that plaintiff failed to initiate review within the time prescribed by the rules and that, therefore, the district court abused its discretion and exceeded its authority and jurisdiction in entering the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-20\"> Our examination of the record discloses that in an opinion filed in subsequent proceedings in this case, the district judge stated that the order appealed from was entered with the agreement of all counsel of record, including counsel for defendants. The accuracy of this statement is not challenged in the brief filed on behalf of defendants in this court. Indeed, the district judge\u2019s statement is neither mentioned nor is his opinion included in the appendix which defendants filed. We accept the district judge\u2019s statement as complete and accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-21\">The district court had jurisdiction of the case. Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946). It is, therefore, axiomatic that defendants cannot appeal from an order entered with their consent unless they establish facts to nullify their consent. Martin Marietta Corporation v. F. T. C., 376 F. 2d 430 (7 Cir. 1967), cert. den., 389 U.S. 923, 88 S.Ct. 237, 19 L.Ed.2d 265 (1967); Stanford v. Utley, 341 F.2d 265 (8 Cir. 1965); Stewart v. Lincoln-Douglas Hotel Corp., 208 F.2d 379 (7 Cir. 1954) ; Kelly\u2019s Trust v. C. I. R., 168 F.2d 198 (2 Cir. 1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-22\">We dispense with oral argument and affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
