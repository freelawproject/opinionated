Lehigh prayed that the use of such evidence in any criminal proceeding he enjoined. This ease was assigned to Judge C. Clyde Atkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-21\">On the same day, Lehigh filed a motion to quash or modify a subpoena duces tecum issued for Lehigh by the grand jury at the direction of the Antitrust attorneys. This motion was assigned to Judge William O. Mehrtens.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-22\">Agreeably to a local rule of the District Court Lehigh filed notice of pen-dency of the actions with both Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-23\">On February 16, 1971, Judge Mehr-tens held a hearing on the motion to quash. He announced from the Bench that he would not defer compliance with the subpoena pending the disposition of the complaint for injunction. On March 3 he denied the motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Thereafter, on April 12, Judge Atkins in a hearing on a motion to dismiss the complaint for injunction announced from the Bench that the motion would be granted. This action was formalized in a memorandum opinion dated April 21, 326 F.Supp. 180. Judge Atkins held that \u201cthe exact issues have already been determined adversely to Lehigh\u201d and that a collateral attack on the decision of another division of the same Court would have to be rejected. Lehigh appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Upon consideration of the record, briefs, and oral argument we affirm the judgment of dismissal, United States v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corporation, 3 Cir., 1967, 388 F.2d 201, cert. denied, Decker v. United States, 390 U.S. 922, 88 S.Ct. 857, 19 L.Ed.2d 983; United States v. Ryan, 402 U.S. 530, 91 S.Ct. 1580, 29 L.Ed.2d 85 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
