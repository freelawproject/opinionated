On October 30, 1969, appellant was arrested in connection with an unrelated robbery of the First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company branch in Cornwells Heights, Pa., and counsel was appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>on January 6, 1970,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for this unrelated offense. On two separate occasions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> January 7 and 8, 1970, a group of photographs including two of appellant, were displayed to eye witnesses of the Frank-ford Trust robbery. On March 25, 1970, over two months after the last photographic showup, appellant was indicted for the Frankford Trust robbery. On April 3, 1970, the same counsel who was appointed to represent appellant in the First Pennsylvania Banking &amp; Trust Company robbery was appointed counsel in the Frankford Trust case.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that on the basis of the decisions in United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1968), and United States v. Zeiler, 427 F.2d 1305 (3rd Cir. 1970), the eyewitness identification at his trial should have been suppressed because photographs were shown to witnesses without the benefit of counsel being present. This contention is without merit, since all four of the pretrial photographic displays occurred prior to indictment or arrest for this offense. We also note that while appellant was \u201cin-custody,\u201d it was in connection with an unrelated offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that the photographic identification procedures were so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentifieation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both the composition of the photographic displays and the method of their presentation were such as to preclude a finding of impermissible suggestiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The March 8, 1971, judgment and commitment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\">. Appellant was represented by Joseph H. Rodriguez, Esq., of the New Jersey bar, from October 30, 1969, until his arraignment on January 6, 1970, when Philadelphia counsel was appointed for him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\">. Any photographic displays on 7/25/69 and before the branch manager on 8/8/69 took place before defendant was in custody or had counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b526-9\">. Appellant\u2019s contention that the FBI knew of his custody and the appointment of counsel, and thus could have staged a corporeal line-up with defendant having had the benefit of counsel\u2019s advice, is not supported by an examination of the record. FBI Agent Stoddard, who conducted the photographic displays to potential witnesses, did not testify that he knew of such representation or custody <em>at the time of such displays.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Ajm\">.
