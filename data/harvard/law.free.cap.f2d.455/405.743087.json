Cobb and Spivey were convicted. The ease against the remaining defendants was severed. On appeal this Court affirmed. 396 F.2d 158 (1968). On May 3, 1971, 402 U.S. 937, 91 S.Ct. 1602, 29 L.Ed.2d 105 the Supreme Court granted <em>certiora-ri, </em>vacated the convictions and remanded the case to this Court for \u201creconsideration in light of this Court\u2019s [its] decision in Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, [89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57] (1969) and United States v. United States Coin &amp; Currency, 401 U.S. 715, [91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434] (1971).\u201d 402 U. S. 937, 91 S.Ct. 1602 (1971). The judgment of this Court of May 27, 1968, accordingly was vacated. On remand additional briefs from the parties were requested. Such briefs have been submitted and the points raised therein have been considered. The evidence presented at the trial has been reconsidered as it relates to the points now in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">The Government concedes insufficiency of evidence to establish knowledge of illegal importation as to Spivey and that he \u201cis entitled to have his conviction reversed.\u201d Govt. Br. 4, 6. The case, however, as to Cobb is quite different. Information was given to Cobb by a co-conspirator that the marijuana was being imported from Mexico. His request that the co-conspirator defer delivery does not negate his knowledge of the source.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">Cobb also argues that with the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the indictment as to co-conspirator Allen Davidowitz and the reversal as to Spivey, he \u201cwill remain as a \u2018single conspirator\u2019 requiring reversal under Judge Waterman\u2019s decision in U. S. v. Roupinion, et al., (decided August 23, 1971).\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>elusion is not supported by the facts. Cobb at no time was a single conspirator. Amongst others were Astor, Levin, Hernick, Epstein, Lapidus, Klein, Car-dona and Kamberg. The proof connected Cobb with one or more of this group.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Cobb\u2019s conviction affirmed; Spivey\u2019s conviction reversed and indictment as to him dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-16\">.
