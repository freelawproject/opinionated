Following his trial for assault, the Nebraska court, after a hearing, found that appellant was an habitual criminal ui.der Nebraska law and sentenced him to ten years on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. The Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed. State v. McGhee, 184 Neb. 352, 167 N.W.2d 765 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-13\">Appellant sought relief in the United States District Court upon six grounds which are enumerated in Judge Ur-bom\u2019s opinion reported at McGhee v. Sig-ler, 328 F.Supp. 538 (D.Neb.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-14\">Appellant, in his pro se brief, seeks reversal of the district court\u2019s order on the ground that his 1952 conviction in the District Court of Lancaster County, Nebraska was invalid and his 1960 conviction in the District Court of Pocahontas County, Iowa also was invalid. Consequently it is argued that neither the 1952 conviction nor the 1960 conviction could form the basis for enhancement of his 1968 conviction referred to above. Judge Urbom carefully considered all of appellant\u2019s claims and, in a soundly reasoned opinion, convincingly demonstrated that both the 1952 and 1960 convictions were constitutionally valid. We agree and affirm on the basis of Judge Urbom\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
