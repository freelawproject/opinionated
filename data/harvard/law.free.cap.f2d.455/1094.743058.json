However, after tracing the vehicle\u2019s serial number, federal authorities determined it had been stolen from an automobile dealer in Mobile, Alabama. FBI Agent Degnan went to Mobile where he questioned Hall, who worked at the dealership. Hall remembered two men inquiring about the Oldsmobile shortly before it disappeared. He described one of them as a large, hairy, wrestler type, a description that fits appellant. Hall was then shown eight photographs and asked if any were the man he had just described. He picked out a photo of appellant. Hall testified at appellant\u2019s trial and identified him in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-9\">Appellant raises only one point on appeal. He argues that Hall\u2019s in-court identification should not have been admitted since appellant\u2019s counsel was not present in Mobile when the photographs were shown to Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-10\">This conviction must be affirmed for several reasons. First, appellant concedes that he waived appointment of counsel prior to indictment on the federal charge, and thus had no counsel at the time of the challenged photographic display. He does not assert that this waiver was other than knowing and intelligent, but appears to contend an attorney should have been appointed despite the waiver and sent to Mobile. Appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel was apparently effective, but we shall, nevertheless, reach the alternative basis for our holding that appellant\u2019s sixth amendment rights were not violated by the absence of counsel at the photographic identification.</p>\n<p id=\"apu-dedup-1\">In Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968), the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-12\">Despite the hazards of initial identification by photograph, this procedure has been used widely and effectively in criminal law enforcement, from the standpoint both of apprehending offenders and of sparing innocent suspects the ignominy of arrest by allowing eye-witnesses to exonerate them through scrutiny of photographs. The danger that use of the technique may result in convictions based on misidentification may be substantially lessened by a course of cross-examination at trial which exposes to the jury the method\u2019s potential for error. We are unwilling to prohibit its employment, either in the exercise of our supervisory power or, still less, as a matter of constitutional requirement. Instead, we hold that each case must be considered on its own facts, and that <em>convictions based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside on that ground only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermis-sibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. </em>This standard accords with our resolution of a similar issue in Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 301-302 [87 S.Ct. 1967, 1972-1973, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199], and with decisions of other courts on the question of identification by photograph. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1159-13\">In the instant case Hall talked to appellant in broad daylight. Two months later he was questioned by Agent Degnan, who asked him to describe the man who had inquired about the Oldsmobile that later disappeared. Hall described appellant accurately as a large man of remarkable appearance. Degnan then displayed the photographs and without prompting Hall picked out appellant. The photos were not marked in any way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>that would call attention to appellant\u2019s picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">Hall testified that his in-court identification of appellant was based on his recollection of appellant\u2019s appearance when the two men talked in Mobile. Despite vigorous cross-examination by appellant\u2019s attorney, Hall insisted that he remembered appellant from their personal encounter rather than from the photographic display and that he had picked out appellant\u2019s photograph without prompting from the FBI Agent. The record is devoid of evidence that \u201cthe photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d Simmons v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 884, 88 S.Ct. at 971. <em>See </em>United States v. Driscoll, 454 F.2d 792, 5th Cir. [1972].</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">Finally, appellant relies on United States v. Zeiler, 3rd Cir. 1970, 427 F.2d 1305, in which the court held that \u201cthe rule of the <em>Wade </em>case [United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed.2d 1149 (1967)] applies to pretrial photographic identifications of an accused who is in custody.\u201d The Supreme Court held in <em>Wade </em>that counsel should be present at post-indictment lineups. <em>Zeiler </em>extended <em>Wade </em>to photographic identifications of an accused who is in custody even though not yet indicted. <em>Zeiler </em>is, however, distinguishable from the instant case. Zeiler was represented by counsel. A lineup was scheduled at which his counsel planned to be present. However, before the lineup FBI agents displayed photographs to witnesses out of the presence of the attorney. The photographs were highly suggestive. There were three of Zeiler and only one of each of the other supposed suspects. The witnesses had said the robber was wearing glasses and of the persons depicted only Zeiler\u2019s picture showed the subject wearing glasses. His photos were common snapshots while those of the others were obviously police mugshots. Furthermore, many of the witnesses had been robbed by the man suspected to be Zeiler three years before being asked to identify the pictures. Finally, the photographs were shown to the witnesses as an aid in the prosecution of Zeiler for a crime of which he was accused and for which he was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">In the present case, although appellant, who was found in possession of a ear in Louisiana that had been stolen in Alabama, was certainly suspected of a federal crime at the time the pictures were shown to Hall, he was not yet \u201caccused\u201d except under state law and was in custody for the state offense. It was only after Hall identified appellant\u2019s photo that the basic elements of the federal crime were supplied and appellant could be termed the \u201caccused\u201d under the rationale of <em>Zeiler. </em>When Agent Deg-nan went to Mobile, appellant\u2019s case was still at the investigatory stage. Appellant urges us to hold that <em>Wade </em>and <em>Zeiler </em>require, without exception, the presence of counsel at photographic identifications of the accused once he has become a suspect in a criminal investigation. No court has thus extended <em>Wade, </em>and we refuse to do so. Instead, we shall follow the guidance of the Supreme Court in <em>Simmons, supra, </em>and consider each ease on its own facts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-8\">[C]onvictions based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside on that ground only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1160-9\">Simmons v. United States, <em>supra, </em>390 U.S. at 384, 88 S.Ct. at 971. In the instant case, in contrast to <em>Zeiler, </em>the photographic identification was not \u201cimper-missibly suggestive\u201d and it did not \u201cgive rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
