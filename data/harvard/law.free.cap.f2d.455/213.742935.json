(collectively referred to as the employer), here appeal from a judgment entered in a wage and hour case. The Secretary of Labor, acting pursuant to \u00a7 17 of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq., sought an injunction against further violations of the FLSA\u2019s overtime and record keeping provisions. Additionally, the Secretary sought restitution of unpaid overtime compensation due three named employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-16\">The district court on summary judgment found that the employer was engaged in an enterprise covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. It ordered restitution and enjoined the employer from further violations of the Act. The findings of the court were premised on an initial finding that the employer was engaged, among other activities, in installing ceramic tile, floor covering and countertops in the construction of residential and commercial buildings, and that it employed individuals who worked on goods which had moved in, or been produced for, interstate commerce. The court, therefore, found the employer to be an enterprise engaged in construction or reconstruction and coverage prescribed by \u00a7\u00a7 3(r) and 3(s) (3) of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>On appeal the employer attacks the summary judgment in favor of the Secretary on the grounds that there was a factual issue of whether the business was an enterprise engaged in construction, or whether it was a retail or service establishment which did not meet the Act\u2019s requirements for coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The issue of whether an employer is \u201cengaged in the business of construction or reconstruction or both,\u201d or whether it is a \u201cretail or service establishment,\u201d is initially a question of fact for the district court. While the law applicable to the findings is clear,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it cannot be applied without that initial factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">It appears from the Secretary\u2019s brief that the factual issue was resolved by stipulation to the effect that the employer here was engaged in the construction and reconstruction business. Unfortunately, from the reconstructed record on appeal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we are unable to verify that assertion. If, as appellants assert, a factual issue remained open, a grant of summary judgment was improper, but if, as the Secretary maintains, the parties stipulated to the critical facts, then the judgment should be affirmed. To resolve these conflicting assertions, we remand to the district court for such further proceedings as shall be deemed necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">In the interest of judicial economy and to avoid the necessity of a further appeal, we hold that if the district court finds the employer has so stipulated, then its judgment shall be affirmed. However, since the order as issued additionally required the employer to make restitution of unpaid wages and overtime in a sum certain (an issue of fact volubly in dispute on appeal), we vacate and remand for an evidentiary determination of the amount, if any, due the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Vacated and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-9\">.
