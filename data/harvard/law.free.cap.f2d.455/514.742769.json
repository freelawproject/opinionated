We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that all the issues raised here will be cognizable in the state courts of Pennsylvania, and therefore affirm the order dismissing the petition. United States ex rel. Huffman v. Commonwealth Court of Dauphin County, 453 F.2d 1254 (3d Cir., 1972).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
