S.C. \u00a7 407. The fine was originally imposed as a lump sum, but then District Judge Mansfield later allowed payment quarterly, in five installments of $5,000 each. After having paid the first $5,000 installment, appellant submitted a motion for suspension of the remainder of the fine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which Judge Wyatt denied on the ground that the district court lacked power to grant such an application. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-26\"> The Probation Act of 1925 allows the district court to suspend the imposition or execution of sentence \u201c[ujpon entering a judgment of eonvie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>tion . . . . \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651. This is the only source of the federal courts\u2019 probationary powers. United States v. Murray, 275 U.S. 347, 357, 48 S.Ct. 146, 72 L.Ed. 309 (1928); Ex parte United States, 242 U.S. 27, 37 S. Ct. 72, 61 L.Ed. 129 (1916). <em>But cf. </em>United States v. Benz, 282 U.S. 304, 309, 51 S.Ct. 113, 75 L.Ed. 354 (1931). Most previous cases arising under this statute have involved incarceration rather than fines, although fines are also included within its scope. United States v. Berger, 145 F.2d 888 (2d Cir. 1944), cert. denied, 324 U.S. 848, 65 S.Ct. 685, 89 L. Ed. 1408 (1945). Indeed, in this case Judge Mansfield suspended sentence as to fines totaling $100,000 in connection with appellant\u2019s conviction under counts 11 through 50. The crucial question, however, is <em>when </em>the district court may suspend a fine. There are no cases directly on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">When a prison sentence is involved, the suspension authority \u201c . . . terminates when the convicted defendant actually enters upon the service of his prison sentence.\u201d United States v. Ellenbogen, 390 F.2d 537, 541 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 918, 89 S.Ct. 241, 21 L.Ed.2d 206 (1968). <em>See also </em>Affronti v. United States, 350 U.S. 79, 83, 76 S.Ct. 171, 174, 100 L.Ed. 62 (1955) [\u201c . . . probationary power ceases with respect to all of the sentences composing a single cumulative sentence immediately upon imprisonment for any part of the cumulative sentence\u201d (footnote omitted) ]. Similarly we believe that authority terminates as to installment fines when the first installment has been paid, as it has here, since appellant\u2019s \u201cservice of sentence\u201d has commenced. Appellant argues that the termination of authority to suspend was designed solely to prevent conflicts between district courts and the federal parole board, and that the rule should be restricted to cases of imprisonment. But suspension long after the sentencing proceeding would give fine-payers second or third chances to have their cases heard again before more sympathetic judges as well as duplicate the provisions for executive clemency. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Murray, <em>supra, </em>275 U.S. at 356-357, 48 S.Ct. 146. Since there is no congressional directive to the contrary, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Bearing in mind, however, the stricture of United States v. Murray, <em>supra </em>at 357, 48 S.Ct. at 149, that we should seek \u201c . . . to reconcile the provisions for probation, parole, and executive clemency . . .,\u201d we will continue the stay for sixty days, with leave to apply to this panel for a further extension for cause shown, so as to permit the defendant to make application for executive clemency under article II, Section 2, of the Constitution and pertinent regulations, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1 et seq. We express no opinion whatsoever on the merits of any such application.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-17\">. The apparent substantive basis of appellant\u2019s request for suspension is a combination of financial inability and cooperative attitude, including \u201csubstantial sums\u201d expended to combat the pollution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
