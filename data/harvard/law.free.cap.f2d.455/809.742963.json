Brenneman, were charged in a four count indictment with manufacturing and selling dl amphetamine sulphate and conspiring to violate the narcotics laws of the United States. Hershberger pleaded guilty to one count; Holly pleaded guilty to two counts. Both testified for the government at the trial of the charges against Brenneman. The remaining counts of the indictment against Hershberger and Holly were dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">In early March of 1970, Holly and Hershberger reached a \u201cmutual understanding.\u201d Holly would locate someone who would buy substantial quantities of \u201cspeed\u201d; Hershberger would find a source. In pursuing his part of the understanding, Holly talked to \u201ca friend.\u201d The friend purportedly located a buyer and a meeting was arranged. Holly received a bottle of dl amphetamine sulphate from Hershberger. That evening the friend brought \u201cEd\u201d to the dairy bar where Holly worked. Holly and Ed sat and talked about price and quality testing. The friend sat in a booth approximately fifteen feet away. Following their conversation Holly walked to the front of the store with Ed and handed him a bag containing the bottle. Holly gave the friend a small portion of the proceeds of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">Ed turned out to be a narcotics agent; the friend turned out to be an informant. Appellant\u2019s counsel attempted to elicit the name of the friend during cross-examination of Holly. The government successfully objected on the ground that he was a \u201cconfidential informant\u201d and that no need for disclosure of his identity had been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">Hershberger testified that Brenneman was the source and had produced the \u201cspeed\u201d in his basement laboratory. Brenneman testified that he had never supplied Hershberger with drugs. The jury, after a lengthy deliberation, found Brenneman guilty as charged. Brenne-man had a good reputation in his community and no prior criminal record. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment and fined $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-16\">Brenneman here maintains that failure to disclose the identity of Holly\u2019s friend<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was reversible \u201e error and that, under all of the circumstances of this case, the sentence imposed was an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>of discretion. We find merit in neither contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">Resolution of a question raised by a demand for disclosure of the identity of a confidential informant \u201ccalls for balancing the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual\u2019s right to prepare his defense.\u201d Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 62, 77 S.Ct. 623, 629, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1956). In order to tip the scales in favor of disclosure, there must be some indication that access to the informer may be \u201chelpful to the defense of an accused\u201d or \u201cessential to a fair determination of a cause.\u201d Roviaro v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 60-61, 77 S.Ct. at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">As in United States v. Konigsberg, 336 F.2d 844, 848 (3rd Cir. 1964), we are convinced from the record that disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity would not have been helpful to the defense here and was \u201cpalpably not essential to the fair determination of this cause.\u201d Appellant\u2019s speculation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that testimony or information from the informant might have been used to impeach or cross-examine Holly and \u201cmight even have led to the appellant\u2019s being able to raise the issue of entrapment\u201d does not persuade us to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Here the informant\u2019s participation was peripheral. He was not in a position to contradict or amplify any of the Holly testimony upon which Brenneman\u2019s conviction rests. The significance of Holly\u2019s testimony so far as Brenneman was concerned was that a sale of dl amphetamine supplied by Hershberger took place.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hershberger, not Holly, implicated Brenneman.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Nor is there any indication that the informant could have provided a basis for a claim of entrapment. In addition to the fact that Holly and Hershberger conceived the scheme before Holly\u2019s friend was contacted, Brenneman himself gave testimony which was irreconcilable with any theory of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">Finally, we find no extraordinary circumstances warranting review of appellant\u2019s sentence. Compare United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972). It was in conformity with the statute and we decline to review it. United States v. Fessler, 453 F.2d 953 (3rd Cir. 1972); United States v. Restaino, 405 F.2d 628 (3rd Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 904, 89 S.Ct. 1012, 22 L.Ed.2d 216 (1969); Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 389 (1958); United States v. Brown, 382 F. 2d 52 (3rd Cir. 1967); United States v. Frank, 245 F.2d 284 (3rd Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 819, 78 S.Ct. 25, 2 L.Ed.2d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-11\">. Appellant maintains that Holly\u2019s knowledge of the identity of the informant is inconsistent with the government\u2019s assertion that his identity was a \u201cconfidential\u201d matter. Appellant relies upon the court\u2019s observation in Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 60, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1956), that the government\u2019s privilege against disclosure terminates when the \u201cidentity of informer has been disclosed to those who would have cause to resent the communication.\u201d At that point, the goal of keeping sources of information secret in order to protect them from retaliation is unobtainable. But, the Supreme Court in <em>Roviaro </em>certainly did not indicate that the informant\u2019s privilege terminated when the identity of an informer, although already known to someone who would have reason to be vindictive, was still unknown to others who would have cause to retaliate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b875-8\">. Appellant\u2019s counsel offered the court below no factual basis for treating his assertions as anything other than speculation and did not request an <em>in camera </em>examination of the informant by the court. Compare United States v. Jackson, 384 F.2d 825 (3rd Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 392 U.S. 932, 88 S.Ct. 2292, 20 L.Ed.2d 1390 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"ABSz\">.
