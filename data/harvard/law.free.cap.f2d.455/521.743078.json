Reference is made to the published opinion of the Michigan Court of Appeals, People v. Benberry, 24 Mich.App. 188, 180 N.W.2d 391, for a detailed recitation of the facts and issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-20\">District Judge Lawrence Gubow denied the writ and dismissed the petition. We agree with the District Court that Benberry\u2019s contentions are directed at alleged errors in his trial in the State court that present no grounds for habeas corpus relief. There is no showing that he was deprived of a fair trial or due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
