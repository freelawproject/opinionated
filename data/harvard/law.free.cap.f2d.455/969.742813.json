Key, Jr., and Betty Lee Wagoner because of their activities on behalf of the union. The respondent contends that both Key and Wagoner were discharged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>not for their union activity but rather because of their solicitation on behalf of the union during working hours in violation of a company rule barring such solicitation. Respondent admits that credibility resolutions are peculiarly within the province of the Trial Examiner and the Board. It asserts, however, that a clear preponderance of the relevant evidence demonstrates that those credibility findings are incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">We see no merit in the respondent\u2019s contentions since an examination of the record as a whole discloses substantial evidence in support of the Trial Examiner\u2019s findings with respect to the discharges of both Key and Wagoner. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">Accordingly, we dispense with oral argument and enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
