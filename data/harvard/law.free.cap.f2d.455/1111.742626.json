Defendants are the Secretary of Transportation and various federal and state highway administrators. Plaintiffs appeal from denial of their motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>preliminary injunction. We vacate the order and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">A. <em>The facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">After several years of preliminary study, beginning in 1944 and continuing into the 1960s, the State of Washington proposed an interstate highway (1-90) to be built in a corridor between particular interchanges of two existing interstate highways (1-5 and 1-405) under the terms of the Federal-Aid Highways Act, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq. Within the selected corridor, three routes were chosen by the State as possible ones to be considered at a public hearing pursuant to 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 128, which was held on March 5, 1963. Following the hearing, the State selected a corridor for the final location of 1-90, which received approval by the Federal Bureau of Public Roads on May 20, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">In June 1970, the State held a public hearing on the design of that segment of 1-90 to be constructed within the chosen corridor in Seattle. Federal approval of the design has not yet been sought or obtained, nor has federal approval for right-of-way acquisition or construction. However, federal authorization has been given to the State for the acquisition of 184 housing units which the property owners asked the State to buy because \u201cundue hardship\u201d would result from following the standard procedure of deferring acquisition until after federal approval of the design. These so-called hardship acquisitions, authorized by a Department of Transportation regulation (DoT IM 20-1-69, April 8, 1969), had by September 4, 1970, resulted in 103 families moving out of the corridor area to other parts of Seattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">The trial judge found that the persons requesting these \u201chardship\u201d acquisitions have obtained decent, safe and sanitary housing. The defendants assert and we assume that these persons have also received the payments for relocation authorized by the Act (23 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 504-507), and have been assisted by an active program of scrutiny to be sure that replacement housing is decent, safe and sanitary. For the purpose of this case, we also assume that the state has been endeavoring to maintain the properties sold to it in a decent, safe and sanitary condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-9\">Nevertheless, it is not really disputed that the choice of a corridor, such as occurred in this case in 1963, is bound to have a deleterious effect on the area within the corridor. As a practical matter, there is no longer an open market for the property in the corridor; there is only one potential buyer, the state. The inevitable effect is a lessening of the property owner\u2019s motivation to maintain his property and a depressing effect upon property values and the general physical, economic and social tone of the area. Residents know that many, if not all, of them are going to have to move out; owners know that most, if not all, of them are going to have to sell. The type of community spirit that seeks to preserve, protect, and improve a neighborhood is bound to disappear under these conditions. These effects are so well known, and so obvious, to those familiar with the urban scene that we would be naive indeed to believe that they do not exist within the corridor here in question, or that they do not exist in this case to an exacerbated extent. The corridor runs through a densely populated, low income, city area; the residents are primarily the poor and persons of minority races.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">Plaintiffs, residents of the portion of the corridor area called the Central Area, seek to prevent continued progress on the planning and construction of 1-90, until <em>inter alia, </em>(1) the defendants comply with the relocation provisions of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 502 and 508; (2) the federal defendants comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 et seq.; and (3) a new public hearing on the proposed highway route is had.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">B. <em>The statutory scheme.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">We take from the brief of the federal defendants a description of the statutory scheme. The Federal-Aid Highways Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq., establishes a grant-in-aid program under which the federal Government will pay 90% of the cost of interstate highways if the Secretary of Transportation finds the State plans comply with standards set forth in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">The building of any section of federally-funded roadway (designated a \u201cproject\u201d) involves a series of successive stages. There is, at the outset, the \u201cprogram\u201d stage, during which a state desiring financial assistance is to \u201csubmit to the Secretary for his approval a program or programs of proposed projects for the utilization of the funds apportioned\u201d for any fiscal year (23 U.S.C. \u00a7 105). The Secretary\u2019s approval of any \u201cprogram\u201d does not bind the Government to a contractual obligation.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">Next come the \u201crouting\u201d and \u201cengineering design\u201d stages, which form the focus of this litigation. Following approval of the program by the Secretary, the State selects the different project routes (23 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(d)) and prepares, for the Secretary\u2019s review- \u2014 and approval if the proper standards are met \u2014\u201csuch surveys, plans, specifications, and estimates for each proposed project included in an approved program\u201d as relate to the route location. 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(a). The same process is repeated with respect to design.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">23 U.S.C. \u00a7 128(a) provides that any State highway department which submits plans for a federal-aid highway project involving the \u201cgoing through\u201d of any city shall certify to the Secretary that it has held public hearings and has considered the effects of such location. As originally enacted (P.L. 85-767, Aug. 27, 1958, 72 Stat. 902) this section required only that the \u201ceconomic\u201d effects of such highway location be considered. The amended version of this section (P.L. 90-495, \u00a7 24, Aug. 23, 1968, 82 Stat. 828) now provides that in addition to the economic effects of such location, these hearings should also consider its \u201csocial [effect] * * *, its impact on the environment, and its consistency with the goals and objectives of such urban planning as has been promulgated by the community.\u201d This statute has been interpreted by the Department of Transportation as requiring two public hearings on a highway \u201cgoing through\u201d a city; once for the location of the route, <em>i. e., </em>a \u201ccorridor hearing\u201d, and once concerning the design, <em>i. e., </em>a \u201cdesign hearing\u201d. See PPM 20-8 (January 14, 1969) para. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">If the Secretary is satisfied with the certification and other information he receives, he first approves the route location and thereafter the design as part of the approval under Section 106; even after such approvals, there is still no contractual obligation on the part of the Government to expend funds for right-of-way acquisitions or project construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">No purchase of right-of-way ordinarily occurs during the \u201crouting\u201d and \u201cengineering design\u201d stages. However, Policy and Procedure Memorandum (PPM) 20-8 (January 14, 1969), para. lO.e, and Instructional Memorandum (IM) 20-1-69, para. (4), as amended by IM 20-1-69(2) provide that where a property owner demonstrates he is suffering hardship due to the possible construction of an interstate highway, he may request the State authorities to purchase his property. The State, with federal approval, is authorized to make such purchase and obtain federal reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-11\">The \u201cright-of-way acquisition\u201d stage follows the \u201cengineering design\u201d stage. Apart from the hardship exception and certain others defined in IM 20-1-69, <em>supra, </em>no right-of-way acquisition can be authorized until after the design has been approved. PPM 20-8 (January 14, 1968), para. 10.d(2). By regulation, right-of-way surveys, plans and specifications are then filed with the Federal Government (PPM 20-5). After the adoption of Chapter 5 of the Federal Highway Act of 1968, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 et seq., the Federal Highway Administration issued an Instructional Memorandum (IM) 80-1-68, which became the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>applicable regulation for implementing the new relocation assistance program. Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 502, and paragraph 5 of IM 80-1-68, the State must submit \u201csatisfactory assurances\u201d that it can provide prospective displacees with adequate relocation housing and payments. Under paragraph 7 of the IM, \u201cprior to proceeding with right-of-way negotiations and/or construction,\u201d a State is required to prepare a detailed plan of relocation \u201cfor review and approval by the division engineer.\u201d If the division engineer is satisfied, authorization to purchase parcels of land within the project right-of-way is given under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 106, and the Government is then contractually obligated to participate in such acquisitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">Finally, there is the actual \u201cconstruction\u201d stage (PPM 21-7), which is to \u201cbe undertaken by the respective State highway departments or under their direct supervision\u201d (23 U.S.C. \u00a7 114). It cannot commence without federal authorization from the division engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">In short, federal law establishes five stages in the construction of a federally financed highway: program, routing, engineering design, right-of-way acquisition, and actual construction. The facts relevant to the present case pertain entirely to the routing and design stages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">In addition to the above provisions of law, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 et seq., which took effect on January 1, 1970, establishes additional requirements pertaining to the construction of federally financed highways. This Act provides among other things that the impact of all \u201cmajor\u201d federal actions which significantly affect the quality of human environment be considered by the responsible federal official and that before such major actions are taken a detailed statement of environmental impact be prepared by the responsible Federal official.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">Federal Highway Administration regulations require similar environmental impact evaluations from state highway departments seeking federal approval and aid for interstate highway projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">The defendants do not argue that Chapter 5 of the Highway Act and NEPA do not apply to this case. They concede their applicability, but deny that the time to apply them has yet arrived. The trial judge agreed with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">C. <em>The posture of the case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-12\">Because this appeal is from the denial of a preliminary injunction, defendants rely on cases holding that the plaintiffs must show that they are likely to prevail on the merits, that the balance of irreparable harm favors the issuance of the injunction, and usually that the public interest supports granting the injunction. Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, Vol. 7, If 65.04; Yakus v. United States, 1944, 321 U.S. 414, 440, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, 1929, 279 U.S. 813, 815, 49 S.Ct. 256, 73 L.Ed. 972; Schwartz v. Covington, 9 Cir., 1965, 341 F.2d 537, 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">We think, however, that this is one of the exceptional cases falling within the principle announced by the Supreme Court in United States v. City and County of San Francisco, 1940, 310 U.S. 16, 60 S.Ct. 749, 84 L.Ed. 1050. There, in answer to a similar argument, the Court said (pp. 30-31, 60 S.Ct. p. 757):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-14\">\u201c * * * we are satisfied that this case does not call for a balancing of equities or for the invocation of the generalities of judicial maxims in order to determine whether an injunction should have issued. * * * The equitable doctrines relied on do not militate against the capacity of a court of equity as a proper forum in which to make a declared policy of Congress effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-15\">Here, the basic facts are not disputed. The only question is when and how the admittedly applicable statutes must be applied. That the statutes are designed to implement important public policies is conceded. The manner and timing of their application is cru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>cial. The longer there is delay in applying Chapter 5 of the Federal Highway Act, the more hardship sales to the state there will be, and the fewer will be the residents of the corridor who receive the full benefit of the chapter. The longer the delay in applying NEPA, the more the neighborhood will have deteriorated and the less will be the chance to Droteet the city and its people from the environmentally detrimental effects of this project. In short, this is one of those comparatively rare cases in which, unless the plaintiffs receive <em>now </em>whatever relief they are entitled to, there is danger that it will be of little or no value to them or to anyone else when finally obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-12\">D. <em>The relocation provisions of Federal-Aid Highway Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-13\">Chapter 5 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 et seq.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and its successor the Uniform Relocation Act, 84 Stat. 1894,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> require the state defendants to submit satisfactory assurances to the federal defendants that within a reasonable period prior to displacement there will be available for persons displaced by state acquisitions of land for the proposed highway adequate replacement housing (\u201cdecent, safe, and sanitary dwellings, equal in number to the number of, and available to, such displaced families and individuals * * *.\u201d) The implementing regulations define such \u201cassurances\u201d in detail <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and defendants admit that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>have not been given. They claim that such assurances are not required until final federal approval is given to the project, which has not yet occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\">In our opinion, the defendants\u2019 view is not supported either by the language of the statute or by its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">1. <em>The language of the statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"a7a-dedup-0\">Section 502 (fn. 1, <em>supra) </em>prohibits approval <em>\u201cunder </em>\u00a7 <em>106\u201d </em>of any project which <em>\u201cwill cause the displacement </em>of any person, business * * * unless he receives satisfactory assurances * * * that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-7\">\u201c(3) <em>within a reasonable time prior to displacement </em>there will be available * * * \u201d housing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">And Section 511(3) defines a \u201cdisplaced person\u201d as \u201cany person who moves * * * <em>as a result of </em>the acquisition or <em>reasonable expectation of acquisition </em>of [his] property * * * for a Federal-aid highway. * * *\u201d 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(3). <em>(Emphasis added.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-10\">The approval of the corridor in 1963 was, as the federal defendants say in their brief, \u201cunder \u00a7 106.\u201d We think it pure sophistry to say that the 184 owners who sold out to the state, and the 103 families who moved out, as a result of such sales, were not displaced, or that they did not sell or move \u201cas a result of a reasonable expectation of acquisition\u201d of the property, or that the project did not \u201ccause the displacement [s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-11\">As the state defendants say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-12\">\u201cOnce a corridor has been established, the foreseeable condemnation of property within that corridor often renders such property unmarketable for a fair price. This condition may exist for several years and, in some cases, depending upon the circumstances, imposes an enormous hardship upon various property owners.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1183-19\">2. <em>The purpose of the statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-20\">The policies behind the enactment of Chapter 5 point to the same conclusion. The purpose of the chapter is to protect all persons who will be displaced from their homes because of a federal-aid highway program. Nothing in its language, or in the legislative history cited to us, suggests that it is to become fully operative only when the final design is approved and actual condemnation proceedings are authorized. If the purpose of the statute is to be accomplished, it must be fully implemented not later than the approval of the \u201ccorridor\u201d or \u201croute\u201d of the highway under section 106.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At that point, the route is known, although the precise location of the right of way within it is not. At that point all of the pressures leading to displacement come into play. Unless the state is then in a position to give the statutory assurances as defined by the Secretary, there is danger that displacements will proceed without anyone\u2019s knowing whether the requirements of the statute can be fully met. \u201cHardship\u201d displacements may use up all of the available housing that meets statutory requirements, leaving the project stalled and the remaining residents of the corridor trapped in a deteriorating area, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>at the time of design approval the necessary assurances cannot be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">3. <em>The Secretary\u2019s regulations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3I\">The Secretary appears to have interpreted Chapter 5 as applying before the final approval stage. DoT Instructional Memorandum 80-1-68 states in ,jf 2(b) (3) that its provisions apply to rights-of-way acquired without Federal participation upon which the State \u201cintends to construct\u201d a federal-aid highway. Such projects would not necessarily have received final federal approval at that stage. Paragraph 5 of the same memo states: \u201cNo State highway department shall be authorized to proceed with any phase of any project which will cause displacement of any person * * * until it has furnished satisfactory assurances * * That paragraph clearly does not limit its application to projects for which final federal approval was being sought. On the contrary, it would seem to apply squarely to the situation here, in which federal approval has been given for the highway location and federal authorization has been given for acquisitions of much property on a hardship basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">None of defendants\u2019 other arguments appear persuasive. General statewide assurances and promises to comply for all federal-aid projects do not satisfy the specific requirements of 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 502 and DoT IM 80-1-68. No exception to the relocation requirements is provided in the case of hardship acquisitions; the only exception granted for those situations is from the requirement of design approval prior to the beginning of formal .displacement proceedings. See DoT IM 20-1-69, j[ 4. If the portions of the DoT Manuals providing for hardship acquisitions are construed, as defendants suggest, to excuse full compliance with Chapter 5 until after the design is approved, they are, to that extent, inconsistent with the statutory scheme and invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">To delay compliance could well result in the situation that faced the Fifth Circuit in Concerned Citizens for the Preservation of Clarksville v. Volpe, 5 Cir., 1971, 445 F.2d 486, (1971). There, acquisition of property had proceeded in spite of the failure of the State to submit relocation assurances, so that by the time the appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction reached the Fifth Circuit the case had become moot by displacement of virtually all residents. No irreparable injury will result to defendants from granting the injunction, and any irreparable injury to those residents who genuinely qualify for hardship acquisitions can be avoided by permitting such transactions upon approval by the district judge granting the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-11\">The public interest, as evidenced by the policies embodied in 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 et seq., supports the granting of a preliminary injunction. One purpose of the statutory scheme was to protect the public interest by insuring that the housing market in a particular area could handle the influx of persons displaced by a federal-aid highway project. The public interest would be best served by requiring the defendants to halt further activity which displaces persons from the corridor until the statute\u2019s requirements have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-12\">E. <em>The National Environmental Policy Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-13\">Plaintiffs claim that the 1-90 project is proceeding in violation of NEPA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 <em>et seq., </em>because no environmental impact statement has been prepared and submitted as required by the statute. They are right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-14\">The statute and implementing regulations indicate beyond question that the requirements of NEPA apply to the 1-90 project. The DoT, like other federal agencies which undertake activities which may affect the environment, must prepare and submit a so-called Section 102(2) (C) statement of the environmental impact of major federal actions. 1-90 already qualifies as a major federal action, even though final federal approval of design or construction plans has not yet been given. Federal highway officials approved the proposed lo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>cation of 1-90 in 1963 and have continued to authorize acquisitions of property for the right-of-way since that time. Given the purpose of NEPA to insure that actions by federal agencies be taken with due consideration of environmental effects and with a minimum of such adverse effects, it is especially important with regard to federal-aid highway projects that the \u00a7 102(2) (C) statement be prepared early. If defendants\u2019 contention were accepted \u2014 that no environmental impact statement is required until the final approval stage \u2014 then it could well be too late to adjust the formulated plans so as to minimize adverse environmental effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-4\">Once the highway-planning process has reached these latter stages, flexibility in selecting alternative plans has to a large extent been lost. To paraphrase the District of Columbia Circuit, \u201cIn the language of NEPA, there is likely to be an \u2018irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources,\u2019 which will inevitably restrict the [highway officials\u2019] options. Either the [highway planners] will have to undergo a major expense in making alterations in a completed [plan] or the environmental harm will have to be tolerated. It is all too probable that the latter result would come to pass.\u201d Calvert Cliff\u2019s Coordinating Committee v. U. S. Atomic Energy Commission, D. C.Cir., 1971, 449 F.2d 1109 (1971).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This was clearly not the intent of Congress when it enacted NEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">The guidelines issued by the Council on Environmental Quality, a NEPA-cre-ated entity, also indicate that federal highway officials should have begun preparation of a Section 102(2) (C) statement immediately after passage of NEPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-9\">\u201cTo the maximum extent practicable the Section 102(2) (C) procedure should be applied to further major federal actions having a significant effect on the environment <em>even though they arise from projects or programs initiated prior to enactment of the Act </em>on January 1, 1970. Where it is not practicable to reassess the basic course of action, it is still important that further incremental major actions be shaped so as to minimize adverse environmental consequences. It is also important in further action that account be taken of environmental consequences not fully evaluated at the outset of the project or program.\u201d 36 Fed.Reg. 7724 (April 23, 1971) <em>(Emphasis added.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-11\">The State defendants are required by Federal Highway Administration regulations implementing NEPA and DoT Order 5610.1 to evaluate the environmental consequences of federal-aid highway projects and make a determination that a detailed environmental statement is necessary or that a \u201cnegative declaration\u201d of no significant environmental effect will suffice. See Interim Guidelines for Implementation of Section 102 (2) (C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-12\">Neither the federal nor the state defendants has complied with the requirements of the statute and regulations by submitting environmental impact statements, although acquisition of property for 1-90 has proceeded with evidence of consequent adverse effects on the environment of the Central Area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>F. <em>Constitutional Validity of Location Hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">Plaintiffs third contention is that the 1963 public hearing on the proposed location of 1-90 deprived them of certain procedural rights guaranteed by due process of law. We need not decide the merits of this contention, since we think the equitable defense of laches is available to defendants. Plaintiffs failed to raise this claim for over seven years after the hearing took place, during which time they knew of the hearing and its alleged deficiencies. Defendants have expended a substantial sum of money in reliance on the validity of that proceeding. Thus the two essential elements of laches \u2014 lack of diligence by plaintiff and injurious reliance thereon by defendant \u2014 are present and plaintiffs are precluded from challenging the validity of the hearing at this late date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">G. <em>Relief.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">The order denying a preliminary injunction is vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court. The court shall order the State defendants to prepare and submit to the court forthwith a proposed schedule, setting forth the dates on which and the manner in which they will prepare and submit to the Department of Transportation (1) a relocation program which complies with the requirements of the statute and relevant implementing regulations, and (2) an environmental statement pursuant to the interim guidelines established by the Federal Highway Administration under DoT Order 5610.1. The court shall also order the federal defendants to prepare and submit to the court forthwith a similar schedule for preparing a Section 102 (2) (C) environmental impact statement in consultation with the appropriate government agencies as required by NEPA.

In footnote 2 of our opinion we stated that the law of the State of Washington does not authorize payments and assistance required by URA \u00a7 221(c). The fact is that Washington law does authorize such payments and assistance. Washington Uniform Relocation Act (Wash. URA) ch. 240, Wash. Laws of 1971, Ex.Sess., effective July 1, 1971. Under the URA, Pub. L. 91-646, 84 Stat. 1894 (42 U.S.C. 1970 Ed. ch. 61, \u00a7 4601 ff), Section 221, the pertinent sections of that Act became effective on July 1, 1971, by reason of Washington\u2019s adoption of its URA, and the corresponding sections of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, discussed in our opinion, were repealed. The adoption of Wash. URA and its effect were called to our attention, both in brief and on oral argument, but we nevertheless overlooked them. Our error, not that of the parties, necessitates this supplemental opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-11\"> We believe that our opinion is a correct exposition of the law that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>in effect when the trial court acted. But we deal here with equitable relief by way of injunction, and we are bound to apply the Washington and federal laws as they now stand, not as they stood when the order appealed from was entered. <em>Cf. </em>Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church, 1972, 404 U.S. 412, 92 S.Ct. 574, 30 L.Ed. 2d 567, and cases cited. Nor does the existence of a saving clause in URA, sec. 220(b), affect this conclusion. That clause speaks of \u201c . . . rights or liabilities now existing under prior Acts. . . . \u201d It preserves rights accrued to persons displaced before URA became effective. But it does not speak to rights <em>in future, i. e., </em>what rights persons not yet displaced may have. As to them, we are satisfied that URA and Wash. URA apply here. Appellants do not disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">The question is, are plaintiffs\u2019 rights and State defendants\u2019 duties different under the new Acts, and if so, how do they differ? We find but one significant difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-8\">Until it enacted URA, Congress had proceeded in piecemeal fashion in providing protection and assistance for persons displaced by federal or federally assisted projects. URA is an attempt to provide such protection and assistance in all such cases. It therefore replaces the previous jumble of statutory provisions. Their repeal is provided for in Section 220(a), which lists no less than eleven acts or parts of acts that are repealed. When Congress adopted URA, it heard much testimony to the effect that federal agencies, and particularly the Department of Transportation, had engaged in a pattern of evasion of the requirements of the Federal-Aid Highways Act and other Acts relating to relocation. See, <em>e. g., </em>Hearings before the Committee on Public Works House of Representatives, 91st Cong., 1st and 2d Sess., on H.R. 14898 and 14899 and S.l and related bills, at p. 371. There is no reason to believe that Congress intended to afford less protection or assistance to persons displaced than had been provided for in the Highways Act; quite the contrary. Thus under the Highways Act, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 502(3) and 508(a) (2), replacement housing was to be assured \u201cto the extent that can reasonably be accomplished.\u201d No such limitation appears in the corresponding \u00a7 205(c) (3) of URA. URA also increases the monetary payments to be made: Compare \u00a7 202(b) with former 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 505(b), \u00a7 203(a) (1) with former 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a), and \u00a7 204 with former 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(b). See also \u00a7 206(a), applicable when existing housing is insufficient. See also \u00a7\u00a7 205(c) and 210(2) and \u00a7 206(b) of URA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-10\">As Mr. Justice Douglas, joined by Justices Black, Brennan, and Marshall, recently stated in a dissent to dismissal of a writ of certiorari as improvidently granted: \u201cThat Act [URA] . . . is so similar to the 1968 amendments [Chapter 5 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act] that any necessary interpretation of the 1968 amendments would be equally applicable to the 1970 Act.\u201d Triangle Improvement Council v. Ritchie, 1971, 402 U.S. 497, 504, n. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1650, 1653, 29 L.Ed.2d 61. Justice Hdr-lan, concurring with the dismissal of the writ, did not dispute that contention by Justice Douglas. <em>Id. </em>at 501, 91 S.Ct. 1650. The question involved in that case was interpretation of Section 502 of the 1968 Act and the effect of its replacement by Section 210 and 205(c) (3) of URA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-13\">Against this background, we examine URA. Section 210 of URA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aiu-dedup-1\">\u201cNotwithstanding any other law, the head of a Federal agency shall not approve any grant to, or contract or agreement with, a State agency, under which Federal financial assistance will be available to pay all or part of the cost of any program or project which will result in the displacement of any person on or after the effective date of this title, unless he receives satisfactory assurances from such State agency that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-14\">(1) fair and reasonable relocation payments and assistance shall be provided to or for displaced persons, as are required to be provided by a Fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>eral agency under sections 202, 203 and 204 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-4\">(2) relocation assistance programs offering the services described in section 205 shall be provided to such displaced persons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-5\">(3) within a reasonable period of time prior to displacement, decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwellings will be available to displaced persons in accordance with section 205(c) (3).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">Section 205(c) (3) gives a more detailed definition of such satisfactory assurances: \u201c . . . within a reasonable period of time, prior to displacement there will be available in areas not generally less desirable in regard to public utilities and public and commercial facilities and at rents or prices within the financial means of the families and individuals displaced, decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings, as defined by such Federal agency head, equal in number to the number of and available to such displaced persons who acquire such dwellings and reasonably accessible to their places of employment, except that the head of that Federal agency may prescribe by regulation situations when such assurances may be waived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">We hold that \u00a7 210 of URA is just as much applicable when the corridor is approved as was former \u00a7 502 of the Highway Act. Section 210 prohibits approval of \u201cany grant to, or contract or agreement with, a State agency\u201d unless the requisite \u201csatisfactory assurances\u201d are received. Federal authorization of hardship acquisitions is an \u201cagreement\u201d on the part of the federal government to reimburse the state for the cost of acquisitions of property. DoT IM 80-2-70, t\u00ed 11(d) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-16\">Section 101 of URA defines displaced persons as \u201cany person who, on or after the effective date of this Act, moves from real property . . . as a result of the acquisition of such real property, in whole or in part, or as the result of the written order of the acquiring agency to vacate real property, for a program or project undertaken by a Federal agency, or with Federal financial assistance. . . . \u201d We think it</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-18\">sophistry to say that persons who make \u201chardship\u201d sales to the state or who leave the property because the owner makes such a sale, do not move \u201cas a result of the acquisition\u201d, or to claim that their departures were \u201cvoluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-19\">The Secretary\u2019s regulations interpret URA as applicable before the final approval stage of the project. The implementing regulation is IM 80-1-71.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Paragraph 7, a, deals with statewide as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>surances which must be given before a State Highway Department may proceed with \u201cany phase of any project which <em>will cause </em>the relocation of any person.\u201d <em>[Emphasis added.] </em>This provision speaks of relocations that will occur in the future. The State of Washington has given such statewide assurance, and claims that no more is required until the stage of final approval of the right-of-way. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">Paragraph 7, b, provides that \u201c[n]o State shall be authorized <em>to proceed with right-of-way negotiations . . . which will cause </em>the relocation of any person until it has submitted specific assurances . . . dealing with the particular project\u201d (emphasis added). Their character is prescribed in detail in paragraph 15. Surely negotiations to acquire property for a highway on a \u201chardship\u201d basis are \u201cright-of-way negotiations\u201d and \u201cwill cause\u201d relocation. The Secretary thinks so. In paragraph 7, b, (1) he specifically refers to \u201chardship cases.\u201d Thus paragraphs 7, b, and 15 of IM 80-1-71 are applicable now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-17\">There is one difference of significance, however, between UR A and the former provisions of the Highway Act. Section 205(c) (3) of URA authorizes the Secretary to prescribe by regulation situations when the assurances required may be waived. The Secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>has utilized this authority to a limited extent in paragraph 7, b, (1) in the following language: \u201cWhere right-of-way is acquired in hardship cases and/or for protective buying, the required assurance together with an analysis of the relocation problems involved and a specific plan to resolve such problems shall be provided for each parcel or for the project.\u201d It is this requirement that the defendants must meet in this case. The State is required to supply, either for each parcel to be acquired or for the project, (1) assurances that within a reasonable period of time prior to displacement comparable replacement dwellings will be available or provided for each displaced person; (2) an analysis of the relocation problems involved, and (3) a specific plan to resolve such problems, in addition to the general assurances required by Section 210 of URA. So far as the record shows, the State has not done so and does not intend to unless the court requires that it shall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">The Federal defendants, not having received the required assurances, have been acting illegally, in authorizing, or paying out moneys for, the acquisition of properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">The State defendants have presented with their petition for a rehearing an environmental statement prepared by the State, which, they say, has been submitted to the Department of Transportation. They thus claim that the portion of our judgment requiring the submission of such a statement is moot. We adhere to the view that such a statement is required, but prefer to leave to the trial judge a determination as to whether the statement in question meets the obligation of the State defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">Except to the extent that it is inconsistent with this opinion, our former opinion remains the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">The judgment of this court is modified, to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-8\">The order denying a preliminary injunction is vacated and the case is remanded to the District Court. That court shall order the State defendants to prepare and submit to the court forthwith a statement showing the time or times when, and the manner in which, they propose to comply, for each parcel to be acquired, or for the project, with URA and IM 80-1-71 as herein construed. The State defendants shall submit to the court a copy of the environmental statement submitted to this court on November 30, 1971. The court shall order the Federal defendants to prepare and submit to the court forthwith a schedule for preparing a Section 102(2) (c) environmental impact statement in consultation with the appropriate governmental agencies as required by NEPA. Until such statement and schedule are submitted to the court, all further acquisitions of land by the defendants for the 1-90 project herein involved shall be enjoined. The court may, however, in cases of genuine hardship, permit hardship acquisitions by the State if it complies with URA and IM 80-1-71 in connection with such acquisitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-10\">If the court finds, after giving full weight to the need for speed in obtaining compliance with these statutes and regulations, that .the schedules presented to it by defendants are not adequate, it shall proceed on its own to set up a definite schedule of compliance for defendants to follow in performing their responsibilities under the law. If, on the other hand, the court is satisfied that the schedules presented are realistic and adequate, then it shall retain jurisdiction to insure compliance with the schedules and shall lift the injunction when it is satisfied that applicable federal law has been properly complied with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-11\">Vacated and remanded with directions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1190-12\">The petition for a rehearing is denied.

Since Washington law apparently does not authorize the State highway department to provide that assistance, the relocation provisions of the Federal-Aid Highway Act have not yet been repealed by the URA and are fully applicable to the 1-90 project. Even if the URA were applicable, all rights existing under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 et seq. were specifically preserved by the new Act (Section 220(b)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1181-15\">.
