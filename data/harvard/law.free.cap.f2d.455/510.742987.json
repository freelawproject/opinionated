We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">The district court gave two reasons in support of its dismissal: (1) Hillen had not exhausted state remedies, and (2) Hillen\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which the court could grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">The lower court\u2019s invocation of the exhaustion doctrine was misplaced. The remedy provided by the Civil Rights Acts \u201cis supplementary to the state remedy, and the latter need not be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked.\u201d Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 183, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961). State prisoners, as with other civil rights plaintiffs, are not required to exhaust state procedures before seeking federal relief. Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 30 L.Ed.2d 418 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-18\">The jail authorities transferred Hillen pursuant to the Western Interstate Corrections Compact, 20 Haw.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 355-1. We agree with the district court\u2019s view that such a transfer presents no issue related to federally protected constitutional rights of the prisoner. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
