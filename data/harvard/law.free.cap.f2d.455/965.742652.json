Subsequently, the Army Conscientious Review Board denied Kurtz\u2019s application. The district court denied ha-beas relief to Kurtz, holding that there was a basis in fact for the Board\u2019s decision. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-19\"> The jurisprudence in conscientious objector cases is now too well settled to need elaboration. Our scope of review is the \u201cnarrowest known to law.\u201d Matyastik v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 392 F.2d 657. We do not sit as super draft boards or as a super conscientious objector review board, Kessler v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 406 F.2d 151. \u201cThe question of jurisdiction of the local board is reached only if there is no basis in fact for the classification which it gave the registrant.\u201d Estep v. United States, 1946, 327 U.S. 114, 122-123, 66 S.Ct. 423, 427, 90 L.Ed. 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-20\">Within the narrow confines established for our review we first look to the reasons assigned by the Board for the denial of Kurtz\u2019s application. The Board found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-21\">* * * a change must be shown within the application. Additionally a statement of the time that crystallization of these professed views became fixed within the mind of the individual must be stated within the application. Pvt. Kurtz * * * has stated no change at all. In addition to the omitted elements * * * the interviewing chaplain * * * states * * * \u201cI believe that Pvt. Kurtz\u2019s system of beliefs as they stand now are sincere. However, I do not personally feel that this philosophy was really finalized <em>until after the individual had entered </em>active military service. Even though I feel the individual is sincere in his beliefs, I do not feel that he has sufficient grounds for discharge from military service as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>conscientious objector. I feel he could be of service to the United States Army in a non-combatant capacity.\u201d For the above stated reasons the Board finds that the applicant lacks the depth of conviction required to qualify for a discharge as a conscientious objector. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">We confess that we are unable to comprehend the meaning of what the Board said. As we read Kurtz\u2019s application, it seems perfectly clear that his conscientious objection to participation in war crystallized after he entered the service. The interviewing chaplain, upon whom the Board relied, also found this to be the fact. He added that Kurtz was sincere, but for some unfathomable reason opined that Kurtz did not have sufficient grounds for a discharge. The Board then, \u201cfor the above stated reasons\u201d (the application showed no change of professed views, the chaplain found a finalization of views after Kurtz entered the service, Kurtz was sincere) found that Kurtz \u201clacks the depth of conviction required * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">The Board\u2019s conclusion does not fit the premise upon which it is based. Furthermore, in this ease we can ascribe no other meaning to the phrase \u201clacks the depth of conviction required,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> than that Kurtz lacks sincerity. We find no basis in fact in the record to support a conclusion of insincerity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">Reversed and remanded with directions to grant the Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1030-16\">. AR 635-20 provides <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMr\">Consideration will be given requests for separation based on bona fide conscientious objection to participation in war, in any form, when such objection develops subsequent to entry into the military service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1031-17\">. This phrase was apparently coined in Jennings v. Laird, W.D.Texas 1971, 333 F.Supp. 335, as a parallel to sincerity in a <em>Welsh </em>type case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"axu-dedup-0\">. It is not inappropriate for us to once again emphasize the importance of clear and concise Board conclusions based upon a factual record. In pointing out that the phrase \u201clacks the depth of conviction required\u201d is a nebulous concept, the same trial judge who tried this case in a subsequent case said, \u201cIn the countless petitions to lately come before this Court, it becomes increasingly apparent that the Board is using this statement as a \u2018catchall\u2019 or \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 to deny applications.\u201d Quamina v. Secretary of Defense, W.D.Texas 1971, No. SA 71-CA-155.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
