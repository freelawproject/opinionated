The Pennsylvania Statutes of Limitations provide that actions for slander, libel and malicious prosecution must be brought within one year,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the actions for the remaining alleged tortious acts must be brought within two years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District Court correctly held that the Pennsylvania Statutes of Limitations were applicable here and the instant action was accordingly barred since it was brought almost eight years after the alleged wrongs were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-15\">Our conclusion in this respect makes it unnecessary to consider the other ground assigned by the District Court for its Order, viz., that the alleged wrongs were not committed \u201cunder color of state law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-16\">The Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1037-25\">.
