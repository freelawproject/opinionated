Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(d) (6),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he has moved for an order requiring the docketing of his criminal appeal without prepayment of fees. If this were a direct appeal petitioner would plainly be correct. But this is an appeal in a collateral attack on the judgment. District Judge Wyatt certified that an appeal from his decision would not be taken in good faith, thus preventing petitioner from proceeding in <em>forma pauperis </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). Petitioner\u2019s argument is that appointment of counsel was under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A (the Criminal Justice Act of 1964) and that \u00a7 3006A(d) (6), allowing appeal without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>prepayment of fees, applies to an appeal such as this one and avoids the necessity of any certification under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). It appears coincidental that the date of petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s appointment below, February 11, 1971, was the effective date of \u00a7 3006A(d) (6), as well as \u00a7 3006A(g) which authorizes appointment of counsel in \u00a7 2255 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Even if we assumed that counsel were appointed under the new section, it does not follow that the old certification procedure is now meaningless. A strictly literal reading of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(d) (6) would support petitioner, particularly since it, as well as the entire Act, uses the word \u201cperson\u201d rather than the word \u201cdefendant,\u201d from which it can be argued that individuals collaterally attacking a judgment are covered. But the structure of the Criminal Justice Act and the sparse legislative history lead to a different interpretation of the relationship between 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(d) (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Section 3006A of Title 18 is concerned with the broad topic of \u201c[ajdequate representation of defendants.\u201d Its primary focus is on providing adequate counsel for trials on substantive offenses. <em>See </em>116 Cong.Rec. 34809-16 (1970) (remarks of Representatives Kastenmeier, Poff, <em>et al.). </em>The formal congressional report (by the Senate Judiciary Committee, adopted by the House Judiciary Committee) says that subsection (d) (6) \u201cfacilitates appellate proceedings by allowing a <em>defendant,\u201d </em>etc. (emphasis supplied). 1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News p. 3991. Subsection (g) of \u00a7 3006A deals with discretionary appointments of counsel, allowing counsel and compensation under the Act in various proceedings, including \u00a7 2255 actions, if \u201cthe interests of justice so require.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If counsel in this case were in fact appointed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A, the appointment falls under subsection (g). On its face, \u00a7 3006A(g) supports the Government\u2019s contention that, if the interests of justice do not so require, free counsel (and hence waiver of filing fees) may be denied on a \u00a7 2255 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Section 3006A(c), on the duration of appointments, also supports the Government\u2019s position. Subsection (c) says that \u201c[a] person for whom counsel is appointed shall be represented at every stage of the proceedings from his initial appearance before the United States magistrate or the court through appeal, including ancillary matters appropriate to the proceedings.\u201d This appeal is not such an ancillary matter. Cases interpreting the earlier version of this section concluded that it applied to trial and direct appeals, not to collateral attacks upon a judgment. Dirring v. United States, 353 F.2d 519, 520 (1st Cir. 1965); <em>cf. </em>United States ex rel. Wissenfeld v. Wilkins, 281 F.2d 707, 715 (2d Cir. 1960) (\u201ca very large proportion of applications of this kind submitted to the federal courts are utterly frivolous\u201d). The congressional report on what became \u00a7 3006A(c) indicates what kind of proceedings were considered \u201cancillary\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">Many times remedies technically outside the scope of the trial proper may be necessary, such as using ha-beas corpus ad testificandum . . . or filing an application under 18 U.S. C. 4244 regarding competency to stand trial .... [Ajlthough there is no apparent ruling to the contrary, the express inclusion of \u201cancillary matters appropriate to the proceedings\u201d will insure that the attorney who spends time and effort to protect a right con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>sidered valuable in defending the principal criminal charge can be compensated under the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News, p. 3989.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">If a \u00a7 2255 proceeding were covered under subsection (c), discretion to appoint counsel in collateral attacks on a judgment as set forth in subsection (g) of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A would be meaningless. Indeed, if we were to reach the result desired by petitioner here, such discretion might seldom be exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">One of the \u201cancillary matters\u201d covered under \u00a7 3006A(c) is a proceeding pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 to determine mental competency after arrest and before trial. No such hearing was held in this case. In this court\u2019s decision remanding Judge Wyatt\u2019s first denial of petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claim, this court specifically declined to decide whether a \u00a7 4244 examination should have been ordered. United States v. Miranda, 437 F.2d 1255, 1259 (2d Cir. 1971). Judge Wyatt\u2019s subsequent decision, made long after trial, was more in the nature of an action under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245 (mental incompetency undisclosed at trial), which action expressly falls under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(g), quoted in note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Section 3006A(d) (6) explicitly dispenses with the affidavit requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). Note 1 <em>supra. </em>In doing so, it can be argued that \u00a7 3006A(d) (6) implicitly left standing the certification procedure spelled out in \u00a7 1915(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Congress was obviously aware of \u00a7 1915(a) when it passed \u00a7 3006A(d) (6), and it chose to eliminate only the affidavit requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">We are left, however, with the question whether Judge Wyatt\u2019s failure to issue a good faith certificate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) was an abuse of discretion. Since the motion papers do not furnish us sufficient information to make an intelligent decision on this question, we grant leave to appellant\u2019s assiduous counsel to submit a brief on this point within ten days from the entry of this order, and the Government an additional ten days to submit a reply, both such to run to this panel in the interests of expedition.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">Motion denied in accordance with terms of opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-15\">.
