Such picking and choosing may be entirely proper in the making of a 103, obviousness rejection, where the applicant must be afforded an opportunity to rebut with objective evidence any inference of obviousness which may arise from the <em>similarity </em>of the subject mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>ter which he claims to the prior art, but it has no place in the making of a 102, anticipation rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">In this case we have no difficulty in deciding that the portions of the Flynn reference relied upon by the Patent Office do not identically describe the claimed subject matter. As appellants point out, the compounds of Flynn\u2019s examples 4 and 10 are the \u201cexact precursors\u201d of appellants\u2019 compound \u201conly to the extent that appellants have discovered that cephaloridine will be formed <em>if </em>the acid [disclosed in example 10] is first selected and <em>then </em>carefully reacted with a particular tertiary amine <em>which also must be selected.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) Of course, it does appear that the \u201cparticular tertiary amine\u201d to which appellants refer is pyridine, which is mentioned elsewhere in Flynn as an example of the class of reactants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with which a particular cephalosporin C-type compound (namely, cephalosporin C itself) may be converted into compounds of the cephalosporin Ca type, but there is nothing in the teachings relied upon by the Patent Office which \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d directs those skilled in the art to make this selection nor any indication that Flynn ever made the selection himself. Similarly, while it is reasonable to suppose that Flynn\u2019s teaching that \u201cin general, those compounds which possess the cephalosporin Ca nucleus are more effective antibacterially than those containing the cephalo-sporin C nucleus\u201d would provide some \u201cmotive\u201d for those that followed him to concentrate their investigations on compounds possessing the cephalosporin Ca nucleus, that motivation is a very general one, pointing to no particular one of the myriads of compounds, actual and potential, containing the cephalosporin Ca nucleus.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The board, apparently recognizing the weakness of its position in attempting to arrive at an anticipation by combining the disclosures in examples 4 and 10 with the above-quoted teaching elsewhere in the patent of how to convert a particular, different cephalosporin C-type compound into cephalosporin Ca type compounds, postulates certain teachings which might have been in the reference patent any one of which, according to it, if present would have removed all doubt concerning the completeness of the anticipation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The simple answer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>board\u2019s argument is that these teachings were not contained in the Flynn patent and that we do not regard the teachings which were there and which <em>were </em>relied upon below as the equivalent of those which were postulated by the board. We do not read into references things that are not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Although the board declined to discuss four relatively recent decisions by this court in cases involving description requirements in various sections of the patent statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on the ground that \u201cthe issue [of anticipation] is essentially a factual one,\u201d it did consider the older ease of In re Armstrong, 280 F.2d 132, 47 CCPA 1084 (1960), to be \u201capposite on this point.\u201d There this court reversed the board, finding support for process claims reciting the use of sodium carbonate although the example in the specification advanced as support for the claims used sodium hydroxide. However, in the first place, the <em>Armstrong </em>case was decided well before the line of eases beginning with <em>Ruschig </em>II, supra,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which have significantly tightened up on the application of the description requirement in the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, and, in the second place, the opinion in <em>Armstrong </em>points out that appellants\u2019 specification stated that alkali hydroxides and alkali carbonates could be used \u201cinterchangeably\u201d in their process. The opinion stresses this equivalency, which involved a tiny number of variables in comparison to the situation here. There are no equivalent \u201cblaze marks,\u201d to quote the language of <em>Ruschig </em>II, in the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Accordingly, we will not sustain the rejection on the ground on which it was made. Concerning the rejection as it is reformulated by the dissent, we express no opinion. It may be that the Patent Office <em>should </em>have relied upon the portions of Flynn on which the dissent relies, or it may be that they had very good reasons for not doing so. In any event, they did <em>not </em>rely on those teachings in Flynn, and appellants have therefore had no opportunity to comment thereon. We do not conceive that it is part of our duty to make better rejections for the Patent Office, even if we could be sure that we really were making a \u201cbetter rejection,\u201d nor do we think that it would be consistent with the requirements of due process for us to do so for the first time on appeal, without notice to the affected party.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">Furthermore, we point out that we are not granting appellants a patent, if that is what the dissent means by \u201cbestowing on the applicants a license to litigate.\u201d We are simply reversing a rejection on the ground that the claim on appeal is <em>anticipated </em>under \u00a7 102 by Flynn. It may well be that it is unpatentable because <em>obvious </em>under \u00a7 103 in view of Flynn, but no such rejection is before us. The Patent Office is free to make such a rejection after our decision in this case should it think it appropriate. In re Ruschig, 379 F.2d 990, 54 CCPA 1551 (1967); and In re Fisher, 448 F.2d 1406, 58 CCPA - (1971). In any event, it is the Patent Office which grants patents, not this court. It may further be observed that it is not now the practice in this court, if it ever was, to apply a different standard in cases which are in \u201ccomplex areas of tech<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>nology\u201d than we do in easily understood cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-17\">. At one time appellants contended that Flynn was not an \u201cenabling disclosure,\u201d In re LeGrice, 301 F.2d 929, 49 OCPA 1124 (1962), but we gather that they have abandoned that contention on appeal, although there is still an ambiguous reference to <em>LeGrice </em>in their briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b652-5\">. The parties argue, in essence, about whether the words \u201cfor example\u201d in the sentence \u201cCephalosporin C is also readily converted into compounds of the cephalosporin Ca type by refluxing in aqueous solution with an excess of pyridine, for example, as described in Belgian Patent 593,777\u201d refers to the word \u201cpyridine\u201d or the words \u201cas described.\u201d Appellants argue that \u201cit is to be stressed that pyridine is only being suggested as an <em>example </em>of the tertiary amine [s] suitable for the reaction with the prior art compound cephalosporin C,\u201d while the solicitor seems to be taking the position that Flynn\u2019s specification would be read as indicating that the Belgian patent was one place among many where those skilled in the art could learn how to react cephalosporin C with pyridine. While the matter is not free from doubt, we think it more likely that the sentence would be read in the former way because the presence of the word \u201ctype\u201d after \u201cCa\u201d and not after \u201cC\u201d suggests that one particular C-type compound (namely, cephalosporin C itself) can be changed into <em>various </em>CA-type comounds by refluxing it with an excess of the proper reactant. This interpretation of the controverted sentence is reinforced by the next sentence in Flynn\u2019s specification, which is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"adx-dedup-1\">The reaction is applicable in general to the tertiary amines, of which numerous examples are given above, yielding corresponding derivatives of the cephalo-sporin Ca type wherein the tertiary amine is attached to the methyl group in the 3 position of the thiazine ring, and forms an inner salt with the car-boxyl group in the 4 position.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b652-11\">.

I find it unreasonable to assume that Judge Rich and Judge Lane intend to overrule this long line of cases <em>sub silen-tio. </em>If what they intend is merely to rephrase the accepted test so as to simplify its application, they have missed the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">The language used in the principal opinion would not in fact simplify the determination of the suitability of a reference as an anticipation under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102. That language requires the tribunal to analyze the teachings of a reference to determine which are equivocal and which are unequivocal. It must also be determined which disclosures are directly related to each other by the teachings of the reference, thus making picking and choosing proper, and which disclosures are only indirectly related, or are not related at all. This is no simpler than reading the reference as a whole and determining what it fairly teaches to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">The more important difficulty with the position taken in the principal opinion is that it misdirects the inquiry. It directs the tribunal to analyze the structure of the reference rather than its content. The real question is not how logically the various disclosures in a reference are related to each other, it is rather <em>what the reference fairly teaches to one of ordinary skill in the art, </em>no matter how ineptly it does so. Of course, the more logically the reference is laid out the clearer will be its teachings and the easier will be the job of those who must interpret it. But the law requires us to determine whether the invention has been <em>identically </em>described, <em>not </em>whether it has been <em>logically </em>described by the reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">The Flynn reference has been described in both the principal opinion and the dissent. I will therefore merely state what I would consider that reference fairly teaches to one of ordinary skill in the art. Flynn does disclose the cephalosporin C-type precursor of the instantly claimed Ca-type compound. The precursor is one of approximately 38 C-type compounds specifically disclosed. Flynn teaches how C-type compounds can be converted to Cq-type compounds by heating with water under acid conditions, or converted to CA-type compounds by refluxing in an aqueous solution with an excess of a tertiary amine. Pyridine is specifically referred to as an example of a tertiary amine which will work, but a list of over 15 other tertiary amines is given. With regard to antibacterial effect, Flynn discloses that Cc-type com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>pounds are not as good as C-type compounds, and C-type compounds are not as good as CA-type compounds. As pointed out by the dissent, Flynn considered the Cc-type and CA-type analogues of the specifically disclosed C-type compounds to be some of the compounds \u201cavailable in accordance with the present invention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">I would not place as much weight as the dissent does on Flynn\u2019s statement that the Cc-type and CA-type analogues were considered within the scope of the invention. Such statements in the specification regarding the breadth of the invention are generally too speculative to be given great weight. In the instant case, all that statement does is focus some additional attention on Cc-type compounds and CA-type compounds. In my view, that attention is not a significant addition to the disclosure, since Flynn\u2019s remarks regarding the antibacterial activity of the compounds are sufficient to emphasize the CA-type compounds as the most desirable. The difficulty is that Flynn gives 38 or so possible precursors and 15 or so tertiary amines which will react with those precursors to form CA-type compounds. The Flynn disclosure, considered as a whole, does not sufficiently direct one skilled in the art to the claimed compound.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">I disagree with the principal opinion on one last point. The opinion seems to suggest that we violate due process whenever we consider portions of a reference not specifically mentioned by the examiner or the board. I know of no requirement that the examiner and the board must list the sentences in the reference upon which they rely, nor can I see any sense in imposing such a requirement. All of the disclosure of a reference must be considered for what it fairly teaches one of ordinary skill in the art. In re Meinhardt, 392 F.2d 273, 276, 55 CCPA 1000, 1004 (1968). As Judge Smith aptly stated in <em>Meinhardt:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">[T]he board relied on the same [reference] as the examiner to sustain the rejection. Assuming arguendo that the board relied on a portion of the [reference] ignored by the examiner, this could not constitute a new ground of rejection in view of In re Azorlosa, 241 F.2d 939, 44 CCPA 826 (1957), which holds, in pertinent part, that it is proper for the court and necessarily, the board, to consider everything that a reference discloses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">In re Meinhardt, <em>supra, </em>392 F.2d at 280, 55 CCPA at 1008-1009.

In re Baranauckas, 228 F.2d 413, 43 CCPA 727 (1955). Reference to the Flynn disclosure will establish, I submit, that such a description exists in the present instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">The principal opinion has set forth portions of the generic and more specific disclosure of Flynn relied on by the board. The class of cephalosporin compounds disclosed generically by Flynn may be divided into several groups, of which the groups designated as cephalosporin C type and cephalo-sporin Ca type (cephaloridine is a Ca type) are of particular interest here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After observing that \u201cin general, those compounds which possess the cephalo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>sporin Ca nucleus are more effective antibaeterially than those containing the cephalosporin C nucleus,\u201d Flynn goes on to name and describe several specific compounds having the cephalosporin C nucleus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">The <em>following examples, </em>together with the [15] <em>operating examples </em>appearing hereinafter, will illustrate the types of compounds available <em>in accordance with the present invention:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">* * -* * * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">[There follows a list of 24 specific 7-acylamidoeephalosporanic acids, i. e., cephalosporin G type compounds. As noted by the board, two of the 15 operating examples referred to, examples 4 and 10, describe the potassium and sodium salts of 7-(2/thienylacetamido) cephalosporanic acid (the sodium salt is known commercially as \u201ccephalothin\u201d). Appellant reacts that particular cephalosporanic acid with the tertiary amine pyridine to obtain the claimed cephalosporin Ca type compound, cephaloridine.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARm\">and the like, <em>including </em>the <em>cephalo-sporin Ca </em>and cephalosporin Cc <em>analogues thereof. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">There can be no doubt from the above disclosure that Flynn regarded the cephalosporin Ca analogues of each of the mentioned cephalosporin C type compounds to form an integral part of his disclosed invention. In particular, it is evident that Flynn does explicitly disclose the cephalosporin Ca analogues of Examples 4 and 10. As to how to obtain those Ca analogues from cephalosporin C type compounds, he states that compounds of the cephalosporin Ca class \u201ccan be obtained by applying to appropriate 7-acylamidocephalosporanic acids the conversion procedures of Belgian Patent 593,777.\u201d Flynn had earlier stated, as pointed out by the board and majority here, just what those \u201cconversion procedures\u201d are, viz. that \u201cCephalosporin C is also readily converted into compounds of the cephalosporin Ca type by refluxing in aqueous solution with an excess of <em>pyridine, </em>for example, as described in Belgian Patent 593,777.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">I think it is clear that Flynn directs one of ordinary skill in the art, who is interested in particular cephalosporin Ca analogues of the 37 or so cephalo-sporin C type compounds Flynn specifically discloses, to prepare them by reacting the appropriate 7-acylamido cephalosporanic acid with the particular tertiaryamine pyridine. Following those instructions, one of ordinary skill in this art would easily prepare the Ca (pyridine) analogue of the particular cephalo-sporin C type compound described in Examples 4 and 10, which analogue is cephaloridine. Each and every one of the Ca (pyridine) analogues of that relatively small number of cephalosporin C compounds has been effectively, or implicitly, described by Flynn. To be sure, appellant is claiming only one of them, but it is no less described than any of the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">From what has been said of Flynn, it should be evident that there is no need in this case for those skilled in the art to resort to picking and choosing various disclosures unrelated to each other by the reference teachings, as \u2022 the principal opinion implies. On the contrary, the disclosures of cephalosporin C compounds, cephalosporin Ca compounds, and how to make them are all interrelated by Flynn himself. It should also be evident that the reference itself contains the full equivalent of the board\u2019s \u201cpostulations\u201d, which are quoted in footnote 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>and later deprecated in the principal opinion. Finally, it should be evident that the rejection rationale as stated herein is substantially identical to \u2014 not a reformulation of \u2014 that expressed by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The principal opinion also criticizes the board for reading into references \u201cthings that are not there.\u201d My difficulty with that position stems from its disregard for the \u201cthings\u201d \u2014 or \u201cblaze marks\u201d\u2014 that <em>are </em>there. In my opinion, the majority is groping for reversible error where none exists. As far back as 40 years, and over the years since, it has been a firm principle that this court would not reverse decisions of the tribunals below in highly complex areas of technology unless manifest error was shown. See, e. g., In re Wietzel, 17 CCPA 1079, 39 F.2d 669, 5 USPQ 177 (1930); In re Bertsch, 132 F.2d 1014, 30 CCPA 813 (1942); In re Stoll, 161 F.2d 241, 34 CCPA 1058 (1947). Needless to say, such error has not been shown here.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Although the majority would undoubtedly disclaim the notion, I cannot help but feel that it is resolving doubt on the issue presented in favor of the applicants. In doing so, this court is not doing the applicants or the public any favor. Rather it is bestowing on the applicants a license to litigate of dubious validity at a time when, it is reliably estimated, 80'.% of contested patents are being held invalid in other federal courts. And the other sad result here is to take from the public that which is already theirs by imposing on them a monopoly that should not exist. Appellants have given the public nothing it had not already been given by Flynn. I would remind my colleagues that patents are not like party favors to be passed out at random. The enabling statutes established under the Constitution clearly require more than appellants have offered as a <em>quid pro quo </em>to the public in exchange for the monopoly the majority awards them.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">I find no error in the board\u2019s decision, and would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\">.
