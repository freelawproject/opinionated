From an order sustaining a motion by Randall Company to dismiss the action, Hayles has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-18\">The owners and drivers of the four trucks involved in the accident were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-19\">Truck No. 1, a tow truck owned by Randall Company and driven and operated by its employee, Cecil R. Williams;</p>\n<p id=\"b234-20\">Truck No. 2, a truck loaded with hay, owned by Pete Sanders and driven by his employee, Hayles;</p>\n<p id=\"b234-21\">Truck No. 3, a grain truck owned by B. P.

A highway patrolman came to the scene of the accident and telephoned for a tow truck. In response to such call, Randall Company sent its tow truck to the scene. The Sanders truck was attached to the tow truck. Hayles stationed himself in the cab of the Sanders truck to steer it while it was being towed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The Randall Company tow truck and the Sanders truck, under tow, both entered the highway. Shortly thereafter, the front end of Truck No. 3, owned by Lytal and driven by John E.

It sought to recover such stated amounts from Sanders, Randall Company, and Lytal.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">A cross-complaint was filed by Lytal on December 30, 1969, captioned as follows:</p>\n<p

Sanders in cases No. 69-410 and No. 69-498 on March 13,1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-28\">In his cross-complaint against Sanders, Bond Company, and Randall Company, Lytal sought to recover damages to his trailer and to his White tractor, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>other damages incidental thereto, which he alleged with requisite particularity. He further alleged that such damages resulted from a collision between the tractor and the Sanders truck and a collision between the front end of the Bond Company truck and the rear end of his trailer; that such collision occurred on November 12, 1968, and that such damages were caused by the negligence of Sanders, Randall Company, and Bond Company, acting by and through their agents, the drivers of their respective trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In his cross-complaint against Miller, Bond Company, and Randall Company, Sanders sought to recover damages for the loss of his load of hay, the cost of repairing his damaged truck, and the loss of use of his truck during the period it took to make the repairs, all of which he alleged occurred as the result of the accident and were caused by the combining and concurring negligence of Miller, John E. Williams, and Cecil R. Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The only other facts in addition to those above stated, with respect to case No. 69-498, that are disclosed by the record, are these: The judgment bears the same caption as the cross-complaint of Lytal and Sanders, except there is added thereto \u201cLiberty Mutual Insurance Company, Intervening Plaintiff,\u201d and such judgment recites that on April 2, 1970, the \u201cplaintiffs and intervening plaintiff being present in person and by their attorneys\u201d and the named defendants being present and by their respective attorneys, and \u201call parties having presented all their evidence, and having rested, the cause was submitted to the jury,\u201d and the jury \u201creturned the following verdicts\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">\u201c \u2018We, the jury, find for both plaintiffs and against Pete Sanders and Randall Motor Company, Inc., and fix the amount of recovery of James L. Miller at $15,000.00 and the amount of recovery of Bond Baking Company, at $8,347.64.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">\u201c \u2018We, the jury, find for the defendant, B. P. Lytal, and against Pete Sanders and Randall Motor Company, Inc., and fix the amount of recovery at $19,192.95.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">\u201c \u2018We, the jury, find against the plaintiffs, James L. Miller and Bond Baking Company, and in favor of the defendant, B. P. Lytal, on the complaints of plaintiffs, and in favor of the plaintiffs, James L. Miller and Bond Baking Company, and against the defendant, B. P. Lytal, on his cross complaint, so that neither of these parties may recover as against the other herein.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">On such verdicts, the court entered judgment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">\u201c * * * that plaintiff, James L.

Ly-tal that he take nothing as against them on his cross complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-20\">Randall Company attached to its motion to dismiss, and by reference made them part of such motion, certified copies of the complaint in Miller\u2019s action against Sanders, Randall Company, and Lytal; the complaint of intervention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>filed in Miller\u2019s action by Liberty Mutual;' the cross-complaints filed in such action by Sanders and Lytal, and also the journal entry of judgment in the consolidated cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The motion to dismiss filed by Randall Company was based on the following premises:</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">(1) That in the Miller action it was adjudged that at the time of the accident Hayles was the driver of the Sanders Truck, acting as the employee and servant of Sanders, and that as such servant Hayles was guilty of negligence, which concurred with the negligence of Cecil Williams, as the driver of the Randall Company truck, and caused the injuries to Miller;</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">(2) That Sanders was liable for the negligence of Hayles, solely under the doctrine of respondeat superior; and</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">(3) That Hayles was concluded by the adjudication in the Miller action that he was guilty of concurring negligence, which contributed to the injuries suffered by Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Hayles contends he was not so bound, because he did not have notice of the Miller action and had no opportunity to appear in that action and litigate the issue of his alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">At the time of the accident and of the filing, trial, and disposition of the Miller action, Hayles was a resident of Paris, Texas. The accident occurred in Oklahoma and the Miller action was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, and it was tried and judgment entered in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">There is nothing in the record on the appeal in the instant case that shows that Hayles had any notice or knowledge of the Miller action prior to the time the judgment therein became final. There is a statement in his brief that Randall Company took his deposition in the Miller case, but the brief further states that Hayles had no notice of the Miller suit; that he was not furnished with a copy of the complaint; and that when his deposition was taken, the pendency of the Miller action was not explained to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Estoppel by adjudication is an affirmative defense, which the party asserting it must plead and prove,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> unless it appears affirmatively from the pleadings of the party against whom it is asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">It should be kept in mind that we are here concerned with the doctrine of es-toppel by adjudication, or collateral es-toppel, in master and servant cases, where the master is liable for the negligence of his servant committed in the course of his employment, solely under the doctrine of respondeat superior, and the servant is primarily liable to the person injured by such negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">It is elemental in our system of jurisprudence that a person is entitled to his day in court once, either to assert his claim or defend an alleged wrongful commission or omission by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-16\">When, in a pending action brought to recover for the negligence of a servant while acting within the scope of his employment for which the servant is liable and his master is also liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior, a plea of estoppel by adjudication is interposed against a party to the pending action, based on an adjudication in a prior action to recover for such negligence brought against either the master or servant, the courts, in deciding whether such plea is well taken, regard one important factor to be considered is whether the party in the pending action against whom the plea is interposed had his day in court in the prior action.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-17\">Since this is a diversity action, the question of whether Hayles was bound by the adjudication in the Miller action that he was guilty of concurring negligence is to be determined by the law of Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-18\">No decision by an Oklahoma court has been cited in the briefs, nor have we found any that is directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>We must, of course, give much weight to the decision of the learned trial judge and the fact that he was formerly a highly regarded practicing lawyer in Oklahoma. However, language of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in its opinion in the case of Massoth v. Staples, 481 P.2d 141, leads us to conclude that the Supreme Court would hold the trial court erred in sustaining Randall Company\u2019s motion to dismiss Hayles\u2019s action. Such a holding would be in accord with the great weight of authority in other jurisdictions, the courts of which have passed on the. question. See cases cited in note 6, infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In the Massoth-Staples case, Staples filed an action against Massoth and her employer, Mercy Hospital, hereinafter referred to as the Hospital. Staples alleged that she suffered injuries growing out of an accident involving two automobiles, one driven by her and one by Mas-soth, and that Massoth, while acting as the servant of the Hospital, was negligent in the operation of the automobile she was driving and such negligence caused the injuries for which Staples sought recovery. Staples alleged no independent acts of negligence by the Hospital, and her sole basis for recovery against it was that it was liable for Massoth\u2019s negligence, under the doctrine of respondeat superior. On the eve of trial, Staples dismissed her action against Massoth. The action was tried against the Hospital and resulted in a verdict and judgment against it and in favor of Staples. Thereafter, Staples brought the action against Massoth.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In its opinion in Massoth v. Staples, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">\u201cWe are impressed with the opinion in the case of Marange v. Marshall (Tex.Civ.App.), 402 S.W.2d 236. The facts in the cited case are very similar to the facts in the present case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-14\">\u201cIn Marange v. Marshall, supra, the court applied the doctrine of res ad ju-dicata and held that the prior action barred the subsequent action. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqe-dedup-0\">\u201cWe are of the opinion and hold that the reasoning in Marange v. Marshall, supra, should be followed in this jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">Then follows the very significant language of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, reading: \u201cTo hold otherwise would in effect permit the respondent (Staples) <em>to have two days in court </em>and would invite a multiplicity of suits.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-17\">In the Massoth-Staples case, Staples had her day in court in the prior action. Here, the reverse is true. Hayles had not had his day in court in the prior action. Indeed, the record does not disclose that he had knowledge of the pen-dency of such prior action.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-18\">Hayles not only was not a party in the prior action, but he was not in privity with Sanders and was not represented therein by Sanders. He was not in privity in the sense that his rights were derived from Sanders. His cause of action was his own. The relation of employer and employee does not confer on the employer any power to represent the employee in litigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-19\">Hayles has never had his day in court. He has never had an opportunity to defend the allegation that he was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-20\">.We conclude that Hayles was entitled to litigate in the instant case the issue of his contributory negligence, asserted against him. Our conclusion, we think, is supported by able opinions in the cases cited in note 6 hereto.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>The order entered September 23, 1970, sustaining the motion of Randall to dismiss the action is hereby vacated and the cause is remanded to the District Court, with instructions to grant leave to Randall to file an amended complaint, alleging the facts upon which it claims that Hayles is barred by the doctrine of estoppel by adjudication or judgment from denying that he was guilty of negligence, which concurred with the negligence of other persons, and together caused the accident which resulted in injuries to Hayles for which he seeks to recover damages in the instant case;</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">And with the further instruction that in the event an amended complaint is so filed, it decide the issues raised thereby and by the answer thereto, applying the principles with respect to estoppel by adjudication or judgment laid down, supra, in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-13\">.
