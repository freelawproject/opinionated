Sales of goods identified by the mark have likewise been on a large scale. Although appellee took no testimony, it introduced into evidence a number of third-party registrations for the purpose of showing the popularity of the use of the term \u201cparty\u201d in trademarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Appellant contends that PARTY PRIDE and PARTY PARADE are substantially similar in appearance, sound and meaning, that the goods which they identify are virtually identical, and that the class of purchasers of these goods is not a discriminating one. These circumstances, it is urged, compel the conclusion that mistake or confusion is likely. Appellee, on the other hand, argues that the only similarity resides in the first word, \u201cparty,\u201d which is asserted to be a highly suggestive term for such products as ice cream and ice cream novelties and should not be accorded controlling weight in the determination of the likelihood of confusion resulting from the use of the marks considered in their en-tireties. Beyond \u201cparty,\u201d there is no resemblance, contends appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">The board found no likelihood of confusion, and in its unpublished opinion, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-18\">* * * \u201cPARTY\u201d is a suggestive and highly appropriate word for food products of the character here involved, all of which are frequently served together at birthday parties, bridge parties, and other social functions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-19\">Giving due consideration to the nature of the word \u201cPARTY\u201d, and to the differences between the words \u201cPRIDE\u201d and \u201cPARADE\u201d in all material respects, it is our opinion that applicant\u2019s use of \u201cPARTY PARADE\u201d is not at all likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-20\">We agree with the reasoning of the board and have little to add. Considering the marks in their entireties, we also find that there is not such a resemblance as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive. We accordingly <em>affirm </em>the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"ASv\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-16\">.
