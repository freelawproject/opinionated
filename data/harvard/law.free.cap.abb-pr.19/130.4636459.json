The plaintiffs, claiming that this did not stay their proceedings, noticed a motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint, and the defendant thereupon moved the court at special term for a stay pending the appeal. The plaintiff opposed this motion, and insisted that if the court should grant a stay, it should do so only on the condition of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>fendant giving a bond to secure the amount claimed in the complaint, citing the case of McMahon <em>a. </em>Allen in 13 Abbotts5 Pr., 126. The judge reserved his decision, and a few days afterwards denied the motion in the following terms: \u201c Motion denied; if the defendants want a stay, they should give the security required by the Code.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-5\">The defendant thereupon entered up an order denying their motion, and embodying this memorandum of the judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-6\">The plaintiff moved to resettle the order by striking out the words \u201cif the defendants want a stay, they should give the security required by the Code.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-7\"><em>Henry A. </em>Cram, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A__\">insisted that the case was wholly unprovided for in the Code, and relied on McMahon <em>a </em>Allen (13 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>126) as disposing of the whole case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-8\"><em>I.

I was of opinion, and am still, that the Code makes ample provision for the staying of proceedings in cases of this character. The Code having made such provision, a party desiring a stay must comply therewith. The court will not make an order staying proceedings on any different terms than those required by the Code, nor will it make an order directing proceedings to be stayed upon the giving of the security required by the Code. The giving of that security stays proceedings by force of the statute, without any interference of, or order from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The question whether a party has complied with the provisions of the Code, can only arise upon a motion to set aside the proceedings of the opposite party taken subsequent to the giving of the security.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
