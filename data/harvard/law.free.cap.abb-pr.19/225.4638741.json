Carpenter, set up the following facts: that he was the administrator of Lloyd Glover, who had during his lifetime formed with the defendant, George H. Danforth and others, the \u201cNational Bank Note Company that the plaintiff\u2019s decedent and Glover had both been active trustees in the management of the company; that the company had declared no dividends, applying all its profits to the enlargement of its business and accumulation of materials ; that at the time of Glover\u2019s death he owned 136 shares of the stock, of the par value of \u00a750 per share, subject, however, to liens to very nearly the amount of its par value; that after Glover\u2019s death there being no market quotations of the stock, and the plaintiff being utterly ignorant of the affairs of the company, he was induced, by the representations of the defendant Danforth of his friendliness to Mr. Glover\u2019s children, and by his concealment of the state of the company, to sell the stock to him at $60 per share; that at the time of the sale the assets and condition of the'company, as known to the defendant Carpenter, rendered the stock of much higher value; and that within five months after, it declared a dividend of 310 per cent., and again within thirteen months of 200 per cent.; that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>defendant had used pressure to procure the sale to be made immediately, and had had the stock conveyed to the other defendant, James A. Williamson, but for his, Danforth\u2019s, use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">The complaint asked for restitution of the stock, and an accounting for the dividends received upon it by the defendants, and an injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\">An injunction was accordingly granted, restraining the defendants from transferring, or disposing, or using the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-7\">The defendant Danforth answered, admitting the purchase, and that he was one of the trustees of the company, but denying any special knowledge of the pecuniary affairs of the company beyond that of any stockholder; denying all pretences of friendly feelings towards Mr. Glover\u2019s children; and setting up that the condition of the company at the time of the purchase was such, owing to the worthless nature of a large portion of their assets, and the contingent nature of another part, that $60 per share was a good price, and larger than others were willing to pay, and added letters to show'that the whole transaction was free from fraud or overreaching on his part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-8\">On the answer and on affidavits, the defendants moved that the injunction be dissolved.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-9\"><em>Evarts, Southmayd &amp; Choate, </em>for the motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-10\"><em>E.

To bring the case within the principle governing purchases by a trustee from his <em>cestui que trust, </em>it is not necessary that the trustee' should have the legal title as technical trustee of the other; any analogous relation of a fiduciary character is within the rule.

The relation between the defendant Danforth and. the plaintiff, administrator of the deceased stockholder, was one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>confidence. In respect to the subject-matter of the sale, the former was the <em>quasi trustee </em>or agent, and the latter the <em>cestui \u2022que trust </em>or principal (Scott <em>a. </em>De Peyster, 1 <em>Ed. </em>Ch., 513; Verplanck <em>a. </em>Mercantile Ins. Co., <em>Ib., </em>84; Robinson <em>a. </em>Smith, 3 <em>Paige, </em>230; Cunningham <em>a. </em>Pell, 5 <em>Ib., </em>607; 3 <em>How. U. </em>S, 133); and though a person in that relation may not be absolutely prohibited from becoming the purchaser from the other, he cannot profit by his superior knowledge and buy at an inadequate price, nor without disclosing every fact which is material to the sale or affects its expediency.
