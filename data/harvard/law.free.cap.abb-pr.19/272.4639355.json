Upon the facts stated in the complaint, the plaintiff does not show himself entitled to recover. He does not aver: either, 1. That he has suffered any damage, or is likely or liable to suffer any; 2. That he is the holder of the bail-bond, or entitled to sue on it; 3. That it (the bail-bond) was ever delivered to any one or made to any one, or in fact ever made at all; 4. That he comes within any of the cases provided by the Code; 5. That the action in which G-alliardet was arrested was ever prosecuted to judgment, or execution over-issued on said judgment. 6. There is no allegation that the plaintiff is the owner of the bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-5\">These' facts being material, the complaint is insufficient, (Rodi <em>a. </em>Rutgers Fire Ins. Co., 6 <em>Bosw., </em>23.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-6\">II. It being made the duty of the officer to return the process, together with the undertaking of the bail, to the-plaintiff\u2019s attorney (see <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 192; 3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>5th ed., 739), it is to be presumed that he performed that duty. If he did, upon the allegations of the complaint he has no standing in court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-7\">III. There is nothing in .the complaint bringing this case within any of the provisions of sections 193, 201, or 203.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-8\">IV. A sheriff is not entitled to look to the bail, except when they fail to justify; and in that case, he can only recover the- \u201c damages which he may sustain by reason of such omission.\u201d (See Loosey <em>a. </em>Orser, 4 <em>Bosw., </em>391.) And there is no allegation on either point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-9\">V. There is no analogy between the cases brought under the Code, and those prosecuted under the old practice, as far as the capacity to sue is concerned. Formerly, the bond was made directly to the sheriff. It was necessary that plaintiff should allege this fact with great particularity, as upon this depended his ability to sue. (See 2 <em>Chitty on Pleading, </em>449.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-10\">Under the present practice, however, the undertaking belongs to the plaintiff in the action wherein the order of arrest was granted. <em>There being </em>no allegation to the contrary, it is fair to presume that the bail-bond is now in Cranston\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-11\">VI. The complaint describes the instrument upon which the plaintiff seeks to recover against the defendants as a \u201c certain writing obligatory, commonly called an undertaking on arrest,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>signed and sealed by the said defendants,\u201d &amp;c.; but it does not state that it was made to any one, which is essential in a bond. (See <em>Burrill's Law Dict., </em>tit. Bond.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-5\">There being no obligee mentioned in the instrument, the plaintiff should show some-particular state of facts, or some special provision of law, as a foundation for his right to recover.' This he has not\" done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-6\">VII. The sheriff had not a right to retain the undertaking. It belongs absolutely to the plaintiff, who, therefore, has a right to sue upon it. (\u00a7 192.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-7\">VIII. The bail-bond or undertaking is a bond of indemnity, and something should be alleged to show that the sheriff has \u2022suffered some loss, or has incurred some liability, for which he is entitled to be compensated. He simply says, that he is sued for an escape, and claims that he is <em>ipso facto </em>entitled to the face of the bond and interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-8\">If the plaintiff\u2019s theory is right, he could recover the full amount and interest, whereas he might defeat the claim of \u25a0Cranston by proving the insolvency of G-alliardet.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-9\">IX. It is difficult to avoid the inference, after a careful perusal of the complaint, that Willet and Cranston have confederated against the defendants, and that any contest between them over the absent body of Galliardet is postponed, in the hope that these defendants may be offered up as scape-goats. The defendants, on the other hand, claim that, as sureties, they are bound only according to the strict letter or precise terms of their contract, and are considered as favorites of the-law (Wright <em>a. </em>Johnson, 8 <em>Wend., </em>512, and cases cited); that they should not be driven to trial without knowing precisely on what grounds they are to be charged.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-10\"><em>J. R. Whiting, </em>for plaintiff, respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-11\">I. The complainant sets forth all the facts necessary to con stitute a perfect cause of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-12\">H. The execution of the undertaking fixes the character ofthe parties as bail to the sheriff. The statute enabling the sheriff to give notice to. the plaintiff, and providing for exception and justification, is for the ease and favor of the sheriff alone; the bail have nothing to do with it. If the sheriff gives the notice, and \"the bail do not justify, the sheriff be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>comes the hail. If he omits to give the notice, which he may do designedly or from neglect, he becomes liable as bail. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 201, 203; Van Duyne <em>a. </em>Coope, 1 <em>Hill, </em>557 ; <em>In re </em>Taylor, 7 <em>How. </em>Pr., 214; Buckman <em>a. </em>Carnley, 9 <em>Ib., </em>180; Sartos <em>a. </em>Marceques, <em>Ib., </em>188.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-5\">JII. The sheriff, <em>on </em>an escape, may immediately take his remedy for a breach of the condition of the bond. (See Hinds <em>a. </em>Doubleday, 21 <em>Wend., </em>223.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b292-6\">By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014Robertson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aag\">This is an action on an undertaking given by the defendants to the plaintiff, on his arrest of the defendant G\u00e1lliardet, under an order in an action by a third person (Mr. Cranston) against such defendant. The undertaking is in the usual form, promising that such defendant should at all times render himself amenable to the process of the court during the pendency of the action, and to such process as should be issued to enforce the judgment therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The complaint shows that .such third person (Cranston) obtained judgment against the defendant Galliardet; issued an execution against his property, which was returned unsatisfied ; and also, afterwards, an execution against his body,, which was returned by the officer to whom it was directed, not found. These facts, in an action against the present plaintiff, by the plaintiff in such action, would be enough to-charge the former with liability for an escape of the defend- ' ant therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The following are the only questions on the merits arising 1 in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\"><em>First. </em>Was the undertaking sued upon ever an obligation to the plaintiff, and could he ever have maintained an action upon it; and if so, did it ever cease to be so, and by what means ?</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\"><em>Second. </em>Is there any presumption of law in favor of the defendants, that the sheriff ever relieved himself of all responsibility for the production of the defendant\u2019s body, in the original action, upon final process, by the delivery of the order of arrest, his return thereto, and a copy of the under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>taking in suit, to the attorney for the plaintiff in such action ?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"><em>Third. </em>As incidental to the second question, does the liability of the defendant, vary, by the undertaking being to the plaintiff in this action instead of the plaintiff in the original action ?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The plaintiff, on the arrest of the former defendant, was liable as if he were bail, in case of an escape, rescue, or failure of the bail to justify, or of a deposit in their place <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 201); and he may put in bail to surrender the defendant. (Code, \u00a7\u00a7 201, 193-196 inclusive.) He is only</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">exonerated by the delivery of the order of arrest, return, and certified copy of the undertaking, to the attorney for the plaintiff in the original action, and the omission by such attorney to refuse such bail, for ten days, or by the justification of the same, or new bail. (\u00a7\u00a7 192, 193.) During all this time until justification, the bail are liable to the sheriff. (\u00a7 203.) By the justification he is relieved, and the bail become liable to the plaintiff in the action. There is no allegation, in the complaint, of the delivery of such documents, or non-refusal to accept the bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">In the next place, the delivery of the order of arrest and other documents to 'the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, authorized by the 192d section of the Code, is not a duty of the sheriff to any of the parties in the action; it is a privilege by which he relieves himself from responsibility, and until he does it, the bail are bound to him, but are not obliged to justify. If it were a duty, it would clearly not be one either to the defendant in the actioti, who can do nothing to enforce it, or to his bail, who are not benefited, and can only be harmed by it, by being required to justify. The defendants have a right to set up the same defences in an action by the present plaintiff on their undertaking, as they would were it brought in the name of the plaintiff in the former action'. Whatever damages the plaintiff is liable in for the latter, he can recover from the defendants, and they are the same as the plaintiff in the former action could recover had he assumed the benefit of the undertaking and sued upon it. There is, therefore, no ground for presuming, in favor of the defendants, that the sheriff \u2018exonerated himself by' delivering the proper documents to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>attorney for the plaintiff in the former suit. That, if the fact be so, should be set up as affirmative matter of defence. The defendants are neither better nor worse off than if the plaintiff in the former action were the plaintiff in this. In fact, the question to whom bail shall be liable, is entirely a matter of election between the sheriff and the plaintiff in the action. They are bound to produce the defendant\u2019s body, when required by a final process, and if they do not, to indemnify the party actually injured thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">It is settled that the sheriff is not obliged to wait until he is sued in order to make the bail liable (Hinds <em>a. </em>Doubleday, 21 <em>Wend., </em>223); and therefore the allegation in the complaint, of the institution of an action against him, is immaterial. The omission to allege expressly that the judgment stated to have been recovered was so in the action originally referred to in the complaint, is aided by the rest of the averments. Advantage can only be taken of it by a motion to make the complaint more definite and certain. The statute does not require the undertaking to be delivered to any one, but merely- to be executed by the bail (\u00a7 187), which is termed giving bail. (\u00a7 186.) It is not a mere contract: it is a stipulation in court, or recognizance, which enures to the benefit of the party entitled. A seal cannot do it any harm. Formerly a bail-bond was in form to the sheriff, but the law permitted a plaintiff,' when assignee of it, to sue upon it, even when other assignees could not sue in their own name. The present practice is perhaps simpler and equally efficacious.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Unless, therefore, it is to be assumed that the plaintiff relieved himself from responsibility by delivering the proper documents to the attorney for the plaintiff in the former action, which does not appear in the complaint, it shows a clear liability on the part of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">I do not see how, if the judgment had been said to have been recovered in the same action in which the order of arrest was issued, and the allegations respecting a seal to the undertaking and the commencement of a suit against the plaintiff had been omitted, a better complaint could have been drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The defendants may be able to set up and prove facts in mitigation of damages, but <em>prima faeie </em>the plaintiff in the original action was entitled to recover the whole amount of the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>bail, against the present plaintiff; and of course he is equally entitled to recover the same against the present defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The order overruling the demurrer in this case must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-11\"> Present, Robertson and Monell, JJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
