The complaint is for money held by him upon certain conditions, which he has neglected to pay over. It is not a complaint for any tort, and the liability of the defendant is clearly that of a bailee.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">There may be some doubt whether, in such an action, where the bailment is set out in the pleadings, the defendant may not be arrested ; but as the point has been decided by one of .the judges of this district, in Alden <em>a. </em>Sarson (4 <em>Abbotts\u2019 Pr., </em>102), I think best to follow that decision until reviewed by the general term. In that case, the judge held that the defendant could not be arrested on execution without a previous order. As there was no order in this case, the motion must be granted on defendant\u2019s stipulating not to bring an action. As the plaintiff may desire to submit the question to the general term, he may have a #ay of proceedings on this order, for the purpose of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">Motion granted, on defendant\u2019s stipulating, &amp;c.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ad8\">By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014Bosworth, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6D\">This is an action to recover the possession of personal property. No order for the arrest \u00bff the defendant was obtained.. He succeeded in the action. Can an execution issue against the person of the plaintiff for the costs ? \u25a0 If the plaintiff had succeeded, no execution against the person could issue against the defendant. <em>(Hoff, on Prov. Rem., </em>22, 23.) The plaintiff cannot be arrested, unless a plaintiff who fails to recover, and against whom a judgment is rendered for costs, may be subjected to execution against his body, in an action where no such execution could issue against the defendant, if the plaintiff had succeeded. Section 178 [153] declares that no person shall be arrested in a civil action, except as prescribed by that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Order affirmed, with ten dollars costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-11\"> Present\u2014Bosworth, Ch.
