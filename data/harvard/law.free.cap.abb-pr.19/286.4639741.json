The defendant pleaded a general denial, and also set out a special defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-13\">On motion of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, setting forth by affidavit that the examination of a long account would be required on part of plaintiff, which was opposed by defendant, claiming that no account was involved, a reference to determine all the issues was ordered by the court at special term, held at \u2022chambers by Mr'.

Roelker, </em>for the defendant, appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJS\">I. This is not a case in which a compulsory reference could be ordered under section 271 of the Code, as it does not involve the examination of a long account. A bill of particulars is not an account proper in the legal sense of the term. And even if it were an account, it is not a <em>long </em>account. (Sharp <em>a. </em>The Mayor of N. Y., 18 <em>How. Pr., </em>213 ; Freeman <em>a. </em>Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co., 13 <em>Abbotts' Pr., </em>124; Harris <em>a. </em>Mead, 16 Ib., 257 ; 6 <em>Hill, </em>373; 2 <em>How., </em>79 ; <em>Ib., </em>171; 3 <em>Ib., </em>9 ; 6 <em>Wend., </em>505 ; 10 <em>Ib., </em>577; and Keeler <em>a. </em>Poughkeepsie Plank Road Co., 10 <em>How. Pr., </em>11.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>decision and opinion of Judge Deah in this case having been confirmed by this court, at this present general term, in the case of Goodrich <em>a. </em>Lorillard Ins. Co., and the opinion of the Superior Court, in Whitaker <em>a. </em>Desfosse (7 <em>Bosw., </em>678), overruling this case in 10 <em>How. Pr., </em>11, having been disapproved of by this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-5\">II. On the question of a right to appeal. (See 13 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>124; 16 <em>Ib., </em>257; 6 <em>Hill, </em>373 ; 6 <em>Wend., </em>505.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-6\"><em>Samuel G. Courtney, </em>for plaintiff and respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqH\">I. The demand of the plaintiff is for work, labor, and services .rendered defendant as counsel. The answer denies each and every allegation in the complaint; and therefore puts at issue the amount of labor, its time, and the value of the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-7\">1. The bill of particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s demand shows the account to be necessarily a long one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-8\">2. All the labor done, what was done, how much time occupied under each item, under the pleadings, must be shown ; also, by experts and professional men, what such labor, time, and services were worth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-9\">II. Such an action and such issues are properly referable. (See <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 271, subd. 1.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-10\">In an attorney\u2019s action to recover compensation for his services, a reference may be had to ascertain the amount he will be entitled to recover. (Bowman <em>a. </em>Sheldon, 1 <em>Duer, </em>607.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-11\">III. This order is not appealable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-12\">The question whether the trial of am issue of fact will involve the examination of a long account, is a question of fact to be determined summarily upon the application to refer. If there is sufficient evidence to authorize the court so to find, granting a reference rests in its discretion, and the order is not appealable. (Dean <em>a. </em>Empire Mutual Ins. Co., 9 <em>How. Pr., </em>69.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-13\">The allegation in the moving affidavit made by the attorney, that the trial would involve the examination' of a long account, is sufficient evidence to authorize the court to order a reference. (Whitaker a. Desfosse, 7 <em>Bosw., </em>678.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b301-14\">By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"Aln\">The order is appealable, as it affects a substantial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The bill of particulars in this case is not an account in the ordinary or legal sense of the term. And if it were an account, it would not be a long account, svteh as would justify a compulsory reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Formerly four items were held sufficient to constitute a long <em>account; </em>but the later decisions of the courts do not deem this a long account.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The order below must be reversed, with ten dollars costs to defendant, to abide the event of the action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-15\"> Present, Ingraham, P.
