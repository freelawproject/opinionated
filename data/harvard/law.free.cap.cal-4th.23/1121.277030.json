Code, \u00a7 1054.7). As we shall explain, however, we conclude in light of controlling constitutional authorities that the trial court and the Court of Appeal erred in determining that, when the risk to a witness is sufficiently grave, the identity of the witness may be <em>permanently </em>withheld from a defendant and the witness may testify <em>anonymously at </em>trial\u2014even when the witness is a crucial prosecution witness and withholding the witness\u2019s identity will impair significantly the defendant\u2019s ability to investigate and cross-examine the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-12\">As discussed hereafter, numerous decisions of both the United States Supreme Court and the California courts establish that whenever nondisclosure of a witness\u2019s identity will prevent the effective investigation and cross-examination of a crucial witness, the confrontation clause precludes the prosecution from relying upon the witness\u2019s testimony at trial while refusing to disclose the witness\u2019s identity. As the United States Supreme Court has explained: \u201c[W]hen the credibility of a witness is in issue, the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>starting point in \u2018exposing falsehood and bringing out the truth\u2019 through cross-examination must necessarily be to ask the witness who he is and where he lives. The witnesses] name and address open countless avenues of in-court examination and out-of-court investigation. <em>To forbid this most rudimentary inquiry at the threshold is effectively to emasculate the right of cross-examination </em>itself.\u201d <em>{Smith v. Illinois </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 129, 131 [88 S.Ct. 748, 750, 19 L.Ed.2d 956], italics added, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the challenged order must be vacated insofar as it authorizes, in advance of trial and without regard to the evidence and circumstances as they then may appear, the prosecution <em>permanently </em>to withhold the identity of these prosecution witnesses from the defense. At the same time, however, we emphasize that the trial court remains free to fashion a more limited order denying, restricting, or deferring disclosure of the identity of each witness <em>before </em>trial (including limiting disclosure to defendants\u2019 counsel), as long as that order does not impermissibly impair defendants\u2019 right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses effectively <em>at trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">On February 6, 1993, during the noon hour, Jose Uribe, an inmate at the Los Angeles County jail, was killed in his cell, having been stabbed 37 times with a contraband knife described as a shank. Three other inmates allegedly witnessed the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-7\">Following an investigation by law enforcement officials, a complaint was filed charging defendants Joaquin Alvarado and Jorge Lopez with the first degree murder of Uribe. A third defendant, Frank Marquez, also was charged but is not a party to this proceeding. The prosecution provided discovery to the defense indicating that three inmates witnessed the killing. A magistrate ordered the prosecution to provide the defense with the identities of the witnesses prior to the commencement of the preliminary hearing, pursuant to Penal Code sections 1054.1, subdivision (a), and 1054.5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-8\">Instead of complying with the magistrate\u2019s order, the prosecution presented its case to a grand jury, which returned an indictment charging defendant Alvarado with murder (and alleging a prior-murder special circumstance) and conspiracy to commit murder, and charging defendant Lopez with murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and possession of a shank while in custody (on three occasions unrelated to the present incident). (\u00a7\u00a7 187, 190.2, subd. (a)(2), 182, subd. (a)(1), 4574, subd. (a).) The prosecution is seeking the death penalty against Alvarado but not against Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>The prosecution provided defendants with transcripts of the grand jury proceedings, in which the three inmate eyewitnesses are identified only as witnesses 1, 2, and 3. We summarize the testimony of the three witnesses before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">Witness 1 testified that on the day of the murder, he was housed in cell No. 12. Witness 1 heard Marquez, a jail trusty, ask one of witness l\u2019s two cellmates in Spanish for some extra jail clothing, mentioning something about a snitch. Witness 1 gave Marquez his shirt, hoping to curry favor with Hispanic inmates. Witness 1 remained in his cell during the noon hour because he was tired. He saw a group of five inmates, including defendants, near his cell. He then heard an altercation and observed the same group of five inmates leave the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">Two days after the murder, during the course of the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s investigation, witness 1 identified a photograph of Marquez as depicting the person to whom he gave his shirt, but six months later he selected another photograph identifying a different individual. Witness 1 told the grand jury that he had been confused regarding his earlier photographic identification. Witness 1 further testified that defendants were in the group of inmates he saw near his cell and that on the day immediately preceding his testimony before the grand jury, he was placed in the same jail cell as defendant Alvarado, who threatened to harm him if he testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">Witness 2 testified that, on the morning of Uribe\u2019s death, Marquez came to cell No. 11, where witness 2 was housed. Marquez spoke to witness 2\u2019s cellmates in Spanish. Witness 2 believed that Marquez said a snitch was going to be dealt with in cell No. 10, and said witness 2 should stay away from cell No. 10. Approximately 10 minutes later, witness 2 heard a Black trusty inform certain Black inmates to stay away from the end of the row where cell No. 10 was located. Witness 2 remained in his cell around noon instead of going to lunch, because he wanted to eat the food he had purchased that morning at the commissary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-8\">Around noon, witness 2 saw defendants Alvarado and Lopez, who were not assigned to cell No. 10, enter that cell with another inmate who was housed there. Witness 2 then heard an altercation inside cell No. 10 and something being said about being a snitch. Shortly thereafter, witness 2 saw Lopez give a bloody shirt to Marquez outside cell No. 10. Witness 2 also saw a bloody body lying under a bed inside cell No. 10. Marquez told witness 2 to return to his cell because the matter did not involve him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-9\">As part of the investigation into Uribe\u2019s murder, witness 2 was shown photographs of inmates who had been in the area. Witness 2 identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>Marquez, Lopez, and Alvarado. (Witness 2 initially identified a different individual as having accompanied Lopez into cell No. 10. When thereafter shown Alvarado\u2019s photograph, witness 2 stated that his earlier identification had been mistaken.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">Witness 3 was a jail trusty assigned to sweep the module that contained cell Nos. 10, 11, and 12. On the morning of the murder, he saw Marquez wrap a shank inside a shirt and give it to another Hispanic inmate. After lunch, witness 3 saw Marquez take a shirt from someone on the same row.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">The prosecution provided the defense with the grand jury transcripts and information regarding the witnesses\u2019 criminal histories, but did not provide the names or photographs of witnesses 1, 2, or 3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defense continued to seek the witnesses\u2019 true names and addresses. The prosecution then sought a protective order, authorizing it <em>permanently </em>to withhold disclosure of the witnesses\u2019 identities and photographs from defendants or their counsel on the ground that disclosure would place the witnesses\u2019 lives in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">Over defendants\u2019 objections, the trial court held a series of in camera hearings, <em>from which the defense was excluded, </em>to permit the prosecution to demonstrate good cause why disclosure of the witnesses\u2019 names and photographs should be denied. (\u00a7 1054.7.) Based upon the evidence adduced at these hearings, the trial court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1170-7\">\u201cThe evidence presented clearly established that witnesses 1 through 3 are in serious danger as a result of their participation in this case and that the disclosure of their names would likely increase the danger to them. Several facts support this conclusion, including the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1170-8\">\u201c(1) The homicide is believed to have been ordered by the Mexican Mafia, a notorious prison gang, and that the defendants, who are not members of the gang, committed the homicide to gain favor with the Mexican Mafia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1170-9\">\u201c(2) The Mexican Mafia is well-known for retaliatory acts against . . . informants and government witnesses, including murder. ftO Information disclosed in camera documented 12 incidents of murder or attempted murder at the county jail of inmates between 1988 through 1991 which were committed by or at the direction of the Mexican Mafia. The additional five murders linked to the Mexican Mafia during this period of time were committed on persons who were not incarcerated. [^Q The Mexican Mafia is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>believed to have ordered the murders of witnesses in protective custody and incarcerated in other states ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-5\">\u201c(3) The Mexican Mafia has an excellent intelligence network which includes sources in several public agencies and is able to obtain confidential information. HD ... HD Penetration [by] the Mexican Mafia of penal institutions is so extensive that one in camera witness described the organization as having \u2018de facto control\u2019 over all penal institutions in California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-6\">\u201c(4) . . . [T]he danger the Mexican Mafia poses to government witnesses is extreme. In camera, a witness stated that the Mexican Mafia has ordered so many hits and there are so many witnesses in protective custody that we cannot adequately protect them all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-8\">\u201c(5) The Mexican Mafia requires documentation which identifies an individual as a government witness before a contract to kill the witness is approved. The procedure for issuing contracts was described as follows: HD For contracts to be issued, one Mexican Mafia member alone cannot give the contract. He has to have that contract approved. HO The contract is approved in a manner where they meet, two or three members meet. They are presented with evidence. They have . . . what you would call a trial. It is informal. This evidence includes transcripts or paperwork . . . that would indict this person who has been a witness and that is why the name is so important.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-9\">\u201c(6) A witness in the instant case was attacked and cut in jail after the killing in this case. The attacker was a member of the prison gang aligned with the Mexican Mafia and warned the witness not to testify. HD One of the defendants in this case threatened a witness while the witness was in protective custody and told the witness somebody would get him. HO Someone wrote on a wall while a witness was in a court holding cell that the witness was dead. And that the witness was a snitch at the time when the witness was in protective custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-10\">\u201c(7) In the instant case, the homicide was committed in a manner which suggests highly organized criminal activity involving several persons. HQ The victim arrived at the institution a single day or at most two days before the killing. This fact suggests that the group responsible for his killing had intelligence and organization. It was known that the [victim] was coming, where he would be and how to get to him. HO This sophisticated criminal activity involving the obtaining of shanks which, of course, [are] illegal to possess in the jail, getting the shanks to the floor [where] they could be used, obtaining the extra clothing so the killer could rid themselves [sic] of the blood-stained clothes, getting rid of the blood-stained clothes. HQ The sophistication of the killing indicates no one is safe inside the county jail system and I think that also obtains to persons who are in prison within California and in prisons outside of California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>\u201cBased on the foregoing and the other facts disclosed to the court in camera, it is clear that the witnesses 1 through 3 are in danger and that disclosure of their names would increase the risk of possible danger to them with a resulting possible los[s] of evidence; that is, their testimony, which has not been preserved in any usable way. HO So I find good cause has been shown to support that there is a danger to these witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-4\">\u201cBut I must say I continue to be troubled by the People\u2019s request to not turn over the names. It is a difficult issue for me. And even though I think good cause exists, I certainly am persuaded by [counsel for defendant Alvarado] Mr. Crain\u2019s argument and the arguments of counsel that for them to investigate the case in this situation, it makes it almost impossible to investigate without the names. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-5\">Based upon the foregoing findings, the trial court concluded that good cause for nondisclosure of the witnesses\u2019 true names had been established. The court therefore issued the following minute order: \u201c[The] People\u2019s request to withhold the names of witnesses from the defense is granted. The witnesses will be made available for interview by defense counsel 30 (thirty) days before trial. The witnesses are not required to state their names, but, may do so at their own volition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">Defendants thereafter sought writ review of the trial court\u2019s order. The Court of Appeal denied defendants\u2019 petitions for writ of mandate. Defendants thereafter sought review from this court. We granted review and transferred the matters to the Court of Appeal, with directions to that court to vacate its order denying mandate and to issue an alternative writ to be heard before that court. The Court of Appeal, upon discovering a discrepancy between the trial court\u2019s minute order and the reporter\u2019s transcript, remanded the case to the trial court, which issued a new minute order clarifying its ruling and providing as follows: (1) the prosecution is authorized <em>permanently </em>to withhold from the defense the identities of the three witnesses; (2) the prosecution is to produce the witnesses for interview by defense counsel 30 days prior to trial, although the witnesses are not required to speak to defense counsel, and if they do, they may\u2014but are not required to\u2014 disclose their names; (3) if defense counsel learn the witnesses\u2019 names, they may not disclose the names to defendants; and (4) at trial, the witnesses may \u2014but are not required to\u2014disclose their names, but their appearance will not be disguised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">Both defendants thereafter sought further writ review from the Court of Appeal, which consolidated the two petitions, issued an order to show cause, and ultimately resolved the matter in a written opinion rendered by a divided court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>In its opinion, the majority of the Court of Appeal determined that the trial court properly had exercised its discretion in authorizing the prosecution permanently to withhold the witnesses\u2019 identities from the defense, based upon the trial court\u2019s finding that disclosure of the witnesses\u2019 names \u201cwould place them in mortal danger. . . .\u201d In so holding, the majority acknowledged that under the trial court\u2019s order \u201c[defendants will have difficulty obtaining complete information about the witnesses\u2019 location and ability to observe and testify about the crime. Moreover, defendants will be unable to obtain complete impeaching information, such as the witnesses\u2019 reputation for truthfulness or dishonesty, previous history and accuracy of providing information to law enforcement, and other motives to fabricate, such as revenge or reduction or dismissal of their own charges.\u201d In sum, the majority conceded that the trial court\u2019s nondisclosure order would seriously limit defendants\u2019 effective investigation and cross-examination of the witnesses, \u201csignificantly impairing]\u201d defendants\u2019 constitutional rights to confrontation and to due process of law. Nonetheless, the majority concluded that in light of the potentially grave danger to the witnesses, the impairment of defendants\u2019 ability to cross-examine and impeach the witnesses was not unconstitutional. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeal majority expressly disagreed with the conclusion reached in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brandow </em>(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 749 [90 Cal.Rptr. 891] <em>(Brandow), </em>in which the appellate court held that disclosure of the identity of a witness constitutes \u201can essential element in the protection of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d (12 Cal.App.3d at p. 755.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">The dissenting justice in the Court of Appeal challenged the majority\u2019s analysis of the relevant case law and criticized the majority for according undue weight to the threat of retaliation against the prosecution\u2019s witnesses at the expense of defendants\u2019 constitutional rights. Questioning the ultimate effectiveness of the trial court\u2019s nondisclosure order, the dissent observed that \u201cin addition to trying to dissuade adverse witnesses from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>testifying, it is also part of the Mexican Mafia\u2019s arsenal to retaliate against such witnesses once their testimony has been given. Here, although the likelihood that the People will be able to bring this case to trial may be enhanced by the order of nondisclosure, once the witnesses have appeared in open court and thereby been subjected to the scrutiny of the Mexican Mafia\u2019s extensive intelligence network, what protection the nondisclosure order previously afforded could well be rendered meaningless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">We again granted defendants\u2019 petitions for review, on this occasion in order for us to determine whether the trial court\u2019s order, by permitting the prosecution\u2019s crucial witnesses to testify anonymously at trial, violates defendants\u2019 constitutional rights to due process of law and to confront the witnesses against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">Proposition 115, approved by the voters in June 1990, included provisions amending the California Constitution and the Penal Code in numerous respects, one of which explicitly authorizes reciprocal discovery in criminal cases. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 30, subd. (c); Pen. Code \u00a7 1054 et seq.; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tillis </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 284, 289 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 447, 956 P.2d 409].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among the statutory revisions implementing the pretrial discovery provisions of the initiative was the addition of sections 1054 through 1054.8, setting forth pretrial discovery procedures to be followed in criminal cases. Included within these procedures is the requirement that a prosecutor disclose the names and addresses of the individuals whom he or she intends to call at trial. (\u00a7 1054.1, subd. (a).) The disclosure may be made to defense counsel, who is prohibited from revealing, to the defendant or others, information that identifies the address or telephone number of the prosecution\u2019s potential witnesses, absent permission by the court after a hearing and a showing of good cause. (\u00a7 1054.2.) Before a party may seek court enforcement of any disclosure required by the pretrial discovery statutes, the party must make an informal request for the desired materials and information; if disclosure is not made within 15 days of the request, the party may seek a court order requiring disclosure, and a court may enter any order necessary to enforce the statutory provisions, including an order directing immediate disclosure. (\u00a7 1054.5.) Absent a formal court order directing earlier disclosure, discovery must be provided at least 30 days prior to trial, \u201cunless good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>cause is shown why a disclosure should be denied, restricted, or deferred.\u201d (\u00a7 1054.7.) \u201cGood cause\u201d is defined for purposes of this provision as \u201cthreats or possible danger to the safety of a victim or witness, possible loss or destruction of evidence, or possible compromise of other investigation by law enforcement.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Section 1054.7 additionally provides that upon the request of any party, the court may permit a showing of good cause\u2014 for the denial or regulation of disclosures\u2014to be made in camera.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">As noted, on the basis of the evidence presented by the prosecution at the in camera hearing in this case, the trial court found that good cause existed to permit the prosecution to withhold the identities of the witnesses because disclosure was likely to pose a serious danger to their safety. The court ruled that the prosecution was required only to make the witnesses available for interviews by the defense 30 days prior to trial, and that the witnesses need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>not disclose their names or even submit to the interviews. On remand from the Court of Appeal, the trial court subsequently clarified its order, reiterating that the prosecution must make the witnesses available for interviews by the defense, but further specifying that the witnesses\u2019 identities need not be disclosed to the defense unless the witnesses themselves choose to reveal their identities (in which case the attorneys would be precluded from disclosing the witnesses\u2019 identities to their clients). The trial court further clarified that its intent was to authorize the prosecution to withhold the witnesses\u2019 identities (and their photographs) from defendants and their counsel both at the pretrial discovery stage <em>and at trial. </em>The trial court further ordered that the witnesses need not submit to interviews by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">Defendants do not contend that the trial court\u2019s finding that disclosure of the witnesses\u2019 names and photographs would pose a potential danger to the safety of the witnesses does not constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d within the meaning of section 1054.7, but they maintain that, under the circumstances of the present case, the trial court\u2019s order\u2014upholding the prosecution\u2019s authority to withhold disclosure of the witnesses\u2019 identities at trial\u2014violates their rights, as guaranteed by the United States Constitution, to due process of law and to confront the witnesses against them. The resolution of this case turns upon these federal constitutional issues.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">In analyzing defendants\u2019 federal constitutional claims, it is helpful to discuss separately two aspects of the trial court order before us: (1) the validity of that order insofar as it permits the prosecution to decline to disclose the witnesses\u2019 identities to the defense before trial, and (2) the validity of the trial court\u2019s order insofar as it permits the prosecution to continue to withhold the witnesses\u2019 identities at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">With regard to the first issue\u2014i.e., disclosure of the witnesses\u2019 identities before trial\u2014section 1054.7 establishes that a trial court has discretion to deny, restrict, or defer disclosure for good cause. Good cause, as defined in the statute, expressly includes \u201cthreats or possible danger to the safety of a victim or witness.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Petitioners have cited no authority that suggests that the statute, in this respect, is unconstitutional under either the confrontation clause or the due process clause. (See generally <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 39, 52 [107 S.Ct. 989, 999, 94 L.Ed.2d 40] (plur. opn. of Rehnquist, C. J.) [\u201cthe right to confrontation is a trial right\u201d (italics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>omitted)]; <em>Weatherford v.

Like California, other states that generally authorize pretrial discovery of the identities of witnesses whom the prosecution intends to call at trial provide at the same time for an exception in instances in which disclosure may pose a danger to a witness\u2019s safety (see 4 LaFave et al., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 20.3 (h), pp. 869-870 &amp; fns. 150-153), and we are unaware of any case that suggests that the denial of pretrial disclosure in such circumstances is constitutionally impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">Even before Proposition 115 added section 1054.7 to the Penal Code, this court had recognized that a trial court retains considerable discretion to protect a witness\u2019s identity before trial. In <em>People v. Lopez </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 223 [32 Cal.Rptr. 424, 384 P.2d 16], the defendants sought disclosure of the names and addresses of certain prospective prosecution witnesses during the pretrial stage of the proceeding. The prosecution opposed immediate disclosure on the ground that the witnesses \u201cwere in \u2018fear of physical injury or death\u2019 \u201d (60 Cal.2d at p. 245), and after conducting a hearing on the issue, the court denied the defendants\u2019 request for immediate disclosure of the witnesses\u2019 identities but ordered the prosecution to provide the information to the defense shortly before the witnesses were to be called to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">On appeal of their subsequent convictions, the defendants contended that the trial court committed prejudicial error in denying their motion for immediate disclosure of the identities of the prospective witnesses prior to trial. In <em>Lopez, </em>this court rejected the contention, explaining that \u201czn <em>special circumstances </em>[the state may] have cogent reasons for keeping confidential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>\u2014in order to give some assurance that the truth can be presented\u2014the names of prospective witnesses. There must be a balancing of the right of a defendant to discover potentially material witnesses with the probability that such discovery might lead to the elimination of an adverse witness or the influencing of his testimony. In balancing these competing factors the trial court must be allowed great discretion. [Citation.] . . . ftO The court\u2019s order delaying disclosure was, undoubtedly, a conscientious effort on the part of the court to balance the claimed right of defendants to immediate disclosure with realistic danger inherent in such disclosure. It is the <em>timeliness </em>rather than <em>the. immediacy </em>of disclosure which should control. In view of the facts before the court, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion by ordering disclosure delayed until shortly before the subject witnesses were to be called.\u201d <em>{People v. Lopez, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d at pp. 246-247, italics in the original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">In the case before us, the evidence presented to the trial court clearly justified its order protecting the witnesses\u2019 identities before trial. In view of the circumstances of the offense\u2014a jailhouse murder with likely prison gang involvement and crucial prosecution witnesses who themselves were jailhouse inmates and thus particularly vulnerable to threats, coercion, or violent acts of other inmates, the trial court clearly had discretion to permit the prosecution to withhold pretrial disclosure of the witnesses\u2019 names and photographs. Particularly in a capital case, where pretrial preparation and investigation often extend over a considerable period of time, early disclosure of the identity of a vulnerable and threatened witness greatly may increase the danger of \u201cthe elimination of an adverse witness or the influencing of his testimony.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d at p. 247.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">Accordingly, we conclude the challenged order clearly is valid insofar as it authorizes the prosecution to refrain from immediately disclosing the inmate witnesses\u2019 identities to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">As noted, however, the trial court\u2019s order in this case\u2014particularly as clarified after remand\u2014did not simply authorize the prosecution to deny the disclosure of the witnesses\u2019 identities before trial, but rather went further and ruled that the prosecution <em>permanently </em>could withhold the witnesses\u2019 identities from the defense, even during (and after) their testimony at trial. Although the Court of Appeal recognized that this aspect of the order would, as a practical matter, seriously impair defendants\u2019 ability to investigate the witnesses\u2019 backgrounds and credibility (as the trial court also recognized) and would affect adversely their constitutional right of cross-examination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>the Court of Appeal majority ultimately concluded that, because of the seriousness of the danger faced by the witnesses, even the complete withholding of this information from the defense at trial does not violate defendants\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">As the Court of Appeal also recognized, the aspect of the trial court\u2019s order authorizing the prosecution to withhold permanently from the defense the names of witnesses who are to testify at trial directly implicates defendants\u2019 rights under the confrontation clause of the federal Constitution. Thus, in analyzing the validity of the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision nonetheless to uphold the trial court\u2019s order permitting nondisclosure at trial, we examine the governing authorities under the federal confrontation clause.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution \u201c \u2018to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>CDelaware v.

On cross-examination, when the defense sought to elicit the witness\u2019s place of residence, the prosecution objected on the ground that such information was immaterial. Defense counsel insisted that the questions were proper, the jury being entitled to know \u201c \u2018who the witness is, where he lives and what his business is.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 689 [51 S.Ct. at p. 218].)

On cross-examination, the witness was asked whether the name by which he had identified himself on direct examination was his correct name. He admitted, over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, that it was not. The witness was then asked to state his correct name. The trial court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to the question.

As noted, the Court of Appeal in the present case expressly disagreed with <em>Brandow. </em>In <em>Brandow, </em>the defendant was charged with one count of pandering and one count of attempted pandering. The principal witness against him was one Michelle Dupree, the assumed name of a woman who had engaged in prostitution prior to agreeing to cooperate with the police by tape-recording her telephone calls. At trial, the witness testified that Michelle Dupree was not her true name, and the court, after hearing evidence outside the presence of the jury regarding threats to the witness\u2019s safety and \u201cphysical harm and abuse which had already been inflicted upon her,\u201d sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to a question, asked by defense counsel on cross-examination, seeking the witness\u2019s true identity. <em>(Brandow, supra, </em>12 Cal.

Citing <em>Smith, supra, </em>390 U.S. 129, the court in <em>Brandow </em>agreed with the defendant, finding that it was constitutionally impermissible to bar the defendant from ascertaining the witness\u2019s actual identity. The court in <em>Brandow </em>explained: \u201cUnder the circumstances, the credibility of the two opposing witnesses [Dupree and the defendant, himself,] constitutes the fulcrum upon which the determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence must be balanced. We conclude that the identity of the witness was an essential element in the protection of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>(Brandow, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.3d 749, 755; accord, <em>Alford </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 724, 728 [105 Cal.Rptr. 713] [holding that the defendant was entitled to cross-examine a material witness as to his true name]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mascarenas </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 660, 666 [98 Cal.Rptr. 728] [reversing the trial court\u2019s ruling that a material witness need not disclose his address where the trial court found that \u201c \u2018the witness is in possible danger of harassment, intimidation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>humiliation, if not personal safety\u2019 \u201d]; cf. <em>People v.

The People contend that under such a balancing process, when the risk posed to a witness\u2019s safety is grave enough, a defendant\u2019s right to be informed of the identity of the witness properly may give way even if the witness\u2019s testimony is crucial to the prosecution\u2019s case. The Court of Appeal majority endorsed this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">In observing that <em>Alford, supra, </em>282 U.S. 687, and <em>Smith, supra, </em>390 U.S. 129, do not establish an inflexible rule requiring disclosure of a witness\u2019s identity and address in all circumstances, however, the overwhelming majority of the decisions cited by the People and the Court of Appeal\u2014unlike the case presently before us\u2014involved factual situations in which the <em>only </em>information withheld from the defense was the residential <em>address </em>of the witness or other identifying information deemed to be <em>inconsequential </em>to the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial under the facts presented. (See, e.g., <em>Montez </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 763, <em>111 </em>[7 Cal.Rptr.2d 76] [where four eyewitnesses to a murder committed during the robbery of a restaurant all were employees of the restaurant, the court upheld nondisclosure of the witnesses\u2019 addresses because \u201cthe facts raise no issue of their reputation in their community for veracity\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 12, 20 [193 Cal.Rptr. 849] [in permitting nondisclosure of the prosecution witness\u2019s address, the court found that the defendant \u201cwas not deprived of a substantial right,\u201d because he already had presented \u201cample evidence ... to place the witness ... in his proper setting and accurately to evaluate his credibility\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 191, 200-204 [160 Cal.Rptr. 156] [defense sought the address of the prosecution\u2019s witness for the purpose of impeachment, but because the witness already had been impeached as a drug addict, felon, and cheat, the court found that the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>had presented \u201csufficient environmental background\u201d to allow the jury to judge the witness\u2019s credibility].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>In other cases relied upon by the People, the identity or address of the witness <em>actually was made available </em>to defense counsel privately, or was discovered by the defense prior to trial. Thus, nondisclosure was limited to events occurring in open court and did not preclude defense efforts to investigate the witness for the purpose of obtaining material that might be useful in cross-examination. Therefore, these cases, too, are distinguishable from the case presently before us. (See, e.g., <em>People v.

As noted, the witnesses\u2019 grand jury testimony suggests they were in close proximity to the murder and witnessed events related to the charged offenses. Thus, under the cases discussed above, should the witnesses provide such crucial testimony at trial, the confrontation clause would prohibit the prosecution from relying upon this testimony while refusing to disclose the identities of the witnesses under circumstances in which such nondisclosure would significantly impair the defense\u2019s ability to investigate or effectively cross-examine them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">The People contend that, although they have not identified the witnesses in question by their true names, the impact of such nondisclosure has been mitigated by the prosecution\u2019s submission of other relevant information to the defense, including the module, row, and cell number occupied by each of the witnesses at the time of the crime as well as the witnesses\u2019 criminal histories. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 799, 842 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, 919 P.2d 1280] [a witness\u2019s credibility may be impeached extensively with evidence of his or her prior criminal history and involvement in other crimes, and of the inducements for the witness\u2019s testimony].) The People maintain that, in view of the disclosures made to the defense, the witnesses can be placed in their proper setting\u2014i.e., as jail inmates\u2014and that further disclosures are unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">In response, defendants contend that the limited information provided to them is inadequate to permit effective cross-examination. Defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>insist that without access to the witnesses\u2019 identities, they will be unable to determine whether the witnesses (1) were present at the time and place of the killing, (2) harbored grudges against either or both defendants, (3) had a motive to kill the victim themselves and accuse defendants in order to dispel suspicion from themselves, (4) made inconsistent statements to others regarding relevant aspects of the case, and (5) had reputations for dishonesty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">We already have explained that the order presently on review, insofar as it relates to <em>pretrial </em>discovery, represents a reasonable exercise of discretion under section 1054.7 and a \u201cconscientious effort\u201d <em>{People </em>v. Lopez, <em>supra, </em>60 Cal.2d at p. 247) to balance the defense\u2019s need for information before trial against the realistic danger to the witnesses inherent in premature disclosure. At <em>trial, </em>however, the confrontation clause imposes greater demands upon the prosecution in that defendants must be afforded an adequate opportunity to confront and cross-examine effectively the witnesses who testify against them. As we have seen, even the Court of Appeal majority opined that without knowledge of the witnesses\u2019 identities, defense counsel \u201cwill have difficulty obtaining complete information about the witnesses\u2019 location and ability to observe and testify about the crime[,] . . . [and] will be unable to [obtain] complete impeaching information, such as the witnesses\u2019 reputation for truthfulness or dishonesty, previous history and accuracy of providing information to law enforcement, and other motives to fabricate, such as revenge or reduction or dismissal of their own charges.\u201d Indeed, without access to either the witnesses\u2019 names or their photographs, defense counsel are unlikely to be able to conduct an adequate investigation of the witnesses or of the veracity of their testimony, or challenge the accuracy of the information concerning the witnesses provided by the prosecution, including their prior criminal records or the benefits that may have been provided to them in return for their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">The People further contend that once the crucial witnesses appear in court at trial, defendants \u201ccan advise their attorneys of any prior contacts with these witnesses and any other information they might have concerning these witnesses,\u201d and that at that point defendants may be able to obtain a continuance in order to investigate the witnesses. The trial court\u2019s order in this case, however, is based upon the premise that the witnesses\u2019, identities need not be disclosed at trial under any circumstances.  We do not believe such an order can be defended, without full consideration\u2014in light of the relevant evidence and circumstances\u2014of the defense\u2019s need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>affirmative disclosure, solely on the assumption that the witnesses\u2019 appearance at trial in any event will reveal their identities.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in ruling, on the record before it, that the witnesses in question may testify anonymously at trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">As emphasized at the outset of this opinion, we are keenly aware of the serious nature and magnitude of the problem of witness intimidation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Further, we agree that the state\u2019s ability to afford protection to witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>whose testimony is crucial to the conduct of criminal proceedings is an absolutely essential element of the criminal justice system. As we have explained, a trial court has broad discretion to postpone disclosure of a prospective witness\u2019s identity in order to protect his or her safety, and may restrict such pretrial disclosure to defense counsel (and ancillary personnel) alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">A trial court also retains broad discretion to control courtroom proceedings in a manner directed toward promoting the safety of witnesses. (See, e.g., \u00a7 868.7, subd. (a)(2) [upon motion of the prosecutor, a magistrate may close the examination of a witness \u201c[w]hose life would be subject to a substantial risk in appearing before the general public\u201d]; see also \u00a7 686.2 [authorizing the trial court to remove any spectator who is intimidating a witness]; \u00a7 867 [authorizing the magistrate to exclude potential and actual witnesses upon motion of either party]; \u00a7 868 [authorizing the magistrate to exclude the public upon the request of the defendant and a finding by the magistrate \u201cthat exclusion of the public is necessary in order to protect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Woodward </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 376, 382-386 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 434, 841 P.2d 954] [upholding the temporary closure of the courtroom to additional spectators during a murder trial, in view of the \u201cunusual security risks\u201d posed by the trial]; <em>NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1222, fn. 46 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 778, 980 P.2d 337] [noting that among the \u201coverriding interests\u201d that may justify closure of a courtroom in an appropriate instance is the protection of witnesses from intimidation].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">The state retains numerous other means of affording protection to a potential witness, including the provision of protective surveillance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>housing, relocation, documents to establish a new identity, and the transfer of an incarcerated witness to another prison, either within or outside of California. (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 14020 et seq. [establishing state Witness Protection Program and authorizing reimbursement to local entities for witness protection expenses], 11189 et seq. [adopting Interstate Corrections Compact authorizing confinement of inmates in other states].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although none of the measures specifically authorized by these legislative enactments can guarantee the safety of a witness, they do provide mechanisms by which the state can help reduce the risks that he or she faces. Furthermore, the state vigorously may enforce the numerous stringent criminal sanctions that are available against witness harassment and intimidation. (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 136 et seq. [establishing a variety of witness intimidation offenses], 190.2, subd. (a)(10) [authorizing the death penalty for the murder of a witness to a crime \u201cwho was intentionally killed for the purpose of preventing his or her testimony in a criminal or juvenile proceeding\u201d]; <em>People v. Jones </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 535, 550 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 42, 917 P.2d 1165] [holding that the witness-killing special circumstance applies to the killing of any witness who might testify in a criminal proceeding]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 1018 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044] [rejecting the argument that the witness-murder special circumstance is inapplicable where \u201cthe victim was not an important witness in the criminal proceeding\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">As has been established by the judicial decisions that we have discussed above, however, the state\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting individuals who, by chance or otherwise, happen to become witnesses to a criminal offense cannot justify depriving the defendant of a fair trial. Thus, when nondisclosure of the identity of a crucial witness will preclude effective investigation and cross-examination of that witness, the confrontation clause does not permit the prosecution to rely upon the testimony of that witness at trial while refusing to disclose his or her identity. As this court observed more than 40 years ago, \u201chowever praiseworthy was the prosecution\u2019s motive in protecting the [witness] from the threat of reprisal^] [s]uch motives and purposes cannot prevail when, as here, they inevitably result, intentionally or unintentionally, in depriving the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>(People v. Kiihoa </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 748, 754 [3 Cal.Rptr. 1, 349 P.2d 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">As we have explained, the serious threat to the witnesses\u2019 safety disclosed by the evidence presented by the prosecution in this case clearly justified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>delaying disclosure of the witnesses\u2019 identities to the defense, but the trial court\u2019s order went beyond constitutional bounds in determining that, notwithstanding the significant impairment of defendants\u2019 ability to investigate or cross-examine the witnesses or the apparently crucial nature of the witnesses\u2019 proposed testimony, the prosecution could withhold the identities of \u201cwitnesses 1, 2, and 3\u201d from the defense for the duration of the proceedings and have them testify anonymously at trial. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal insofar as it upholds this aspect of the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">We conclude that the trial court should be directed to vacate the challenged order and, because that order was entered some time ago and a variety of circumstances\u2014including the location and situation of the witnesses\u2014may have changed materially in the interim, the trial court should be permitted to fashion a revised order in light of the conclusions expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remand the matter to that court with instructions to issue a writ directing the trial court to vacate the challenged order, and to conduct further proceedings and issue a new order consistent with the reasoning set forth in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-7\">Mosk, J., Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., and Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-8\">The petition of real party in interest for a rehearing was denied November 15, 2000, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1168-9\">Unless otherwise specified, all further statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1170-10\">The prosecution also provided the defense with information describing the witnesses\u2019 custodial status and with the police reports of their prior crimes. Copies of reports of interviews of other inmates were made available to the defense. Additionally, the prosecution provided the names and photographs of 33 other inmates who, on the date of the murder, resided in the county jail module where the killing occurred. Defendants also were provided with the names of every other inmate who resided in a nearby county jail module.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">In discussing the danger posed to the prosecution witnesses, the Court of Appeal majority emphasized the threats by the Mexican Mafia found by the trial court, observing: \u201cOne of the witnesses was attacked and warned against testifying by an inmate aligned with the Mexican Mafia. [Defendant] Alvarado threatened a witness while he was in protective custody. While one of the witnesses was in court, someone wrote on his cell wall that he was dead.\u201d In addition to noting that the trial court found that defendant Alvarado had threatened one of the witnesses, the Court of Appeal also observed that \u201cboth of the other witnesses received specific threats designed to dissuade them from testifying.\u201d The majority concluded that disclosure of the witnesses\u2019 names to the defense would further endanger the witnesses, because the Mexican Mafia then could determine who they are.</p>\n<p id=\"A9q\">In the briefs filed in this court, defendants note that the hearings conducted by the trial court (prompted by the prosecution\u2019s concerns for the safety of its witnesses) were held outside the presence of defendants and defense counsel, and that the transcript of that hearing was sealed. Defendants explain that under these circumstances, they are in no position to challenge the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the alleged danger to the witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1174-7\">We upheld the constitutionality of the reciprocal discovery provisions of Proposition 115 in <em>Izazaga v.

The right of a defendant to know his or her accusers and to mount a defense against them can be traced back to the time of the Roman Empire and the sedition trial of the Apostle Paul in the year 60 A.D. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also Berger, <em>The Deconstitutionalization of the Confrontation Clause: A Proposal for a Prosecutorial Restraint Model </em>(1992) 76 Minn.

Beginning around the year 1290, a group of officials appointed by the King of England \u201cbegan regularly to advise the king on the resolution of legal disputes which were of interest to the Crown. The Privy Council, as the group came to be called, also performed several other executive functions. By the mid-fourteenth century, when the Privy Council acted as a court, it sat in a room at Westminster ornamented with the king\u2019s star-shaped seal. The Council-as-tribunal came to be known as the Star Chamber.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Gecas </em>(11th Cir. 1997) 120 F.3d 1419, 1446, fn. omitted <em>(Gecas).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"AsV\">The Star Chamber helped to maintain the Crown\u2019s control over its enemies by adopting an inquisitorial system of criminal procedure\u2014forgoing the use of juries, dispensing with established criminal procedure, and relying upon unidentified accusers. (Berger, <em>supra, </em>76 Minn.L.Rev. 557; see also <em>In re Oliver </em>(1948) 333 U.S. 257, 269, fn. 22 [68 S.Ct. 499, 505, 92 L.Ed. 682] [\u201c[T]he accused himself was grilled in secret, often tortured, in an effort to obtain a confession . . . .\u201d]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Cojab </em>(2d Cir. 1993) 996 F.2d 1404, 1407 [\u201cA defendant\u2019s trial was based on charges made by persons whose identities were not disclosed, and he could be \u00bfxamined under torture, with the ultimate decision left to a court sitting without a jury.\u201d]; New Encyclopedia Britannica (15th ed. 1990) p. 218.)

The primary purpose of the confrontation clause ultimately set forth in the Sixth Amendment was to prevent the abuses that had occurred in England. <em>(Mattox v.

(See fn. 9, <em>ante.) </em>As noted, Justice White suggested that under proper circumstances such as a threat to the personal safety of a witness (an issue not addressed in <em>Smith), </em>the witness might be excused from answering questions that \u201ctend to endanger the personal safety of the witness\u201d without violating the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. <em>(Smith, supra, </em>390 U.S. at pp. 133-134 [88 S.Ct. at pp. 750-751]; see also Brennan, <em>The Criminal Prosecution: Sporting Event or Quest for Truth </em>(1963) 3 Wash. U. L.Q. 279, 292-295 [\u201cIn the rare case, the denial of all discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>may be compelled to protect the safety of witnesses or prevent apparent perversion of the judicial process.\u201d].) Justice White\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Smith </em>did not suggest, however, that the testimony of a crucial witness could be admitted while withholding his or her identity, when nondisclosure of the witness\u2019s identity would significantly impair the defendant\u2019s ability to investigate and cross-examine the witness. (See also <em>Siegfriedt v. Fair, supra, </em>982 F.2d 14, 17-18 [\u201c[T]he <em>Smith </em>standard has a core purpose: to prevent a criminal conviction based on the testimony of a witness who remains \u2018a mere shadow\u2019 in the defendant\u2019s mind. [Citation.] When that core purpose is not implicated, we see no reason for reflexively excluding otherwise admissible testimony . . . . flQ . . . Sometimes, as in <em>Smith </em>itself, a witness\u2019 use of a fictitious name will transform him into a wraith and thereby thwart the efficacy of cross-examination. Other times, the use of a fictitious name will be no more than a mere curiosity, possessing no constitutional significance.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)]; accord, <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Ricketts, supra, </em>958 F.2d 851, 854-855; <em>United States v. Ellis, supra, </em>468 F.2d 638, 639; <em>United States v. Palermo, supra, </em>410 F.2d 468, 472; <em>United States v. Twoomey, supra, </em>400 F.2d 400, 401; <em>State v.

Van Arsdall, supra, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679 [106 S.Ct. 1431, 1435] [cross-examination of the witness always is subject to a trial judge\u2019s broad discretion to impose reasonable limits on interrogation \u201cbased upon concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">Although they did not raise the issue in the trial court, the People now contend that even if the trial court\u2019s order authorizing permanent nondisclosure otherwise would be impermissible, defendants, by threatening certain witnesses, waived any constitutional right to obtain disclosure of the witnesses\u2019 identities. For a variety of reasons, we believe this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AEF\">First, there is no evidence in the record that links defendant Lopez to any threats, and thus even under the People\u2019s theory there is no basis for finding a waiver on his behalf. Second, although evidence was introduced at the in camera hearing, from which the defense was excluded, indicating that defendant Alvarado personally had threatened a witness, Alvarado had no opportunity to contest the evidence or litigate the issue, because the People did not otherwise raise the waiver theory in the trial court. All of the cases upon which the People rely in support of their waiver theory hold that a valid waiver cannot be found absent a full hearing on the point in question. (See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thai </em>(2d Cir. 1994) 29 F.3d 785, 814.)</p>\n<p id=\"AaJ\">Third, and finally, the trial court\u2019s finding that the safety of the witnesses would be endangered by disclosure of their identities was based upon the premise that the danger to the witnesses was posed by the Mexican Mafia, <em>not </em>by the individual defendants in this case. Under this circumstance, we do not believe that the denial of disclosure can be sustained on a waiver theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1191-11\">In so concluding, we should not be understood as precluding the trial court, as this case proceeds, from reassessing any question with regard to disclosure of the identities of these witnesses. Much may have happened in the considerable time that has elapsed since the trial court\u2019s order, or may happen between now and the time of trial, that may affect the necessity for a disclosure order. For example, the prosecution may choose not to present one or more of the witnesses, the witnesses may be unavailable, or the witnesses may choose voluntarily to disclose their names to defense counsel at a pretrial interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1191-12\">At oral argument, the People pointed out that during the past five years in Los Angeles County alone, the prosecution has filed special circumstance allegations stemming from the murder of witnesses in 25 cases, is investigating 1,600 cases of witness intimidation, and \u201ccan\u2019t get witnesses to come forward in over 1,000 gang murders. Why? Because we cannot protect them [the witnesses].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2hd\">The use of violence and intimidation by criminal gangs to immunize themselves from the criminal justice system is by no means a recent phenomenon. (See, e.g., Invasions of Privacy: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 89th Cong. 1st Sess., pt. 3, at p. 1157 (1965) [testimony of former United States Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach regarding acts perpetrated by organized crime].) For example, the Mexican Mafia, referenced throughout the findings made by the trial court in support of its nondisclosure order <em>(ante, </em>at pp. 1128-1129), has been described as one of the oldest prison gangs in the United States, dating back to 1957. (Lyman, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>Gangland: Drug Trafficking by Organized Criminals (1989) p. 53.) It is believed to exist in several states, with its membership estimated to be about 600 members. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 54.) In California, the Mexican Mafia has been characterized as \u201ca highly organized, well structured, and rather sophisticated organization . . . .\u201d (U.S. Dept. of Justice, Off. of Legal Policy, Prison Gangs, Their Extent, Nature and Impact on Prisons (1985) p. 97.)
