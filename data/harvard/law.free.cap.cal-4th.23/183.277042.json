Code, \u00a7 10851), that conviction of that offense might have the consequences of his being deported or barred from naturalizing to United States citizenship, but he was not advised the conviction might also result in his being excluded from admission to this country (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1016.5, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court permitted him to withdraw his 1992 plea, vacated the judgment of conviction and reset the matter for trial. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).) We conclude that the Court of Appeal, which summarily denied the People\u2019s petition for writ relief, thereby contravened the legislative intent underlying section 1016.5. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">On or about August 5, 1992, defendant was arrested and charged with the felony of unlawfully taking or driving a vehicle (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851) and with receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496). Petitioner filed a complaint in the Municipal Court for the County of San Joaquin, Stockton Judicial District (hereafter the 1992 prosecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">At defendant\u2019s arraignment the next day, the court advised him and others who were appearing: \u201cIf any of you are not United States citizens and you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>are convicted of a misdemeanor or a felony, it could be used to cause your deportation or to prevent your obtaining United States citizenship.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court did not advise defendant that, in the event he were deported or left the country, a conviction might have the further consequence of excluding him from readmission to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Approximately two weeks later, at the time set for the preliminary hearing, defendant, pursuant to a negotiated settlement, entered a plea of no contest to the vehicle-taking charge, whereupon the court dismissed the charge of receiving stolen property. During the plea colloquy, defendant expressly gave up various constitutional rights, including his right to trial by jury. As to immigration consequences, the court advised defendant: \u201cIf you\u2019re not a citizen of the United States, a plea of no contest can result in your deportation or in a refusal of naturalization, citizenship or amnesty at a later point in time.\u201d The court again failed to advise defendant that a conviction resulting from his plea might also result in his exclusion from admission to the United States. Defendant was sentenced to serve eight months in county jail and placed on five years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Just under five years later, in May 1997, defendant was arrested and charged in the same court with taking a vehicle (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851), driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152), and unlawful possession and transportation or sale of a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11377, 11379) (hereafter the 1997 prosecution). An order to show cause alleging defendant\u2019s violation of probation also was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">A settlement was negotiated encompassing both files, with defendant admitting a probation violation in the 1992 prosecution and pleading no contest to possession of a controlled substance and driving under the influence (with a prior) in the 1997 prosecution. The court gave defendant various advisements, including some relating to immigration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court sentenced him to two years in state prison on the probation violation, reducing the sentence with various credits to 90 days\u2019 actual time and granting defendant permission to remain in county jail pending his pregnant wife\u2019s giving birth. In consideration of defendant\u2019s pleading no contest to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>possession and driving under the influence (for which he was sentenced to no additional time and placed on informal probation) the remaining counts were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">In March 1998, defendant filed a section 1016.5 motion seeking to vacate his plea in the 1992 prosecution, alleging that he had been improperly advised about the possible immigration consequences. In support, defendant submitted his immigration attorney\u2019s sworn declaration (hereafter the Yun Declaration) that defendant\u2019s cumulative criminal convictions, including his convictions under Vehicle Code section 10851,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> created the possibility he would suffer adverse immigration consequences.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">At the hearing on the motion, the trial court denied petitioner\u2019s request to make an offer of proof and for an evidentiary hearing on the questions whether defendant would have pleaded no contest to vehicle taking in 1992 had he been properly advised, and when defendant acquired actual knowledge of the adverse immigration consequences of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The court also ruled on the validity of a subpoena duces tecum petitioner had served on the public defender for the contents of certain files relating to defendant. Determining that petitioner had a right to receive only that information in the public defender\u2019s files relating to the immigration issues raised by defendant\u2019s section 1016.5 motion, the court conducted an in camera review of the files to determine if they contained any such information. After conducting its review, the court ruled the files contained \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d relating to this case other than a showing that federal authorities had placed an immigration hold on defendant in connection with the 1997 prosecution, a fact with which, apparently, all present (including counsel for petitioner and defendant) were already familiar.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s section 1016.5 motion, reinstating the original complaint in the 1992 prosecution. Defendant was held to answer, and an information charging him with taking a vehicle and receiving stolen property was filed. Defendant\u2019s pleas of not guilty to both charges were taken and the matter set for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>We granted review when the Court of Appeal summarily denied petitioner\u2019s application for writ relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Section 1016.5 provides that \u201c[p]rior to acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere [no contest] to any offense punishable as a crime under state law, except offenses designated as infractions under state law, the court shall administer the following advisement on the record to the defendant: fl[] If you are not a citizen, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The statute also specifies a remedy for a trial court\u2019s failure to administer the mandated advisements. \u201cIf, after January 1, 1978, the court fails to advise the defendant as required by this section and the defendant shows that conviction of the offense to which defendant pleaded guilty or nolo contendere may have the consequences for the defendant of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States, the court, on defendant\u2019s motion, shall vacate the judgment and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and enter a plea of not guilty.\u201d (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">\u201cAbsent a record that the court provided the advisement required\u201d by section 1016.5, subdivision (a), the defendant is \u201cpresumed not to have received\u201d it. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).) In this case, however, no presumption is necessary. Defendant and petitioner agree that, both at the arraignment and at the time of plea in the 1992 prosecution, the trial court expressly advised defendant about possible consequences leading to deportation or affecting naturalization to citizenship, but did <em>not </em>advise him about the possible consequence of \u201cexclusion from admission to the United States\u201d (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (a)), as also required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>A. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Section 1016.5 Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">As noted, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s section 1016.5 motion, vacating his 1992 conviction for taking a vehicle. Quoting <em>People v. Gontiz </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1316 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 786], the court observed: \u201c \u2018The statute requires the court to warn the defendant expressly of each of the three distinct possible immigration consequences of his conviction[] prior to his plea.\u2019 I only advised him of two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">According to petitioner, the trial court committed several errors in granting defendant\u2019s section 1016.5 motion. We consider each of petitioner\u2019s contentions in turn, reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling for abuse of discretion. <em>{People v. Shaw </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 492, 495-496 [74 CaI.Rptr.2d 915]; see also \u00a7 1016.5, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">1. <em>Prejudice requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Petitioner first contends the trial court erred in granting defendant relief under section 1016.5 without requiring him to demonstrate he was prejudiced by the incomplete advisement he received at the time of his 1992 plea. Petitioner contends that, in order to prevail on his section 1016.5 motion, defendant must show not only that the trial court failed, at the time of that plea, to advise him as provided by the statute and that there exists, at the time of the motion, more than a remote possibility that his conviction will have one or more of the specified adverse immigration consequences (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (b)), but also that, properly advised, he would not have pleaded no contest in the first place. For the following reasons, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">a. <em>Statutory language</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Initially, \u201c[a]s in any case of statutory interpretation, our task is to determine afresh the intent of the Legislature by construing in context the language of the statute.\u201d <em>(Harris v. Capital Growth Investors XIV </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1142, 1159 [278 Cal.Rptr. 614, 805 P.2d 873].) In determining such intent, we begin with the language of the statute itself. <em>(Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 73 [276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373].) That is, we look first to the words the Legislature used, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning. (C<em>ity of Santa Cruz v. Municipal Court </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 74, 90 [260 Cal.Rptr. 520, 776 P.2d 222].) \u201cIf there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, \u2018then the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lennane v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 263, 268 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 563, 885 P.2d 976].) \u201cBut when the statutory language is ambiguous, \u2018the court may examine the context in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>which the language appears, adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Calvillo-Silva </em>v. <em>Home Grocery </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 714, 724 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 506, 968 P.2d 65].)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In construing a statute, we must also consider \u201c \u2018the object to be achieved and the evil to be prevented by the legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Horwich v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 272, 276 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 222, 980 P.2d 927].) And, wherever possible, \u201cwe will interpret a statute as consistent with applicable constitutional provisions, seeking to harmonize Constitution and statute.\u201d <em>(California Housing Finance Agency v. Elliott </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 575, 594 [131 Cal.Rptr. 361, 551 P.2d 1193], citing numerous authorities.)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">By its terms, section 1016.5 applies whenever, \u201cafter January 1, 1978, the court fails to advise the defendant as required\u201d and \u201cthe defendant shows that conviction of the offense . . . may have the consequences\u201d specified therein. (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (b).) In such circumstances, section 1016.5 provides that, \u201con defendant\u2019s motion,\u201d the court \u201cshall vacate the judgment and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and enter a plea of not guilty.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Section 1016.5 contains an express statement of the legislative intent underlying the statute. (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (d).) The Legislature was concerned about the \u201cmany instances involving an individual who is not a citizen of the United States charged with an offense punishable as a crime\u201d in which \u201ca plea of guilty or nolo contendere is entered without the defendant knowing that a conviction of such offense is grounds for deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cTherefore,\u201d the Legislature declared, section 1016.5 was enacted \u201cto promote fairness to such accused individuals by requiring in such cases that acceptance of a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere be preceded by an appropriate warning of the special consequences for such a defendant which may result from the plea.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Partly on the basis of section 1016.5, subdivision (d), some Courts of Appeal have expressly or impliedly engrafted onto section 1016.5 prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>or diligence requirements\u2014most commonly that the defendant was, in fact, ignorant of potential adverse immigration consequences, or that he would not have pleaded guilty had proper advisements been given. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Castaneda </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1612, 1617-1622 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 666]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Murillo </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1298, 1305 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 403]; <em>People v. Aguilera </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 128, 130-132 [208 Cal.Rptr. 418].)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Defendant suggests that the Legislature\u2019s use of \u201cshall vacate the judgment\u201d in section 1016.5, subdivision (b) renders the statute a per se rule of reversal, incompatible with a construction that requires defendants to demonstrate prejudice. We disagree. While \u201cthe word \u2018shall\u2019 in a statute is ordinarily deemed mandatory, and \u2018may\u2019 permissive\u201d <em>(California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1143 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 693, 899 P.2d 79]), \u201ca court may consider the consequences that would follow from a particular construction and will not readily imply an unreasonable legislative purpose\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1147). We conclude that defendant\u2019s proffered construction does not accord with the legislative purpose underlying section 1016.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Defendant correctly observes that section 1016.5, subdivision (b) expressly details only one proof requirement relating to the consequences of a court\u2019s failure to give the advisements required by section 1016.5, subdivision (a), i.e., that the defendant show that conviction of the offense to which he pleaded guilty or nolo contendere actually \u201cmay have\u201d one or more of the specified adverse immigration consequences. On the other hand, section 1016.5 contains no express reference to prejudice and thus is silent on the question whether such a requirement may be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Fortunately, \u201c \u2018we do not construe statutes in isolation, but rather read every statute \u201cwith reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Horwich </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 276.) Accordingly, in construing section 1016.5 with respect to prejudice, we may be guided by other provisions in the criminal law relating to that topic. (See, e.g., Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13 (hereafter article VI, section 13); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">b. <em>Article VI, section 13</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Article VI, section 13 provides, in its entirety: \u201cNo judgment shall be set aside, or new trial granted, in any cause, on the ground of misdirection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>jury, or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or for any error as to any matter of pleading, or for any error as to any matter of procedure, unless, after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In seeking review, petitioner suggested that the trial court, in granting defendant\u2019s section 1016.5 motion, had permitted the \u201cvacating of a judgment where there was no injustice,\u201d implicating article VI, section 13. Petitioner points out that failure to advise a defendant in compliance with section 1016.5 is not one of the few errors that have been found so fundamental as to be reversible per se despite article VI, section 13. Petitioner argues we must prefer a construction requiring section 1016.5 movants to demonstrate prejudice because a contrary construction would call into question the statute\u2019s constitutionality. (See <em>Palermo v. Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 53, 65 [195 P.2d 1] [court will not \u201creach out and unnecessarily pronounce upon the constitutionality of any duly enacted statute\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Defendant contends petitioner is precluded from relying on article VI, section 13 for the first time on appeal, not having invoked that constitutional provision in the trial court. Petitioner acknowledges having explicitly invoked article VI, section 13 for the first time in the Court of Appeal, but argues the invocation was not a change in legal theory, but rather, mere elucidation of one aspect of its trial court theory that section 1016.5 is subject to equitable defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">We need not determine whether petitioner\u2019s first express references to article VI, section 13 in fact echo earlier themes. Defendant\u2019s own authority on the \u201ctheory of trial\u201d doctrine notes its application is \u201cdiscretionary with the reviewing court\u201d and, in any event, subject to an exception for appellate reliance on a new theory \u201cwhere the issue is one of law alone.\u201d (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 406, p. 457; see also <em>id., </em>\u00a7 407, p. 459.) The exception applies here, as petitioner\u2019s theory indeed raises a purely legal issue, i.e., whether our construing section 1016.5 not to require a demonstration of prejudice might implicate article VI, section 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Substantively, defendant argues article VI, section 13 does not apply to a vacation of judgment under section 1016.5. As defendant points out, we long have recognized that \u201c[t]he amendment by which [former article VI, section <em>4V2, </em>predecessor to article VI, section 13] was added to the constitution was not \u2018designed to repeal or abrogate the guarantees accorded persons accused of crime by other parts of the same constitution, or to overthrow all statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>rules of procedure and evidence in criminal cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Hall </em>(1926) 199 Cal. 451, 458 [249 P. 859], quoting <em>People v. O\u2019Bryan </em>(1913) 165 Cal. 55, 65, 66 [130 P. 1042] [holding \u201cfinal test\u201d of \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d is \u201cthe opinion of the appellate court upon the result of the error,\u201d not whether error is constitutional].) From the first, defendant notes, in considering article VI, section 13 (and former art. VI, \u00a7 <em>41/2) </em>we have recognized \u201c[i]t is an essential part of justice that the question of guilt or innocence shall be determined by an orderly legal procedure, in which the substantial rights belonging to defendants shall be respected.\u201d <em>(People v. O\u2019Bryan, supra, </em>at p. 65.) The court\u2019s error in misadvising him, defendant argues, so compromised his substantial right to make an informed plea that it cannot be considered merely \u201cerror as to any matter of procedure\u201d within the meaning of the constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Petitioner concedes that article VI, section 13 does not encompass misadvisement under section 1016.5 as a \u201cmisdirection of the jury,\u201d an \u201cimproper admission or rejection of evidence\u201d or an \u201cerror as to any matter of pleading.\u201d Petitioner insists, however, that article VI, section 13 <em>does </em>encompass a trial court\u2019s failure to deliver full section 1016.5 advisements as an \u201cerror as to any matter of procedure\u201d because the law regards as procedural all \u201c \u2018those legal rules which direct the course of proceedings\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Williamson </em>(1933) 134 Cal.App. 775, 781 [26 P.2d 681]) without conferring substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">No court previously has considered whether a criminal defendant\u2019s right under section 1016.5 to receive from the court specified immigration advisements on the record is a \u201cmatter of procedure,\u201d error in the implementation of which is subject to article VI, section 13. Our previous pronouncements in an analogous situation, however, provide useful guidance.  We repeatedly have referred to the judicially declared rule compelling advisement of the direct consequences of a guilty plea as one of \u201ccriminal procedure.\u201d <em>(People v. Walker </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1013, 1022 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 902, 819 P.2d 861]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Barella </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 261, 266 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 248, 975 P.2d 37]; <em>People, </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 487, 495 [233 Cal.Rptr. 69, 729 P.2d 260].) Moreover, we have relied on article VI, section 13 in holding that \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s failure to comply with this judicial rule of criminal procedure requires reversal only if it is reasonably probable a result more favorable to the defendant would have been reached if he had been properly advised.\u201d <em>(People v. Wright, supra, </em>at p. 495, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">As noted, <em>People </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>cited by both parties, calls procedural \u201c \u2018those legal rules which direct the course of proceedings to bring parties into court, and the course of the court after they are brought in.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>Williamson, supra, </em>134 Cal-App. at pp. 781-782, quoting <em>Kring </em>v. <em>Missouri </em>(1882) 107 U.S. 221 [2 S.Ct. 443, 27 L.Ed. 506].)  On its face, section 1016.5\u2019s requirement that courts \u201cadminister [specified immigration advisements] on the record to the defendant\u201d (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (a)) before accepting a guilty or nolo contendere plea would seem to be such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Of course, the precise legal rule at issue\u2014that criminal defendants preparing to plead guilty or no contest be given specified immigration advisements\u2014is not primarily of judicial origin. Section 1016.5 confers important rights our Legislature accorded in \u201cfairness to . . . accused individuals\u201d (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (d)). But section 1016.5 rights are not substantive in the sense of flowing from \u201c \u2018the prerogative of the legislature to declare what . . . acts shall be unlawful\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1093, fn. 6 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 874, 824 P.2d 680], overruled on another point in <em>Green v. Ralee Engineering Co. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 66, 80, fn. 6 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046]). With all appropriate deference, we cannot derive, merely from the Legislature\u2019s reference to \u201cfairness\u201d in section 1016.5, subdivision (d), an intent that the procedural safeguards mandated thereby be regarded as \u201cessential element[s] of a fair trial or due process\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sarazzawski </em>(1945) 27 Cal.2d 7, 11 [161 P.2d 934]) so as to insulate any error in providing them from analysis, under article VI, section 13, as \u201cerror as to any matter of procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Furthermore, we are not-persuaded that defendant\u2019s rights under section 1016.5 are, by their nature, so important as to constitute an \u201cessential part of justice\u201d <em>(People v. O\u2019Bryan, supra, </em>165 Cal. at p. 65), any deprivation of which must be regarded as a miscarriage. Nor do we believe a trial court\u2019s failure to deliver complete section 1016.5 advisements ranks among \u201cthe kinds of errors that, regardless of the evidence, may result in a \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 because they operate to deny a criminal defendant ... a fair trial\u201d <em>(People v. Cahill </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 478, 501 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 582, 853 P.2d 1037]) as does, \u201cfor example, the denial of the defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial or to an impartial trial judge\u201d <em>(ibid.). </em>(See also <em>People v. Succop </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 785, 789-790 [63 Cal.Rptr. 569, 433 P.2d 473] [denial of hearing on temporary commitment constituted deprivation of substantial right]; <em>People v. Sarazzawski, supra, </em>27 Cal.2d at p. 18 [same re denial of reasonable opportunity to present new trial motion]; see generally 6 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1989) Reversible Error, \u00a7\u00a7 3303-3311, pp. 4084-4095 [discussing types of errors held per se reversible notwithstanding art. VI, \u00a7 13].)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Defendant relies heavily on <em>People v. Gontiz, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th 1309 <em>(Gontiz), </em>which held that section 1016.5 does not require a defendant moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>for relief thereunder to show prejudice, beyond that his conviction actually may have adverse immigration consequences. <em>(Gontiz, supra, </em>at p. 1317.) The <em>Gontiz </em>court, noting that section 1016.5, subdivision (b) contains no express reference to prejudice, opined the statute provides for mandatory vacation of judgment where a trial court fails to give the specified advisements, \u201climited only by the requirement that the movant be in danger of suffering those consequences.\u201d <em>(Gontiz, supra, </em>at p. 1311.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">As far as it goes, we do not find the reasoning of <em>Gontiz </em>entirely unpersuasive. But <em>Gontiz </em>did not consider whether section 1016.5 should be construed in order to avoid state constitutional infirmities, and \u201ccases are not authority for propositions not considered.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 475, 482, fn. 7 [82 Cal.Rptr. 724, 462 P.2d 580].) Obviously, the principle of construction invoked by the <em>Gontiz </em>court\u2014that a criminal statute\u2019s \u201cambiguity must be resolved in favor of the defendant\u201d <em>(Gontiz, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th at p. 1318)\u2014cannot take precedence over paramount constitutional considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Ultimately, we need not decide whether defendant\u2019s state statutory right to receive specified immigration advisements is \u201cconstitutionally qualified by the duty of California appellate courts to examine \u2018the entire cause\u2019 when any [\u2018error as to any matter of procedure\u2019] is alleged and to affirm the judgment absent a \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wims </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 293, 310 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 895 P.2d 77] [bracketed text quoting art. VI, \u00a7 13 added]), as defendant fails to adduce any authority suggesting the Legislature, when enacting section 1016.5, intended to depart from the normal rules, consonant with that constitutional provision, governing withdrawal of a plea for misadvisement regarding collateral consequences. Defendant does not dispute that immigration consequences, generally, are considered \u201ccollateral\u201d consequences of a criminal conviction. <em>(Gontiz, supra, </em>58 CaI.App.4th at p. 1311; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Limones </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 338, 344 [284 Cal.Rptr. 418].) As defendant\u2019s own authority acknowledges, \u201c[n]ormally a motion to vacate a plea based on misadvisement or omission of a collateral consequence requires the defendant to demonstrate that he would not have entered into the plea had he known of the consequence.\u201d <em>(Gontiz, supra, </em>at p. 1311, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at pp. 1022-1023.) We see no indication that the Legislature intended section 1016.5 to operate as an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">c. <em>Section 1404</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\"> On the other hand, for the entire period of section 1016.5\u2019s existence (and before), the Legislature has provided that no mistake or error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>in a proceeding mandated by the Penal Code renders the proceeding invalid, absent prejudice to the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. (\u00a7 1404.) Thus, section 1404 provides that: \u201cNeither a departure from the form or mode prescribed by this Code in respect to any pleading or proceeding, nor an error or mistake therein, renders it invalid, unless it has actually prejudiced the defendant, or tended to his prejudice, in respect to a substantial right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Enacted in its present form by the Legislature in 1872, section 1404 is derived from a provision that entered the code in 1851. (Stats. 1851, ch. 29, \u00a7 601, p. 279.) We long have held that section 1404 constitutes a legislative command that courts disregard technical errors in procedure unless they impact the substantial rights of defendants. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1132, 1164-1165 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 268, 824 P.2d 1315] [omissions in stenographic record]; <em>In re Etie </em>(1946) 27 Cal.2d 753, 757 [167 P.2d 203] [failure of parole revocation order to specify ground]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Durrant </em>(1897) 116 Cal. 179, 198 [48 P. 75] [peremptory challenge of juror].) Most recently, we cited section 1404 in concluding that a trial court\u2019s use of an inaccurately worded form for the jury to record its finding on a prior felony conviction allegation created no prejudicial defect in the finding. <em>(People v. Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 330-331 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374].)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">We do not presume that the Legislature intends, when it enacts a statute, to overthrow long-established principles of law unless such intention is clearly expressed or necessarily implied. <em>(Theodor </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 77, 92 [104 Cal.Rptr. 226, 501 P.2d 234].) Rather, we must assume that, when enacting section 1016.5, the Legislature was aware of existing related laws and intended to maintain a consistent body of rules. <em>{Fuentes v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 1, 7 [128 Cal.Rptr. 673, 547 P.2d 449].) There is no indication the Legislature enacted section 1016.5 in denigration of, or as an exception to, section 1404\u2019s general proviso that only those procedural errors that prejudice the defendant\u2019s substantial rights render the criminal proceeding invalid. Moreover, to afford relief for incomplete advisement under section 1016.5 only to defendants who demonstrate they were prejudiced thereby accords with the Legislature\u2019s expressly stated purpose of addressing \u201cinstances\u201d in which pleas are entered \u201cwithout the defendant knowing\u201d the immigration consequences. (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">For the foregoing reasons, and in order to avoid whatever constitutional infirmity a contrary construction might engender, we have no difficulty construing section 1016.5 to require that defendants, in order to obtain relief under subdivision (b) of the statute, demonstrate they were prejudiced by any failure of the court to provide complete advisements under subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>(a). Accordingly, when ruling on defendant\u2019s section 1016.5 motion, the trial court in this case erred in failing to consider, not only whether it formerly had failed to advise defendant as section 1016.5 requires and whether, as a consequence of his conviction on the offense to which he pleaded nolo contendere, defendant actually faces one or more of the statutorily specified immigration consequences, but also whether defendant was prejudiced by the court\u2019s having provided incomplete advisements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Although the order of the trial court must therefore be reversed, for the guidance of the trial court on remand we turn now to discussion of petitioner\u2019s other claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">2. <em>Evidentiary hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In granting defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court impliedly found that defendant had shown that conviction of the offense to which he pleaded nolo, contendere \u201cmay have the consequences for [him] of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States\u201d (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (b)). <em>(Watts </em>v. <em>Crawford </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 743, 762, fn. 15 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 81, 896 P.2d 807].) Petitioner contends that, at the hearing on the motion, the court improperly denied its request for a further evidentiary hearing on whether defendant faces such consequences and, if so, when defendant acquired knowledge that he faces them.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Neither in its written opposition nor at the hearing on the motion did petitioner dispute that defendant, in fact, faces potential adverse immigration consequences.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, it was petitioner who drew the court\u2019s attention to the fact the 1997 probation report on this case stated defendant \u201cwould be deported.\u201d Nevertheless, petitioner now contends the court should have permitted live testimony and cross-examination on whether and when defendant faced, and knew he faced, immigration risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Petitioner\u2019s argument necessarily is premised on the belief that the showing required of defendant under section 1016.5, subdivision (b) is a factual one. While defendant made a factual showing in the trial court, he took the position that his no contest plea subjected him, as a matter of law, to potential adverse immigration consequences and that, therefore, by citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>to the record of his plea and relevant immigration laws, he had carried his proof burdens under section 1016.5. (See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(B); <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I); see generally Kurzban\u2019s Immigration Law Sourcebook (Am. Immig. L. Found., 6th ed. 1998) pp. 52-53, 56.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Even assuming petitioner is correct that a factual showing is required, we are not persuaded the trial court abused its discretion in denying a further evidentiary hearing and ruling on the basis of the record before it, which included the parties\u2019 written submissions. \u201cThere is simply no authority for the proposition that a trial court necessarily abuses its discretion, in a motion proceeding, by resolving evidentiary conflicts without hearing live testimony.\u201d <em>(Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities Corp. </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 414 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 875, 926 P.2d 1061].)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Petitioner cites no authority specifically requiring courts to hold live evidentiary hearings on section 1016.5 motions or, more generally, on plea withdrawal motions. On the other hand, California law affords numerous examples of a trial court\u2019s authority, in ruling upon motions, to resolve evidentiary disputes without resorting to live testimony. (See, e.g., \u00a7 1050, subd. (b) [affidavits or declarations sufficient to support motion for continuance]; <em>People v. Cox </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 618, 697 [280 Cal.Rptr. 692, 809 P.2d 351] [whether to conduct live hearing on new trial motion alleging juror misconduct is within court\u2019s discretion]; <em>Garcia v. Superior Court </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 670, 681-682 [203 Cal.Rptr. 290] [evidentiary hearing on motion to disqualify trial judge not required]; <em>People v. Eastman </em>(1944) 67 Cal.App.2d 357, 359 [154 P.2d 37] [implying court properly could rule on motion to vacate judgment of conviction on affidavits only].)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we decline to burden trial courts with a requirement that they conduct live evidentiary hearings on all section 1016.5 motions. The trial court did not err in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">3. <em>Showing conviction \u201cmay </em>have\u201d <em>specified consequences</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Petitioner next contends that, to the extent it is based on the Yun Declaration, the trial court\u2019s implied factual finding that defendant actually faces adverse immigration consequences from his 1992 plea is insufficiently supported. Petitioner asserts the Yun Declaration is \u201cnearly entirely conclusory and devoid of facts.\u201d Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>502, 510 [106 Cal.Rptr. 324], petitioner argues the Yun Declaration is not competent evidence because it is inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Section 1016.5 itself is silent about what constitutes a sufficient showing under its subdivision (b). The only decisions directly to address the question simply recognize that, while section 1016.5, subdivision (b) \u201cimplies the need to show more than just a remote possibility of deportation, exclusion, or denial of naturalization\u201d <em>(People v. Shaw, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 499), \u201c \u2018where there is a sufficient showing on the record from the words of the court itself\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid., </em>quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>116 Cal.App. at p. 192), the defendant must be given an opportunity to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\"><em>People v. Williams, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.3d 502, upon which petitioner relies in attacking the Yun Declaration, is not apposite. In <em>Williams, </em>involving a hearing on a motion to dismiss criminal charges for dilatory prosecution, the Court of Appeal upheld a trial court\u2019s refusal to accept into evidence the defendant\u2019s declaration under penalty of perjury about his place of residence, noting the defendant had refused to take the stand and be subjected to cross-examination. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 510.) In <em>Williams, </em>it was the <em>defendant </em>who refused to answer material questions on cross-examination; accordingly, the trial court could properly exclude his sworn affidavit on his own behalf. Here, by contrast, the declaration is not that of a party who refused to answer questions at trial, but that of merely a witness (Attorney Yun) whose evidence relevant to a motion was taken by affidavit. (Accord, <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(Mo. 1977) 549 S.W.2d 336, 344.)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Ultimately, we need not pass on the admissibility of the Yun Declaration because the record before the trial court contained more than sufficient support, apart from that declaration, for the court\u2019s implied finding that defendant\u2019s conviction based on his 1992 plea might, as of the time the court was considering defendant\u2019s motion, actually have the consequences for him of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">As discussed, both in its written opposition to defendant\u2019s motion and at the hearing, petitioner impliedly conceded defendant faced \u201cimmigration problems.\u201d The trial court, moreover, possessed the record of defendant\u2019s criminal history, including his 1997 conviction, which, as a matter of law, in combination with his earlier convictions, put defendant at risk of adverse immigration consequences, including exclusion from admission to the United States for having committed crimes of moral turpitude. (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(B); <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I); see <em>Matter of Serna </em>(1992) 20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 579 [1992 WL 301779]; <em>Matter of M. </em>(1948) 3 I. &amp; N. Dec. 272 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>[1948 WL 6270].) The record also reveals that the trial court possessed documentary evidence that a border patrol hold had been placed on defendant by federal immigration authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">We conclude that defendant, in moving to vacate his 1992 conviction under section 1016.5, showed that, at the time of the motion, he faced \u201cmore than just a remote possibility of deportation, exclusion, or denial of naturalization\u201d (Pe<em>ople </em>v. <em>Shaw, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 499). Therefore, the trial court\u2019s implied finding that \u201cconviction of the offense to which defendant pleaded . . . nolo contendere may have the consequences for the defendant\u201d specified in the statute (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (b)) was adequately supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">4. <em>Diligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Petitioner next contends the trial court should have denied defendant\u2019s section 1016.5 motion on the ground he delayed, without excuse, in bringing it. As petitioner has emphasized, however, no record evidence pinpoints when defendant first knew that he risked actual \u201cexclusion from admission to the United States\u201d (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (b)). Defendant takes the position that precisely when he acquired such knowledge is irrelevant under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Pursuant to a judicially declared rule of criminal procedure, a defendant\u2019s right to complain he was not advised of the collateral consequences of a guilty plea is waived absent a timely objection. <em>{People v. Walker, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at pp. 1022, 1023.) More specifically, \u201cwhen the only error is a failure to advise of the [collateral] consequences of the plea, the error is waived if not raised at or before sentencing.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1023.) As we recognized in <em>In re Moser </em>(1993) 6 CalAth 342 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 723, 862 P.2d 723], however, that procedural bar does not apply where the defendant has no reason to question the accuracy of the trial court\u2019s advisement. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 352-353, fn. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">We are not persuaded the trial court was required to deny defendant\u2019s section 1016.5 motion as untimely. The trial court sentenced defendant on his 1992 vehicle-taking conviction at the same hearing (indeed, in almost the same breath) at which it delivered the defective plea advisements. Thus, unlike <em>Walker </em>and as in <em>Moser, </em>this case \u201cdoes not involve a trial court\u2019s imposition at the sentencing hearing of a sentence at variance with the advice given at the earlier plea proceeding\u201d; it is not, therefore, \u201ca situation in which a defendant reasonably may be required to bring the discrepancy to the court\u2019s attention by a timely objection at the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>(In re Moser, supra, </em>6 CalAth at p. 352, fn. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">The authority petitioner cites, <em>People v. Castaneda, supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th 1612, stands at most for the proposition that a postjudgment motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>change a plea must be made with \u201creasonable diligence\u201d <em>{id. </em>at p. 1619). Absent evidence that defendant long ago had cause to question the accuracy of the trial court\u2019s 1992 immigration advisements, to hold he should have objected to them earlier would be unfair. This conclusion accords with the plain language of section 1016.5, which contains no time bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">To the extent petitioner relies on the affirmative defense of laches or its equivalent, the burden is petitioner\u2019s to prove the facts comprising that defense. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 500; see also <em>Miller v. Eisenhower Medical Center </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 614, 624 [166 Cal.Rptr. 826, 614 P.2d 258].) Petitioner states there is \u201cno indication as to when defendant became aware of possible immigration problems,\u201d suggesting only that \u201cpresumably he knew in 1990\u201d because he received some immigration advisements that year, in another case. We see no significance for present purposes in defendant\u2019s having received some immigration advisements in 1990. The mandated advisement refers to \u201cthe offense for which you have been charged\u201d (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (a)) and no other. Defendant cannot in 1990 have been advised\u2014adequately or otherwise\u2014about the possible consequences of a no contest plea he would enter in 1992 to criminal charges brought against him that same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Petitioner notes also that defendant, when pleading in 1992, was advised about some of the adverse immigration consequences his plea might have, specifically, that his conviction \u201ccould be used\u201d to cause his deportation or prevent his obtaining United States citizenship. But advising a defendant that a no contest plea may in the abstract have immigration consequences, cannot be taken as placing him on notice that, owing to his particular circumstances, he faces an actual risk of suffering such. Were it so, the <em>second </em>of section 1016.5, subdivision (b)\u2019s express required showings, i.e., that the conviction \u201cmay have the consequences\u201d specified, would be superfluous. Put another way, that relief under section 1016.5 is predicated upon a defendant\u2019s demonstrating his conviction \u201cmay have\u201d one or more of the specified consequences implies that such a motion is timely if brought within a reasonable time after the conviction actually \u201cmay have\u201d such consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">As petitioner points out, the record indicates defendant was concerned that adverse immigration consequences might follow his 1997 conviction. Defendant\u2019s concern then was well founded, as in 1997 he stood convicted of multiple criminal offenses, including a drug offense, and, as a consequence, was at risk both for deportation (see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)) and exclusion from readmission (see <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)). (Indeed, as the trial court noted, the public defender\u2019s files on the 1997 case indicate federal authorities had placed an immigration hold on defendant.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">A similar level of concern on defendant\u2019s part in the period following the 1992 prosecution would not have been as well founded. Deportation can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>instituted only \u201cupon the order of the Attorney General\u201d (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)) of the United States, who retains discretion not to institute such proceedings. (See <em>United States v. Santelises </em>(2d Cir. 1973) 476 F.2d 787, 790, citing prior statute.) The trial court\u2019s examination of the public defender\u2019s files in the 1992 case revealed no immigration hold or other relevant federal activity such as was found in the 1997 files.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Moreover, the record reveals that in 1992 defendant stood convicted, cumulatively, of at most one misdemeanor violation of Vehicle Code section 10851 (in 1990)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and one felony violation of the same statute (in 1992), receiving for the latter a sentence of five years\u2019 probation and eight months in jail. While it is possible defendant was at that point technically subject to deportation or exclusion for being \u201cconvicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude\u201d (former 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 125l(a)(2)(A)(ii) (Westlaw Historical U.S.C.A. 1992) [deportation]; see also 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) [inadmissibility or exclusion]), that in 1992 defendant faced more than a remote possibility of adverse immigration consequences seems unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">First, it is doubtful federal authorities would have regarded defendant\u2019s 1990 plea to misdemeanor vehicle-taking as involving a crime of moral turpitude for immigration purposes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Then, as now, Vehicle Code section 10851 could be violated by taking a vehicle \u201cwith intent either to permanently <em>or </em>temporarily deprive the owner thereof of his or her title to or possession of the vehicle, whether with or without intent to steal the vehicle.\u201d (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851, subd. (a), italics added.) Thus, \u201con its face Vehicle Code section 10851 can be violated either by taking a vehicle with the intent to steal it or by driving it with the intent only to temporarily deprive its owner of possession (i.e., joyriding).\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 846, 851 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 279, 984 P.2d 486].) Accordingly, \u201c[a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>conviction under such statute ha[d] been found insufficient to establish theft for purposes of the [Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq.].\u201d (Brady et al., Cal. Criminal Law and Immigration, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.8, p. 4-21, citing <em>Matter ofT., </em>(1944) 2 I. &amp; N. Dec. 22 [1944 WL 5154]; <em>Matter of M., </em>(1946) 21. &amp; N. Dec. 686 [1946 WL 6077]; see also Brady et al., Cal. Criminal Law and Immigration, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 4.10, p. 4-24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Second, even assuming federal immigration authorities would have regarded defendant\u2019s 1992 plea to felony vehicle-taking as involving a crime of moral turpitude, the conviction on the plea would not have constituted grounds for deportation, as defendant\u2019s actual confinement thereon, eight months, was so short. (See generally Kurzban\u2019s Immigration Law Source-book, <em>supra, </em>at p. 110.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Most significantly, even if defendant was, in 1992, subject to deportation, he would not necessarily also have been subject to exclusion from readmission. (See 8 U.S.C. (supp. IV, 1993) \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii); <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In sum, as petitioner pointed out in the trial court, from the perspective of immigration consequences, defendant\u2019s criminal record was worse in 1997 than it was in 1992 and, therefore, more likely to engender adverse immigration consequences. Moreover, under the immigration law as it existed in earlier years, greater remedies would have been available to defendant in 1992 than were available in 1997. For example, even if it were found to entail moral turpitude, defendant\u2019s misdemeanor vehicle-taking conviction (based on the 1990 plea) might have been subject to a judicial recommendation-against-deportation order (signed before Nov. 29, 1990), which would have required federal authorities to withhold immigration penalties based on that conviction. And if defendant had been placed in deportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997, he might have qualified for a waiver applicable to criminal deportation grounds that Congress that year greatly narrowed. (See Brady et al., Cal. Criminal Law and Immigration, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.7, pp. 4-16 to 4-17; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 11.10, pp. 11-38 to 11-39.) By 1997, the immigration laws, generally, had become much more severe. (See, e.g., Holding, <em>Heavy-Handed INS Agents, Legal immigrants are being arrested for minor crimes, </em>S.F. Chronicle (Sept. 19, 1999) p. 2; Kravets, <em>Challenge to Pleas Entailing Deportation, </em>S.F. Daily J. (Mar. 6, 2000) p. 1 [under stricter retroactive 1996 immigration law, even misadvised criminal aliens who have completed sentences often move to vacate pleas because of unforeseeable immigration consequences].)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In view of his family\u2019s presence here (and the United States citizenship status of any of his children bom in this country), defendant understandably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>may have viewed exclusion, about which he was <em>not </em>advised, rather than deportation or denial of naturalization, as the most serious for him among section 1016.5\u2019s specified immigration consequences; indeed, perhaps as the only one that could affect his calculations regarding the advisability of pleading no contest to the 1992 vehicle-taking charges. Defendant was warned about deportation, but, as noted, deportation does not necessarily preclude legal reentry. And, partly because he was not accurately advised in 1992, defendant reasonably may not have been aware, until the immigration hold revealed in the 1997 case file, that one consequence of the 1992 conviction could be to place him at risk, especially if other convictions followed, of being excluded from readmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Shortly after he was convicted in the 1997 prosecution, on March 10, 1998, defendant moved to vacate both the 1992 and 1997 pleas. For the reasons stated, petitioner fails to persuade us defendant delayed unreasonably in bringing his section 1016.5 motion. Accordingly, we cannot conclude the trial court erred in failing to deny the motion on timeliness grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">5. <em>Substantial compliance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Petitioner contends that the trial court erred in failing to deny defendant\u2019s section 1016.5 motion on the ground the immigration advisements defendant received in the 1992 prosecution were in substantial compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Notwithstanding that section 1016.5 expressly provides that, under specified circumstances, \u201cthe court shall administer the following advisement\u201d (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (a)) and then details a specific, tripartite, form of advisement (i<em>bid.), </em>some Courts of Appeal have held that \u201c[t]he exact language of the advisement is not crucial\u201d <em>(People v. Limones, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 345 [dictum]; <em>People v. Soriano </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 1470, 1475 [240 CaLRptr. 328, 65 A.L.R.4th 705] [dictum]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barocio </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 99, 105 [264 Cal.Rptr. 573] [without analysis, citing <em>People v. Soriano, supra]). </em>The issue here, however, is not whether the advisements defendant received were sufficiently exact. Rather, defendant complains because, at the critical juncture, the mandated advisement respecting possible \u201cexclusion from admission to the United States\u201d (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (a)) was entirely omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Section 1016.5 incorporates several distinct terms of art from immigration law. \u201cDeportation is the removal or sending back of an alien to the country from which he or she has come . . . .\u201d (Roseman, <em>The Alien and the Guilty Plea: Caveat to the Defense </em>(1984) 12 W. St. U. L.Rev. 155, 163.) \u201cExclusion\u201d is \u201cbeing barred from entry to the United States.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 165, fn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>omitted.) \u201cNaturalization\u201d is a process by which an eligible alien, through petition to appropriate authorities, can become a citizen of the United States. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 167-168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Petitioner asserts that defendant\u2019s having been advised of possible deportation consequences effectively warned him that any reentry would result in removal, which petitioner asserts is the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of exclusion. Aliens subject to deportation, however, are not automatically or indefinitely subject also to exclusion. An alien in the United States becomes subject to exclusion only if actually deported; some deportable persons who agree to depart the United States at their own expense may have available a voluntary departure remedy not entailing exclusion from reentry. (See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(a).) Moreover, some deported persons are barred from reentry only for a period of years, the length of which may vary depending on the circumstances. (See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(i) &amp; (ii); see generally Kurzban\u2019s Immigration Law Sourcebook, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 57-58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Nevertheless, if defendant\u2019s circumstances at the time of his 1992 plea did not, in fact, allow for the possibility of his subsequent exclusion from the United States in the event he were deported, the advisements he received concerning deportation and naturalization would have been in substantial compliance with the requirements of section 1016.5, in that they would have informed defendant of the only consequences pertinent to his situation. Because the record does not disclose whether defendant would have been eligible for readmission, we are unable to conclude that the trial court erred in failing to deny defendant\u2019s motion on grounds of substantial compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">6. <em>Subsequent advisement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Finally, petitioner argues that any harm caused by the trial court\u2019s 1992 misadvisements was corrected when defendant, in the course of the 1997 prosecution, signed an accurate plea and waiver form stating he had violated his 1992 probation. Without authority, petitioner asserts that the 1997 form \u201ccorrects, nunc pro tunc,\u201d any error in the original advisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Petitioner\u2019s retroactive-correction theory cannot be reconciled with section 1016.5 itself. It was the intent of the Legislature in enacting section 1016.5 to promote fairness to criminally accused noncitizens \u201cby requiring in such cases that acceptance of a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere be <em>preceded </em>by an appropriate warning of the special consequences for such a defendant which may result from the plea.\u201d (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (d), italics added.) This purpose logically cannot be served and, in fact, would be thwarted, by a rule permitting after-the-fact warnings. Such a rule also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>would undermine the Legislature\u2019s expressed intention \u201cthat the court in such cases shall grant the defendant a reasonable amount of time to negotiate with the prosecuting agency in the event the defendant or the defendant\u2019s counsel was unaware of the possibility of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization as a result of conviction.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Obviously, advisements at the time of a subsequent probation violation would not afford a defendant an opportunity to negotiate the terms of his <em>original </em>conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Most fundamentally, as discussed, our Legislature expressly sought to address in section 1016.5 the problem of a defendant\u2019s entering a plea of guilty or nolo contendere without knowing about its potential adverse immigration consequences. (\u00a7 1016.5, subd. (d).) The evil targeted, thus, is not simply a defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge, but his or her lack of knowledge at a specified critical juncture. Such an evil cannot be corrected by provision of the required information after the critical juncture has passed. (Cf. <em>In re Martinez </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 808, 814 [345 P.2d 449] [advisement of right to counsel meant to ensure defendant is aware \u201cat the time he pleads guilty\u201d].) To conclude otherwise would undermine any prophylactic effect the statute might have.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Hence, the trial court did not err in rejecting petitioner\u2019s theory of subsequent correction of the partial advisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">B. <em>Prejudice Inquiry on Remand</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Since we have concluded that the trial court erred in failing to require that defendant demonstrate prejudice in connection with his section 1016.5 motion (see <em>ante, </em>at pp. 192-200), we must address defendant\u2019s contention that we should affirm the decision of the Court of Appeal because the record before us demonstrates he was, indeed, prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to deliver complete section 1016.5 advisements. Defendant asserts he would not in 1992 have pleaded no contest to vehicle theft had the court fully advised him of the plea\u2019s potential immigration consequences, including the possibility of his being excluded from admission to the United States. As defendant points out, a deported alien who cannot return \u201closes his job, his friends, his home, and maybe even his children, who must choose between their [parent] and their native country\u201d <em>(Galvan v. Press </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 522, 533 [74 S.Ct. 737, 744, 98 L.Ed. 911] (dis. opn. of Black, J.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Petitioner maintains the record does not demonstrate defendant was prejudiced, because defendant may have had actual knowledge of the relevant immigration consequences when, in 1992, he entered the plea at issue. To that extent, petitioner argues, defendant cannot now claim he would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>pleaded differently if he had been advised differently. As previously discussed, the trial court, in ruling on defendant\u2019s 1016.5 motion, did not consider evidence relating to the state of defendant\u2019s knowledge at the time he entered his plea. Petitioner asserts there was a \u201cvery strong prosecution case\u201d on the vehicle-taking and receiving stolen property charges and notes defendant received a sentence of probation and eight months in jail. According to petitioner, on such facts it \u201cseems virtually assured\u201d that defendant would have pleaded no contest even if he had been properly advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Whether defendant was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s incomplete advisements is a factual question, appropriate for decision by the trial court in the first instance. (See <em>Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 190, fn. 13 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527]; <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 816, 850 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 823 P.2d 1216].) In making that determination, the trial court should be guided by this opinion and our previous pronouncements. For prejudice from the erroneous application of a state procedural requirement, \u201cthe test generally applicable may be stated as follows: That ... the court, \u2018after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence,\u2019 is of the \u2018opinion\u2019 that it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u201d <em>(People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) Thus, \u201cwhen the only error is a failure to advisd of the consequences of the plea ... the sentencing court must determine whether the error prejudiced the defendant, i.e., whether it is \u2018reasonably probable\u2019 the defendant would not have pleaded guilty if properly advised.\u201d <em>(People v. Walker, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1023; see generally <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Giron) </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 793 [114 Cal.Rptr. 596, 523 P.2d 636].)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">It follows from the foregoing that the Court of Appeal should not have denied petitioner\u2019s application for writ relief on the ground that the trial court was not required to determine whether defendant had suffered prejudice in ruling on his section 1016.5 motion. In ruling summarily, however, the Court of Appeal did not reveal the grounds of its denial. Accordingly, we shall remand the cause in order that the Court of Appeal may consider any alternative grounds timely raised by defendant, such as whether the trial court\u2019s order may have been appealable.

Indeed, he is subject to, inter alia, deportation as a result of (1) the conviction for the narcotics offense, (2) convictions for multiple offenses involving moral turpitude (both the vehicle theft and the narcotics offenses are deemed to be offenses involving moral turpitude for purposes of the immigration law), and/or (3) the conviction for the drunk driving offense, since he has a prior drunk driving conviction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Almost a year after we granted review, defendant filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss,\u201d suggesting that, as petitioner could have appealed the trial court\u2019s order vacating the judgment of conviction, writ review is not available. Even were defendant technically correct that petitioner may be denied writ relief on appealability grounds, he would have articulated at best an argument supporting the result he actually obtained in the Court of Appeal, not an argument suggesting we improvidently granted review of that decision. We granted review because it appeared \u201cnecessary to secure uniformity of decision or the settlement of important questions of law\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 29(a)), and nothing in defendant\u2019s dismissal motion undermines that determination.

Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature ... to promote fairness to such accused individuals by requiring [compliance with section 1016.5].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The language \u201cwithout the defendant knowing\u201d and \u201csuch accused individuals\u201d in subdivision (d) of section 1016.5 permits a conclusion that an individual seeking to vacate a guilty or no contest plea must show a lack of knowledge of one or more of the three immigration or nationality consequences of that plea. \u201cSection 1016.5 recognizes that noncitizens sometimes unknowingly expose themselves to [such] adverse . . . consequences by entering pleas.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Murillo </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1298, 1305 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 403].) That is the danger that the statute is designed to protect against, and if a defendant does know of each enumerated consequence, failing to advise him or her of them is harmless error. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Castaneda </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1612, 1620 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 666].)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">But the majority engraft another requirement onto section 1016.5, concluding that the convicted criminal must also show that he or she would not have pleaded guilty or no contest. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">There is nothing in the language of section 1016.5 that may be read to impose such a requirement. The majority do not state otherwise. Rather, they find authority for it in Penal Code section 1404 (section 1404).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Section 1404 provides: \u201cNeither a departure from the form or mode prescribed by this Code in respect to any pleading or proceeding, nor an error or mistake therein, renders it invalid, unless it has actually prejudiced the defendant, or tended to his prejudice, in respect to a substantial.right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">In the case of section 1016.5, however, the Legislature has specified that it does implicate a substantial right when a noncitizen defendant who does not know about the possible consequences pleads guilty or no contest without being advised of the possibility of deportation, later exclusion, or bar to naturalization. Section 1404, therefore, is without effect on section 1016.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The majority state that an immigration consequence is a collateral matter in a criminal proceeding and that section 1404 \u201cconstitutes a legislative command that courts disregard technical errors.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 199.) There is, however, nothing necessarily collateral or technical about deportation, exclusion, or loss of the opportunity to obtain United States citizenship. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The Legislature was trying to avoid a situation in which, based on imperfect information, a defendant could be banished from the United States and quite possibly separated from his family for life. The United States Supreme Court has noted the severity of such a consequence. Deportation \u201cmay result. . . in loss of both property and life; or of all that makes life worth living.\u201d <em>(Ng Fung Ho v. White </em>(1922) 259 U.S. 276, 284 [42 S.Ct. 492, 495, 66 L.Ed. 938].) \u201cTo banish [noncitizens] from home, family, and adopted country is punishment of the most drastic kind whether done at the time when they were convicted or later.\u201d <em>(Lehmann </em>v. <em>Carson </em>(1957) 353 U.S. 685, 691 [77 S.Ct. 1022, 1025, 1 L.Ed.2d 1122] (cone. opn. of Black, J.).) \u201c \u2018Denaturalization consequences [including possible deportation and exclusion] may be more grave than consequences that flow from conviction for crimes. . . . [T]o deprive a person of his American citizenship is an extraordinarily severe penalty. The consequences of such a deprivation may even rest heavily upon his children.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kungys </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1988) 485 U.S. 759, 792 [108 S.Ct. 1537, 1557, 99 L.Ed.2d 839] (cone. opn. of Stevens, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">It is also important to understand that a proper advisement must refer to all three immigration and nationality consequences. With regard to immigration consequences, exclusion and deportation are different consequences of a criminal conviction. \u201cThe differences between proceedings of exclusion and those of deportation are significant.\u201d <em>(Maldonado-Sandoval v. United States I. &amp; N. Serv. </em>(9th Cir. 1975) 518 F.2d 278, 280 <em>(per curiam).) </em>The rights accorded to the alien in each are quite different. <em>(Leng May Ma </em>v. <em>Barber </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 185, 187 [78 S.Ct. 1072, 1073-1074, 2 L.Ed.2d 1246].) It is beyond the scope of this discussion to outline the differences\u2014they are many, subtle, and complicated\u2014but for an overview, one need only compare 8 United States Code section 1182(a)(2), with <em>id., </em>section 1227(a)(2). The only point to be made here is that the Legislature was wise to require separate warnings about exclusion and deportation. Section 1016.5\u2019s requirements are well grounded in title 8 of the United States Code, and the courts should adhere carefully to the Legislature\u2019s requirement that a defendant be aware of each possible adverse consequence to a noncitizen following entry of a guilty plea.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, and on the basis of the record before us, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeal summarily denying the writ petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Kennard, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">On July 12, 2000, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The majority also discuss, in what I perceive to be a dictum, article VI, section 13 of the California Constitution. Contrary to anything that may be said or implied in parts of that discussion, I believe that the constitutional provision bars only a <em>reviewing court </em>from reversing a judgment when there has been no prejudicial error. <em>(Mitchell v. Gonzales </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1041, 1054 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 913, 819 P.2d 872]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 834-836 [299 P.2d 243]; <em>Herbert v. Lankershim </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 409, 476-477 [71 P.2d 220]; <em>Copley </em>v. <em>Putter </em>(1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 453, 456 [207 P.2d 876].) \u201c[T]he final test is the \u2018opinion\u2019 of the reviewing court.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 835.) I have found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>no authority for the suggestion that the constitutional provision prevents <em>the Legislature </em>from imposing a particular remedy for a particular trial court error.</p>\n<p id=\"APR\">Moreover, even if article VI, section 13 did apply to legislated remedies, I am not persuaded that the error is procedural in nature and hence covered by the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"APn\">And even if the constitutional provision applied to legislated remedies and the error were procedural in nature, it would appear, from the text of section 1016.5, that the Legislature has determined that it would be a miscarriage of justice for the erroneously entered plea to stand if the result is possible banishment from the United States.
