Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the attempted premeditated murder of Rodney Almond (\u00a7\u00a7664, 187, subd. (a), 189), first degree robbery (\u00a7211), conspiracy to commit robbery (\u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1)), and residential burglary (\u00a7 459). The jury also found that defendant and Flores had personally used a deadly weapon in the robbery and burglary, and in the murders of April Gilhousen and Kevin Chandler (\u00a7 12022), and that defendant had personally used a deadly weapon and inflicted great bodily injury in the attempted murder of Almond (\u00a7\u00a7 12022, 12022.7). The jury further found true as to defendant the special circumstance allegations of murder during the commission of robbery and burglary, and multiple murder. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3), (17)(A), (17)(G).) Defendant was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">The case is before us on defendant\u2019s automatic appeal. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 11; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1239, subd. (b).) For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-8\">A. <em>Guilt Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1213-9\">1. <em>Prosecution Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1213-10\">On August 9, 1989, April Gilhousen, her flane\u00e9, Michael Ross, and their two children, Bryan and Aspen, resided at 4341 Clairemont Mesa Boulevard, San Diego. Also residing temporarily at the house was a friend, Kevin Chandler. Flores lived nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-11\">On August 9, 1989, between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m., Ross left for work. At that time, his children and Chandler were sleeping. Bryan was celebrating his third birthday that day. April had purchased a bicycle for him, but assembly was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-12\">Approximately 3:00 p.m., Randi Renken, a friend of April\u2019s, and another woman arrived at the Gilhousen residence. Entering through the unlocked front door, Renken discovered a broken telephone in the living room, a disassembled bicycle in the kitchen, and April\u2019s body in her bedroom. She-notified authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>April died as a result of blunt head injuries and a stab wound that completely penetrated her heart. Either injury would have been fatal. Her ear was nearly ripped in half, her forehead split open and skull fractured, and a pattern abrasion appeared on her forearm, cheek, and neck. There were defensive injuries on her arm and hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">Bryan\u2019s blanket-wrapped body had been discovered that morning in a carport. He died as a result of asphyxia by strangulation with a contributing factor of blunt head injuries. His collarbone was broken. His face was congested or plethoric. The entire left side of the head was bruised as a result of an impact that crushed the tissues and caused bleeding. He suffered abrasions and bruises about the face, head, upper torso, arms, and legs, and there were numerous small abrasions and bruises around the neck, mouth, and nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">Kevin Chandler\u2019s blanket-wrapped body was also discovered, in a different carport, at approximately 10:45 a.m. on August 9. His skull was crushed and he had a deep incised throat wound that severed his trachea. Either injury would have been fatal. There were no defensive or postmortem injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">Four-month-old Aspen was found by a responding firefighter, lying unharmed on the floor by April\u2019s bedroom door. Bryan\u2019s bedroom window was broken. April\u2019s purse and the living room couch, in which drug proceeds were kept, contained no currency. Also missing were a pound of marijuana, a baseball bat, and a butcher knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">Defendant and Flores had previously visited the Gilhousen residence. On one occasion, Jason De Blasio accompanied defendant to the residence. He waited outside for defendant and entered the residence when he grew impatient. Defendant was sitting with April in the living room. As De Blasio entered the room, the conversation stopped and defendant picked up a plastic baggie containing a white rock-candy-like substance and put it in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">On another occasion several days before the murders, defendant and Flores visited April together. Randi Renken overheard defendant and April discussing the purchase of a pound of marijuana. April told defendant she had picked up her pot and had obtained a pound for him as well, and that when defendant had the money, all he had to do was come over and get it. April also mentioned she had made $1,200 during the past few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-10\">On the Sunday before the murders, Flores told Marcus Boykin about a woman across the street who had a pound of marijuana, and that he and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>defendant were going to try to make a deal. According to Flores, defendant had been to the house before, had seen the marijuana in a bag, and knew where it was located in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">Just before 8:00 a.m. on August 9, Flores\u2019s mother was waiting at a bus stop, and saw defendant and Flores drive by in defendant\u2019s Chevrolet S-10 Blazer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">Between 8:30 and 8:50 a.m., Rodney Almond (also known as Rodney Nicholson) arrived at the Gilhousen residence. After parking his car in an alley behind the house, Almond approached the open back door. He heard a slamming sound. Flores brushed past Almond. Almond stared at Flores, and then turned to see defendant coming out of the doorway with a baseball bat raised over his head. Defendant swung at Almond\u2019s head; Almond blocked the blow with his left arm. Defendant swung again striking Almond\u2019s left shoulder. Almond ran out onto the middle of Clairemont Mesa Boulevard with defendant in close pursuit; this chase was witnessed by two passersby. One of these witnesses saw a person whose physical description matched that of defendant return to the Gilhousen residence. This witness also saw a person whose physical description was consistent with Flores wave the person who looked like defendant inside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">Almond ran into a Thrifty gas station and took refuge in a back room. He declined offers to call the police, was asked to leave, and obtained a ride from a stranger to his friend Dennis Burns\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-8\">Shortly after 9:00 a.m-., Flores\u2019s younger sister Yvonne, accompanied by a friend, encountered Flores outside a nearby Von\u2019s store. Flores was driving defendant\u2019s Blazer. Brief pleasantries were exchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-9\">Michael Schwanbeck, who resided next door to the Gilhousens, came out of his residence on his way to work about 8:50 to 8:55 a.m. Schwanbeck saw two men whose physical descriptions were consistent with that of defendant and Flores outside the Gilhousen residence carrying a rolled up comforter. He was struck by the fact that it required two men to carry \u201csomething that looked so light as that.\u201d The two men approached a blue Blazer parked behind the Gilhousen residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-10\">Approximately 9:30 a.m., Randi Renken telephoned April. An unfamiliar male voice answered the telephone and then hung up. Calling back a second time, Renken again spoke with the unidentified male.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-11\">About 10:00 a.m., Almond, Bums, and David Samples returned to the alley behind the Gilhousen house to recover Almond\u2019s car. Shortly after they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>arrived, defendant and Flores appeared. Burns, who was armed with a shotgun, and Almond confronted them. Defendant apologized, and drove with Almond to a nearby 7-Eleven store. While in the car, defendant told Almond there had been an accident and April had been killed. Defendant appeared to have a large sum of money, and gave Almond a $100 bill to pay for an X-ray.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">On August 10, 1989, defendant and Flores were apprehended. Police recovered $1,105 from defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Jeane Harkleroad. Defendant gave her the money late in the evening on August 9. Sometime between August 9 and the time he was arrested on August 10, defendant told Harkleroad he had a large quantity of marijuana. A search of Flores\u2019s bedroom revealed $600 wrapped in a plastic bag hidden beneath the carpet, and another $600 inside a backpack identified as belonging to Flores.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">2. <em>Defendant\u2019s Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">The defense consisted primarily of character and reputation evidence. According to teachers, coaches, and friends, defendant was a warm, popular person who loved children and was an outstanding athlete. He was also a nonviolent person and generally had a reputation as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-8\">On August 9, 1989, about 7:30 a.m., Lori Sooy, April\u2019s neighbor, heard yelling from the alley area, and the loud voices of adults and children. Approximately 9:00 a.m., Sooy\u2019s two small boys pushed open the door of the Gilhousen residence. Sooy pulled the door shut; as she did so she could hear a phone ringing without being answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\">Richard Shaw, chief of the toxicology laboratory at the San Diego County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, testified that the toxicology analysis of Chandler\u2019s bodily fluids revealed the presence of alcohol and a relatively high amount of methamphetamine. Chronic use of methamphetamine can cause paranoia. Forensic analysis of defendant\u2019s urine sample by a different toxicologist, Norman Pawchuk, revealed a relatively low level of methamphetamine. Flores\u2019s blood and urine samples were negative for all drugs tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-10\">Daniel Rattiner, defendant\u2019s fellow student, also knew Almond and Chandler. Almond appeared to be a drug abuser who acted in a nervous, excited manner. Chandler also appeared to have a drug problem. He had a \u201cbad attitude\u201d and used racial epithets. Rattiner had never, however, seen Chandler use a racial epithet to anyone\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-11\">Several months before the homicides occurred, Rex Romero had a hostile encounter with Chandler. Angry words were exchanged, and a fellow employee separated them before blows were struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>3. <em>Flores\u2019s Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">Flores testified in his own defense and introduced both his prior police statements and those of defendant. While defendant and Flores each gave inconsistent statements, they ultimately both admitted being together at the Gilhousen residence on the morning of the crimes, but attempted to place primary responsibility for the murders and motivation for drugs and money on each other. Their statements were otherwise consistent with the other evidence such as the murder weapons used, the movement of Bryan\u2019s and Chandler\u2019s bodies, the attack on Almond, and the breaking of Bryan\u2019s window.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">Flores testified that while Chandler was seated and opening Bryan\u2019s bicycle box, defendant attacked Chandler with a bat. Defendant also killed April and Bryan. Flores admitted cutting Chandler\u2019s throat and stabbing April after defendant had already injured them. He denied knowing Bryan had been killed until he saw the evening news.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">Following defendant\u2019s failed pursuit of Almond, defendant and Flores drove around the neighborhood in defendant\u2019s Blazer for approximately 10 to 15 minutes looking for Almond. Defendant then returned to the house, and Flores continued driving around by himself for another 15 minutes. It was during this time he encountered his sister Yvonne.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-8\">In addition, Flores presented evidence of his good character and reputation. He was described by several witnesses as a nonviolent person who had a reputation for nonviolence. In contrast, defendant had a reputation for being violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-9\">Dr. Randall Baselt, a clinical and forensic toxicologist, opined that given defendant\u2019s August 11, 1989, methamphetamine level, and making certain other assumptions, defendant\u2019s methamphetamine level on August 9 was consistent with someone under the influence of that drug. At such a level, objective symptoms include anxiety, nervousness, or an irritable or hostile manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-10\">Dr. Sheldon Zigelbaum, a psychiatrist who examined Flores, opined that Flores was a follower and responded ineffectively to stress. According to Zigelbaum, if Flores were to witness an unexpected lethal bludgeoning, he would be traumatized, and \u201cbecome depersonalized and would fall under control of some external source of command that would indicate to him what to do next, because Manny Flores would have no idea what to do next. . . .\u201d Flores\u2019s \u201cown decision-making systems were short-circuited,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>and he was \u201cnot able to hear the voice of his own conscience\u201d or judgment, \u201cthe voice of his own reason.\u201d None of Flores\u2019s postbludgeoning behavior, such as his failure to seek help from his sister, Almond, or Burns, or otherwise report the incident, his failure to leave the Gilhousen residence when defendant said he could, driving defendant\u2019s vehicle alone in search of Almond, or his acceptance of money from defendant, were inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">Zigelbaum\u2019s credibility was impeached when it was revealed his license to practice medicine was currently under review by the State of Massachusetts due to allegations of unprofessional conduct. Moreover, Zigelbaum was not board-certified in either psychiatry or forensic psychiatry. In addition, Zigelbaum\u2019s curriculum vitae was shown to be substantially misleading to the extent it falsely suggested he was the medical director for a psychotherapy center, when the professional corporation at issue consisted only of himself and his wife; that he was currently on the advisory board for a Vietnam veterans posttraumatic stress program at Rutland Heights Hospital, when that board had not been active since 1987; that he was an active consultant to and expert witness for the Bristol County District Attorney\u2019s office, when in fact he had no relationship with that office since approximately 1981; that he was a consultant to the Massachusetts Attorney General\u2019s office from 1978-1987, when in fact he had not been an active consultant to that office since approximately 1980; and that he was a current consultant for First Security Services Corporation, when he had not been an active consultant since approximately 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-6\">Dr. Donald Viglione, a clinical psychologist, administered a Rorschach test to Flores to determine whether his personality was more consistent with dependent traits or antisocial or psychotic traits. Based on the test results, Viglione opined that Flores had dependent personality traits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-7\">4. <em>Defendant\u2019s Rebuttal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-8\">Several witnesses who knew Flores testified in an effort to discredit Zigelbaum\u2019s testimony. Some testified Flores was a violent person; others that he had a reputation for violence. He had bragged about participating in a robbery murder or assault in a canyon, stolen a watch and gone through the pockets of a severely inebriated guest at a party, stolen a leather-encased telephone during the same party, stolen a handgun from a home where he had attended a different party, initiated an angry confrontation with a motorist, climbed into and out of a female motorist\u2019s car while it was stopped at a red light, and provoked fights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>5. <em>Flores\u2019s Rebuttal and Surrebuttal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">Flores denied he had bragged about a robbery murder in a canyon, stolen a gun, phone, or watch, or started any fights. Testimony was presented regarding his nonviolent character.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">6. <em>Prosecution Rebuttal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">Detective Raybould testified regarding an untaped statement by defendant. (See <em>post, </em>at pp. 1192-1195.) Aaron Rieker, who babysat for April, testified that Bryan knew defendant by name. Thomas Tutrow, Chandler\u2019s former next-door neighbor, testified he was a sickly diabetic who was not physically capable of hurting a flea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">B. <em>Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-9\">1. <em>Prosecution Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">The prosecution relied on the guilt phase evidence for its penalty phase case-in-chief and offered no further evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">2. <em>Defense Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">Scores of family members, friends, classmates, clergy, teachers, and coaches testified that defendant was consistently a compassionate, hardworking, respectful, and nonviolent individual, who loved children. Defendant had excelled athletically in high school, and was disappointed when he did not receive any scholarship offers. Rather than burden his parents with the expense of college, defendant attended San Diego City College with the hope of obtaining a football scholarship from Long Beach State University.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-13\">Defendant\u2019s family life was warm and stable. His parents had been married approximately 25 years. Both had overcome impoverished backgrounds, and the couple waited to have children until they could adequately provide for them. Defendant\u2019s father was a Vietnam War veteran who spent 22 years in the Navy, subsequently earned two associate college degrees, and at times worked two jobs to send defendant to private Catholic school. Defendant and his father enjoyed playing football together. His mother primarily devoted herself to raising defendant and his younger sister. She also provided foster care for several children whom defendant treated as his brothers and sisters. The Box family was described as a good Christian family.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-14\">Witnesses described Flores as a robber, a troublemaker, and violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">A. <em>Guilt Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">1. <em>Alleged Failure to Allow Sufficient Inquiry of Prospective Jurors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-7\">Defendant contends the trial court \u201cseverely hampered [defendant\u2019s] ability to effectively use voir dire to ensure an unbiased and unprejudiced jury\u201d by prohibiting defendant from conducting sequestered, individual voir dire of those prospective jurors who had, or who had spent time with, small <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant asserts violations of his right to due process and an impartial jury under the federal and state Constitutions, and violation of his federal constitutional right to a reliable death verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">During jury selection, defendant requested that the trial court inquire as to the ages of the prospective jurors\u2019 grandchildren. The court denied the request, stating, \u201cWhether you\u2019re going to be prejudiced by the fact that a young child is involved in this case doesn\u2019t turn upon whether you have one at the moment. It turns upon whether your personality and capacities are such as to be able to deal with the wrench that goes with that. No matter how many or how few grandchildren you have got or what age you are. It\u2019s something that jurors are going to have to deal with; they\u2019re going to have to be able to set aside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-9\">Over defendant\u2019s objection below, and contrary to what he argues on appeal, the trial court correctly ruled that the then recently enacted jury selection provisions of Proposition 115, subsequently codified in Code of Civil Procedure section 223,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> applied to this case. <em>(Tapia </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 282, 299-300 [279 Cal.Rptr. 592, 807 P.2d 434] [jury voir dire provisions of Proposition 115 apply to all trials occurring after the proposition\u2019s effective date].) Accordingly, the trial court assumed primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>responsibility for questioning prospective jurors, and generally performed this task in open court. This included \u201cdeath qualification,\u201d as discussed below. (See <em>post, </em>at pp. 1180-1181.) The prospective jurors were instructed at length on the need for candor during voir dire. Sensitive matters were discussed in chambers, and at that point counsel was permitted to inquire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">The trial court made the following inquiry to the first panel of prospective jurors regarding Bryan\u2019s death: \u201c[Ojne of the more pathetic things that you\u2019re going to see is at least one picture . . . of a little three-year-old boy in his sleepers dead. It\u2019s not a picture that\u2019s going to make anybody very happy, but you\u2019re not here to be made either happy or sorrowful, and you\u2019re not here to decide the case on the basis of your emotions in response. The facts are that this little boy ended up dead, and there are factual issues that a jury must decide that arise out of that circumstance. They must be decided on the basis of reason, not any kind of emotion that you feel. Is there anyone who\u2019s going to be so upset by that kind of a picture that you can\u2019t apply your reason and set aside your emotions? Not telling you you shouldn\u2019t have the emotions. I\u2019m telling you you must set them aside and not allow them to cloud your judgment. Is there anybody who feels you can\u2019t do that?\u201d \u201cIs there anybody who feels that because the case involves, among other people and things, a three-year-old child, that you are going to be emotionally moved to do something that\u2014other than reason requires?\u201d Shorter but similar inquiries were made to the subsequent panels. Subsequently, several jurors were questioned in chambers regarding their strong emotional reaction to a case involving a small child\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">\u201cThe Constitution . . . does not dictate a catechism for <em>voir dire, </em>but only that the defendant be afforded an impartial jury.\u201d <em>(Morgan </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1992) 504 U.S. 719, 729 [112 S.Ct. 2222, 2230, 119 L.Ed.2d 492].) Pursuant to former Code of Civil Procedure section 223, the question of whether individual, sequestered voir dire should take place is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Waidla </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 690, 713-714 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 396, 996 P.2d 46].) Such discretion is abused \u201cif the questioning is not reasonably sufficient to test the jury for bias or partiality.\u201d <em>{People v. Chapman </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 136, 141 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 738].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">Here, the trial court acted within its discretion. Its inquiry clearly sought to ascertain from the prospective jurors whether they harbored any improper bias. That the prospective jurors understood the inquiry as such is evidenced by the fact that several did come forward and discuss their strong emotional reaction in chambers. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, a prospective juror would not reasonably interpret the trial court\u2019s comments to mean a biased response \u201cwas expected and therefore not worth mentioning to the judge.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>Nor does the fact that some prospective jurors came forward mean that others were too intimidated or embarrassed to do so. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a prospective juror <em>not </em>having a strong emotional reaction to a three-year-old\u2019s murder, or feeling shame or embarrassment at revealing in front of others the depth of that reaction. Moreover, the precise parameters of a prospective juror\u2019s possibly disqualifying reaction <em>were </em>examined in chambers, and counsel was then permitted to inquire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">Defendant also challenges as unconstitutional the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow the parties to give the prospective jurors a written questionnaire. The trial court stated a written questionnaire would not adequately provide the necessary explanation needed to understand the questions. The court, however, used the proposed questionnaires in formulating the questions it asked on voir dire, and invited counsel to provide any further questions they wanted the court to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">Defendant asserts that the questionnaire would have ascertained whether the prospective jurors had young children or grandchildren and how much contact they had with them, and whether they could be impartial in a case involving a three-year-old victim. The bias these inquiries sought to uncover was adequately addressed in the court\u2019s voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">Finally, defendant asserts that the trial court \u201cordered that jury .selection be conducted in less than one week.\u201d Not so. The trial court merely predicted the parties would be able to select a jury within that time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">2. <em>Denial of Hovey Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-9\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in not performing individualized voir dire concerning prospective jurors\u2019 views on capital punishment, in violation of his federal constitutional rights to effective representation, due process, an impartial jury, and a reliable death verdict, citing <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 1, 80 [168 Cal.Rptr. 128, 616 P.2d 1301]. We recently held that Proposition 115 abrogated <em>Hovey. (People </em>v. <em>Waidla, supra, 22 </em>Cal.4th at p. 713.) Defendant suggests no persuasive reason to revisit this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-10\">Nor did the trial court abuse its discretion in determining that group voir dire regarding death qualification was \u201cpracticable\u201d in this case. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 223; <em>People </em>v. <em>Waidla, supra, 22 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 713-714.) Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the trial court expressly stated on numerous occasions it had discretion to order sequestered voir dire if group voir dire was impracticable. In its view, individual voir dire with inquiry by counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>appropriate when a juror made an affirmative response to a group inquiry involving a sensitive matter, such as a \u201cdeath-\u201d or \u201clife-qualifying\u201d question. This approach seems reasonable, and defendant fails to assert any persuasive reason why group voir dire was impractical in this case. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 223.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">Defendant also contends that the format and questions used by the trial court prevented adequate \u201clife-qualifying\u201d inquiry in violation of <em>Morgan v. Illinois, supra, </em>504 U.S. at pages 735-736 [112 S.Ct. at page 2233]. We disagree. Rather, the trial court specifically asked the prospective jurors whether anyone would automatically vote for death on a particular set of findings or on any set of findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">Finally, defendant contends the trial court erred in allowing the prosecution\u2019s challenge for cause of Prospective Juror Esther J. While in chambers, Esther J. volunteered, \u201cI couldn\u2019t vote for [the] death penalty. I just\u2014it\u2019s just something that I have never believed in it. A life, whether it\u2019s taken by legal means or otherwise, is just wrong; that\u2019s how I feel within me.\u201d In response to inquiry by the court, Esther J. stated, \u201c[O]ne thing that I think is so horrible is when a small child is mutilated and killed, but then I think the person who did it must be absolutely insane and they\u2014they should be put away for life without a chance of getting out again, not that this\u2014death, I can\u2019t\u2014even for that I can\u2019t quite bring myself to feel that that\u2019s right.\u201d She further stated, \u201cI know that if I did vote for capital punishment, I would live with a sense of guilt for the rest of my life.\u201d While Esther J. indicated she would try to follow the law, she also agreed with the prosecutor that it was wrong for the state to execute people \u201cfor any circumstance,\u201d and that she \u201ccould think of no situation where [she] would be able to agree with the death penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">A prospective juror \u201cmay be challenged for cause based upon his or her views concerning capital punishment only if those views would \u2018prevent or substantially impair\u2019 the performance of the juror\u2019s duties as defined by the court\u2019s instructions and the juror\u2019s oath.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crittenden </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 121 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887], quoting <em>Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 412, 424 [105 S.Ct. 844, 852, 83 L.Ed.2d 841].) \u201cOn appeal, if the prospective juror\u2019s responses are equivocal, i.e., capable of multiple inferences, or conflicting, the trial court\u2019s determination of that juror\u2019s state of mind is binding.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 771, 809 [281 Cal.Rptr. 90, 809 P.2d 865]; <em>People v. Mincey </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 408, 456 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 827 P.2d 388].) \u201cIf there is no inconsistency, and the only question is whether the prospective juror\u2019s responses in fact demonstrated an opposition to or bias in favor of the death penalty, we will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>not set aside the court\u2019s determination if it is supported by substantial evidence and hence not clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1005, 1047 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 225, 929 P.2d 544].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">We conclude this prospective juror was properly excused. To the extent Esther J.\u2019s answers were equivocal or conflicting, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s determination. To the extent they were not so, substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the trial court\u2019s rejection of prosecution challenges for cause based on other prospective jurors\u2019 views on capital punishment has no bearing on the correctness of the trial court\u2019s decision to excuse Esther J.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">3. <em>Denial of Funding for Jury Selection Expert</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">Defendant contends voir dire was also improperly limited by the trial court\u2019s failure to authorize funding for a jury selection expert. (\u00a7 987.9.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He contends this failure, in combination with the other alleged errors noted above, deprived him of his right to an impartial jury and a reliable penalty determination, violated his rights under the California Constitution and his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and effective assistance of counsel, and resulted in a fundamentally unfair trial. In particular, defendant contends that by arbitrarily denying defense counsel funding for a jury selection expert, the trial court allowed bias to continue unprobed by not providing counsel the resources to intelligently exercise peremptory and for cause challenges. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">On August 23, 1990, Defense Counsel Elizabeth Barranco filed a declaration requesting investigative and expert funds, including a request for $9,240 to hire jury selection expert Dr. Wendy Saxon. (\u00a7 987.9.) The declaration stated Saxon had experience in 33 capital cases, and, in particular, \u201cexperience in selecting juries in cases involving the capital murder of children,\u201d which trial counsel did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">San Diego County Superior Court apparently uses a panel of trial judges (which of course does not include the assigned trial judge) to review funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>requests. At the September 4, 1990, hearing on the request, trial counsel stated Saxon\u2019s expertise was particularly necessary because the district attorney\u2019s office had a full-time jury selection expert; the court noted this expert \u201cwill be gone in two months.\u201d One judge expressed the panel\u2019s view that \u201clawyers are trained as well as anyone else to select juries, and there are two lawyers on the case, and their expertise is as great or greater than this person\u2019s.\u201d Counsel stated Saxon had experience in several capital cases involving murdered children, which counsel did not, \u201cand I think murder of children, from what I read, is one of the most touchy areas with the jury.\u201d A judge apparently responded that it was fairly obvious \u201cpeople don\u2019t like people accused of killing children.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge added that \u201c[o]n the general subject of jury selection experts have been proliferating, not because anyone thought it was necessary, but because we recognize that in a number of cases the District Attorney has had someone there who may or may not have some competence. I think the general attitude for this group of judges is that that\u2019s nice but nonessential, and at least a majority and one hung on the issue of [whether] we should continue this.\u201d Counsel said, \u201cI know a lot of the cases pending have jury experts, and I feel like we are being shorted . . . because we didn\u2019t ask for it earlier.\u201d A judge responded, \u201cYou have to have a place to start change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">On September 11, 1990, Barranco filed another declaration requesting the court to reconsider its denial of funding for a jury selection expert. The requested amount was reduced to $4,200 because jury selection was now expected to take half the time originally estimated. Counsel stated that contrary to the panel\u2019s assumption, defense counsel would not be permitted to ask prospective jurors \u201cany direct questions unless pursuant to a challenge for cause.\u201d In addition, she stated there would not be <em>Hovey </em>voir dire for every prospective juror. <em>(Hovey v. Superior Court, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 1.) Moreover, \u201cjury selection will be done without [the] benefit of a jury questionnaire.\u201d Defense counsel had no experience selecting a jury under these circumstances, and were thus \u201call the more needy of a death penalty jury selection expert who, on the basis of her experience and studies, can identify with minimal information those prospective jurors who should be peremptorily challenged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">At the September 18, 1990, hearing on the reconsideration request, the court stated, \u201cI have seriously considered the question of experts on jury selection. They are nice to have. We can\u2019t afford giving everybody in this case and every case an expert for jury selection. That\u2019s what lawyers are for. They are supposed to be experts. You\u2019re going to have a couple. That will do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>lots of things. If you will study the situation, I am sure in a case of this nature the judge will allow voir dire by [the] lawyer, as the judge has discretion to do. And I see no reason ... in this case, why it\u2019s different from any other case, and you are skilled lawyers. I know [codefense counsel] Mr. Adair is extremely adept and skilled at selecting juries. I have had Mr. Adair appear in front of me on serious cases, and I\u2019m not going to reconsider it.\u201d Counsel said, \u201c[O]ur judge has told us he will not allow us to ask any questions.\u201d The court responded, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t alter the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">\u201cSection 987.9 commits to the sound discretion of the trial court the determination of the reasonableness of an application for funds for ancillary services\u201d such as a jury selection expert. <em>(People v. Mattson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 826, 847 [268 Cal.Rptr. 802, 789 P.2d 983]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 234 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365].) Here, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the record reveals the panel did not deny the funds request simply because it \u201chad decided to arbitrarily draw a line in the sand concerning expenses.\u201d Nor, by relying on the expertise of these particular attorneys instead of providing funding for a jury selection expert, did the trial panel \u201cvirtually ensure[] that jurors with strong biases due to the nature of the case and of the victims remained in the jury pool.\u201d Rather, the trial court reasonably concluded a jury selection expert was not reasonably necessary for preparation or presentation of the defense. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 847.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">While defense counsel expressed concern that they had no experience in selecting a jury post-Proposition 115, or in a case involving a child\u2019s murder, and noted the possibility that the district attorney would use a jury selection expert, none of these circumstances establish a basis for concluding funding was \u201creasonably necessary.\u201d (\u00a7 987.9.) As the trial court stated, \u201clawyers are trained as well as anyone else to select juries, and there are two lawyers on the case, and their expertise is as great or greater than this person\u2019s.\u201d Here, counsel was permitted to suggest voir dire questions to the court, and sensitive matters were discussed in chambers, at which point counsel was permitted to inquire. Defendant does not explain how counsel lacked the ability during this process to identify juror bias simply because the case involved a child\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">Indeed, in <em>Mattson, </em>which involved the brutal kidnapping, sexual assault, and murder of a nine-year-old girl, we also upheld the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant funding for a jury selection expert, concluding that none of the factors cited in support of the request established such funds were \u201c \u2018reasonably necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Mattson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 839-840, 847-848.) In so doing, we rejected the claim that reasonable necessity was established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>because counsel lacked experience performing <em>Hovey </em>voir dire, the \u201cinflammatory nature of the charges increased the difficulty of selecting impartial jurors,\u201d \u201ccounsel had been economical in other phases of trial preparation,\u201d and \u201cthe cost of an expert was modest.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 847.) We stated the defendant \u201cdid not demonstrate how lack of experience in conducting voir dire under the <em>Hovey </em>procedure was relevant to his ability to identify prospective jurors who were qualified or were subject to excuse for cause.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, \u201c[n]othing about the charges in this case so distinguishes it from other capital cases or noncapital cases in which sexual assaults are charged as to compel a conclusion that selection of impartial jurors would be unusually difficult.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 848.) The same is true here. Thus, this case is unlike <em>Ake v. Oklahoma </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 68, 74 [105 S.Ct. 1087, 1091, 84 L.Ed.2d 53], on which defendant relies, and in which the high court held an indigent defendant is entitled to the services of a psychiatrist when he makes a preliminary showing that his sanity at the time of the offense is likely to be a significant factor at trial. Unlike psychiatric expertise, the trial panel reasonably concluded a jury selection expert in this case would not offer any expertise not already available to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">4. <em>Alleged Wheeler Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">Defendant contends the prosecutor impermissibly exercised three of her peremptory challenges to exclude Blacks from the jury in violation of his right to trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community, guaranteed by article I, section 16, of the California Constitution and the Sixth Amendment, and his and the prospective jurors\u2019 Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection. The trial court denied the motion. We conclude defendant\u2019s claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">Following the prosecution\u2019s peremptory challenge to Carl H., defense counsel asked that the record reflect Mr. H. was Black, and stated, \u201cFor the record, your honor, perhaps I would make the <em>Wheeler </em>motion and submit it. I would admit that I think we\u2019re on very weak grounds at the present time.\u201d The prosecutor stated, \u201cThen I have nothing to respond to,\u201d and the matter was not further addressed at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">Following the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenge of Stephen A., defense counsel again made a <em>Wheeler </em>motion <em>(People v. Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748]), noting Mr. A. was Black, and that many other Black prospective jurors had been excused for hardship reasons. As a result, only two Black prospective jurors \u201cactually made it into the selection process\u201d to that point, and both had been challenged by the prosecution. The trial court denied the motion, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t think that I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>can find the preliminary fact on the basis of . . . two peremptories. . . . [A]t this point I can\u2019t make the finding of a prima facie showing . . . .\u201d The court nevertheless allowed the prosecutor to state her reasons. She observed that Carl H. worked at a waste treatment plant, where she had \u201cprosecuted a good number of the individuals who work there, in an undercover drug deal,\u201d and had information that \u201cmost of the individuals working there were high as kites on most days.\u201d Mr. H. had also been arrested, and when asked about the arrest \u201cdidn\u2019t seem to understand diversion and the fact that this was a serious matter,\u201d and placed more emphasis on his traffic warrants than his arrest for paraphernalia. Moreover, he had as a result spent three days in the custody of the San Diego police, the department involved in this case, and he was single.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">As for Stephen A., the prosecutor stated Mr. A. knew approximately 10 people, including friends and relatives, who had been shot, and that he used the word \u201cshot\u201d instead of \u201ckilled,\u201d which gave her \u201ca certain impression of that individual\u2019s thinking\u201d; one of these people, a relative, had been shot by police. Moreover, he had grown up with a person who later became a football coach at San Diego City College, where defendant had played football. When asked about his recollection of news coverage, he remembered that the defendants were athletes from Clairemont, \u201cwhereas everybody else who remembers the news generally remembers that there was a baby killed, that individuals were killed.\u201d Mr. A. felt \u201cpolice had to meet quotas in making arrests . . . [a]nd that the police didn\u2019t always have the facts when they bring someone in on, quote, \u2018technicalities.\u2019 \u201d He used the term \u201cpolice,\u201d emphasizing the first syllable, instead of \u201cpolice.\u201d He had the same distinctive haircut as defendant at the time of his arrest, had \u201cextremely poor grammar,\u201d was slow of speech, and was tardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">The trial court responded, \u201cWell, my reaction is that I don\u2019t have to pass on the quality of the challenges,\u201d presumably because it had not found a prima facie case. (7)(See fn- <footnotemark>6</footnotemark>-) The court further stated, \u201cbut my curbstone reaction is that the first one is amply justified, and many of the reasons stated for the second one are the type of which the appellate courts have been critical. But, on the other hand, if he weren\u2019t Black, nobody ... if they knew about these reasons would be criticizing counsel for using them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">Following the prosecution\u2019s peremptory challenge to Stephanie W. as an alternate juror, defense counsel renewed their <em>Wheeler </em>motion. \u201cWe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>believe that Miss [W.] is the first in a string, probably, of minorities who are about to be excused.\u201d A debate ensued as to whether Stephanie W. was indeed Black; while the court itself had placed a question mark next to her name in its own notes, it declined the prosecution\u2019s request to question Ms. W. regarding her ancestry. The court deferred ruling on the motion, but allowed the prosecution to state its reasons for challenging Stephanie W.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">Ms. W. had been a victim of a residential burglary; the door was left open and the lights on. She did not report it to the police, which \u201csays something to me.\u201d Instead, she sought advice from a firefighter friend, who advised her not to enter the residence. While she did not go in, she sent a neighbor in.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">Following the completion of voir dire, the court inquired whether anyone had a <em>Wheeler </em>motion. The prosecutor stated, \u201cYes, your honor. And it is very apparent that defense counsel are choosing the individuals that they care to kick off in a group manner; and by doing so and by already knowing the People\u2019s position in regards to the Filipinos and having the blanket kick of Filipinos, this is the third individual kicked.\u201d The court inquired, \u201c[W]hat is the defense position as to whether I should grant the <em>Wheeler </em>motion as to the Filipinos and discharge this panel and start over?\u201d Defense counsel stated, \u201cYour honor, ... we feel it\u2019s in Mr. Box\u2019s best interest to proceed with this particular jury and alternates. And to be . . . intellectually honest in regards to it, it\u2019s not my feeling that we discriminated against Filipinos because of their race. . . . We oppose the <em>Wheeler </em>motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">The court denied the motion, and inquired of defense counsel whether they could maintain their deferred <em>Wheeler </em>motion in view of the fact that one alternate juror was Black. Defense counsel submitted the motion. It was denied, with the trial court expressly finding the prosecutor had not \u201cengaged in racial discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">\u201cIt is well settled that the use of peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors solely on the basis of a presumed group bias based on membership in a racial group violates both the state and federal Constitutions.\u201d <em>(.People v. Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 164; <em>People v. Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 276-277; <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 79, 89 [106 S.Ct. 1712, 1719, 90 L.Ed.2d 69].) Under <em>Wheeler </em>and <em>Batson, </em>\u201c \u2018[i]f a party believes his opponent is using his peremptory challenges to strike jurors on the ground of group bias alone, he must raise the point in timely fashion and make a prima facie case of such discrimination to the satisfaction of the court. First, ... he should make as complete a record of the circumstances as is feasible. Second, he must establish that the persons excluded are members of a cognizable group within the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>representative cross-section rule. Third, from all the circumstances of the case he must show a strong likelihood [or reasonable inference] that such persons are being challenged because of their group association . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Howard </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1132, 1153-1154 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 268, 824 P.2d 1315], italics omitted; <em>People v. Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 164; <em>People v. Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 280-281.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">\u201cWhen a trial court denies a <em>Wheeler </em>motion because it finds no prima facie case of group bias was established, the reviewing court considers the entire record of voir dire.\u201d <em>(People v. Davenport </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1171, 1200 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 800, 906 P.2d 1068].) \u201cIf the record \u2018suggests grounds upon which the prosecutor might reasonably have challenged\u2019 the jurors in question, we affirm.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1155, quoting <em>People v. Bittaker </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1046, 1092 [259 Cal.Rptr. 630, 774 P.2d 659].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">When a trial court expressly rules that a prima facie case was not made, but allows the prosecutor to state his or her justifications for the record, the issue of whether a prima facie case was made is not moot. <em>(People v. Davenport, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1200; <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 166-167.) Rather, \u201cwhen an appellate court is presented with such a record, and concludes that the trial court properly determined that no prima facie case was made, it need not review the adequacy of counsel\u2019s justifications for the peremptory challenges.\u201d <em>(People v. Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">Contrary to what defendant claims, substantial evidence supported the trial court\u2019s denial of his <em>Wheeler </em>claims to the extent such rulings were based on a finding that no prima facie case of discrimination had been made. In particular, defendant failed to establish from all the circumstances of the case a strong likelihood or reasonable inference that Carl H., Stephen A., and Stephanie W. were challenged because of their group association. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1154.) Rather, the only basis for establishing a prima facie case cited by defense counsel was that the prospective jurors\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>like defendant\u2014were Black. This is insufficient. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Davenport, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1201; <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 167; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rousseau </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 526, 536-537 [179 Cal.Rptr. 892] [defense counsel\u2019s statement that \u201c \u2018there were only two blacks on the whole panel, and they were both challenged by the district attorney\u2019 \u201d failed to establish a prima facie case].) Indeed, there was a dispute as to whether Stephanie W. was Black, and a Black juror did serve as an alternate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">Defendant asserts that any failure by the defense to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory peremptory challenges is attributable to the trial court\u2019s alleged mishandling of voir dire in general and the <em>Wheeler </em>motions in particular, preventing defendant from showing that there were no legitimate nonracial grounds for excusing the prospective jurors. We reject this characterization of the record, and find ample grounds on which to uphold denial of defendant\u2019s <em>Wheeler </em>motion. The trial judge, who had performed much of and observed the remainder of the voir dire, was in the best position to determine under \u201call the relevant circumstances\u201d of the case whether there was a strong likelihood or reasonable inference these prospective jurors were being challenged because of their group association. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1156; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 1194, 1221 [255 Cal.Rptr. 569, 767 P.2d 1047]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 280-281.) The prosecutor engaged in more than \u201cdesultory\u201d questioning of Carl H. and Stephen A. (there was no in-chambers questioning by counsel of Stephanie W.). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 281.) While the significance of this factor is diminished in the aftermath of Code of Civil Procedure section 223, defendant overlooks the fact that counsel was permitted to question Carl H. and Stephen A., and the trial court conducted voir dire for all three prospective jurors. This record, reviewed independently by the trial court, clearly established specific non-race-related reasons why a prosecutor might want to excuse these prospective jurors, e.g., Mr. H.\u2019s arrest by the San Diego Police Department, Mr. A.\u2019s relative who had been shot by police and his relatively low general opinion of police, and Ms. W.\u2019s reluctance to call the police when her home was burglarized. Furthermore, it is incongruous that defendant was satisfied with the jury\u2019s composition when opposing the prosecution\u2019s <em>Wheeler </em>motion, but immediately became dissatisfied when the court turned to defendant\u2019s <em>Wheeler </em>motion. Finally, while the trial court\u2019s express determination that the prosecutor had not \u201cengaged in racial discrimination,\u201d made after discussing the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for excusing Stephanie W., is ambiguous as to whether the trial court ever found a prima facie case was established as to this prospective alternate juror, substantial evidence supports the conclusion either that there was no prima facie case established, or that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for excusing her were race-neutral. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayfield </em>(1997) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>14 Cal.4th 668, 726-727 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 928 P.2d 485]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 166-168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">Defendant argues, however, that these and the other bases stated by the prosecutor are insufficient because the prosecutor did not excuse other non-Black jurors who displayed similar characteristics.  \u201cHowever, we have previously rejected a procedure that places an \u2018undue emphasis on comparisons of the stated reasons for the challenged excusals with similar characteristics of nonmembers of the group who were not challenged by the prosecutor,\u2019 noting that such a comparison is one-sided and that it is not realistic to expect a trial judge to make such detailed comparisons midtrial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 169, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 1220.) \u201cIn addition, we have observed that \u2018the same factors used in evaluating a juror may be given different weight depending on the number of peremptory challenges the lawyer has at the time of the exercise of the particular challenge.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 169.) \u201cMoreover, \u2018the very dynamics of the jury selection process make it difficult, if not impossible, on a cold record, to evaluate or compare the peremptory challenge of one juror with the retention of another juror [who] on paper appears to be substantially similar.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 170.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-6\">5. <em>Alleged Error Regarding In-chambers Conferences</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-7\">The trial court refused to allow defendant to attend in-chambers conferences regarding jury selection unless he wore shackles, because he was alleged to be an escape risk. Defendant apparently chose not to attend any conferences throughout the trial, and now contends his absence from three of them violated his rights to due process and a reliable death verdict under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, the California Constitution, article I, section 15, and state statutory provisions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree. (See generally <em>People </em>v. <em>Waidla, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 741-743.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-8\">\u201c[E]ven in a capital case, defendants may generally waive their right to be present at trial when evidence is not taken.\u201d <em>(People v. Riel </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1153, 1196 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 998 P.2d 969].) This general rule applies to discussions of legal matters. <em>(Ibid.) </em>While defendant contends his waiver was coerced by the trial court\u2019s allegedly improper shackling condition, for the reasons that follow there would have been no error even without the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>Defendant first challenges a conference regarding witness Danny Chouinard. Prior to Chouinard\u2019s testimony, and <em>in defendant\u2019s presence, </em>the court and counsel discussed at length the scope of questioning allowed for this witness. In particular, the court refused to allow defendant\u2019s counsel to inquire whether the witness and Flores stopped being friends, and if so, why. Counsel anticipated the witness would say he stopped associating with Flores \u201cbecause Flores was so crazy and liked to get into trouble.\u201d Chouinard in fact testified Flores was violent. On cross-examination, he testified he had told Dr. Zigelbaum that \u201cFlores got in fights slightly more than [he] did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">At the challenged conference, defendant\u2019s counsel argued Flores\u2019s counsel\u2019s cross-examination had opened the door to the issue of why the witness stopped associating with Flores. The trial court disagreed, and stated that even if it had been opened, the line of questioning involved \u201ctoo many additional side issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">Defendant claims his presence was indispensable at the in-chambers conference because his intimate knowledge of the relationship between Chouinard and Flores would have assisted counsel in arguing to the court that the area of questioning should be allowed. However, defendant was <em>present </em>when this issue was explored at length in open court. Had he anything to contribute to counsel\u2019s argument, he was free to do so at that time. The later in-chambers conference involved nothing more than an evidentiary question of whether cocounsel had opened the door to the excluded testimony. Defendant does not assert how his presence would have assisted counsel in addressing this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">Defendant next challenges an in-chambers conference regarding the admissibility of statements he made to his girlfriend, Harkleroad. The discussion focused on whether Flores would be waiving his right to cross-examine defendant under <em>People v. Aranda </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 518 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265], if Flores\u2019s counsel elicited defendant\u2019s statements from Harkleroad. While defendant is undoubtedly correct that he was familiar with both his statements and Harkleroad\u2019s, it is not apparent how this knowledge would have assisted counsel in this purely legal discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-8\">Finally, defendant challenges a conference in which the trial court considered whether the defense had opened the door to certain evidence bolstering the prosecution\u2019s uncharged theory that defendant had tried to escape from jail. Defendant again fails to demonstrate how his presence would have had any bearing on these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-9\">In sum, we cannot conclude, with respect to any of these three conferences, that defendant\u2019s personal, presence was necessary for an opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>for effective cross-examination under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation clause, would have contributed to the trial\u2019s fairness in any marginal way for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause, or bore a reasonably substantial relation to the fullness of his opportunity to defend for purposes of article I, section 15 of the California Constitution or Penal Code sections 977 and 1043. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Waidla, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 742.) Given that defendant had no right to attend these three in-chambers conferences, it is not relevant that he did not attend because of the condition imposed for jury selection conferences that he be shackled. We therefore need not address the propriety of this aspect of the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">6. <em>Alleged Error in Admitting Defendant\u2019s Statement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his August 12, 1989, statement to police because it was purportedly obtained and admitted at trial in violation of his right to remain silent, to the assistance of counsel, and to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-7\">On August 10, 1989, approximately 9:45 p.m., defendant was taken into custody. Approximately 11:00 p.m., after being advised of and waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he was interrogated by Detectives Grant Raybould and Pat Ruffner. This interrogation, including breaks, lasted approximately four hours. Defendant made several inconsistent statements regarding his activities on August 9, the day of the murders. Defendant ultimately acknowledged he was at the house with Flores, and said he had hit Chandler with a baseball bat after Flores initiated a violent confrontation with Chandler. He also expressed a willingness to take a polygraph exam. Defendant does not challenge the admission of this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">Detective Raybould testified at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his second statement made to police on August 12, 1989. According to Raybould, on August 12, 1989, approximately 10:10 a.m., he went to the county jail to give defendant a polygraph test. Defendant was brought from his cell and taken to the interview room. Raybould told defendant he was there to reinterview him and do the previously discussed polygraph exam. Defendant said an attorney had told him not to speak with anyone. Raybould told defendant he was \u201cnot aware there was an attorney involved.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. Just go ahead and advise me of the rights.\u201d Raybould had explained to defendant he \u201cwould have to advise him of any rights prior to this interview and polygraph.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-9\">Raybould told defendant he was not certain what his obligation was at that point, since an attorney had come over to visit him. Defendant told him he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>had not hired an attorney or signed any papers for an attorney; \u201can attorney had come over and left a card with him.\u201d Raybould asked defendant if he wanted to consult with that attorney prior to any further questioning, and defendant said no. \u201cI had a tape recorder with me, and I asked him if we could put on tape the essence of the conversation we were having. He was reluctant to put it on tape.\u201d Raybould told him it was for everyone\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">During the taped portion of the interview, which began at 10:20 a.m., Raybould stated, \u201cWhen I came in here ... I came over and told you that I wanted to talk to you some more and that, that we may want to do a polygraph today and that I was going to admonish you of your rights. You told me that your lawyer told you not to talk to anyone. And I told you that I didn\u2019t know you had an attorney and that that sort of brought some new rules into what we were allowed to do. I told you that I, in my opinion, I didn\u2019t think that I would be able to interview you or do a polygraph if you had an attorney without me first going through that attorney. Tell me again about the attorney and whether he\u2019s representing you or what you consider his role to be at this point because I\u2019m not real clear on that and I\u2019d like to get that on tape.\u201d Defendant answered, \u201cHe didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t call him. My parents didn\u2019t call him. He came down the day after I was put into jail. He gave me his card and said \u2018I\u2019ll be,\u2019 I mean \u2018Get in touch with me or I\u2019ll be back in touch with you.\u2019 And that was pretty much it. I didn\u2019t sign any papers saying that he was my attorney or anything but he said, \u2018Try not to talk to anyone that\u2019ll get you into any more trouble than you already are.\u2019 Or whatever, something like that.\u201d Raybould inquired, \u201cOkay. Let me just ask you, first of all, do you consider him to be your attorney, representing you?\u201d \u201cNo. Not yet. No.\u201d \u201cOkay. Do you want me to admonish you of your rights\u2014\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201c[A]nd ask you questions that I\u2019d like to clarify and also explain things\u2014\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201c[T]hat I\u2019ve learned since I last talked to you?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cDo you want to do this without the presence of that attorney\u2014\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201c[O]r any other attorney?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Chris.\u201d \u201cI know. I know.\u201d \u201cI want this to be free and voluntary on your part.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Raybould then told defendant he was going to admonish him of his rights and that defendant could turn the tape recorder off whenever he wished. After giving defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Raybould asked, \u201cDo you understand each of these rights that I have explained to you?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHaving in mind and understanding your rights as I have told you are you willing to talk with me?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Raybould began to speak again, and defendant turned off the tape recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">The interview continued untaped for more than an hour. Defendant at no time said he did not want to speak with Raybould.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">During the hearing on the motion to suppress, Raybould testified his purpose in asking defendant further questions about the attorney was that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>\u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t clear to me whether he was being represented or not.\u201d As a result of this questioning, it was clear to Raybould defendant was not invoking his right to have counsel present during questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">Defendant also testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress. After initial pleasantries, Raybould said that he \u201cwanted to ask me some questions about my previous testimony to him.\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d Raybould asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201c[A]n attorney told me not to talk to anyone else.\u201d Three times defendant told Raybould he did not want to talk to him. When defense counsel inquired at the hearing why defendant had not mentioned on tape \u201cthat on three occasions you had told Detective Raybould that you did not want to speak to him?\u201d defendant replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it mattered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">The trial court found Raybould\u2019s version of events credible and denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-7\">In considering a claim that a statement or confession is inadmissible because it was obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974], the scope of our review is well established. \u201c \u2018We must accept the trial court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts and inferences, and its evaluations of credibility, if they are substantially supported. [Citations.] However, we must independently determine from the undisputed facts, and those properly found by the trial court, whether the challenged statement was illegally obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 1033.) \u201cWe apply federal standards in reviewing defendant\u2019s claim that the challenged statements were elicited from him in violation of Miranda.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-8\">Once a suspect receives <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he \u201cis free to exercise his own volition in deciding whether or not to make a statement to the authorities.\u201d <em>(Oregon v. Elstad </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 298, 308 [105 S.Ct. 1285, 1293, 84 L.Ed.2d 222].) If he thereafter requests counsel, \u201c \u2018the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Edwards v. Arizona </em>(1981) 451 U.S. <em>All, </em>482 [101 S.Ct. 1880, 1883, 68 L.Ed.2d 378], quoting <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 474 [86 S.Ct. at p. 1628].) If a suspect\u2019s request for counsel or invocation of the right to remain silent is ambiguous, the police may \u201ccontinue talking with him for the limited purpose of clarifying whether he is waiving or invoking those rights.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1, 27 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 593, 859 P.2d 673]; see <em>Davis v. United States </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 452, 461 [114 S.Ct. 2350, 2356, 129 L.Ed.2d 362] [police may seek to clarify suspect\u2019s ambiguous reference to counsel].) \u201cThe state must demonstrate the voluntariness of a confession by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>(People v.

Twomey </em>(1972) 404 U.S. <em>477, </em>489 [92 S.Ct. 619, 626, 30 L.Ed.2d 618].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">Here, the trial court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts and its evaluations of credibility are substantially supported by Officer Raybould\u2019s testimony and the taped portion of the interview. Accepting this version of events, as we must, defendant\u2019s statement to Raybould that either an attorney or his attorney had told him not to speak with anyone was ambiguous as to whether defendant was invoking either the right to remain silent or the right to counsel. As such, Raybould was justified in clarifying whether defendant was exercising these rights, and did so exhaustively. Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">7. <em>Severance Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">The trial court granted the prosecution\u2019s motion to consolidate defendant\u2019s case with that of Flores. Defendant contends the trial court\u2019s denial of his ensuing motions to sever the trials violated his federal constitutional rights to due process, an impartial jury, a fair trial, and a reliable death verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">Under section 1098, \u201c[w]hen two or more defendants are jointly charged . . . they must be tried jointly, unless the court order[s] separate trials.\u201d In light of this legislative preference for joinder, separate trials are usually ordered only \u201c \u2018in the face of an incriminating confession, prejudicial association with codefendants, likely confusion resulting from evidence on multiple counts, conflicting defenses, or the possibility that at a separate trial a codefendant would give exonerating testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 302, 312 [208 Cal.Rptr. 196, 690 P.2d 669], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104, 1115 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306], quoting <em>People v. Massie </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 899, 917 [59 Cal.Rptr. 733, 428 P.2d 869].) A trial court\u2019s ruling on a severance motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion on the basis of the facts known to the court at the time of the ruling. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alvarez, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 189; <em>People v. Cummings </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1233, 1287 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 850 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">Here, at the time the trial court first ruled on the severance motion, it expressly noted that by seeking consolidation, the prosecutor risked \u201ctotal exclusion\u201d of defendants\u2019 statements. (See <em>People v. Cummings, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 1287.) Subsequently, Flores testified at trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>and hence defendant had no <em>Aranda </em>objection to his statement, and Flores introduced defendant\u2019s statements, thereby waiving his own <em>Aranda </em>objections. (See <em>People v. Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 518.) Thus, while defendant renewed his severance motion several times during trial, no circumstance developed which required the trial court to change its initial ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">Nor did defendant suffer a prejudicial association with Flores. Along these lines, defendant contends severance was required because defendant, but not Flores, was subject to the death penalty. However, as the trial court stated, \u201cThe exclusion of the death penalty against Flores is not based upon an election by the People. ... If the jury should conclude somebody must pay with his life, it would be more likely to exact that penalty from [defendant] in a separate trial, since it could not reach anyone else.\u201d The jury was aware that Flores was not subject to the death penalty because of his age at the time of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">In addition, defendant claims he was denied his right to confrontation by certain extrajudicial statements made by Flores\u2019s witnesses. He does not, however, identify these witnesses (other than Dr. Zigelbaum), or indicate why their testimony would not be admissible on behalf of the People in a separate trial. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cummings, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 1288.) Even assuming Dr. Zigelbaum\u2019s testimony would not have been admitted at a separate trial, the trial court precluded this expert from opining as to <em>defendant\u2019s </em>mental state. Moreover, Zigelbaum was not permitted to testify that in his opinion the events on August 9, 1989, at the Gilhousen residence had occurred in a certain way. Rather, he was asked to assume that certain events had occurred and base his opinion on these assumptions. The jury was expressly and repeatedly instructed that the assumptions were not evidence, and that the jury was the sole finder of fact as to what had occurred on that day. In addition, as noted above, Zigelbaum was impeached by an ongoing Massachusetts medical license review and by certain inaccuracies on his resume. Indeed, it is apparent the jury rejected Zigelbaum\u2019s opinion in any event since it found Flores guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">Nor was defendant prejudiced by his inability to conduct voir dire in a manner that openly indicated why he was exercising his peremptory challenges. A severed trial is nonetheless adversarial, and even in that situation a defendant would likely be circumspect about defense strategy at the jury selection stage. Nor does defendant persuasively explain how certain jurors\u2019 possible low opinion of Flores\u2019s counsel would prejudice him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">Moreover, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, severance was not required merely because it was anticipated defendants would attempt to shift responsibility for the capital crimes to each other. <em>(People v. Alvarez, supra, </em>14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>Cal.4th at p. 190; <em>People v. Cummings, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1287.) Here, as in <em>Cummings, </em>the defense positions were antagonistic because the circumstances of Chandler\u2019s death, and the identity of April\u2019s and Bryan\u2019s killer, were in dispute. \u201cThat each was involved in the incident was undisputed, however, and the prosecution had offered evidence sufficient to support verdicts convicting both defendants. . . . [T]his was not a case in which only one defendant could be guilty. . . . Here the prosecution theory was that both defendants participated in, and were guilty of, the murder[s].\u201d <em>(Cummings, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1287.) The jury was presented with a straightforward decision regarding both defendants\u2019 relative culpability; its verdict finding each defendant guilty as charged reveals it accepted neither defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">Finally, contrary to defendant\u2019s speculation, there is no evidence Flores would have offered testimony exonerating defendant had they been separately tried. <em>(People v. Cummings, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1286.) In sum, no gross unfairness depriving defendant of a fair trial or due process is evident. <em>(.People v. Turner, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">8. <em>Alleged Briggs Instruction Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">Defendant contends the trial court improperly emphasized the Governor\u2019s commutation power in violation of <em>People v. Ramos </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 136 [207 Cal.Rptr. 800, 689 P.2d 430]. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-8\">In <em>Ramos, </em>this court held that portion of section 190.3 embodying what came to be known as the <em>\u201cBriggs </em>instruction\u201d was unconstitutional under state law. <em>(People v. Ramos, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 159; cf. <em>California </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 992 [103 S.Ct. 3446, 77 L.Ed.2d 1171] [upholding same instruction against federal constitutional challenge].) This section provides that at the penalty phase \u201c[t]he trier of fact shall be instructed that a sentence of confinement to state prison for a term of life without the possibility of parole may in [the] future after sentence is imposed, be commuted or modified to a sentence that includes the possibility of parole by the Governor of the State of California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-9\">Here, during voir dire, the trial court explained to the prospective jurors that it was the jury\u2019s responsibility, if the issue of penalty were reached, to make a choice between the penalty of death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Out of concern that the subject of whether any penalty chosen would realistically be carried out would come up during jury deliberations, the court stated, \u201c[Y]ou must assume that if you sentence somebody . . . [to] death, in due course that person will die. . . . Now, the Governor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>has the power to commute death sentences, but that\u2019s his problem; not yours. And there is no reason to believe that the Governor is going to decide that you were wrong. So don\u2019t look to anybody else to make any such decision. The buck stops here, and so if you serve on this jury, you must expect that you will make the decision which will be carried out. Now, the same thing has to be said of the penalty of life without possibility of parole. It means it. It means that a person who is so sentenced will die in prison, but not by the act of the state; rather of natural causes sooner or later. Now, it\u2019s also true that the Governor has the power to commute a sentence of life without possibility of parole. We had that penalty for one kind of offense or another for a good many years .... So far as I know, no Governor has ever commuted one of those sentences, and if you have been paying any attention to the politics, you can figure quite practically that the sentence means it. So those will be your choices, if you come to the issue, and you will bear the ultimate burden of making the choice. There is no thinking, \u2018Oh well, somebody else will fix it.\u2019 . . . And so you can expect your decisions ultimately to be carried out, whichever they are. You do bear the ultimate responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">Following the trial court\u2019s statement to the first panel of prospective jurors, defendant moved for a mistrial based on the comments regarding the Governor\u2019s power to commute a sentence. The matter was revisited the next day, and the People at that time also requested a new jury panel. This request and the motion for a mistrial were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">As can be seen, no <em>Briggs </em>instruction was given. As a preliminary matter, the instruction was given during voir dire, when \u201cthe jury\u2019s attention is not narrowly focused on its duty to select a penalty,\u201d not at the end of the penalty phase. <em>(People v. Pinholster </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 865, 918 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 765, 824 P.2d 571].) More critically, the prospective jurors were expressly told they bore the final responsibility for deciding penalty, and that in doing so they should <em>not </em>consider the Governor\u2019s power to commute either a death sentence or a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. \u201cThe jury, having been so advised, could not have been misled as to the nature and scope of the commutation power.\u201d <em>(People v. Coleman </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 749, 782 [251 Cal.Rptr. 83, 759 P.2d 1260].) No error is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">9. <em>Admission of Victim and Surrounding Crime Scene Photographs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to exclude exhibits 2B and 2C, which depict the Gilhousen living room, because they include framed photographs of the victims while alive. Our independent review of the exhibits indicates this is not the case; rather, the frames in the exhibits are empty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>Defendant also asserts these exhibits were irrelevant. We disagree. They were relevant to support the prosecution\u2019s theory that defendant and Flores were aware of the baseball bat\u2019s location in that room, and that the room was arranged in a manner that would have allowed Randi Renken to overhear the conversation between defendant, Flores, and April regarding the pound of marijuana and the amount of drug proceeds April had recently earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court also erred in admitting exhibits 1, 8, 13, 16, 18, and 19, which are photographs of the victims\u2019 bodies and the surrounding crime scene. He objected below to exhibits 1, 8, 13, and 16 on the ground they were cumulative, and to exhibits 18 and 19 on the grounds they were cumulative and irrelevant. These exhibits contained more than one photograph of each victim or crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">Defendant now contends these exhibits were not only cumulative and irrelevant, but also unduly prejudicial. To the extent the last claim is waived, he asserts that counsel was ineffective in failing to object on this basis. We conclude on the merits there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the photographs were relevant to the prosecution\u2019s case. Here, the first degree murder charges were tried under the theory that the killings were premeditated or perpetrated during a robbery and burglary. \u201cThe photographs were pertinent because they showed the nature and placement of the fatal wounds,\u201d and supported the prosecution\u2019s theory regarding how the murders occurred. <em>(People v. Pride </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 195, 243 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 833 P.2d 643]; see <em>People v. Crittenden, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at pp. 132-133.) In addition, the photographs clarified the coroner\u2019s and other witnesses\u2019 testimony regarding the victims\u2019 wounds and the locations in which two of the victims\u2019 bodies were found. <em>(People v. Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 132.) Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the prosecution was not obligated to \u201caccept antiseptic stipulations in lieu of photographic evidence.\u201d <em>(People v. Pride, supra, 3 </em>Cal.4th at p. 243; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\">Moreover, the photographs were not cumulative. \u201cWe often have rejected the contention that photographs of a murder victim must be excluded as cumulative simply because testimony also has been introduced to prove the facts that the photographs are intended to establish.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 134-135.) The same principle applies to crime scene photographs. While defendant contends the photographs \u201cwere cumulative of each other,\u201d \u201cdepicting essentially the same view of the victims,\u201d our review of the record is otherwise. Indeed, the trial court carefully evaluated defendant\u2019s objections, the prosecution\u2019s response thereto, and the coroner\u2019s voir dire testimony, and excluded several photographs on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>Defendant contends the trial court erred in not expressly considering whether the probative value of the photographs outweighed their prejudicial impact. Of course, as noted above, defendant did not challenge the photographs on this basis. Moreover, the trial court \u201c \u2018need not expressly weigh prejudice against probative value\u2014or even expressly state that [it] has done so . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Waidla, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 724, fn. 6.) \u201c \u2018The record as a whole shows the court was well aware of, and consistently performed, its duty ... to balance the probative value of evidence against any prejudicial effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Riel, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 1187-1188.) In any event, after independently reviewing the photographs, we conclude they were not unduly gruesome or inherently inflammatory, and are unpersuaded for the reasons above that we should reach a different result based on the graphic nature of the photographs, the number of photographs, or the fact that one of the victims was a child. <em>{People v. Pride, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 243.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">Finally, defendant contends admission of the photographs was also unduly prejudicial at the penalty phase. Here, the challenged evidence, which illustrated the precise nature of the crime, was admissible under section 190.3, factor (a) (factor (a)). Factor (a) makes admissible evidence of the \u201c \u2018circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true . . . <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davenport, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at pp. 1205-1206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">In <em>People v. Davenport, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 1171, we first noted that defendant had waived any objection to the challenged photographs and physical evidence by failing to object below. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1205.) Had the claim been preserved, we would have then concluded it lacked merit because the trial court has no discretion under Evidence Code section 352 to exclude such evidence at the penalty phase on the basis that it is unduly inflammatory or lacking in probative value. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davenport, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1206.) In so doing, we relied on <em>People </em>v. <em>Karis </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 612, 641 [250 Cal.Rptr. 659, 758 P.2d 1189]. <em>(People v. Davenport, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1205.) We further observed that the trial court retains its inherent discretion to exclude evidence admissible under factor (a) based on the form of the evidence, i.e., that a particular piece of evidence is inaccurate or cumulative. <em>(Davenport, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">Similarly here, defendant did not object below that the prejudicial impact of the challenged photographs outweighed their probative value at the penalty phase. Nevertheless, defendant makes such a challenge in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">Reading <em>Davenport </em>as a whole, including its reliance on <em>Karis, </em>it stands for the proposition that the trial court lacks discretion to exclude <em>all </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>factor (a) evidence on the ground it is inflammatory or lacking in probative value. (See <em>People v. Karis, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at pp. 641-642, fn. 21, italics added [\u201cWe hold here only that the court does not have discretion to prevent introduction at the penalty phase of <em>all </em>evidence of a capital defendant\u2019s commission or attempted commission of a prior violent felony.\u201d].) Neither factor (a) nor section 190.3, factor (b) (factor (b)), however, deprives the trial court of its traditional discretion to exclude \u201cparticular items of evidence\u201d by which the prosecution seeks to demonstrate either the circumstances of the crime (factor (a)), or violent criminal activity (factor (b)), in a \u201cmanner\u201d that is misleading, cumulative, or unduly inflammatory. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Karis, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at pp. 641-642, fn. 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">We emphasize, however, that at the penalty phase, the trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude circumstances-of-the-crime evidence as unduly prejudicial is more circumscribed than at the guilt phase. During the guilt phase, there is a legitimate concern that crime scene photographs such as are at issue here can produce a visceral response that unfairly tempts jurors to find the defendant guilty of the charged crimes. Such concerns are greatly diminished at the penalty phase because the defendant has been found guilty of the charged crimes, and the jury\u2019s discretion is focused on the circumstances of those crimes solely to determine the defendant\u2019s sentence. Indeed, the sentencer is <em>expected </em>to subjectively weigh the evidence, and the prosecution is entitled to place the capital offense and the offender in a morally bad light.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">Moreover, the question of whether evidence is unduly inflammatory is closer under factor (b) than factor (a) to the extent the penalty jury must decide whether the factor (b) crime actually occurred beyond a reasonable doubt as well as assess its moral weight for purposes of sentencing. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 21, 53-55 [188 Cal.Rptr. 77, 655 P.2d 279].) The factor (b) evidence, even if it fairly depicts the moral blameworthiness of the defendant, may nonetheless be excludable under Evidence Code section 352 insofar as it unfairly persuades jurors to find the defendant guilty of the crime\u2019s commission. This danger is not present with factor (a) evidence at the penalty phase because the jury has already found the defendant guilty of the capital offense. The trial court\u2019s Evidence Code section 352 discretion to exclude relevant factor (a) evidence is reduced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">Here, the prosecution did not introduce any evidence at the penalty phase, but merely relied on its guilt phase evidence. We have already concluded the challenged photographs were not unduly prejudicial at the guilt phase. Thus, for the reasons stated above, defendant was not unduly prejudiced at the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>10. <em>References to Bryan\u2019s Third Birthday</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">Prior to trial defendant moved in limine to preclude any reference to the fact that Bryan was murdered on his third birthday. The trial court denied the motion, stating that the \u201ccircumstances of the birthday celebration [were] relevant,\u201d the \u201cfact it was the child\u2019s birthday adds little to the emotional impact of the homicide itself,\u201d and \u201c[c]oaching witnesses to leave out facts impairs the ability of juries to evaluate their credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">Defendant here renews his contention that the references to the fact that Bryan was killed on his third birthday were irrelevant to any contested fact and should have been excluded. No error is demonstrated. Evidence regarding Bryan\u2019s birthday helped place the testimony of prosecution witnesses in context and assisted the jury in assessing their credibility. For example, Randi Renken indicated she had the opportunity to see the significant sum of money later stolen from April\u2019s purse because the two shopped for birthday presents the day before the capital crime. The trial court was reasonably concerned that requiring witnesses to edit their testimony might make that testimony seem halting and less credible. In addition, the trial court was correct that the fact of the birthday added little to the emotional impact of a three-year-old\u2019s murder. The trial court was well within its discretion in concluding the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudice. In any event, even assuming the trial court erred, defendant could not have been prejudiced, since he said in his police statement, which the jury heard, that he knew August 9 was Bryan\u2019s birthday prior to going to the Gilhousen residence that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">Defendant also contends admission of this evidence prejudiced him at the penalty phase because the prosecutor asked the jury to consider the circumstances of the crime, including the fact that defendant knew it was Bryan\u2019s third birthday, and nevertheless went to the Gilhousen residence on August 9, and returned there after unsuccessfully chasing Rodney Almond. Such argument was fair comment on the evidence, and could properly be considered in assessing defendant\u2019s moral culpability at sentencing. Indeed, defense counsel also referred to Bryan\u2019s birthday in his penalty phase closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">11. <em>Alleged Error in Limiting Impeachment of Expert Witness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">As noted above, Dr. Zigelbaum testified as an expert witness on Flores\u2019s behalf, and opined that Flores had dependent personality traits. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1175-1176.) Zigelbaum\u2019s credibility was impeached when it was revealed that the Massachusetts State Board of Registration had filed formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>charges of unprofessional conduct against him that could result in revocation or suspension of his medical license. Defendant\u2019s counsel was precluded, however, from eliciting the nature of the charges, which included allegations of sexual misconduct with six patients, and use of cocaine and marijuana with patients and a baby-sitter. Defendant contends the trial court\u2019s ruling rendered the trial fundamentally unfair and violated his right to confront and cross-examine witnesses under the federal and state Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">Confrontation clause and fairness principles generally guarantee a criminal defendant the right to explore a witness\u2019s bias on cross-examination. (See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 308, 316 [94 S.Ct. 1105, 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d 347].) They do not, however, prevent the trial court from imposing reasonable limits on defense counsel\u2019s inquiry based on concerns about harassment, confusion of the issues, or relevance. (See <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 673, 679 [106 S.Ct. 1431, 1435, 89 L.Ed.2d 674].) Here, at the time of trial, the charges of unprofessional conduct against Zigelbaum, while significant and troubling, were pending and unadjudicated. Unlike <em>Lindh </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(7th Cir. 1997) 124 F.3d 899, on which defendant relies, the jury learned Zigelbaum\u2019s license to practice medicine was under review because of allegations of professional misconduct; it simply did not learn what those allegations were. The trial court reasonably concluded the proposed line of questioning was extraneous under Evidence Code section 352. While defendant now refers to the impeachment value of a \u201cparade of six responsible citizens . . . testifying,\u201d he never sought to introduce such evidence below. Rather, defense counsel proposed cross-examining the doctor on the basis of newspaper articles. Indeed, it is not even clear the names of the six complaining patients were public information. Moreover, while defendant was permitted to elicit that Zigelbaum was currently \u201canathema\u201d to the prosecution offices listed on his resume, he never did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">Even assuming the trial court erred in precluding the testimony regarding the nature of the charges, it is apparent defendant was not prejudiced at either the guilt or penalty phase. As noted above, Zigelbaum was not permitted to testify that in his opinion the events on August 9, 1989, at the Gilhousen residence had occurred in a certain way. Rather, he was asked to assume that certain events had occurred and base his opinion on these assumptions. The jury was expressly and repeatedly instructed that the assumptions were not evidence, and that the jury was the sole finder of fact as to what had occurred on that day. Nor was Zigelbaum permitted to state an opinion as to <em>defendant\u2019s </em>mental state. Moreover, Zigelbaum was impeached not only by the fact that misconduct charges were pending, but also by the fact that he was not board-certified in either psychiatry or forensic psychiatry, his curriculum vitae was substantially misleading, and his opinion of Flores\u2019s diminished culpability for the murders was unshaken by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>Flores\u2019s seemingly inconsistent behavior, such as his failure to seek assistance from anyone after Chandler\u2019s death even though he had the opportunity to speak to his sister, and later to Burns when defendant was not present. Indeed, it is apparent the jury rejected Zigelbaum\u2019s opinion as not credible, because it convicted Flores on all first degree murder, robbery, burglary, and conspiracy counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">Defendant further summarily argues that as a result of Zigelbaum\u2019s testimony, he was entitled to an independent psychiatric exam of Flores. He cites no basis on which such an exam is authorized, and we are aware of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">12. <em>Alleged Error in Admitting Attempted Escape Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">Defendant alleges the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his uncharged escape attempt to show consciousness of guilt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">On August 22, 1990, defendant was housed on the third floor of the San Diego jail. That morning, he was allowed to leave the third floor and walk up to the sixth floor dispensary. Approximately 11:00 a.m., when defendant was done, he was placed back in the stairwell and sent to the third floor. When he arrived at the third floor, Deputy Sheriff Barber was unable to open the door at that time and told defendant to wait. Approximately 30 minutes later, when Barber turned his attention to the stairwell, defendant was not there. A search ensued. Shortly afterwards, defendant was seen descending the stairwell to the third floor entrance. A subsequent search revealed defendant had hidden tan \u201ctrusty\u201d clothing under his blue jail outfit. Such clothing was stored in the eighth floor laundry and occasionally left in a neighboring portion of the stairwell. \u201cTrusties\u201d were inmates who generally had greater privileges, including the ability to leave the jail on work assignments. Defendant was not a trusty, and was therefore not permitted to have such clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s relevance and Evidence Code section 352 objections to this evidence, finding it relevant and stating \u201cits greatest tendency would be to suggest that [the district attorney] lacks confidence in her circumstantial case and that she\u2019s grabbing . . . . Now, the real question that you\u2019re raising and that we ought not to ignore, even though we aren\u2019t trying it at this time, is the suggestion that the mention of the concept of escape is going to prejudice the jury on the question of penalty, if we come to that stage. I simply do not believe that jurors are entitled to that little credit, that the idea that somebody might escape would never occur to them; and given the quality of the evidence of this .... this flimsy escape is not going to terrify the jury that some madman may be afoot in the community, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>and therefore I do not find it unduly prejudicial under 352.\u201d The jury was instructed at the time the evidence was received that it was admissible for the limited purpose of what \u201cbearing as it may have in showing [defendant\u2019s] consciousness of guilt.\u201d In addition, it was instructed at the conclusion of the guilt phase, \u201cThe attempted escape of a person after the commission of a crime, or after he is accused of a crime, is not sufficient in itself to establish his guilt, but is a fact which, if proved, may be considered by you in the light of all other proved facts in deciding the question of his guilt or innocence. Whether or not the evidence shows an attempted escape or a consciousness of guilt, and the significance to be attached to such a circumstance, are matters for your consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">The trial court acted within its discretion in admitting the evidence, subject to appropriate limiting instruction. \u201cEvidence of a planned escape permits an inference of consciousness of guilt, even if the escape was not actually attempted.\u201d <em>(People v. Morris </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 152, 196 [279 Cal.Rptr. 720, 807 P.2d 949].) Here, the evidence showed both that defendant possessed contraband and one use for that contraband. While defendant is correct that defendant\u2019s intent in possessing the clothes was not \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d the jury was instructed this was an issue for it to decide. No error is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">Nor could defendant have been prejudiced at the penalty phase. No reference to the incident was made at the penalty phase, and the jury was instructed as to the factors it could appropriately consider in determining penalty. (See <em>People v. Riel, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 1208-1209.) We therefore reject defendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of a fair and reliable penalty determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">13. <em>Alleged Misconduct by Prosecutor and Codefendant\u2019s Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">Defendant alleges numerous instances of misconduct by both the prosecutor and Flores\u2019s counsel during the guilt phase, claiming they violated his constitutional right to due process and a fair trial. At the outset we note that as a general rule, objections to codefendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s actions do not fall within the rubric of \u201cmisconduct.\u201d  Reasonably understood, the claim on appeal is that the trial court violated the evidence rules in admitting certain testimony over defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">Here, Flores\u2019s counsel elicited from Flores that Flores was afraid of defendant after he saw defendant hit Chandler with a baseball bat. Counsel then asked, \u201cAre you still afraid of Chris Box?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Counsel then approached Flores, and asked, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a[n] elevator band.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>\u201cWhat\u2019s an elevator band?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so when I have to go places, I go through the elevator instead of the stairwell.\u201d \u201cAnd why don\u2019t you go in the stairwell?\u201d Defendant\u2019s objection was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">Flores\u2019s evidence that he was afraid of defendant was relevant to his duress defense. Moreover, Flores and defendant blamed each other for the murders. The jury could reasonably conclude that if Flores\u2019s version of the August 9 events were true, he had reason to fear defendant; if his version were false, he similarly should feel frightened of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">During Flores\u2019s cross-examination of Rodney Almond, counsel asked if Almond recalled testifying at the preliminary hearing. Almond said yes. \u201cYou had\u2014or you expressed some reluctance at that hearing in identifying Mr. Box, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d \u201cWas that because you felt you were being threatened?\u201d \u201cYeah, I believe so.\u201d Defendant objected, and the court stated, \u201cOh, I think I\u2019ll let you take care of it on cross.\u201d On redirect, the prosecutor asked, \u201cWere you afraid of Mr. Box when you testified at the first preliminary exam?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe so.\u201d On cross-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel, Almond was asked, \u201cAnd when you stated that you felt threatened and that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t identify Mr. Box, you weren\u2019t threatened by Mr. Box in particular, were you?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">Of course, the reason Almond failed to originally identify defendant was relevant to the strength of his identification at trial. The trial court therefore did not abuse its discretion in overruling the objection. Moreover, Almond subsequently clarified any misimpression created by his response to the question posed by Flores\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">Defendant also contends there were several instances of prosecutorial misconduct. First, he claims the prosecutor violated a court order when she asked jail guard Edward Wells on how many occasions he had seen a trusty make an unauthorized trusty badge. Defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied the motion, and expressly ruled that the question was within what it intended to be the scope of its order, and if the court had been presented with that question at the time of its ruling, \u201cI would have allowed that question and answer and nothing more.\u201d It also stated, \u201cThat much is legitimate; that much she\u2019s got; that\u2019s all she gets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">Next, defendant claims the prosecutor committed misconduct during her questioning of Dennis Burns. Bums testified on cross-examination that prior to his testimony at the preliminary hearing he had taken two Valium pills, and that he had lied under oath at the hearing when he testified he had not taken any drugs that day. On redirect, the prosecutor asked, \u201cAt the time that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>you testified at the preliminary exam for Mr. Box you testified to the same material that you\u2019re now telling the jury; is that correct?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd you had taken two Valiums before you came to court?\u201d \u201cYes, I did.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI was scared.\u201d \u201cOf what?\u201d \u201cWell\u2014\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s objection was overruled. Bums said, \u201cWell, first of all, I heard the first preliminary hearing had some\u2014or first hearing had some problems in the hallway. I was\u2014you know, I was afraid about taking the stand. I was nervous. I hear Valiums calm that.\u201d There was no objection, and the subject matter was changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">Assuming defendant has not waived a claim of prosecutorial misconduct by failing to renew his objection, there was no misconduct. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the prosecutor did not question Burns \u201cin such a way that implied he had been threatened by\u201d defendant. Nor did her questioning \u201ccreate the implication that [defendant] was responsible for causing problems in the hall or for authorizing someone to frighten witnesses.\u201d Indeed, it was unclear whether the hearing Burns referred to involved defendant, or what the \u201cproblems\u201d were with reference to that hearing; moreover, his information was not based on personal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">Next, defendant challenges a conversation between the prosecutor and Almond at the preliminary hearing. As noted above, Almond testified at trial that he had initially failed to identify defendant at the preliminary hearing because he felt threatened. On cross-examination, defendant\u2019s counsel asked Almond, \u201c[W]hen you stated that you felt threatened and that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t identify Mr. Box [at the preliminary hearing], you weren\u2019t threatened by Mr. Box in particular, were you?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cIn fact, when you initially failed to identify him, there was a recess in the proceedings, correct?\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d Almond further testified that the prosecutor had taken him to a back room and said \u201csomething to the effect that \u2018This isn\u2019t a game and don\u2019t bullshit around. This is serious.\u2019 \u201d Defense counsel inquired, \u201cAnd so after you had this conversation with [the prosecutor], you were then able to make an identification?\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, reminding a witness of the gravity of the proceedings is not misconduct. Nothing in the prosecutor\u2019s remarks can be construed as coercion or intimidation to testify falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">Finally, defendant contends that during closing argument, the prosecutor \u201creferred to \u2018facts\u2019 which were nowhere in evidence, and invited jurors to base their verdict on unfounded speculation.\u201d In particular, defendant now objects to the prosecutor\u2019s statement that Bryan said to defendant, \u201cChris, why did you break my mommy\u2019s window?\u201d We reject defendant\u2019s claim at the outset because he failed to satisfy the general rule requiring assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>of misconduct and request for admonition as to the prosecutor\u2019s comment of which he now complains, and no exception is applicable. <em>{People v. Berry-man </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1048, 1072 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 867, 864 P.2d 40], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 823, fn. 1 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 656, 952 P.2d 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">We also reject the claim on the merits. In Flores\u2019s police statement, which was presented to the jury, he stated that he and defendant drove off to look for Almond. When they did so, defendant closed the door and it locked. When defendant returned, he had to break Bryan\u2019s bedroom window to reenter. \u201cHe broke the window and that\u2019s when ... he said the little boy said, \u2018You broke my window.\u2019 \u201d Moreover, there was evidence in the record that Bryan knew defendant and called him \u201cChris.\u201d While the prosecutor clearly modified Flores\u2019s statement to increase its sympathetic value, her modification was based on inferences drawn from the record. Moreover, defendant was free to remind the jury of the actual language in Flores\u2019s statement. No misconduct is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">14. <em>Alleged Instructional Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">Defendant alleges the trial court committed numerous reversible instructional errors that deprived him of due process, a fair trial, effective assistance of counsel, a reliable guilt determination, and a reliable death verdict. We do not find his claims persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">First, defendant contends the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the testimony of a single witness, if believed, was sufficient to establish defendant\u2019s guilt, but failing to instruct the jury that an accomplice\u2019s testimony must be corroborated and should be viewed with distrust. (\u00a7 1111; CALJIC Nos. 2.27, 3.11, 3.18; see CALJIC Nos. 3.10, 3.12, 3.13.) Defendant requested such accomplice instructions below. The court denied the request, stating such an instruction was generally inapplicable when the accomplice was a codefendant, and it would be fundamentally unfair to Flores.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-9\">We have since clarified that \u201cwhenever an accomplice, or a witness who might be determined by the jury to be an accomplice, testifies,\u201d the court should sua sponte instruct the jury as follows: \u201c \u2018To the extent an accomplice gives testimony that tends to incriminate the defendant, it should be viewed with caution. This does not mean, however, that you may arbitrarily disregard that testimony. You should give that testimony the weight you think it deserves after examining it with care and caution and in the light of all the evidence in the case.\u2019 Such a pretailored instruction is applicable regardless which party called the accomplice.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number><em>Guiuan </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 558, 569 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 239, 957 P.2d 928].)  Here, of course, neither the prosecution nor defendant called Flores as a witness, and hence <em>Guiuan </em>is not directly controlling. Nevertheless, just as in the case of an accomplice called to testify by the prosecution, Flores\u2019s testimony was \u201csubject to the taint of an improper motive, i.e., that of promoting his . . . own self interest by inculpating the defendant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 568.) Thus, there appears to be no persuasive reason not to require such an instruction when requested by a defendant in a case where the codefendant testifies. (See <em>People v. Alvarez, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 217-219 [trial court did not abuse its discretion in instructing jury to view with distrust testimony of an accomplice-defendant that tends to incriminate a codefendant because such a defendant \u201chas the motive, opportunity, and means to try to help himself at the other\u2019s expense\u201d].) Accordingly, here, the trial court should have instructed the jury to view Flores\u2019s testimony with care and caution to the extent it tended to incriminate defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">Nevertheless, defendant was not prejudiced. The jury was aware defendant and Flores were at the scene when the triple murder occurred, and had every motivation to shift blame to each other. Moreover, Flores\u2019s testimony was corroborated by the physical evidence, defendant\u2019s statements, and the testimony of other witnesses, including Almond. Under these circumstances, it is not reasonably probable that the jury would have reached a result more favorable to defendant had it been instructed to view with care and caution that portion of Flores\u2019s testimony that inculpated defendant. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Arias </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 92, 143 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 913 P.2d 980]; <em>People v. Mincey, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 461.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">Defendant next contends the trial court erred in failing to instruct that if the jury found Flores\u2019s testimony \u201cfailed to explain or deny any evidence against him introduced by the prosecution which he can reasonably be expected to deny or explain because of facts within his knowledge, you may take that failure into consideration as tending to indicate the truth of such evidence. ...\u201d (CALJIC No. 2.62.) The trial court expressed concern the instruction was not appropriate when only one codefendant testifies, and noted he could not possibly rule on the propriety of the instruction until after Flores actually testified. Defendant did not renew the request after Flores\u2019s testimony, and hence the claim is waived on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">Nor was counsel ineffective in failing to renew the request. Even now defendant does not persuasively identify what facts were in Flores\u2019s particular knowledge that he failed to explain or deny, warranting this instruction. <em>(People v. Saddler </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 671, 682-683 [156 Cal.Rptr. 871, 597 P.2d 130].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>Next, defendant contends the trial court erred in instructing the jury that if it found defendant had attempted an escape, that was \u201cnot sufficient in itself to establish his guilt,\u201d but was a fact that may be considered \u201cin the light of all other proved facts in deciding the question of his guilt or innocence. Whether or not the evidence shows an attempted escape or a consciousness of guilt and the significance to be attached to such a circumstance are matters for your consideration.\u201d There was no error. As noted earlier, \u201cEvidence of a planned escape permits an inference of consciousness of guilt, even if the escape was not actually attempted.\u201d <em>(People v. Morris, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 196.) Nor did the instruction prejudice defendant at the penalty phase. Again, as noted above, the evidence of attempted escape was not mentioned at the penalty phase, and the jury was instructed regarding the factors it could appropriately consider in determining defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">Next, defendant contends the trial court erred in modifying the former reasonable doubt instruction. (Former CALJIC No. 2.90.) As modified, the instruction provided: \u201cReasonable doubt is a state of the case in which the jurors, after comparison and consideration of all the evidence, do not feel an abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the charge. It is not a mere possible doubt, because everything relating to human affairs is open to some possible or imaginary doubt.\u201d While we have cautioned \u201cagainst trial court experimentation\u201d with this instruction, the jury was adequately advised of the People\u2019s burden of proof. <em>(People v. Freeman </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 450, 504 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 558, 882 P.2d 249, 31 A.L.R.5th 888]; see <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 1, 6 [114 S.Ct. 1239, 1243, 127 L.Ed.2d 583].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">Defendant next contends the trial court erred in modifying CALIIC No. 2.00 regarding the definition of circumstantial evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In particular, he contends the trial court\u2019s instruction \u201cfailed to inform jurors that the crucial facts from which inferences could be drawn were limited to those facts which were themselves established by the evidence.\u201d As such, the jurors would have felt at liberty to include such extraneous considerations as racial stereotypes. Not so. The modified instruction expressly stated that \u201cboth the underlying facts and the inferences drawn from those facts must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>Next, defendant contends the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the crime of conspiracy to commit burglary because this charge was not contained in the information. Actually, the trial court did not so instruct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather, during Flores\u2019s defense, the prosecution stated it intended to proceed on a theory of burglary-murder based on an uncharged conspiracy to commit burglary. The trial court stated it would so instruct, stating the pleadings put the defense \u201con notice of both a previous intent to burgle and previous intent to rob.\u201d The prosecution \u201ccharged the robbery in order to be conservative on the theory that there could be a conspiracy to commit robbery without burglary; but if there was a conspiracy hatched before the entry, then it was to do both and, therefore, they cover the ground adequately.\u201d Flores, but not defendant, objected below. Defendant now claims he lacked proper notice the prosecutor intended to rely on \u201cfelony-murder theories and a burglary in pursuance of a conspiracy.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">Here, the information charged defendant with three murders, burglary, robbery, the special circumstances that the murders were committed in the commission of a burglary and robbery, and conspiracy to commit robbery. As an overt act in furtherance of the robbery conspiracy, the prosecution alleged defendant entered the Gilhousen residence.  \u201c \u2018 [I]t is not necessary to separately charge a defendant with either a felony-murder theory or the underlying felony. Felony murder and premeditated murder are not distinct crimes; rather, they constitute \u201ctwo kinds of first degree murder\u201d requiring different elements of proof.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 463, 514 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 826, 896 P.2d 119].)  Here, defendant <em>was </em>charged with burglary and the special circumstance of murder in the commission of burglary. Moreover, he was informed during trial that the prosecution intended to proceed on a burglary-murder theory, and the trial court intended to instruct on this theory. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 513 [notice adequate when the defendant informed from beginning of trial that prosecution intended to proceed on a theory of rape murder, and trial court indicated willingness to do so if sufficient evidence adduced].) He did not object, and made no request for a continuance on the basis that such notice was inadequate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number><em>(Ibid.) </em>Hence, his reliance on <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Rees </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 909 F.2d 1234 is misplaced. Nor has defendant persuasively demonstrated that his defense strategy was materially affected by the addition of this instruction. <em>(People v. Davis, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 513.) No error is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">Defendant next challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to give his modified instruction regarding defendant\u2019s good character. The jury was instructed in the language of CALJIC No. 2.40. Defendant claims this was error because the court\u2019s instruction failed to inform the jury what it \u201cshould do in response to reasonable doubt based on good character.\u201d We disagree. The court instructed the jury that \u201c[g]ood character for the traits involved in the commission of a crime charged, may be sufficient by itself to raise a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of a defendant.\u201d The jury had already been instructed that \u201cin case of a reasonable doubt whether [a defendant\u2019s] guilt is satisfactorily shown, he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty.\u201d There was no need to repeat this principle in the context of the challenged good character instruction. Moreover, we have already rejected defendant\u2019s contention that the reasonable doubt instruction was improperly modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">Next, defendant contends the trial court committed reversible error when it misspoke while giving the jury instructions. As defendant acknowledges, misreading instructions is at most harmless error when the written instructions received by the jury are correct. <em>(People v. Osband </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 622, 687 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 26, 919 P.2d 640].) That is the case here. Defendant\u2019s efforts to distinguish <em>Osband </em>are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-7\">Next, defendant contends the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser related offense of assault with a deadly weapon. Defendant relies on <em>People v. Geiger </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 510 [199 Cal.Rptr. 45, 674 P.2d 1303, 50 A.L.R.4th 1055]. <em>Geiger </em>was overruled in <em>People </em>v. <em>Birks </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 108, 136 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 848, 960 P.2d 1073], and that ruling is fully retroactive. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-8\">Next, defendant contends the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it did not have to unanimously agree on the theory of first degree murder, i.e., felony murder or deliberate and premeditated murder. Not so. Although the elements underlying the theories differ, there is only a single statutory offense of first degree murder. <em>(People v. Carpenter </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 394 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 935 P.2d 708].) <em>Schad v. Arizona </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 624, 630-631, 645 [111 S.Ct. 2491, 2496-2497, 2504, 115 L.Ed.2d 555], on which defendant relies, does not hold otherwise. Nor is malice an element of felony murder. <em>(People v. Carpenter, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 394.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-9\">Finally, defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing to give an imperfect self-defense instruction. Defendant told police that while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>he and Flores waited in the living room for April, Flores suggested they \u201cjack,\u201d (i.e., beat) the occupants and steal the marijuana; defendant rejected the idea. Defendant then began assisting Chandler, who was assembling Bryan\u2019s tricycle, in the kitchen. Flores entered the kitchen with a baseball bat and attempted to strike Chandler with it. Chandler knocked the bat from Flores\u2019s hand, picked up a knife, and came towards defendant. Defendant grabbed the bat, knocked the knife from Chandler\u2019s hand, and struck Chandler on the head. Flores then cut Chandler\u2019s throat with a box cutter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">Even assuming substantial evidence supported an imperfect self-defense instruction, there was no prejudice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 684, fn. 12 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1].) The jury necessarily rejected defendant\u2019s account when it found the felony-murder special-circumstance allegations true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">15. <em>Alleged Error Regarding Providing Jury Written Transcripts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-7\">During guilt phase deliberations, the jury sent a note requesting the testimony of Randi Renken and Marcus Boykin. The trial judge gave the jury transcripts of this testimony after having the court reporter make certain redactions, and allowing counsel to review the 62-page transcript and make comments. Both the People and defendants requested that the jury be read back the testimony, not given written transcripts. The trial court denied the request. Defendant claims this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">Section 1138 provides that \u201c[a]fter the jury have retired for deliberation, if there be any disagreement between them as to the testimony, or if they desire to be informed on any point of law arising in the case, they must require the officer to conduct them into court. Upon being brought into court, the information required must be given in the presence of, or after notice to, the prosecuting attorney, and the defendant or his counsel, or after they have been called.\u201d We have stated that under this section, \u201cthe trial court must satisfy requests by the jury for the rereading of testimony.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ainsworth </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 984, 1020 [248 Cal.Rptr. 568, 755 P.2d 1017].) We have also held, however, that it is not \u201cimproper for a court, with the consent of the accused and his counsel, to provide a transcript to the jury in lieu of rereading testimony in open court.\u201d <em>(People v. Odle </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 386, 407 [247 Cal.Rptr. 137, 754 P.2d 184].) The question here is whether the trial court may do so over the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-9\">\u201cThe rereading of testimony is not a critical stage of the proceedings.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ayala </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 225, 288 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 1 P.3d 3].) Hence, the trial court\u2019s procedure did not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>right to be present or to counsel at a critical stage of trial. Nor does he persuasively demonstrate his right to a jury trial was violated by this procedure, and he waived below any objection to the procedure based on his right to a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">We also reject defendant\u2019s claim the trial court violated a statutory right under section 1138. Section 1138 requires the testimony to be furnished; the form in which it is furnished, i.e., written or oral, is apparently in the trial court\u2019s discretion. Even assuming error, defendant does not persuasively demonstrate how he was thereby prejudiced or denied a fair trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Frye </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 1007 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 25, 959 P.2d 183]; <em>People v. Fauber </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 792, 836-837 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 24, 831 P.2d 249]; <em>People v. Ainsworth, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 1020.) Rather, it is not reasonably probable that the outcome would have been different had the testimony been reread instead of being provided in writing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ainsworth, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 1020.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">16. <em>Cumulative Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-7\">Defendant asserts that even if the errors alleged above are not in themselves reversible, they are so cumulatively. We disagree. The few errors that may have occurred during defendant\u2019s trial were harmless whether considered individually or collectively. Defendant was entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect one. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cain </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1, 82 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 481, 892 P.2d 1224].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-8\">B. <em>Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-9\">1. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-10\">Defendant alleges numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct and improper questioning by Flores\u2019s counsel in violation of his right to due process, a fair trial, an impartial jury, and a reliable death verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-11\">Defendant first contends he was prejudiced at the penalty phase by the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct during her examination of jail guard Edward Wells in the guilt phase regarding evidence of prior escapes. (See <em>ante, </em>at p. 1206.) There was no misconduct at the guilt phase, and hence defendant was not prejudiced at the penalty phase. Indeed, no\" reference to the alleged escape incident was made at the penalty phase, and the jury was instructed as to the factors it could appropriately consider in determining penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-12\">Next, defendant claims he was prejudiced at the penalty phase by improper questions by the prosecutor and Flores\u2019s counsel suggesting defendant had threatened witnesses. We have rejected these claims above; hence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>defendant was not thereby prejudiced at the penalty phase. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1205-1206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">Next, defendant claims he was prejudiced at the penalty phase by Almond\u2019s coerced identification of defendant at the preliminary hearing. There was no misconduct, and hence defendant was not prejudiced thereby at the penalty phase. (See <em>ante, </em>at p. 1207.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">Defendant next contends the prosecutor committed misconduct during her penalty phase argument. First, he contends the prosecutor misstated the record when she attributed to Bryan the comment, \u201cWhy did you break my mommy\u2019s window?\u201d We reject defendant\u2019s claim at the outset because he failed to satisfy the general rule requiring assignment of misconduct and request for admonition as to the prosecutor\u2019s comment of which he now complains, and no exception is applicable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Berryman, supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1072.) We also reject the claim on the merits for the reasons we rejected a similar claim at the guilt phase. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1207-1208.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-7\">Defendant next contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct when she stated defendant was the same age as April Gilhousen, and subsequently said, \u201cDefense counsel points to [section 190.3, factor (i)], the age of the defendant at the time of the crime. This is a mitigating factor, if you should so find it. If you find a lack of this mitigating factor, it doesn\u2019t come over into the aggravating side, but what I ask you to look at is not the chronological age of Mr. Box, but I ask you to look at the sophistication.\u201d The prosecutor then detailed defendant\u2019s college attendance, his attention to detail at the Gilhousen residence after the murders were committed, and his similarity in age to those in the military then stationed in Saudi Arabia. Such argument was appropriate. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, chronological age is not \u201call that is relevant to this factor.\u201d <em>(Tuilaepa </em>v. <em>California </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 967, 977 [114 S.Ct. 2630, 2637, 129 L.Ed.2d 750] [\u201cBoth the prosecution and the defense may present valid arguments as to the significance of the defendant\u2019s age in a particular case.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-8\">Defendant next contends the prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing defendant\u2019s lack of remorse was an aggravating factor. She did not. The prosecutor said, defendant \u201cgoes to Jack in the Box soon after committing these murders and he eats. It has not had an effect upon him whatsoever.\u201d The prosecutor further noted that defendant went about his everyday business not acting any differently, and fell asleep during a break in his interrogation. These statements were a fair comment on the state of the evidence. \u201c[T]he prosecutor merely anticipated predictable defense argument urging sympathy for defendant and sought to negate its mitigating effect by highlighting defendant\u2019s apparent lack of concern for the murder victim[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number><em>(People V. Bemore </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 809, 855 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 840, 996 P.2d 1152].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">Defendant next contends the prosecutor committed misconduct when she referred to the fact defendant went to and then returned to the Gilhousen residence, knowing it was Bryan\u2019s third birthday. We have already rejected this claim above. (See <em>ante, </em>at p. 1202.) No misconduct is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">Finally, defendant contends the cumulative effect of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct constitutes reversible error. There was no misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-7\">2. <em>Alleged Instructional Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-8\">Defendant asserts the jury should have been instructed that the aggravating factors must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt (there was no unadjudicated criminal activity alleged in this case), that to impose the death penalty, the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors, and that death must be found to be the appropriate penalty beyond a reasonable doubt. We have consistently rejected these claims. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 1059; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 153.)  Nor does defendant\u2019s alternative claim that the trial court erred by not giving the jury any standard of proof have merit. The jury was instructed that \u201c[t]o return a judgment of death, each of you must be persuaded that the aggravating circumstances are so substantial in comparison with the mitigating circumstances that it warrants death instead of life without parole.\u201d That is sufficient. <em>(Tuilaepa v. California, supra, </em>512 U.S. at p. 979 [114 S.Ct. at p. 2638] [jury \u201cneed not be instructed how to weigh any particular fact in the capital sentencing decision\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1231.) \u201cUnlike the guilt determination, \u2018the sentencing function is inherently moral and normative, not factual\u2019 [citation] and, hence, not susceptible to a burden-of-proof quantification.\u201d <em>(People v. Hawthorne </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 43, 79 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 133, 841 P.2d 118].) Nor, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, did the trial court err in failing to instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree that a particular aggravating circumstance exists. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-10\">Defendant next contends it was error not to instruct the jury to refrain from drawing any inference from the fact that defendant did not testify at the penalty phase. Not so. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davenport, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1231.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-11\">Defendant also contends the jury should have been instructed that it could not consider as an aggravating factor any aspect of defendant\u2019s crimes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>were elements of first degree murder. In particular, he contends that the trial court should have informed the jury of the definition of an \u201caggravating circumstance\u201d contained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Dyer </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 26, 77 [246 Cal.Rptr. 209, 753 P.2d 1]. In fact, the trial court did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">3. <em>Alleged Unconstitutionality of Death Sentencing Statute and Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-7\">Defendant contends the California death statute is unconstitutional in numerous respects. We have previously rejected all of these arguments, and defendant cites no compelling reason to reconsider our decisions. Thus, the California death statute is not unconstitutional in failing to require the jury to make explicit findings of the factors it finds in aggravation and mitigation <em>{People v. Davenport, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1232), require intercase or intracase proportionality review <em>{People v. Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 1053 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 209), delete inapplicable factors <em>{People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 207-208), identify which factors are aggravating and which are mitigating <em>{People v. Crittenden, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 153), require that aggravating factors be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, require that the aggravating factors must outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, require that death must be found to be the appropriate penalty beyond a reasonable doubt <em>{ibid.), </em>or require that there be any burden of proof <em>{People </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 79). Nor are the factors a jury may consider in determining penalty, such as the circumstances of the crime, the defendant\u2019s age, or the use of the adjectives \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201csubstantial,\u201d unconstitutionally vague. <em>{Tuilaepa v. California, supra, </em>512 U.S. at pp. 976-977 [114 S.Ct. at pp. 2637-2638]; <em>People v. Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 208.) Nor does the prosecutorial discretion to charge special circumstances or seek the death penalty under the statute violate the federal Constitution. <em>{People v. Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 278 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123, 940 P.2d 710]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 152.) Nor does the death statute in general, or the multiple-murder special circumstance in particular, fail to narrow in a constitutionally acceptable manner the class of persons eligible for the death penalty. (See generally <em>People </em>v. <em>Smithey </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 1017 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 978 P.2d 1171]; <em>People v. Crittenden, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at pp. 154-156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-8\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, use of unadjudicated criminal activity during the penalty phase is permissible; however, no such evidence was introduced in this case. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 1054; <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 209.) While there was evidence at the guilt phase regarding defendant\u2019s drug use and dealing, the jury was instructed at the penalty phase that, aside from the crimes defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>convicted of in the guilt phase, it could only consider \u201ccriminal activity . . . which involve[d] the use or attempted use of force or violence or the express or implied threat to use force or violence,\u201d and that it could \u201cnot consider any evidence of any other criminal activity as an aggravating circumstance.\u201d \u201cThe crucial assumption underlying our constitutional system of trial by jury is that jurors generally understand and faithfully follow instructions.\u201d <em>(People v. Mickey </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 612, 689, fn. 17 [286 Cal.Rptr. 801, 818 P.2d 84].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">4. <em>Alleged Impermissible Race Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-6\">Defendant contends that impermissible race factors affected the prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek and the jury\u2019s imposition of the death penalty, in violation of his right to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, a fair trial under the Sixth Amendment, a reliable verdict under the Eighth Amendment, and to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. He relies on the facts that he is Black, Flores is Hispanic, and the murder victims were White, the county in which the trial took place is predominantly White, the prosecutor exercised her peremptory challenges to excuse Black prospective jurors, and the fact that he was the only defendant against whom the death penalty was sought. Defendant also contends the prosecutor used race as a factor even though race was not mentioned when she described her theory of how defendant murdered Bryan during her penalty phase argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s constitutional challenges because none of these factors demonstrate, directly or circumstantially, that race was a factor in either the prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek, or the jury\u2019s decision to impose, the death penalty. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Keenan </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 478, 506 [250 Cal.Rptr. 550, 758 P.2d 1081]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Melton </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 713, 772 [244 Cal.Rptr. 867, 750 P.2d 741].) Defendant does not argue the evidence against him was insufficient; nor do we so find. Nor did he seek below to change venue, and we have already rejected defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor impermissibly exercised her peremptory challenges to exclude Blacks from the jury. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1185-1190.) Moreover, Flores was statutorily ineligible for the death penalty because of his minority at the time of the crimes. Prospective jurors were voir dired on the issue of racial bias, and defendant\u2019s sentence was imposed under procedures that focused the jury\u2019s discretion on the particularized characteristics of this individual defendant and the circumstances of the crime. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, allowing the jury to consider the circumstances of the crime does not mean \u201cthere is a strong likelihood that racial prejudice . . . infected the [jurors\u2019] deliberations.\u201d \u201cBecause discretion is essential to the criminal justice process, we would demand exceptionally clear proof before we would infer that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>the discretion has been abused.\u201d <em>(McCleskey </em>v. <em>Kemp </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 279, 297 [107 S.Ct. 1756, 1770, 95 L.Ed.2d 262].) Defendant has failed to make such a compelling showing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">5. <em>Cumulative Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">Defendant contends cumulative and interrelated errors from the guilt and penalty phases undermined the fundamental fairness of his penalty trial and mandate reversal. We have found no errors that can be deemed cumulatively prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">6. <em>Denial of Automatic Motion to Modify</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">Defendant contends the trial court committed various errors in denying the automatic motion to modify the death verdict. (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e).) None of these claims have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">First, defendant claims that the trial court erred in disregarding the fact that Flores, who was found guilty of the same crimes, could not receive the death penalty. \u201cHowever, the punishment received by others who might be involved in the crime is not relevant to [any] \u2018intracase\u2019 proportionality review, because a capital penalty determination is \u2018based on the character and record of the individual defendant and the circumstances of the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Arias, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 193, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">Defendant next contends that the trial court gave excessive weight to the circumstances of the crime, and insufficient weight to the mitigating evidence, such as his apparent lack of planning and lack of any prior convictions or unadjudicated violent conduct. Along these lines, defendant similarly contends the trial court failed to properly weigh evidence under section 190.3, factor (k), which, as expanded upon in <em>People v. Easley </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 858 [196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813], allows consideration of \u201c \u2018any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime\u2019 and any other \u2018aspect of [the] defendant\u2019s character or record . . . that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 878, fn. 10.) In particular, defendant contends that \u201c[s]ince the events were uncharacteristic of [defendant\u2019s] prior behavior, his good background should not be diminished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-11\">The trial judge, however, did note that defendant\u2019s youth and \u201cexcellent, outstanding record in life\u201d were mitigating factors; he simply concluded that the circumstances of the crime, particularly defendant\u2019s callousness and the presence of three special circumstances, significantly outweighed this evidence. Nor need the trial court recite all possible mitigating evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Arias, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 192; <em>People </em>v. <em>Memro </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 786, 885 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 219, 905 P.2d 1305].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">Defendant further contends the trial court erroneously characterized defendant based on evidence not in the record. Not so. The trial court\u2019s references to defendant\u2019s use and possible selling of methamphetamine, his involvement in a deal to purchase marijuana from April, and his association with Flores, were based on the record, and supported the trial court\u2019s statement, \u201cDefendant\u2019s good record\u2014oh, I could cry with all those people who came in and testified, who have been inspired by Chris Box . . . But the problem is that they did not know the whole story, and the whole story was changing. ... In short, this ideal record is not the whole picture. Even before the start of the events that give rise to this case, Chris Box was on the skids, and he just went off an awfully big bank all at once.\u201d Defendant also objects to the trial court\u2019s statement that \u201cI\u2019m inclined to think that what happened was that Chris Box was forced within the last year before this offense to come to terms with the fact\u2014to make adjustments to the fact that life is not fair, and most particularly it was not fair to him. And that\u2019s mitigating that it wasn\u2019t fair. And it wasn\u2019t. Here he was; he did all the right things; he touched all the right bases; and he should have gone ever onward and upward. And God didn\u2019t make him four inches taller, and so it wasn\u2019t happening. And he put all his eggs in that basket and couldn\u2019t see any other basket. And, unfortunately, his reaction was in the direction of \u2018Life isn\u2019t fair to me, so why do I have to be fair to it.\u2019 \u201d The trial court did not engage in improper speculation, as defendant suggests, but relied on reasonable inferences from the evidence, such as defendant\u2019s disappointment in not receiving a college football scholarship, and testimony that his height was the most likely reason for this lack of opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">Finally, defendant contends that the cumulative effect of the trial court\u2019s errors in ruling on the automatic motion to modify requires reversal. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-7\">7. <em>Jury Misconduct Allegation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-8\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for new trial based on alleged jury misconduct, failing to adequately investigate the allegation, and denying defendant\u2019s request for the jurors\u2019 addresses and telephone numbers. None of these claims have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-9\">On December 18, 1990, the jury returned a verdict of death. On December 20, 1990, Deputy Clerk Laura Clark was questioned on the record by Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>Peterson<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> regarding a jury room conversation she had overheard. According to Clark, on Monday, December 17, 1990, she was using a copy machine located in a foyer adjacent to the room in which defendant\u2019s jury was deliberating. She heard two voices, a male and female. The male voice said, \u201cThe newspaper said that he could get 27 years to life for each count and that there are seven counts.\u201d The female voice responded, \u201cYes, that\u2019s what the newspaper said.\u201d At this point, Clark left the foyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">The following day a reporter\u2019s transcript of Clark\u2019s statement was given to the parties. On January 4, 1991, defendant filed points and authorities in support of a new trial motion based on Clark\u2019s statement, and the prosecutor submitted copies of news stories about the case that had appeared in local newspapers between the time of the guilt verdict on December 7, 1990, and the penalty verdict on December 18, 1990. That same day, a hearing was held in which the matter was further discussed. The prosecutor noted that none of the articles referred to \u201c27 years to life.\u201d Counsel knew the jurors\u2019 names; their request for the jurors\u2019 addresses was denied in the absence of a motion and sufficient showing. Defense counsel also requested that the court conduct its own investigation. That request was denied. The court stated, \u201cI\u2019m telling you that what is before me is insufficient to induce me to take any action whatever. If you\u2019re going [to] move me, you\u2019re going to have to have more.\u201d Counsel also made an oral new trial motion, and requested that the court defer ruling \u201cuntil we have done further investigation.\u201d The trial court did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">On January 18, 1991, further proceedings were held. Defense counsel indicated that they were continuing to investigate the matter, but had recently been denied funding for an investigator, and had conclusively located only some of the jurors in the telephone book. Other jurors\u2019 names appeared in the telephone book in duplicate, and counsel had apparently not attempted to ascertain whether any of the names were of the actual jurors. Defense counsel renewed their request for the jurors\u2019 addresses and telephone numbers. The trial court denied the request, stating that it had reviewed the known newspaper articles and saw nothing either prejudicial or that suggested investigation would find anything prejudicial. \u201cI decline on the present showing to release anything.\u201d \u201c[I]t\u2019s incumbent on somebody to find something that somebody said that said \u201827 to life.\u2019 Now, if you come in with that, then I\u2019ll infer that that\u2019s probably what they heard; and if it\u2019s prejudicial, then you\u2019ve got the lead that you\u2019re talking about. And you have to find out did they really hear that, and if they really heard that and it really is prejudicial, then I would have to grant the motion for new trial on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>penalty phase. But . . . giving it the worst for the jury, they say they read newspapers. . . . My recollection of the transcript was somebody said that \u2018the newspaper said\u2019 and somebody else said, \u2018That\u2019s what it said,\u2019 and they said \u201827 to life.\u2019 Now, none of those things in my view could or would in any way prejudice the defendant\u2019s right to a fair determination of penalty. And as long as that is true, . . . if I do anything, I will then be lending credence to something other than that. And since I don\u2019t believe in harassing juries without, shall we say, probable cause, whatever the standard may be, I am loath to make such an order because it creates a risk with regard to what I believe the showing so far has been, and it also opens the door a little further to jury harassment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">The sentencing hearing, which coincidentally had also been scheduled for January 18, was continued to February 22, with the understanding defense counsel had the option of continuing to investigate the jury misconduct allegations. At the February 22, 1991, hearing, the jury misconduct allegations were not discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">Defendant never filed a written motion for new trial or sought a ruling on his oral motion for new trial; hence the trial court could not deny such a motion or err in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-7\">Nor did the trial court err in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the allegations of juror misconduct. Such a hearing need only be held when \u201c \u2018the defense has come forward with evidence demonstrating a strong possibility that prejudicial misconduct has occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 119, 195 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 386, 931 P.2d 960], overruled on other grounds in <em>People v. Hill, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 823, fn. 1.) That was not the case here. Clark\u2019s statement was hearsay; she was unable to even identify which jurors were speaking. <em>(People v. Hayes </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1211, 1257 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 211, 989 P.2d 645].) Moreover, the overheard comments were ambiguous as to who potentially might receive the 27-year-to-life sentence, and may have involved an entirely unrelated case. Indeed, the known newspaper articles during the relevant time period did not contain the phrase \u201c27 years to life.\u201d Finally, even if the comments were about Flores, it is difficult to see how such a conversation prejudiced defendant. Counsel was given the opportunity on January 18, 1991, to continue its investigation; for reasons not in the record, it apparently abandoned this effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-8\">Nor did the trial court err in declining to provide the jurors\u2019 addresses and telephone numbers. This case was tried in 1990, prior to the enactment of Code of Civil Procedure section 237. At that time, defense counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>entitled to jurors\u2019 addresses and telephone numbers \u201cif the defendant sets forth a sufficient showing to support a reasonable belief that jury misconduct occurred, that diligent efforts were made to contact the jurors through other means, and that further investigation is necessary to provide the court with adequate information to rule on a motion for new trial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 541, 552 [261 Cal.Rptr. 1], cited with approval in <em>Townsel v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1084, 1093-1094 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 602, 979 P.2d 963].) Here, prior to January 18, defense counsel did not contact those jurors whose addresses and telephone numbers they had independently obtained, or attempt to ascertain whether identical names in the telephone book were those of jurors. Moreover, for the reasons that the trial court was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing, the trial court expressly and reasonably found nothing either prejudicial or that suggested investigation would find anything prejudicial. The court acted within its discretion in denying the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">George, C.

Facts may be proved by direct evidence, by circumstantial evidence, or by a combination of direct evidence and circumstantial evidence. Both direct evidence and circumstantial evidence are acceptable as a means of proof. . . . Facts may be established beyond a reasonable doubt by circumstantial evidence. However, in order for the prosecution to sustain its burden of proof by circumstantial evidence, both the underlying facts and the inferences drawn from those facts must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">The court stated, \u201cIf a number of persons conspire together to commit robbery or burglary and if the life of another person is taken by one or more of them in furtherance of the common design, and if such killing is done to further that common purpose or is an ordinary and probable result of the pursuit of that purpose, all of the co-conspirators are deemed in law to be equally guilty of murder of the first degree, whether the killing is intentional, unintentional, or accidental. If a human being is killed by any one of several persons engaged in the commission or attempted commission of the crime of robbery or burglary, all persons who either directly and actively commit the act constituting such crime or who with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator of the crime and with the intent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating the commission of the offense, aid, promote, encourage, or instigate by act or advice its commission, are guilty of murder of the first degree, whether the killing is intentional, unintentional, or accidental.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1263-7\"> Clark also approached Judge Langford, the trial judge in this case.
