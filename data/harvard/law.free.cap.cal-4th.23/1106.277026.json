The fourth case, <em>People </em>v. <em>Castenada </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 743 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 906, 3 P.3d 278] <em>(Cas</em>tenada), involved subdivision (a), which defines a particular offense to which only gang members are subject. An element of that offense is that the defendant \u201cactively participates in any criminal street gang.\u201d (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (a).) In those four decisions, section 186.22 was directly at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">This case <em>indirectly </em>involves subdivision (a) of section 186.22. There is an express reference to that provision in section 12031, subdivision (a)(2)(C), under which defendant was charged. That subdivision elevates from a misdemeanor to a felony the offense of carrying a loaded firearm in public when committed by \u201can active participant in a criminal street gang, <em>as defined in </em>subdivision (a) of Section 186.22, under the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act.\u201d (\u00a7 12031, subd. (a)(2)(C), italics added.) Our task is to ascertain what the Legislature meant by the quoted phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">Defendant was charged with carrying a loaded firearm in public in violation of section 12031, subdivision (a)(1). That offense is a misdemeanor. <em>{Id., </em>subd. (a)(2)(G).) But the offense was charged as a felony here because, as we mentioned earlier, the complaint also alleged under section 12031, subdivision (a)(2)(C) that defendant was \u201can active participant in a criminal street gang, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 186.22.\u201d At the preliminary hearing, the prosecution presented this evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">Officer Warren Tojong of the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s \u201cCommunity Resources Against Street Hoodlums\u201d (CRASH) unit was in a marked police car near the intersection of Hyperion Avenue and Sunset Boulevard when he noticed a group of individuals \u201cin gang attire\u201d standing at the comer. Defendant, who was in the group, looked towards the police car and then discarded \u201ca blue metal-like object\u201d in a planter. Officer Tojong detained defendant and retrieved the item, a fully loaded .22-caliber revolver. After his arrest, defendant told Officer Tojong that he was a member of \u201cLa Mirada Locos,\u201d a local street gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-9\">Detective Louis Vargas testified that members of La Mirada Locos had committed a series of armed robberies a month before defendant\u2019s arrest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>and that the previous year two members of the same gang had stabbed a high school student on a bus. Vargas had no reason to believe that defendant knew of these incidents. , .</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">Defendant moved to dismiss the felony complaint. He noted that subdivision (a)(2)(C) of section 12031, under which he was charged, required the prosecution to show he fell within the statutory language of being \u201can active participant in a criminal street gang, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 186.22.\u201d The latter provision contains no such definition, however; instead it sets forth the elements of a separate offense for gang members. Thus, defendant argued, the prosecution had to, but did not, present evidence on each element of the gang offense described in section 186.22, subdivision (a). In response, the prosecution contended that it need show only one element of the gang offense defined in that provision, namely, that defendant \u201cactively participates\u201d in a criminal street gang. The magistrate agreed with defendant and reduced the felony charge to a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">The prosecution unsuccessfully moved in superior court to reinstate the felony complaint (\u00a7 871.5). On the prosecution\u2019s appeal of that denial order (\u00a7 1238, subd. (a)(9)), the Court of Appeal agreed with the prosecution that section 12031, subdivision (a)(2)(C) requires proof of only one element of the offense described in section 186.22, subdivision (a): that the defendant \u201cactively participates\u201d in a criminal street gang. The Court of Appeal, relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 692 [278 Cal.Rptr. 140], nonetheless concluded that the superior court had properly denied the prosecution\u2019s motion to reinstate the felony complaint. In <em>Green, </em>a different Court of Appeal had held that a defendant \u201cactively participates\u201d in a gang within the meaning of section 186.22, subdivision (a) only if the defendant devotes \u201call, or a substantial part of his time and efforts to the . . . gang.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>at p. 700.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, the prosecution did not present such evidence at the preliminary hearing. We granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">Section 12031, subdivision (a)(1) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of carrying a loaded firearm when he or she carries a loaded firearm on his or her person or in a vehicle while in any public place or on any public street in an incorporated city or any public place or on any public street in a prohibited area of unincorporated territory.\u201d Generally, the offense is \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine.\u201d (\u00a7 12031, subd. (a)(2)(G).) But the offense becomes a felony punishable by a state prison term of 16 months, two, or three years (\u00a7 18) when, as here relevant, \u201cthe person is an active participant in a criminal street gang, <em>as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 186.22, </em>under the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act.\u201d (\u00a7 12031, subd. (a)(2)(C) (section 12031(a)(2)(C)), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">Contrary to the express language of section 12031(a)(2)(C), however, subdivision (a) of section 186.22 (section 186.22(a)) does not at all <em>define </em>the statutory phrase \u201can active participant in a criminal street gang.\u201d Rather, section 186.22(a) sets forth the elements of a gang offense that is punishable either as a felony or a misdemeanor: \u201cAny person who actively participates in any criminal street gang with knowledge that its members engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity, and who willfully promotes, furthers, or assists in any felonious criminal conduct by members of that gang, shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for a period not to exceed one year, or by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months, or two or three years.\u201d (\u00a7 186.22(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">Because section 186.22(a) does not at all define the challenged phrase in section 12031(a)(2)(C), we need to determine what definition the Legislature had in mind when it said in section 12031(a)(2)(C) that the phrase \u201can active participant in a criminal street gang\u201d was \u201cdefined\u201d in section 186.22(a). (2) In construing section 12031(a)(2)(C), \u201c \u2018as with any statute, we strive to ascertain and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Castenada, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 746; <em>People v. Loeun, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 1, 8.) \u201cBecause statutory language \u2018generally provide[s] the most reliable indicator\u2019 of that intent <em>(People v. Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 621; <em>Hsu v. Abbara </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 863, 871 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 824, 891 P.2d 804]), we turn to the words themselves, giving them their \u2018usual and ordinary meanings\u2019 and construing them in context <em>(People v. Loeun, supra, </em>at p. 9).\u201d <em>(Castenada, supra, </em>at p. 747.) If the language contains no ambiguity, we presume the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the statute governs. <em>(Ibid.) </em>If, however, the statutory language is susceptible of more than one reasonable construction, we can look to legislative history in aid of ascertaining legislative intent. <em>(Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1036, 1055 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 968 P.2d 539].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">The language of section 12031(a)(2)(C) is subject to more than one reasonable construction. Its phrase \u201can active participant in a criminal street gang, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 186.22\u201d might refer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>substantive offense defined in section 186.22(a), as the magistrate here concluded. Or it might refer to just one element of that crime, that the defendant \u201cactively participates in any criminal street gang,\u201d as the Court of Appeal here held. Both constructions are plausible. Accordingly, we can consider the legislative history of section 12031(a)(2)(C) to assist us in ascertaining the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">Section 12031(a)(2)(C) has its origins in Assembly Bill No. 632 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.). The People point to a comment in a Senate Committee report on that bill as supporting their argument that under section 12031(a)(2)(C) they need prove only one element of the substantive offense defined in section 186.22(a), namely that the defendant \u201cactively participates\u201d in a criminal street gang. The comment in that report states that \u201cother felony penalties may currently apply in some of the situations\u201d covered by the proposed legislation. (Sen. Com. on Crim. Procedure, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 632 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 2, 1995, com. 3, p. 8 (hereafter Senate Committee Report).) It goes on to state, \u201cFor example, if a person is actively engaged in any street gang activity, they <em>[sic] </em>are currently subject to potential felony prosecution.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">The People offer this reasoning: A person actively engaged in street gang activity can be prosecuted under section 186.22(a), which defines a substantive gang offense that is punishable as either a misdemeanor or a felony. Felony punishment for that crime is 16 months, two, or three years (\u00a7 18) but can be increased by one, two, or three years under section 12021.5, subdivision (a) when a person commits the offense while carrying a firearm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, a defendant who carries a firearm when committing a violation of section 186.22(a) faces a potential six-year prison term. In contrast, one who violates section 12031(a)(2)(C), by carrying a loaded firearm when an active participant in a criminal street gang, as defined in subdivision (a) of section 186.22, commits a felony offense subject to a maximum three-year prison sentence. (\u00a7 18.) According to the People, the Legislature would have had no incentive to have felony liability under section 12031(a)(2)(C) for carrying a loaded firearm depend on proof of a violation of section 186.22(a), when it was aware that a violation of section 186.22(a)\u2019s gang provision, while carrying a firearm (whether loaded or unloaded), already exposed the violator to a potential six years in prison, a term greater than the maximum three-year felony sentence for violating section 12031(a)(2)(C). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>It is true that a violation of section 186.22(a), when punished as a felony, results in a maximum three-year prison sentence. It is also true that a violation of that section while carrying a firearm triggers section 12021.5(a), which imposes additional punishment of up to three years in state prison. Thus, the People are correct that a defendant violating section 186.22(a) while carrying a loaded firearm could be subject to a longer term of imprisonment (six years) than the maximum three-year term for violating section 12031(a)(2)(C), under which defendant here was charged. What the People overlook, however, is that to be subject to increased punishment under section 12021.5(a) for carrying a firearm \u201cduring the commission or attempted commission\u201d of the substantive street gang crime described in section 186.22(a), the carrying of the firearm must occur <em>as part of </em>the violation of section 186.22(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">Thus, it is entirely plausible that the Legislature may have enacted section 12031(a)(2)(C) to cover a situation not subject to felony punishment under section 186.22(a): when the person carrying the loaded firearm had <em>at some other time </em>committed a violation of section 186.22(a). This interpretation of legislative intent is consistent with the Senate Committee Report comment on which the People rely. In stating that \u201cother felony penalties <em>may </em>currently apply in <em>some </em>of the situations\u201d covered by the proposed legislation (Sen. Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>com. 3, p. 8, italics added), the comment suggests the Legislature may have intended the proposed legislation to cover those situations not already subject to felony punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">The Senate Committee Report comment also notes the potential for felony punishment under the law in effect before enactment of section 12031(a)(2)(C) (Sen. Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>com. 3, p. 8), an apparent reference to section 186.22(a), which as a \u201cwobbler\u201d is potentially punishable as a felony but is also punishable as a misdemeanor at the discretion of the trial court. When the offense is treated as a misdemeanor, the maximum penalty is only one year in county jail, and the offense is not subject to section 12021.5(a)\u2019s added punishment for carrying a firearm during a <em>felony </em>gang offense. Thus, contrary to the People\u2019s contention here, the Legislature may have enacted section 12031(a)(2)(C) to ensure that a person violating section 186.22(a) while carrying a loaded firearm will incur felony rather than misdemeanor punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">Finally, the People suggest a drafting error in section 12031(a)(2)(C). They argue that in drafting this provision the Legislature mistakenly referred to subdivision (a) of section 186.22 instead of that section\u2019s subdivision <em>(f). </em>Under that view, section 12031(a)(2)(C) would elevate from a misdemeanor to a felony the offense of carrying a loaded firearm in public by a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>who is \u201can active participant in <em>a criminal street gang, </em>as defined in subdivision (/)\u201d of section 186.22, rather than by one who is <em>\u201can active participant </em>in a criminal street gang, as defined in subdivision (a)\u201d of that section. (Italics added.) The People point to the Senate Committee Report, which mentions section 186.22, subdivision (f). (Sen. Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>com. 5, p. 8.) As the People correctly note, subdivision (f), unlike subdivision (a), does include a definition\u2014it defines the phrase \u201ccriminal street gang.\u201d (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (f).) Based on the Senate Committee Report\u2019s mention of section 186.22\u2019s subdivision (f), the People ask us to assume that section 12031 (a)(2)(C)\u2019s reference to \u201csubdivision (a)\u201d of section 186.22 was a drafting error and that the Legislature really intended that reference to be to subdivision (f) of section 186.22. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">This court does not lightly assume drafting error by the Legislature. \u201c \u2018It is fundamental that legislation should be construed so as to harmonize its various elements without doing violence to its language or spirit.\u2019 \u201d <em>{People v. Garcia </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1, 6 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 114, 980 P.2d 829]; <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Marina City Properties, Inc. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 781, 788 [176 Cal.Rptr. 104, 632 P.2d 217].) Thus, we may disregard statutory language only \u201cwhen compelled by necessity\u201d and to conform to legislative intent. <em>{People v. Garcia, supra, </em>at p. 6; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Broussard </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1067, 1072 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 278, 856 P.2d 1134].)  Such compulsion does not exist here because \u201cthe statute is reasonably susceptible to an interpretation that harmonizes all its parts without disregarding or altering any of them.\u201d <em>{People v. Garcia, supra, </em>at p. 6.) As we have explained, there are two possible harmonizing interpretations of section 12031(a)(2)(C)\u2019s phrase \u201can active participant in a criminal street gang, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 186.22.\u201d The phrase could refer either to the substantive gang offense defined in section 186.22(a) or to just one element of that offense (that the defendant \u201cactively participates\u201d in a criminal street gang).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">Because the legislative history of section 12031(a)(2)(C) gives no clear guidance regarding which of these two meanings the Legislature intended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>we look to yet another rule of statutory construction.  When, as here, the language of a penal law is reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, we construe the law \u201cas favorably to criminal defendants as reasonably permitted by the statutory language and circumstances of the application of the particular law at issue.\" <em>(People v. Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 605, 622; <em>People v. Overstreet </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 891, 896 [231 Cal.Rptr. 213, 726 P.2d 1288].) This \u201cprotects the individual against arbitrary discretion by officials and judges and guards against judicial usurpation of the legislative function which would result from enforcement of penalties when the legislative branch did not clearly prescribe them.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Overstreet, supra, </em>at p. 896.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">Applying that rule here, we construe section 12031(a)(2)(C)\u2018s phrase \u201cactive participant in a criminal street gang, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 186.22\u201d as referring to the substantive gang offense defined in section 186.22(a). We pointed out earlier that contrary to what section 12031(a)(2)(C) says, section 186.22(a) does not at all define the phrase \u201cactive participant in a criminal street gang.\u201d Instead, section 186.22(a) defines a substantive gang offense, setting forth the elements of that offense. Thus, carrying a loaded firearm in public becomes a felony under section 12031(a)(2)(C) when a defendant satisfies the elements of the offense described in section 186.22(a). Those elements are \u201cactively participat[ing] in any criminal street gang with knowledge that its members engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity\u201d and \u201cwillfully promot[ing], further[ing], or assisting] in any felonious criminal conduct by members of that gang.\u201d (\u00a7 186.22(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">At defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing on the felony charge of carrying a loaded firearm in public, the prosecution presented evidence that defendant was a member of a criminal street gang, La Mirada Locos. But the prosecution presented no evidence of the other requirements of section 186.22(a): \u201cknowledge that its members engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity\u201d and \u201cwillfully promoting], furthering], or assisting] in any felonious criminal conduct by members of that gang.\" (\u00a7 186.22(a).) Accordingly, as the magistrate at the preliminary hearing ruled, the prosecution failed to establish the requirement in section 12031(a)(2)(C), under which defendant was charged, that defendant was \u201can active participant in a criminal street gang, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 186.22.\u201d Because the prosecution failed to do so, defendant could not be held to answer under section 12031(a)(2)(C), which elevates to a felony the misdemeanor offense of carrying a loaded firearm in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-8\">Although the Court of Appeal was wrong in concluding that section 12031(a)(2)(C) incorporates only the \u201cactively participates in any criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>street gang\u201d element of the substantive offense defined in section 186.22(a), it reached the correct result in upholding the superior court\u2019s order denying the People\u2019s motion to reinstate defendant\u2019s felony complaint, which the magistrate at the preliminary hearing had dismissed. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">George, C.

(Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 1117.) Yet even the People, who advocate the dissent\u2019s statutory construction, concede the ambiguity of the phrase. The dissent also stresses that the legislative analysis of then proposed section 12031(a)(2)(C) states the provision would increase the penalty for carrying a loaded firearm \u201cfor \u2018a member of a \u201cstreet gang,\u201d \u2019 for \u2018a gang member,\u2019 for \u2018known gang members,\u2019 or for \u2018active members of criminal street gangs.\u2019 \u201d (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 1119.) But gang membership is not an evidentiary requirement of either section 186.22(a)\u2019s \u201cactively participates\u201d element or for a violation of that offense. (See <em>Castenada, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 747.)

(a)(1).) Ordinarily, a person found in violation of this statute is subject to misdemeanor punishment. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a)(2)(G).) As relevant here, however, section 12031 authorizes felony punishment where the violator \u201cis an active participant in a criminal street gang, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 186.22 [hereafter section 186.22(a)], under the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u00a7 12031, subd. (a)(2)(C); hereafter section 12031(a)(2)(C).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">As the majority observes, just last month we unanimously concluded in <em>People </em>v. <em>Castenada, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at pages 745 and 752, that a defendant \u201cactively participates\u201d in a criminal street gang \u201cwithin the meaning of section 186.22[(a)]\u201d where the defendant\u2019s gang involvement \u201cis more than nominal or passive.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1110, fn. 2.) Logically, then, it follows that a person \u201cis an active participant in a criminal street gang, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>defined in [section 186.22(a)]\u201d where the person\u2019s involvement with a criminal street gang is more than nominal or passive. Under this natural and commonsense reading of section 12031(a)(2)(C), the crime of carrying a loaded firearm in public, normally punishable as a misdemeanor, becomes punishable as a felony when the person carrying the firearm is more than nominally or passively involved with a criminal street gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">As explained in <em>People v. Castenada, </em>a person\u2019s active participation in a criminal street gang, without more, does not amount to a violation of section 186.22(a): \u201c[T]he Legislature expressly required in section 186.22(a) that a defendant <em>not only </em>\u2018actively participates\u2019 in a criminal street gang . . . <em>but also </em>that the defendant does so with \u2018knowledge that [the gang\u2019s] members engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity,\u2019 <em>and </em>that the defendant \u2018willfully promotes, furthers, or assists in any felonious criminal conduct by members of that gang.\u2019 \u201d <em>{People v. Castenada, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 749, italics added.) It therefore is plain that section 186.22(a)\u2019s phrase \u201cactively participates in any criminal street gang\u201d refers to only one of three distinct elements of the offense described in that statute.. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the majority effectively construes section 12031(a)(2)(C)\u2019s key reference to \u201can active participant in a criminal street gang, as defined in [section 186.22(a)]\u201d to mean a person who: (1) actively participates in a criminal street gang by being more than nominally or passively involved in the gang; <em>and </em>(2) participates with knowledge that the gang\u2019s members engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity; <em>and </em>(3) willfully promotes, furthers, or assists in any felonious criminal conduct by gang members. Accordingly, under the majority\u2019s interpretation, section 12031(a)(2)(C) purports to authorize felony punishment only where the prosecution can establish all three criteria and prove not only that the defendant violated section 12031, subdivision (a)(1) by unlawfully carrying a loaded firearm in public, but also that he or she has committed a section 186.22(a) offense by aiding and abetting yet another separate felony offense by gang members (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Castenada, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at pp. 749, 751). In the majority\u2019s view, the prosecution may show that the section 186.22(a) offense was committed either concurrently with the section 12031(a)(1) offense or <em>\u201cat some other </em>time.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">The majority\u2019s construction flies in the face of section 12031(a)(2)(C)\u2019s express language. By its own terms, the statute applies to any person who \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>an active participant in a criminal street gang, as defined in [section 186.22(a)]\u201d; nowhere does it refer to the two additional elements necessary to establish an offense under section 186.22(a). (See <em>ante, </em>fns. 2, 3.) Moreover, section 186.22(a) makes clear through its wording and grammatical structure that its element of active participation in a gang is separate and distinct from its knowledge and aiding and abetting elements. As <em>People v. Castenada </em>reflects, we did not discern the meaning of section 186.22(a)\u2019s phrase \u201cactively participates in any criminal street gang\u201d by reference to its other prerequisites for criminal liability. Rather, we construed the phrase by giving the words \u201cactively\u201d and \u201cparticipates\u201d their usual and ordinary meanings, i.e., \u201cnot passive\u201d and \u201c \u2018to take part in something (as an enterprise or activity).\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castenada, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 747.) I see no basis for giving the phrase \u201cactive participant in a criminal street gang\u201d a wholly different meaning here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">Additionally, the express language of section 12031(a)(2)(C) leaves no room for the majority\u2019s further conclusion that \u201cit is entirely plausible\u201d that the section was enacted to apply when the person carrying the loaded firearm had <em>\u201cat some other time\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>in the past committed a violation of section 186.22(a). (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1113.) By authorizing felony punishment for a firearm violation specifically \u201c[w]here the person <em>is </em>an active participant in a criminal street gang\u201d (\u00a7 12031(a)(2)(C), italics added), the statutory wording defies any notion that increased punishment applies where the person previously \u201cwas\u201d an active gang participant who violated section 186.22(a) at some past point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">Legislative documents pertaining to the enactment of section 12031(a)(2)(C) also undermine the majority\u2019s interpretation. Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, none of the legislative analyses or reports reflects an understanding that the provision would mandate felony punishment for a person who carries a loaded firearm either while violating section 186.22(a) (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1113) or after having violated section 186.22(a) <em>\u201cat some other time\u201d </em>(maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1113). Indeed, the legislative history Contains no indication whatsoever that a violation of section 186.22(a) is a necessary predicate to felony liability under section 12031(a)(2)(C). This stands in sharp contrast to other subdivisions of section 12031 that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>unequivocal in imposing felony punishment for persons found guilty of other crimes. (E.g., \u00a7 12031, subd. (a)(2)(A) [\u201cthe person previously has been convicted of any felony, or of any crime made punishable by this chapter [\u00a7\u00a7 12000-12101]\u201d]; \u00a7 12031, subd. (a)(2)(E) [\u201cthe person has been convicted of a crime against a person or property, or of a narcotics or dangerous drug violation\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">Notably, the legislative analyses of the proposed text of section 12031(a)(2)(C) repeatedly commented that the provision would increase the penalty for unlawfully carrying a firearm from a misdemeanor to a felony for \u201ca member of a \u2018street gang,\u2019 \u201d for \u201ca gang member,\u201d for \u201cknown gang members,\u201d or for \u201cactive members of criminal street gangs.\u201d (E.g., Assem. Com. on Appropriations, Assem. Bill No. 632 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 3, 1995, p. 1; Sen. Appropriations Com., Fiscal Summary, Assem. Bill No. 632 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 2, 1995, p. 1; Sen. Appropriations Com., Fiscal Summary, Assem. Bill No. 632 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 1, 1996, p. 1; Assem. Floor Analysis, Concurrence in Sen. Amends., Assem. Bill No. 632 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 1, 1996, p. 2; Assembly 3d reading analysis, Assem. Bill No. 632 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.), pp. 3, 4.) But none suggested the targeted gang members also must be found guilty of aiding and abetting a separate felony offense by other gang members as required for a section 186.22(a) violation. Viewed in context with the statutory language as enacted (\u201cthe person is an active participant in a criminal street gang\u201d), these documents are strongly indicative of a legislative intent to increase the existing punishment for any person who carries a loaded firearm in public while actively involved with a criminal street gang, not merely for those proven violators of section 186.22(a) who, in addition, have \u201cknowledge [of the gang\u2019s] pattern of criminal gang activity\u201d and \u201cwillfully promote[], further[], or assist[] in any felonious criminal conduct\u201d by gang members. <em>(Ibid..)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">In sum, I would construe section 12031(a)(2)(C) as providing felony punishment for the crime of carrying a loaded firearm in public in any case where the lawbreaker is more than nominally or passively involved with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>criminal street gang. Such construction is supported by both the language and the legislative history of the statute, and is consistent with our recent interpretation of what section 186.22(a) means by the phrase, \u201c[a]ny person who actively participates in any criminal street gang.\u201d In my view, this construction is superior to the majority\u2019s interpretation, which falls conspicuously short on all three points and deprives the statute of much of its prosecutorial utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">Because the Court of Appeal analyzed this case under a narrower construction of the relevant statutory phrases, I would remand the matter to allow that court to reexamine the propriety of the superior court\u2019s refusal to reinstate the felony allegations against defendant in accordance with the views set forth herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1158-9\">Section 12031 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a)(1) A person is guilty of carrying a loaded firearm when he or she carries a loaded firearm on his or her person or in a vehicle while in any public place or on any public street in an incorporated city or in any public place or on any public street in a prohibited area of unincorporated territory. flD (2) Carrying a loaded firearm in violation of this section is punishable, as follows: [H]. . .

As the legislators themselves recognized when they enacted section 12031(a)(2)(C), section 186.22(a) pertains to a crime that occurs \u201cif a person is actively engaged in any criminal street gang <em>activity.\u201d </em>(Sen. Com. on Crim. Procedure, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 632 (1995-1996 Reg.

(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1114, fn. 4.) That the legislative analyses made repeated references to gang members, however, is consistent with a reasonable belief that active gang members were the primary focus of the statutory provision. The relevant point, which the majority overlooks, is that nothing in the legislative history suggests that the targeted criminals must commit three separate criminal offenses\u2014(1) a firearm offense under section 12031 and (2) the so-called \u201cactive participation in a criminal street gang\u201d offense under section 186.22(a), which in turn requires proof of (3) aiding and abetting some other felony offense by gang members\u2014before qualifying for felony punishment under section 12031(a)(2)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
