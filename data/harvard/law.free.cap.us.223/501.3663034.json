These scraps are not treated as worthless, but are swept up, and, when cleaned, are used in the manufacture of a cheap grade of cigarettes and stogies.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The plaintiff in error shipped to Porto Rico a quantity of these sweepings, and the question arose as to whether the shipment was dutiable at 10 per cent, ad valorem as \u201cwaste, not specially provided for in this Act,\u201d under \u00a7 463 of the Tariff Act of 1897; or, at 55 cents a pound as \u201ctobacco,- manufactured or unmanufactured,\u201d under \u00a7 215 of the same statute. (30 Stat. 194, 169.) The customs officer classed it as \u201cunmanufactured tobacco,\u201d and required the payment of a duty of 55 cents a pound. The importer protested and a case was made to test the question. On appeal the General Board sustained the collector. It was affirmed by the District Court of Porto Rico, and to reverse that judgment the importer has brought the cas\u00e9 here.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">There has been some difference of opinion as to the proper classification of scrap 'tobacco under the various tariff acts. In <em>United </em>States v. <em>Schroeder, </em>93 Fed. Rep. 448, a higher grade of scrap was held to be \u201cwaste\u201d within the meaning of the Tariff Act of 1890. In <em>Seeberger </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>153 U. S. 32, it was decided that the clippings from the ends \u25a0 of cigars wer\u00e9' dutiable as unmanufactured tobacco under the .Tariff Act of 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u2022 The plaintiff claims that this decision has no application here, because it related to clippings which were of a higher grade than scrap, and for the further reason that, as the importer there made no claim that it should be taxed as waste, the court did not pass on that question. But it' did definitely decide that such material, by whatever name called, was \u201cunmanufactured tobacco.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The words', having received such a construction under the act of 1883, must be given the same meaning when used in the Tariff Act of 1897, on the theory that, in using the phrase in the later statute, Congress adopted the construction already given it by this court. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baruch, </em>this day decided, <em>ante, </em>p. 191. That such was the intention of Congress appears further from the fact that the duty of \u201c10 per cent, ad valorem on waste\u201d is found in \u201cSchedule N \u2014 Sundries.\u201d The word as thus used generally refers to remnants and by-products of small value that have not the quality or utility either of the finished product or of the raw material. <em>Patton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>159 U. S. 500, 503. But the scrap here involved retains the name and quality of tobacco. It is tobacco, and as such it is used for making cigarettes and stogies. It was therefore taxable under Schedule F, which fixes the duty on tobacco in all its forms \u2014 manufactured or unmanufactured. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
