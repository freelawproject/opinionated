Snow-den executed a deed to him, which was duly approved by the Secretary of the Interior, and duly recorded in the Office of Indian Affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Prior to the commencement of this action Prichard made the payments required, which were received and accepted by the. Interior Department for distribution to those entitled to the same, including Ruther Jacobs and Lillie Jacobs, plaintiffs in error. Their,guardian, E. D. Wilcox, has not received the same and refused to accept the sum, except a. cash payment of $420.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Charley Jacobs died January 2, 1900, leaving surviving him, among others,; the plaintiffs in error, who, as we have said, were not \u00f1affied in the patent. His death was reported to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs by Snowden May 1, 1900.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Wilcox is the duly appointed guardian of plaintiffs in error, and' reported to the court the receipt by him of the payment of $420 made, by Prichard. He did not know, however, that the sale by Snowden was after the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Charley Jacobs, father of plaintiffs in error,- until after the commencement of this suit, and, as soon as.he discovered that fact, refused to receive any further payment. The money received by plaintiffs in error as their share of the purchase' price of the land was tendered to defendant in error prior to the trial of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">At the time Prichard, defendant in error, purchased the land he did not know of the death of Charley Jacobs, and was at no time advised of it' or of the existence of plaintiffs in error until shortly before bringing this action. He purchased the property in good faith, relying upon the representations of Snowden, and in the full belief of the regularity of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">We have stated the facts thus fully, although they are not disputed, as they exhibit clearly .upon what right the Secretary of the Interior proceeded in his instructions to Commissioner Snowden and the strict compliance of the latter with those, instructions. It will be observed that where the allottees and true owners executed consents which had been approved by the Secretary, it was the practice of the Department to continue the sale of the lands covered thereby, though the allottee or owner died, and to distribute the funds arising therefrom to his or her heirs, the Department regarding the \u201cconsents as remaining in full force upon the decease of the Indian executing the same,\u201d they being \u201cin the nature of an agreement or contract to be carried out for the sole benefit of his heirs in case of his decease.\u201d The Secretary expressed the view, that the \u201clands are sold under the provisions of the act of Congress, March 3, 1893, and not under the laws of Washington. . . . ..' It is for the department to pass upon the sufficiency of consents arid not the courts of Washington,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Defendant in error takes the view that the consents remairied good after the decease of the Indian who gave them, in this case Charley Jacobs, and was \u201cin the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>of a permanent power or trusteeship.\u201d Qn the other hand, plaintiffs in error contend that the consent was.a \u201cnaked power to sell,\u201d and terminated with the death of the giver. ~</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">There can be no doubt of the power of Congress to give character to the consents. <em>United States ex rel. Lowe </em>v. <em>Fisher, ante, </em>p. 95; <em>The Cherokee Nation et al. </em>v. <em>Whitmire, Trustee, ante, </em>p. 108. The questions in the case, therefore,. turn upon the statute, and both sides invoke it to sustain their respective contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The patent to Charley Jacobs was made subject to the conditions and restrictions Of the sixth article of the treaty. In other words, there was a limitation upon the right of alienation of the patented lands, and the ultimate power to remove this restriction and grant a right of full alienation was reserved to Congress. The act of 1893 was an 'exercise of this power. It provided for the sale of such part of the allotted lands as was not required for the homes of the Indians, and prescribed the conditions of the sale to be \u201ca written agreement consenting to the sale,\u2019\u2019 signed by the Indian or Indians entitled to the allotted land offered for- sale.. And it was provided further that the agreement should constitute the commissioners, or a majority of them (subsequently one commissioner), trustees to sell the lands and <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>make deeds to the purchasers for the same,\u201d subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, which deeds should \u201coperate as a complete, conveyance of the land upon the full-payment of the purchase .money.\u201d. It is manifest that the \u201cconsent\u201d required created something more than a mere -revocable agency. It was a- written agreement giving the commissioner (we drop the plural) full power to execute the provision and policy of the act of Congress, a power which could be confidently counted on as continuing against contingencies, and to terminate in a \u201ccomplete conveyance of the land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">That the \u201cconsent\u201d was to have this character was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>immediate and continued construction of the act of Congress by the Interior Department, and such construction would determine against ambiguity in the act even if we should admit ambiguity existed. The rule which gives strength to the construction of the officers who are'directed to execute the law and who, it has been said, may have written or suggested it, is given an added force from one \u25a0of the provisions of the act of Congress. It directs the Secretary of the Interior \u201cto make the necessary regulations to carry out the purposes\u201d of its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">But we find no ambiguity in the act when we consider its purpose and the habits of Indian life. ' It could not have been intended that when proceedings had been instituted under it they should be embarrassed always by the possibility of defeat, and, it may be, \u2022 progressing up to the' moment of the delivery of the deed to a purchaser, should be made useless and nugatory by the death of some roving Indian. It is to be noted that all the proceedings are under the control of the Secretary of the Interior and that any irregularity in them or improvidence in the consents can be corrected by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We do not answer in detail'the argument of plaintiffs in error based on the law of agency because iye do not. think its analogies are applicable to the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The Supreme Court of- Washington has repeated its ruling in this cas\u00e9 in two other's, <em>Little Bill </em>v. <em>Swanson, </em>117 Pac. Rep. 481; <em>Same </em>v. <em>Dyslin, </em>Id. 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirm\u00e9'd.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
