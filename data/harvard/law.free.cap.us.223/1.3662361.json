The injuries occurred in Connecticut August <em>5,. </em>1908, the \u25a0 action was commenced -in one of the Superior Courts of that- State in October following, and the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>of action was based solely on the act of Congress of April 22, 1908 (35 Stat. 65, c. 149). According to the complaint, the injuries occurred while the defendant, as a common carrier by railroad, was engaged in commerce between some of the States and while the plaintiff, as a locomotive fireman, was employed by the defendant in such commerce, and the injuries proximately resulted from negligence of the plaintiff\u2019s fellow servants, who also were employed by the defendant in such commerce. A demurrer to the complaint was interposed upon the grounds, first, that the act of Congress was repugnant in designated aspects to-the Constitution of the United States, and, second, that even if the act were valid a right of action thereunder could not be enforced in the courts of the State. The demurrer was sustained, judgment was rendered against the plaintiff, the judgment subsequently was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Errors of the State (82 Connecticut, 373) upon the authority of <em>Hoxie </em>v. <em>N.

The injury and death occurred in Montana, September 25, 1908, the action was commenced in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Minnesota, October 4, 1909, and the right of action was based solely on the act of Congress before mentioned. It appeared, from the coin-plaint, that the injury occurred while the' defendant, as a common carrier by railroad, was engaged in commerce between some of the States, and while the deceased, as a locomotive fireman, was employed by the defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>such commerce; that the injury proximately resulted from negligence of fellow servants of the deceased, who also' were employed by the defendant in such commerce; that the deceased resided in Montana and died without issue or a surviving father or mother, but leaving a widow and also a sister, and that if the statutes of Montana were applicable the recovery should be for the equal benefit of the widow and sister, and not for the exclusive benefit of the widow, as prayed in the complaint and as provided in the act of Congress. The defendant challenged the validity of the act by a demurrer to the complaint, and in the subsequent proceedings insisted that the recovery,, if any, should be for the benefit of the widow and sister jointly and not for the benefit of the widow alone, but the demurrer and the insistance were overruled and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff for the exclusive benefit of the widow, as prayed. By a direct writ of error the defendant seeks a reversal of that judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-5\">Nos. 289, 290 <em>(Walsh </em>v. <em>New </em>York, <em>New Haven and Hartford R.

It was an action by the personal representative of a deceased employe of a railroad corporation to recover, for the benefit of the surviving widow and children, for the death of the employ\u00e9, which resulted from an injury suffered in the course of his employment. ' The injury and death occurred in Connecticut, February 11, 1909, the action was commenced in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts in July following and the right of action asserted in the second count of the declaration was based on the act of Congress before mentioned. There were several other counts, but they may be passed without special notice. It was charged in the second count that the injury occurred while the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>fendant, as a common carrier by railroad, was engaged in commerce between some of the States and while the deceased, in the course of his employment by the defendant in such commerce, was engaged in replacing a drawbar on one of the defendant\u2019s cars then in use in such commerce, and that the injury proximately resulted from negligence of fellow servants of the deceased in pushing other cars against the one on which he was working. A demurrer to that count challenged the validity of. the act of Congress, but the demurrer was overruled. The defendant answered, putting in issue all that was stated in that count, and also alleging that the deceased, by his own negligence, contributed to the injury which resulted in his death and therefore that the damages should be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to him. A trial to the court and a jury resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff upon the second count, and there was a judgment for the defendant upon the other counts. Each party has sued out a direct writ of error from this court. The defendant calls in question the ruling upon its demurrer and other rulings in the progress of the cause, notably such as related to the nature of the employment in which the deceased and the fellow servants whose conduct was in question were engaged at the time of the. inj try and to the admeasurement of the damages. The plaintiff makes no complaint of the judgment upon the second count and, if it shall be affirmed, wishes to waive her objections to the judgment upon the other counts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">The act whose validity is drawn in question, 35 Stat. 65, c. 149, and the amendment of April 5, 1910, 36 Stat. 291, c. 143, are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-6\">\u201cAn Act Relating to the liability of common carriers by railroad to their employ\u00e9s in certain cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AK\"><em>\u201cBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>of the United States of America in Congress assembled, </em>That every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce between any of the several States or Territories, or between any of the States and Territories, or between the District of Columbia and any of the States or Territories, or between the District of Columbia or any of the States or Territories and any foreign nation or nations, shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce, or, in case of the death of such employ\u00e9, to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband- and children of such employ\u00e9; and, if none, then of such employ\u00e9\u2019s parents; and, if none, then of the next of kin dependent upon such employ\u00e9, for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employ\u00e9s of such carrier, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves, or other equipment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-4\">\u201cSec. 2.

But the fact cannot be ignored that for over a century it has been supposed that laws such as this fell within the exclusive power of the States,, and that this view is. held still by a large proportion of the bar and people. In fact, while defends ant in error as administratrix is maintaining this action under this law, a sister of deceased, not a party to this action, asserts the liability of the railway company to her under the Montana statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-7\">The act of Congress rests wholly upon the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the States, which is the power to prescribe the rules by which commerce is to be governed. <em>Adair </em>v. <em>United States, </em>208 U. S. 161, 177. Se\u00e9 article by Mr- Hackett in Harvard Law Review for November, 1908. From the adoption of the Constitution until recently it has been understood universally that the exclusive, power is in the States to say for what negligence a master shall be liable to a servant, what shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>be the effect of the servant\u2019s contributory negligence, what shall be the master\u2019s liability for the acts of fellow servants, whether any pecuniary liability shall arise out of death caused by negligence, what' shall be the measure of damage in dt\u00ed\u00e1th and other negligence cases, \u2022 and who-shall receive the fruits of recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5d\">While the power of Congress is supreme in its sphere, it does not extend beyond those subjects which pertain 'immediately and directly to commerce. The utmost ingenuity has failed to prove how commerce will directly be promoted or affected, or the movement of goods or passengers by rail directly influenced, by any rule governing the master\u2019s liability to his-servant for defects'in appliances, or for th\u00e9 acts of fellow servants, or establish the effect of the servant\u2019s own negligence, or determining when a liability arises for negligent death, or the extent of the damages, or the persons to whom the damages shall go.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-6\">The act is plainly distinguishable-from safety appliance laws and from laws prescribing tests for. qualification of trainmen.

It would be impossible to enumerate such conflicts; but some of them \u00e1re: in-respect of the liability for the acts of fellow servants; in creating an action for death practically with unlimited damages; in distribution of proceeds in cases of recovery for death; in respect of the effect of contributory negligence and assumption of risk;, in providing that -no contract may be made between the parties contrary to the terms of the act; and in giving two years to bring action and in not requiring, as the laws of some States do, any preliminary notice to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-5\">Congress has assumed to enter the field of the administration of deceased persons. In some States damages for death are not subject to the claims of creditors; in others it is believed that they are; but if this act is valid it seems to remove that question from state control. Some States give the damages to the heirs, some to the next of kin, and some to the widow. The rules in the States vary widely in determining who is an heir or next of kin entitled to share in the recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-6\">In this particular case the law of Montana would give the damages half to the widow' and half to the sister; but the act of Congress assumes to overrule these state statutes, in the case \u00e1t bar giving the whole damage to the widow to the exclusion of the sister, instead of dividing it between them. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-7\">\u2022 Conflicts between the act of Congress and laws of the States result in annulling the acts of the States, providing that of Congress is valid, because if this is a regulation, of commerce it is so well .settled as now to be elementary , that Congress once having acted, state power oyer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>whole subject (if indeed the States ever had any power) is ended; and any legislation by a State creating a liability of railway companies to their employ\u00e9s engaged in interstate commerce would, be an unlawful interference with and burden upon such commerce. On this clear principle the plaintiff in error will not be liable to the sister of deceased, or to an administrator appointed for her benefit under the laws of Montana, provided this judgment is affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-5\">Plaintiff in. error agrees with the Attorney. General that railway companies have no employ\u00e9s who are not engaged in interstate commerce, unless indeed they carry on mining or some business apart from transportation.

Nor can Congress be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>considered to have made the operation of t\u00edre substantive rules of law established by the act of 1908 dependent upon the willingness of all or any state courts to take cognizance of actions founded upon those .rules. <em>Hoxie </em>v. <em>N.

The act deals entirely with rights and duties \u2014 not with remedies. It creates rules of substantive law.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-5\">The state courts, inasmuch as Congress did not give exclusive jurisdiction to the Federal courts, could and should use their general jurisdiction, given to them by their .state legislatures, in enforcement of the Federal right. The privilege of the state courts so to use their jurisdiction is undeniable, when neither Congress nor the state legislature has withdrawn that privilege in a particular c^se. The general grant of jurisdiction by state law is sufficient to cover any right, whether created by the law of that State or of other States or of the United States or of foreign countries. Congress has left the state courts free to use that general jurisdiction, by not prohibiting its use; and the terms of the State\u2019s grant of jurisdiction cover the case. <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Houseman, </em>93 U.

In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>first place, any claimant of the new Federal right can go into. a Federal court by simply laying his damages at more than $2,000: In the second place, as already suggested, this court can doubtless compel the state courts to exercise in aid of the new Federal right such jurisdiction as those courts have under state laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-4\">\" The act does not deprive a railroad of its property without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-5\">Assuming that the due process requirement of the Fifth Amendment is equivalent to the equal protection of the laws required by the Fourteenth Amendment, the authorities show that this court has already repeatedly disposed of these objections to the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-6\">The following cases sustain state statutes abolishing the fellow-servant rule upon railroads alone, against express attack under the Fourteenth Amendment: <em>Missouri Pacific Ry.

Bowers who died in September, 1910) with his accustomed care and ability. In order that it may properly be before the court, I adopt it and ask its consideration. Geo. W. Wickersham, Attorney General. December, 1910.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"235\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b88-5\">Mr. Justice Van Devanter,</author>\n<p id=\"A-d\">after stating the cases as above, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The principal questions presented in these cases as discussed at.the bar and in the briefs are: 1. May Congress, in the exertion of its power over interstate commerce, regulate the relations of common carriers by railroad and their employ\u00e9s while both are engaged in such commerce? 2. Has Congress exceeded its power in that regard by prescribing the regulations which are embodied in the act in question? 3. Do those regulations supersede the laws of the States in so far as the latter cover the same field? 4. May rights arising under those regulations be enforced, as of right, in the courts of the States when their jurisdiction, as fixed by local laws, is adequate to the occasion?</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The clauses in the Constitution (Art. I, \u00a7 8, clauses 3 and 18) which confer upon Congress the power \u201cto regulate commerce . . . among the several States\u201d and \u201cto make all laws which shall be necessary and proper\u201d for the purpose have been considered by this court so often and in such varied connections that some propositions bearing upon the extent and nature of this power have come to be so firmly settled as no longer to be open to dispute, among them being these:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">1. The term \u201ccommerce\u201d comprehends more than the mere exchange of goods. It embraces commercial intercourse in all its branches, including transportation of passengers \u2022 and property by common carriers, whether Carried on by water or by land.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">2. The phrase \u201camong the several States\u201d marks the distinction, for the purpose of \u25a0 governmental regulation, between 'commerce which concerns two or more States and commerce which is confined to a-single State and does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>not affect other States, the power to regulate the former being conferred upon Congress and the regulation of the latter remaining with the States severally.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">3. \u201cTo. regulate,\u201d in the sense intended, is to foster, protect, control and restrain, with, appropriate regard for the welfare of those who are immediately concerned and of the public at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">4. This power over commerce among the States, so conferred upon Congress, is complete in itself, extends incidentally to every instrument and agent .by which such commerce is carried on, may be exerted .to its utmost extent over every part of such commerce, and- is subject to no limitations save such as are prescribed in the Constitution. . But, of course, it does not extend to any matter or thing which does not have a real or substantial relation to some part of such commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">5. Among the instruments' and agents to which 'the power extends are the railroads over which transportation from one State to another is conducted, the engines and cars by which such transportation is effected, and all who are in any. wise engaged in such transportation, whether as common carriers or as their employes.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">6. The duties of common carriers in respect of the safety of their employ\u00e9s, while both are engaged in commerce among the States, and the liability of the former for injuries sustained by the latter, while both are so engaged, have a real or substantial relation to such commerce, and therefore are within the range of this power. <em>Cooley </em>v. <em>Board of Wardens, </em>12 How. 299, 315-317; <em>The Lottawanna, </em>21 Wall. 558, 577; <em>Sherlock </em>v. <em>Alling, </em>93 U.

S. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">As is well said in the brief prepared by the late Solicitor-General: \u201cInterstate commerce \u2014 if not always, at any rate when the commerce is transportation \u2014 is an act. Congress, of course, can do anything which, in the exercise by itself of a fair discretion, may be deemed appropriate to<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> save the act of interstate commerce from prevention or interruption, or to make, that act more secure, more reliable or more efficient. The act of interstate commerce is done by the labor of men and with the help of things; and these men and things are the agents and instruments of the commerce. If the agents or instruments are destroyed while they are doing the act, commerce is stopped; if the agents or instruments are interrupted, commerce is interrupted; if the agents or instruments are not of the right kind or qhality, commerce in consequence becomes slow or costly or unsafe or otherwise inefficient; and if the conditions under which the agents or instruments do the work of commerce are wrong or disadvantageous, those bad conditions may and often will prevent or interrupt the act of commerce or make it less expeditious, \u25a0less reliable, less economical and less secure.'<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, Congress may legislate about the agents and instruments of interstate commerce, and about the conditions under \u25a0which those agents and instruments perform the work of interstate commerce, whenever such legislation bears, or in the exercise of a fair legislative discretion can be deemed to bear, upon the reliability or promptness or economy or security or utility of the interstate commerce act.\u201d \u25a0 \u2022. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In. view of these settled propositions', it does not admit of doubt, that the answer to the first of the questions before stated must be that Congress, in the exertion of its power over interstate commerce, may regulate the relations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>of common carriers by railroad and their employ\u00e9s, while both are engaged in such commerce^ subject always'to the limitations prescribed in the Constitution, and to the qualification that the particulars in which those relations are regulated must have a real or substantial connection with the interstate commerce in which the carriers and their employ\u00e9s are engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">W\u00e9 come, then, to inquire whether Congress has exceeded its power in that regard by prescribing the regulations embodied in the present act.* It is objected that it has, (1) because the abrogation of the fellow-servant rule, the extension \u00f3f the carrier\u2019s liability to cases of death, and the restriction of the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk have no tendency to promote the safety of the employ\u00e9s or to advance the commerce in which they are engaged; (2) because the liability imposed for injuries sustained by one employ\u00e9 through the negligence of another, although confined to instances where the injured employ\u00e9 is engaged in interstate commerce, is not confined to instances where both employ\u00e9s are so engag\u00e9d; and (3) because the' act offends against the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution (a) by unwarrantably interfering with the liberty of contract and (b) by arbitrarily placing all employers engaged in interstate commerce by railroad in a disfavored class and all their employ\u00e9s engaged in such commerce-in a favored class.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Briefly, stated, the departures from the common law made by the portions of the act against' which the first objection is leveled are these: (a) The rule that the negligence of one employ\u00e9 resulting in injury to another was not to be attributed to their common employer, is displaced by a rule imposing upon the employer responsibility for such an injury, as was done at common law when the injured person was not an employ\u00e9; (bythe rule exonerating ah employer from liability for injury sustained by an employ\u00e9 through the .concurring negligence of the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ployer and the employe is abrogated in all instances where the employer\u2019s violation of a statute enacted for the safety of his employ\u00e9s contributes to the injury, and in other instances, is displaced by the rule of comparative negligence, whereby the exoneration is only from a proportional part of the damages corresponding to the amount of negligence attributable to the employe; (c) the rule that - an employ\u00e9 was deemed to assume the risk of injury, even if due to the employer\u2019s negligence, where the employ\u00e9 voluntarily entered or remained in the service with an actual or presumed knowledge of the conditions out of which the risk arose, is abrogated in all instances where the employer\u2019s violation of a statute enacted for the safety of his employ\u00e9s contributed to the injury; and (d) the rule denying a right of action for the death of one person caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another is- displaced by a rule vesting such a right of action in the personal representatives of. the deceased for the benefit of designated relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Of the objection to these changes it is enough to observe:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">First. <em>\u201c k </em>person has no property, no vested interest, in any rule of the common law-; That is only one of the forms of municipal law, and is no more sacred than, any other. Rights' of property which have been created- by the common law cannot be taken away without due process; but the law itself, as a rule of conduct, may be changed at the will \u2022... of the legislature, unless prevented by constitutional limitations. Indeed, the great office of statutes is to remedy defects .in the .common law as they are developed; and to adapt it to the changes of time and circumstances.\u201d <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>94 U. S. 113, 134; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Pittsburg &amp; Lake Erie R. R. Co., </em>203 U. S. 284, 294; <em>The Lottawanna, </em>21 Wall. 558, 577; <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Commercial Milling Co., </em>218 U. S. 406, 417.</p>\n<p id=\"Aks\">Second. The. natural tendency of- the changes described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>is to impel the carriers to avoid or prevent the negligent acts and omissions which are made the bases of the. rights of recovery which the statute creates and defines; and, as whatever makes for that, end tends to promote the safety of the employes and. to advance the commerce in which' they are engaged, we entertain no doubt that in. making those changes Congress acted within the limits of the discretion confided to it. by the Constitution. <em>Lottery Case, </em>188 U. S. 321, 353, 355; <em>Atlantic Coast </em>Line <em>R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Riverside Mills, </em>219 U. S. 186, 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">We \u00e1re not unmindful that-that end was being measurably attained through the remedial legislation of the'several States, but that legislation has been far from uniform, and it undoubtedly rested with Congress to determine whether a national law, operating uniformly in all\" the States upon all carriers by railroad engaged in interstate commerce, would better subserve the needs of that com-.' merce. <em>The Lottawanna, </em>21 Wall. 558, 581-582; <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. </em>v. <em>Baugh, </em>149 U. S. 368, 378-379.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Th\u00e9 second objection proceeds upon' the theory that, even although Congress has- power to regulate the liability of a carrier for injuries sustained .by one employe through the negligence of another where all \u00e1re engaged in interstate commerce, that power does not embrace instances where the negligent employe is engaged in intrastate, commerce. But this is a .mistaken .theory, in that it treats the source of the injury,- rather than its effect upon interstate, commerce, as the criterion of-congressional power. As was said in <em>Southern Railway Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>222 U. S. 20, 27, that, power is plenary \u00e1nd competently may be exerted to secure the safety of interstate transportation and of those who are employed therein, no-matter what the'source of . the dangers which threaten it. The present act! unlike the one condemned in <em>Employers\u2019 Liability Cases, </em>207 U. S. 463, deals only with the liability of a carrier engaged, in interstate commerce for injuries sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>tained by its employes while engaged in such commerce. And this being so, it is not a valid objection that the act embraces instances where the causal negligence is that of an employ\u00e9 engaged in intrastate commerce; for such negligence, when operating injuriously upon an employ\u00e9 engaged in interstate commerce, has the same effect upon that commerce as if the negligent employ\u00e9 were also engaged therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Next in order is the objection that the provision in \u00a7 5, declaring void any contract, rule, regulation or device, the purpose or intent of which'is to enable a carrier to exempt itself from the liability which the act creates, is repugnant to the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution as an unwarranted interference with the liberty of contract. But of this it suffices to say, in view of our recent decisions in <em>Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>219 U. S. 549; <em>Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Riverside Mills, </em>219 U. S. 186, and <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Interstate Commerce Commission, </em>221 U. S. 612, that if Congress possesses the power to impose that liability, which we here hold that it does, it also possesses the power to insure its efficacy by prohibiting any contract, rule, regulation or device in evasion of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Coming to the question of classification, it is true that \u2018the liability which the act creates is imposed only on interstate carriers by railroad, although there are other interstate carriers, and is imposed for the benefit of all. \u00e9mploy\u00e9s of such carriers by railroad who ar\u00e9 employed in interstate commerce, although some are not subjected to the peculiar hazards incident to the operation of trains or to hazards that differ from those to.which .other \u00e9mploy\u00e9s in such commerce, not within the act, are exposed. But it does not follow that this classification is violative of the \u201cdue process of law\u201d clause of the Fifth Amendment. Even if it be assumed that that clause is equivalent to the \u201cequal protection of the laws'\u201d clause'of the Four<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>teenth Amendment, which is the most that can be claimed for it here, it does not take from Congress the power to classify, nor does it condemn exertions of that power merely because they occasion some inequalities. On the contrary, it admits of the exercise of \u00e1 wide discretion in classifying according to general, rather than minute, distinctions, and condemns what is done only when it is without any reasonable basis, and therefore is purely arbitrary. <em>Lindsley </em>v. <em>Carbonic Gas Co., </em>220 U. S. 61, 78. Tested by these standards, this classification is not objectionable. Like classifications of railroad carriers and employ\u00e9s for like purposes, when assailed under the equal protection clause, have been sustained by repeated decisions of this .court. <em>Missouri Pacific Railway. Co. </em>v. <em>Mackey, </em>127 U. S. 205; <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Melton, </em>218 U. S. 36; <em>Mobile, Jackson &amp; Kansas City Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Turnipseed, </em>219 U. S. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u2019 ..It follows that the answer to the second of the questions before stated must be that Congress has not exceeded its power by prescribing the regulations embodied in the present act.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The third question, whether those regulations supersede the laws of the States in so far. as the latter cover the same field, finds its answer in the following extracts from the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, 4 </em>Wheat. 316:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">(p.,.405) \u201cIf any one proposition could command the universal assent of mankind, we might expect it would be this: \u2014 that the; government of the Union, though limited ip its powers, is supreme within its sphere of action. This would seem to result necessarily from its nature. It is the government of all; its powers are delegated by all; it represents all, and acts for all.. Though any one State may be willing.to control its operations, no State is willing to. allow others to control them. The nation, on those subjects on which it can act, must necessarily^ bind its com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>ponent parts. But this question is not left to mere reason: the people have, in express terms, decided it, by saying, \u2018this constitution, and the- laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, . . . shall be the supreme law of the land,\u2019 and by requiring that the members of the state legislatures, and the officers of the executive and judicial departments of the States, shall take the oath of fidelity to it. The government\u2019 of the \"United States, then, though limited in its powers, is supreme; and its laws, when made in pursuance of the constitution, form the supreme law of the land, \u2018 anything in the constitution or laws of any State, to the contrary \u25a0notwithstanding.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">(p. 426) \u201cThis great principle is, that the constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof are supreme; that they control the constitution and laws of the respective States, and cannot be controlled by them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">. And particularly apposite is the repetition of that principle in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>124 U. S. 465, 473:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u201cThe grant of power to Congress in the Constitution to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several' States, it is conceded, is paramount over all legislative powers which, in consequence of not having been granted to Congress, are reserved to the States. It follows that any legislation of a State, although in pursuance of an acknowledged power reserved to it, which conflicts with the actual exercise of the power of Congress over the subject of commerce, must give way before the supremacy of the national authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">True, prior to the present act the laws -of the several States were regarded as determinative of the liability of employers engaged in interstate commerce for injuries received by their employ\u00e9s while engaged in such commerce. But that was because Congress, although empowered to regulate that subject, had not acted thereon, and because the subject is one which falls within the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>power of the States in the absence of action by Congress... <em>Sherlock </em>v. <em>Alling, </em>93 U. S. 99; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>124 U. S. 465, 473, 480, 482; <em>Nashville &amp;c. Railway v. Alabama, </em>128 U. S. 96, 99; <em>Reid v. Colorado, </em>187 U. S. 137, 146. The inaction of Congress, however, in no.wise affected, its power qver the subject. <em>The Lottawanna, </em>21 Wall. 558, 581; <em>Gloucester Ferry Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>114 U. S. 196, 215. And now th\u00e1t Congress has acted, the laws of the States, in so far as they cover the same field, are superseded, for necessarily that which is not supreme must yield to that which is. <em>Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Hefley, </em>158 U.S. 98, 104; <em>Southern Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>222 U. S. 424; <em>Northern Pacific Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>222 U. S. 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">We come next to. consider whether rights arising under the congressional act may be enforced, as.of right, in the courts- of the States when their jurisdiction, as prescribed by local laws, is adequate, to the occasion. The first of the cases now before us was begun in one of the Superior Courts of the. State of Connecticut, and, in that case, the Supreme Court of Errors of the State answered the question in the negative. That, however, was not because the ordinary jurisdiction of the Superior Courts, as-defined by the constitution and laws of the State, was deemed inadequate or not adapted to the adjudication of such \u00e1 case, but because the Supreme Court of Errors was of opinion. (1) that the congressional act impliedly restricts the enforcement of the rights which it creates to the Federal courts,, and (2) that, if this^be not so, the Superior Courts are at liberty to decline cognizance of actions to enforce rights arising under that act&gt; because (a) the policy manifested by it is not in ac\u00f3ord with the policy of the State respecting the liability of employers to em-. ploy\u00e9s for injuries received by the latter while in the servic\u00e9 of the former, and (b) it would b\u00e9 inconvenient and confusing for the same court, in dealing with- cases of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>same general class, t\u00f3 apply in some the standards of right established by the congressional act and in others the different standards recognized by the laws of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">We are quite unable to, assent to the view that the en-, forcement of the rights which the congressional act creates was originally intended to be restrict\u00e9d to the Federal courts. The-act contains nothing which is suggestive of such a restriction, and in this situation the. intention of Congress was reflected , by the provision in the general jurisdictional act, \u201cThat the \"circuit courts of the United States shall have original cognizance, <em>concurrent with the courts of the several States, </em>of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in..\u00bfequity, where the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of two .thousand dollars^ <em>.and arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d </em>August 13, 1888, 25 Stat. 433, c. 866, \u00a7 1. <em>Robb </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>111 U. S. 624, 637; <em>United </em>States v. <em>Barnes, </em>222 U. S. 513. This is emphasized by'the amendment engrafted upon the original act in 1910, to the effect that \u201cThe\u00bfjurisdiction of the courts of the-\" United States under this Act shall be <em>concurrent with that of the courts of the several States, </em>and no case arising under this Act and brought in. any state court, of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court , of the United States.\u201d. .The amendment, as appears by its language, instead of granting jurisdiction to the state courts, presupposes that they already possessed it. -</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Because of some general observations in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Errors, and to the end that the remaining ground of decision advanced therein may be more accurately understood, we deem it well to observe. ..that there is. not here involved any attempt by Congress to enlarge or regulate the jurisdiction of state courts or to control or affect their inodes of procedure, but only a question of the duty of such \u00e1 court, when its ordinary ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>risdiction as. prescribed by local laws is appropriate to the occasion and is invoked m conformity with those laws, to take cognizance of an action to enforce a right of civil recovery arising under the act of Congress and susceptible of adjudication according to the prevailing rules of procedure. We say \u201cwhen its ordinary jurisdiction as prescribed by local laws is appropriate to the occasion,\u201d because we are advised by. the decisions of the Supreme Court of Errors that the Superior Courts of the State are courts of general jurisdiction, are empowered to take cognizance of actions to recover for personal injuries .and for death, and are accustomed to exercise that jurisdiction, not only in cases, where the right of action arose under the laws of that State, but. alsoTn cases where it arose in another State, under its laws, and in circumstances in which the laws of Connecticut .give no right of recovery, as where the causal negligence was that of a fellow-servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">The suggestion that the act of Congress is not in harmony with the policy of the State, and therefore that the courts of the. State are free to decline jurisdiction, is quite inadmissible, because, it presupposes what in legal contemplation does not exist. When.Congress, in the exertion-of the power confided to it by the Constitution, adopted that act, it spoke for all the people and all the States, and thereby established a policy for all. That policy is as much the policy of Connecticut as if the act had emanated from its own legislature, and should be respected accordingly, in the courts of the State. As was said by this court in <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Houseman, </em>93 U. S. 130, 136, 137:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u201cThe laws of the United States are laws in the several States, and just as much binding on the citizens .and courts thereof as the State laws ar\u00e9. The United States is not a foreign sovereignty as regards the. several States, but is a concurrent, and, within its jurisdiction, paramount' sovereignty. . . .. If an act of Congr\u00e9Ss gives a penalty, [meaning civil and remedial] to a party aggrieved, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>specifying a remedy for its enforcement, there is no reason why it should not be enforced, if not provided otherwise by some act of Congress, by a proper action in \u00e1 state court. The fact that-a state court derives its existence and functions from the state laws is no reason why it should \u2019not. afford relief; because it is subject also to the laws- of the United States, and is j\u00fast as much bound to recognize these as operative within the State as it is to recognize the. state laws. The two together form one system of- jurisprudence, which constitutes the law of the land for the State; and the courts of the two jurisdictions are not . foreign to each other, nor to be'treated by each other as such) but as courts of the Same country, having jurisdiction partly different and..partly concurrent.- . . . It is true, the sovereignties are distinct, and neither can interfere with the proper jurisdiction of the. other, as was so clearly shown by Chief Justice Taney, in; the'case of <em>Ableman </em>v. <em>Booth, 21 </em>How. 506; and hence the state courts have no power to revise the action of the Federal courts, nor the Federal the state, exc\u00e9pt where the Federal Constitution or laws are involved'.. But this is no reason why the state courts should not be open for the prosecution of rights growing out of the laws of the United States, to which their jurisdiction is competent, and not denied.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"A_9\">We are not. disposed to believe that the exercise of jurisdiction by the state courts will he attended by any appreciable inconvenience or \"confusion; but, be this .as it may, it affords no reason for declining a jurisdiction conferred by law. The existence of the jurisdiction creates an implication of duty to exercise, it, and that its exercise may b\u00e9.onerouS does not militate against that implication. Besides, it is neither new nor unusual in judicial proceedings tP apply different rules of law to different situations, and subjects, \u00bfven although possessing some elements of similarity, as where the liability of a public carrier, for personal injuries turns upon whether the injured person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>was a-passenger, an employ\u00e9' or a stranger. But it never has been supposed that'courts are at liberty to decline cognizance of cases of a partic\u00fclar class merely because tlie rules of law -to be applied in their adjudication are unlike those applied in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"A4z\">We conclude that rights,arising under the act in question may be enforced, as of right, in the courts of the States when their jurisdiction* as prescribed, by local laws, is adequate to the occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In No. 289 several rulings in the progress of the cause, not covered by what already has been said, are called-in question, but it suffices to say of them that they have been carefully considered, and that we find, no reversible error in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>In Nos. 170, 289 \u25a0 and 290 the judgments are affirmed, and ' in No. 120 the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with \u2022 this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
