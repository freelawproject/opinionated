Sherck, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">{\u00b6 1} This is an appeal from a summary judgment issued by the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas against an employee in an employer intentional tort claim. Because we conclude that the employee submitted sufficient evidence to raise a question of fact concerning substantial certainty of injury, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Appellee, Toth Industries, Inc., is a manufacturer of auto components. Appellant, Edward A. Bee,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was a 15-year employee of appellee when, in 1999, he fractured his ankle on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant is a diabetic with an associated condition known as neuropa-thy, a lack of feeling or sensation in his feet. Because of this condition, appellant was at increased risk for blisters and infection associated with wearing a east.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">{\u00b6 4} On January 14, 1999, an orthopedic surgeon set appellant\u2019s fractured ankle and applied a short cast. Appellant was ordered off the foot. He remained off work until April 5, 1999. At that time, appellant\u2019s physician, received a 'fax from Bob McCullough, appellant\u2019s shift supervisor, seeking permission for appellant to return to work. McCullough characterized the work to which appellant would be assigned as \u201clight duty.\u201d Specifically, McCullough described appellant\u2019s proposed work duties as \u201cdata entry work and other desk type work at a computer station. This will require Ed to walk to his working area. At this point he will be able to sit in a chair during his working hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant\u2019s physician approved work release under the conditions stated and returned the proposal to McCullough. Appellant then returned to work on April 7. It is undisputed that neither the physician nor appellant ever informed appellee or its agents of appellant\u2019s neuropathy or the special risks it posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">{\u00b6 6} During his first week back at work, except for an errand outside the plant, appellant was assigned to data entry as indicated in his physician\u2019s release. During the second week, appellant was, however, assigned to do \u201ctiming checks\u201d on manufacturing machinery on the plant floor. Although appellant was able to conduct these checks while seated, it is undisputed that he was required to walk from machine to machine to perform this work. The exact distance appellant was required to walk is not clear from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">{\u00b6 7} Following two days of machine timing, appellant was fitted for an ankle brace. The fitter found a blister on appellant\u2019s heel and advised appellant to immediately contact his physician. Appellant\u2019s physician ordered him off the foot for four days, then permitted him to return to work with the instruction that appellant be restricted to a \u201csit down job only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant returned to work on April 20, 1999, but, despite the physician\u2019s written restrictions and appellant\u2019s own protests, was again assigned to perform timing checks on the shop floor. This assignment continued through April 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Appellant alleges that the walking from these three days on the floor caused a blister on his foot to become severely infected. As a result, appellant\u2019s left foot was amputated.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant then sued appellee,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging an intentional employer tort. Following discovery, the matter was submitted on cross-motions for summary judgment. On December 17, 2001, the trial court concluded that appellant failed to meet his burden to show \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d of harm. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee and denied appellant\u2019s cross-motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant sets forth the following sole assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendant Toth Industries, Inc.\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">{\u00b6 13} On review, appellate courts employ the same standard for summary judgment as do trial courts. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198. The motion may be granted only when it is demonstrated:</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c* * *(1) that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 67, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46; Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">{\u00b6 15} When seeking summary judgment, a party must specifically delineate the basis upon which the motion is brought, <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 526 N.E.2d 798, syllabus, and identify those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. When a properly supported motion for summary judgment is made, an adverse party may not rest on mere allegations or denials in the pleading but must respond with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact. Civ.R. 56(E); <em>Riley v. Montgomery </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 75, 79, 11 OBR 319, 463 N.E.2d 1246. A \u201cmaterial\u201d fact is one that would affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable substantive law. <em>Russell v. Interim Personnel, Inc. </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 301, 304, 733 N.E.2d 1186; <em>Needham v. Provident Bank </em>(1996), 110 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>App.3d 817, 826, 675 N.E.2d 514, citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">{\u00b6 16} Workers\u2019 compensation provides relief for employee injuries on the job and limits an employer\u2019s liability for workplace injuries. Under the system, an injured employee is compensated irrespective of fault. Keeton, Prosser <em>&amp; </em>Keeton on Torts (5th Ed.1984) 573-574; Fulton, Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (2d Ed.1998) 13-21. Employers who comply with Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statutes are immune from suit for an employee\u2019s injury or disease acquired in the course of or arising out of employment. R.C. 4123.74. Excepted from this arrangement, however, is an act committed by an employer wherein the employer intentionally injures the employee. <em>State ex rel. Ohio AFL-CIO v. Voinovich </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 225, 230, 631 N.E.2d 582; <em>Brady v. Safety-Kleen Corp. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 624, 630, 576 N.E.2d 722. Such an act is outside the purview of the workers\u2019 compensation statute. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">{If 17} In order to establish the \u201cintent\u201d necessary to sustain an employer intentional tort, a plaintiff must show:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(1) knowledge by the employer of the existence of a dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality or condition within its business operation; (2) knowledge by the employer that if the employee is subjected by his employment to such dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality or condition, then harm to the employee will be a substantial certainty; and (3) that the employer, under such circumstances, and with such knowledge, did act to require the employee to continue to perform the dangerous task.\u201d <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">{\u00b6 19} While ordinarily the <em>Fyffe </em>test is applicable to workplace conditions that may be universally hazardous, such as toxic chemicals or dangerous equipment, it may also be reasonably construed to apply to dangers which are idiopathic. <em>Sinea v. Denman Tire Corp. </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 44, 58, 732 N.E.2d 1033, discretionary appeal not allowed in (2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 1415, 723 N.E.2d 120; see, also, <em>Tulloh v. Goodyear Atomic Corp. </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 740, 639 N.E.2d 1203. Thus, an employer who forces its employee to work in an environment that violates the employee\u2019s valid medical restriction may be found to have intended to harm the employee. <em>Sinea, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">{\u00b6 20} In this matter, the trial court concluded that appellee was aware that if appellant worked in violation of the specific medical restriction imposed by his physician, injury might follow. The court concluded that this gave rise to a question of fact concerning the first prong of the <em>Fyffe </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">{\u00b6 21} The trial court, nevertheless, concluded that because appellant\u2019s injury was not the \u201cexact danger\u201d to which the medical restriction apparently applied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>appellee did not have knowledge that there was a \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d that appellant would be injured in the manner in which he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">{\u00b6 22} The court further concluded that, on the information that appellant\u2019s supervisor had, he could reasonably assume that appellant\u2019s restrictions were intended to promote the healing of his fractured ankle. Given this understanding, it was, therefore, reasonable to broadly interpret the proviso that appellant could \u201cwalk to his working area\u201d as leave to require that appellant walk between machine groupings as he timed the machinery. Consequently, appellee did not knowingly require appellant to perform the dangerous task, except with respect to the single trip out of the plant. Moreover, the court concluded, since the trip outside the plant was three weeks before the onset of infection, appellant could not show proximate cause as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">{\u00b6 23} The trial court begins its analysis of the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d prong of the <em>Fyffe </em>test with reference to the standard articulated by this court in <em>Richie v. Rogers Cartage Co. </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 638, 644, 626 N.E.2d 1012. There we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe difficult issue in any employer intentional tort case is the degree of risk the employer can take before its conduct is legally considered to be, or can legally be inferred to be, an intentional act to injure. The employee need not prove that the employer had an actual subjective intent to cause the injury sustained or that the employer knew that the exact injury sustained would occur. <em>[Fyffe] </em>at 117, 570 N.E.2d 1108. However, the mere knowledge and appreciation of a risk is not enough. <em>Id., </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. The employee must prove that the employer knew that because of the exact danger posed, the employee would be harmed in some manner similar to the injury sustained or that the employer knew that because of the exact danger posed, it was highly probable (substantially certain) that the employee would be harmed in some manner similar to the injury sustained. <em>Id.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">{\u00b6 25} In the end, the trial court concluded that because appellee did not know the \u201cexact danger posed\u201d (neuropathy) that it was not substantially certain that appellant would be harmed in a manner similar to the injury sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">{\u00b6 26} The difficulty with the trial court\u2019s analysis arises from the translation of the <em>Fyffe </em>test from an environmental context to an idiopathic context. <em>Fyffe </em>and <em>Richie, </em>indeed most workplace intentional torts, are environmental hazards, e.g., <em>Fyffe, </em>supra (removal of a safety guard); <em>Richie, </em>supra (improperly ventilat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ed cleaning area for flammable materials); <em>Vermett v. Fred Christen &amp; Sons </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 586, 741 N.E.2d 954 (industrial press operated against express manufacturer warnings). These conditions may harm any employee unfortunate enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. When an employer knows of such a condition and is aware that some type of resulting injury to someone is substantially certain, this is the intent necessary to establish an employer intentional tort. <em>Fyffe </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. The missing guard or poor ventilation or improper procedure is the \u201cexact danger\u201d posed from which \u201csome manner\u201d of injury occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">{\u00b6 27} Medical restrictions, however, are inherently idiopathic. A condition or a substance or a practice that is perfectly benign for most employees becomes harmful to a specific employee because of that employee\u2019s specific condition, e.g., <em>Sinea, </em>supra (back injury required lifting restrictions); <em>Tulloh, </em>supra (employee should not be exposed to certain chemicals because of prior bacterial infection); <em>Raines v. Rubbermaid, Inc. </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 384, 678 N.E.2d 988 (shoulder injury required lift restrictions and no duties with repetitive motions). With a medical restriction, it is the violation of the restriction itself that poses the \u201cexact danger\u201d from which \u201csome manner\u201d of injury occurs. To hold otherwise would be to permit an employer to substitute its lay opinion of an employee\u2019s medical condition for that of a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">{\u00b6 28} Such a substitute of judgment appears to be what happened in this case. In his deposition testimony, appellant\u2019s immediate supervisor, Bob McCullough, testified that he was not aware of appellant\u2019s neuropathy. McCullough believed that requiring appellant to walk between work stations several times during the day posed no greater risk than that appellant\u2019s fractured ankle might not set properly. McCullough, nevertheless, did have knowledge of the medical restriction, the violation of which was the \u201cexact danger\u201d posed to his employee. Appellant presents evidence which, if believed, would establish that McCullough, as appellee\u2019s agent, required appellant to work in violation of his medical restriction. That violation caused the blister that led to the infection that caused appellant\u2019s foot to be amputated. Such evidence gives rise to disputed facts that preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">{\u00b6 29} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">{\u00b6 30} Appellee has interposed a conditional assignment of error, pursuant to R.C. 2505.22, in support of affirmance. Appellee contends that the trial court considered portions of appellant\u2019s expert medical testimony in violation of Evid.R. 702 and 703. Specifically, appellee argues that the court should not have considered the opinion of appellee\u2019s treating physician that if appellee was required to walk on the job that it was \u201csubstantially certain\u201d that he would develop an ulcer on his foot which would lead to amputation. Such testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>does not require an expert or, alternatively, is beyond the treating physician\u2019s expertise, according to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">{\u00b6 31} With or without the treating physician\u2019s testimony on this issue, there is sufficient evidence to create a question of fact with respect to causation. Therefore, we decline appellee\u2019s invitation to enter an interlocutory ruling on an evidentiary question. The question of the proper scope of expert testimony is not yet ripe.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">{\u00b6 32} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is reversed. This matter is remanded to that court for further consideration consistent with this decision. Costs to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-8\">Mark L. Pietrykowski, P. J., and Richard W.
