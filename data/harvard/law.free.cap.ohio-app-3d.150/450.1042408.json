He argued that R.C. 2923.42 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that it violated his right to free speech, assembly, and association under the First Amendment. After a hearing, the trial court granted Bennett\u2019s motion to dismiss. The trial court ruled that R.C. 2923.42 was unconstitutionally vague \u201c \u2018because it fail[ed] to establish standards for the police and public that are sufficient to guard against the arbitrary deprivation of liberty.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court also held that the statute violated due process because as written it made no connection between gang membership and the crime a defendant might commit. Thus, the trial court reasoned that the statute provided a \u201ca gang offense and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>gang punishment for a person who is an active participant in a gang for committing any crime, even, one unrelated to the gang.\u201d As a consequence, the trial court concluded that a gang participant is \u201cheld to be promoting gang interests even when he obviously is not doing so.\u201d Thus, the trial court determined that the crime of \u201cparticipating in a criminal gang\u201d was based on a defendant\u2019s status as a gang member, rather than on his participation in the gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">{\u00b6 3} Shortly thereafter, the trial court sua sponte dismissed the charge against Jasper. In its entry dismissing the charge against Jasper, the trial court additionally held the statute \u201cunconstitutionally overbroad\u201d and incorporated its earlier decision in <em>State v. Bennett </em>by reference. The state now appeals the dismissals, raising one assignment of error. The Ohio Attorney General has filed an amicus curiae brief supporting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">{\u00b6 4} In its sole assignment of error, the state contends the trial court erred in holding R.C. 2923.42 unconstitutional. The state argues that R.C. 2923.42 is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and that it does not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">I. Ohio\u2019s Criminal Gang Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 2923.42 is just one part of a comprehensive criminal law specifically aimed at criminal street gangs. In 1998, the Ohio legislature passed Am.Sub. H.B. No. 2 in an effort to \u201ceradicate the terror created by criminal gangs by providing enhanced penalties [for gang members] and by eliminating the patterns, profits, proceeds, and instrumentalities of criminal gang activity.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The law, which took effect on January 1, 1999, criminalizes participation in criminal street gang activity by creating the offense of \u201cparticipating in a criminal gang\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and providing enhanced sentences for gang-related felonies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The law additionally permits buildings, premises, or real estate used by criminal street gangs to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>declared nuisances,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as well as providing for the forfeiture of gang-related property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 2923.42(A), which is the subject of this appeal, states: \u201cNo person who actively participates in a criminal gang, with knowledge that the criminal gang engages in or has engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity, shall purposely promote, further, or assist any criminal conduct, as defined in division (C) of section 2923.41 of the Revised Code, or shall purposely commit or engage in any act that constitutes criminal conduct, as defined in division (C) of section 2923.41 of the Revised Code.\u201d Section 2923.42(B) states: \u201cWhoever violates this section is guilty of participating in a criminal gang, a felony of the second degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">II. Other Ohio Appellate Decisions Interpreting R.C. 2923.42</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">{\u00b6 7} Since we have heard oral argument on these cases, the Ninth and Tenth Appellate Districts have each addressed the constitutionality of R.C. 2923.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>State v. </em>Williams,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Tenth Appellate District rejected a defendant\u2019s claim that R.C. 2923.42 and 2923.41(B) were void for vagueness under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Sections 1 and 3, Article 1 of the Ohio Constitution. The court also rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the statutes were unconstitutionally overbroad because they infringed the right of association as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Section 3, Article I, of the Ohio Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">{\u00b6 9} Although the Tenth Appellate District did not identify the specific language that the defendant had argued was vague, it nonetheless focused on the terms \u201ccriminal gang\u201d and \u201cpattern of criminal gang activity\u201d as defined in R.C. 2923.41.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court then relied upon statutes and case law from other states that had held these terms to be constitutional and concluded that \u201cthe terms at issue [were] sufficiently certain to give a defendant reasonable notice of the conduct which the statute prohibit[ed]\u201d and to prohibit arbitrary enforcement by law enforcement officials.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>{\u00b6 10} The Tenth Appellate District additionally held that R.C. 2923.42 was not void for vagueness because it required more than just knowledge of criminal conduct for a defendant to be convicted of \u201cparticipating in criminal gang activity.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court reasoned that R.C. 2923.42(A)\u2019s requirement that a defendant \u201cactively participate with knowledge that the criminal gang engages in or has engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity and must purposively promote, further, or assist any criminal conduct,\u201d combined with the definitions in R.C. 2923.41(B), sufficiently notified \u201cpersons of ordinary intelligence\u201d of the prohibited conduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">{\u00b6 11} The Tenth Appellate District also rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that R.C. 2923.42 was overbroad because it impermissibly established \u201cguilt by association.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court stated that because R.C. 2923.42 required that a person \u201c[1] actively participate in a criminal gang [2] with knowledge of the criminal gang and [3] that the person purposely promotes, furthers, or assists any criminal conduct,\u201d a defendant could not be convicted solely for associating with other gang members; instead, the statute required that the defendant actively participate in the gang with the specific intent to further the group\u2019s goals before that defendant could be convicted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>State v. </em>Stallings,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the Ninth Appellate District rejected a defendant\u2019s arguments that R.C. 2923.42(A) was facially unconstitutional because it was vague, criminalized membership in an organization, and inflicted cruel and unusual punishment. The defendant in <em>Stallings </em>had argued that R.C. 2923.42(A) was void for vagueness because the statute failed to define the term \u201cactively\u201d as used in the phrase \u201cactively participates,\u201d and because the phrase \u201cpurposely promote, further, or assist any criminal conduct\u201d was too uncertain to provide an ordinary person with notice of what conduct the statute prohibited.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">{\u00b6 13} The Ninth Appellate District, relying upon California and Indiana case law for guidance, held that R.C. 2923.42(A) was not void for vagueness for its failure to define the term \u201cactively participates,\u201d because that term had a common and ordinary meaning.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court, again relying on California case law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>further determined that the phrase \u201cpurposely promote, further, or assist any criminal conduct\u201d was synonymous with the definition of an aider and abettor, and thus well defined under Ohio law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As a result, the court held that the defendant had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that R.C. 2923.42 was void for vagueness.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">{\u00b6 14} In addressing the defendant\u2019s claim that R.C. 2923.42 punished membership in an organization and thus rendered the statute overbroad, the Ninth Appellate District relied upon the Tenth Appellate District\u2019s analysis in <em>State v. Williams.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court held that R.C. 2923.42 \u201crequires an express showing that (1) the individual actively participates in a criminal gang, with knowledge of the criminal gang; (2) the individual engages in or has engaged in the pattern of criminal gang activity; and (3) the individual purposely promotes, furthers, or assists any criminal conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the court concluded that the state could not prosecute an individual unless he had the specific intent or purpose to further the gang\u2019s criminal actions.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that R.C. 2923.42 criminalized mere membership in an organization.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The court also held that because R.C. 2923.42 did not criminalize mere membership in a gang, it did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">III. The Trial Court\u2019s Decision in <em>State v. Bennett </em>and <em>State v. Jasper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>State v. Bennett, </em>the trial court held that R.C. 2923.42 was unconstitutional for two separate reasons. First, the court stated that R.C. 2923.42 was unconstitutionally vague because it \u201cfail[ed] to establish standards for the police and public that [were] sufficient to guard against the arbitrary deprivation of liberty.\u201d Second, the court held that R.C. 2923.42 violated the Due Process Clause because the statute permitted a gang member to be convicted of \u201cparticipating in a criminal gang\u201d when the gang member committed any crime, even one that was unrelated to the gang. In <em>State v. Jasper, </em>the trial court additionally held that R.C. 2923.42 was overbroad because it inhibited the exercise of First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>{\u00b6 16} We begin our analysis by noting that all legislative enactments must be afforded a strong presumption of constitutionality.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, the party challenging a statute must prove that it is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> If at all possible, statutes must be construed in conformity with the Ohio and United States Constitutions.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> So where there is more than one possible interpretation of a statute, the court must construe the statute to save it from constitutional infirmities.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> With these general principles in mind, we turn to the state\u2019s argument that R.C. 2923.42 does not violate due-process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">IV. R.C. 2923.42 Does Not Violate Due-Process Rights</p>\n<p id=\"AQA\">{\u00b6 17} The United States Supreme Court has recognized that a criminal statute may violate due-process principles in two separate ways. First, a criminal statute may be void for vagueness. The vagueness doctrine, which is premised on the due-process provision of the Fourteenth Amendment,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201cbars enforcement of \u2018a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Second, a criminal statute may also violate due process under the Fifth Amendment when it \u201cimpermissibly imputes guilt to an individual merely on the basis of his associations and sympathies, rather than because of some concrete personal involvement in criminal conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Thus, a criminal statute that provides for guilt by association is unconstitutional no matter how clear the notice or how fair the hearing it provides. In this case, the trial court\u2019s decision, which found that R.C. 2923.42 violated due-process rights, implicated both of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">A. R.C. 2923.42 Is Not Unconstitutionally Vague</p>\n<p id=\"AMy\">{\u00b6 18} We first address whether R.C. 2923.42 is void for vagueness. The state argues that R.C. 2923.42 is not unconstitutionally vague because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>clearly defines the conduct it prohibits, thus preventing arbitrary law enforcement and providing adequate notice to potential offenders. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">{\u00b6 19} As we have already noted, a criminal statute must clearly define its prohibitions so that persons of ordinary intelligence may comprehend the statute to fairly inform themselves of the generally proscribed behavior and so that the statute does not encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> So, in order to withstand a facial vagueness challenge under the Due Process Clause, R.C. 2923.42 must satisfy two basic requirements. First, the statute must be sufficiently definite to provide a person of ordinary intelligence with adequate notice of the conduct that the statute proscribes. Second, the statute must provide sufficiently definite guidelines for law enforcement officials in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> A statute is not vague solely because it could have been drafted more precisely.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">{\u00b6 20} In both cases before us, the trial court summarily stated that R.C. 2923.42 was void for vagueness without pointing to any specific terms or phrases in R.C. 2923.42 that it found to be vague. The trial court\u2019s analysis, however, focused solely on the fact that a gang member could be convicted under R.C. 2923.42 for committing \u201cany criminal conduct.\u201d Thus, we must ascertain whether the phrase \u201cany criminal conduct\u201d is so vague that it fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence with adequate notice of the conduct that it proscribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 2923.42(A) provides, \u201cNo person who actively participates in a criminal gang, with knowledge that the criminal gang engages in or has engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity, shall purposely promote, further, or assist <em>any criminal conduct, </em>as defined in division (C) of section 2923.41 of the Revised Code, or shall purposely commit or engage in any act that constitutes <em>criminal conduct, </em>as defined in division (C) of section 2923.41 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">{\u00b6 22} Criminal conduct is defined in R.C. 2923.41(C) as \u201cthe commission of, an attempt to commit, a conspiracy to commit, complicity in the commission of, or solicitation, coercion, or intimidation of another to commit, attempt to commit, conspire to commit, or be in complicity in the commission of an offense listed in division (B)(1)(a), (b), or (c) of this section or an act that is committed by a juvenile and that would be an offense, an attempt to commit an offense, a conspiracy to commit an offense, complicity in the commission of, or solicitation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>coercion, or intimidation of another to commit, attempt to commit, conspire to commit, or be in complicity in the commission of an offense listed in division (B)(1)(a), (b), or (c) of this section if committed by an adult.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 23} R.C. 2923.41(B)(1) provides: \u201c \u2018Pattern of criminal gang activity\u2019 means, subject to division (B)(2) of this section, that persons in the criminal gang have committed, attempted to commit, conspired to commit, been complicitors in the commission of, or solicited, coerced, or intimidated another to commit, attempt to commit, conspire to commit, or be in complicity in the commission of two or more of any of the following offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(a) A felony or an act committed by a juvenile that would be a felony if committed by an adult;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(b) An offense of violence or an act committed by a juvenile that would be an offense of violence if committed by an adult;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(c) A violation of section 2907.04 [unlawful sexual conduct with a minor], 2909.06 [criminal damaging or endangering], 2911.211 [aggravated trespass], 2917.04 [failure to disperse], 2919.23 [interference with custody], or 2919.24 of the Revised Code [contributing to unruliness or delinquency of a child], section 2921.04 [intimidation of attorney, victim, or witness in criminal case] or 2923.16 of the Revised Code [improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle], section 2925.03 of the Revised Code [trafficking in drugs] if the offense is trafficking in marihuana, or section 2927.12 of the Revised Code [ethnic intimidation].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">{\u00b6 27} Having reviewed the definition of \u201cany criminal conduct,\u201d we cannot say that R.C. 2923.42 is so vague that it fails to provide sufficient notice of the conduct that it prohibits. When R.C. 2923.42(A) is read in conjunction with the definition of criminal conduct contained in R.C. 2923.41(B) and (C), the statute attaches criminal liability only to a person who (1) is an active gang member, (2) has knowledge that the gang engages in or has engaged in a pattern of criminal activity, and (3) purposely promotes, furthers, or assists other gang members in a pattern of criminal gang activity (as defined by R.C. 2923.41[B][2] )<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> by partiei-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>pating in two or more of the enumerated offenses in R.C. 2923.41(B)(1) <em>or </em>purposely commits or engages in a pattern of criminal gang activity by committing or engaging in two or more of the enumerated offenses in R.C. 2923.41(B)(1). Because the definition of criminal conduct in R.C. 2923.41(B) and (C) is highly specific, is clear in its intent and scope, and links the criminal conduct of the gang member to that of the criminal gang, we cannot say that it fails to provide ordinary persons with notice of its prohibited conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">{\u00b628} We next address whether R.C. 2923.42 provides an explicit standard for those who apply it. The statute, again through its extensive definition of \u201cany criminal conduct,\u201d is sufficiently narrow in scope and sufficiently explicit to provide law enforcement personnel with ample standards for its application. The statute permits liability only when a person who is an active gang member has knowledge that the gang is engaged in or has engaged in criminal activity and purposely promotes, furthers, or assists other gang members in the commission of two or more of the enumerated offenses in R.C. 2923.41(B)(1) or purposely commits or engages in a pattern of criminal gang activity by committing or engaging in two or more of the enumerated offenses in R.C. 2923.41(B)(1). Thus, the statute ensures that law enforcement officials may punish only those members of a criminal gang who are aware of the gang\u2019s criminal activities and who actively participate in those activities. Because R.C. 2923.42 gives persons of ordinary intelligence fair warning of its prohibited conduct and does not encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement, we agree with the state that R.C. 2923.42 is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">B. R.C. 2923.42 Does Not Provide for Guilt by Association</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 29} In addition to finding the statute void for vagueness, the trial court also found that R.C. 2923.42 violates the Due Process Clause because the statute permits a gang member to be convicted of \u201cparticipating in a criminal gang\u201d when the gang member commits any crime, even one that is unrelated to the gang, thus giving rise to guilt by association. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">{\u00b6 30} In <em>Scales v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a statute criminalizing group membership does not give rise to \u201cguilt by association,\u201d which would violate both the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause and the First Amendment, as long as the statute reaches only \u201cactive\u201d members of the group who have knowledge of the group\u2019s illegal goals and who entertain the specific intent to advance those goals. With respect to the Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Amendment, the court reasoned, \u201cIn our jurisprudence guilt is personal, and when the imposition of punishment on a status or on conduct can only be justified by reference to the relationship of that status or conduct to other concededly criminal activity***, that relationship must be sufficiently substantial to satisfy the concept of personal guilt in order to withstand attack under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Thus, under <em>Scales, </em>the government is forbidden to provide for guilt by association \u201cno matter how clear the notice and no matter how fair the hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 31} R.C. 2923.42 comports with the due-process requirements set forth in <em>Scales </em>because it punishes conduct, not association. A person may be convicted under the statute only when (1) the person actively participates in a street gang; (2) the person participates in the gang with knowledge that the gang\u2019s members engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity; and (3) the person willfully promotes, furthers, or assists other gang members in the commission of two or more of the enumerated offenses in R.C. 2923.41(B)(1) or the person commits or' engages in a pattern of gang activity by committing two or more of the enumerated offenses in R.C. 2923.41(B).<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Because the statutory elements necessary to prove a violation of R.C. 2923.42 satisfy <em>Scales, </em>R.C. 2923.42 does not provide for guilt by association.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">V. R.C. 2923.42 Is Not Overbroad</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 32} The state next argues that R.C. 2923.42 does not infringe the right to free speech or association and therefore is not overbroad. We agree. In its entry dismissing the charge against Jasper, the trial court ruled that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and incorporated its earlier decision in <em>State v. Bennett </em>by reference. Although the trial court never explicitly stated why it found R.C. 2923.42 to be unconstitutionally overbroad, the court was apparently troubled by the fact that R.C. 2923.42 tied a defendant\u2019s criminal liability to his gang membership, thus violating the defendant\u2019s right of association.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">{\u00b6 33} In order for a statute that regulates conduct to be considered overbroad, \u201cthe overbreadth of [the] statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\u201cspecific doctrine of overbreadth relates only to First Amendment issues.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has recognized that the right of association, which stems from the First Amendment,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> \u201cencompasses two distinct types of freedoms\u201d: \u201cThe first type of freedom of association includes the choice to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships. * * * The second type of freedom is the right to associate for the purpose of engaging in expressive activity protected by the First Amendment. This includes rights of free speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the exercise of religion.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Chicago v. Morales, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated that the right of association does not encompass \u201csocial contact between gang members and others.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has also stated that those organizations that commit felonies are not protected by the right of association.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Thus, R.C. 2923.42 does not prohibit gang members from enjoying those kinds of associations that are protected by the First Amendment. Furthermore, because individuals cannot be punished under R.C. 2923.42 unless they are active in the gang, have knowledge of its illegal activities, and are in some way linked with the gang\u2019s commission of crimes, we cannot say that R.C. 2923.42 violates any other group\u2019s rights of free association.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 35} Because R.C. 2923.42 is not vague or overbroad and does not violate due-process rights, we must sustain the sole assignment of error. Consequently, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand these cases for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b493-9\">Hildebrandt, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A-M\">Painter, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-15\">.
