Stallings, appeals from his convictions for possession of cocaine and criminal gang activity in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">{\u00b6 2} On July 10, 2000, the Summit County Grand Jury indicted defendant on possession of cocaine, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). Thereafter, a supplemental indictment was filed, wherein the grand jury indicted defendant on criminal gang activity, in violation of R.C. 2923.42(A). Another supplemental indictment was filed and the grand jury indicted defendant on three additional counts: (1) criminal gang activity, in violation of R.C. 2923.42(A); (2) receiving stolen property, in violation of R.C. 2913.51(A); and (3) trafficking in marijuana, in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2). Defendant contended that R.C. 2923.42(A) was unconstitutional and, therefore, moved to dismiss both counts of criminal gang activity. The trial court found R.C. 2923.42(A) constitutional and denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">{\u00b6 3} Defendant subsequently pled no contest to the charge of possession of cocaine and the charge of criminal gang activity, as contained in the initial supplemental indictment, and the remaining three charges were dismissed. The trial court found defendant guilty of possession of cocaine and criminal gang activity and sentenced him accordingly. Defendant timely appeals and raises one assignment of error for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe trial court erred when it denied [defendant\u2019s] motion to dismiss count\u2019s [sic] two and three of the indictment on constitutional grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">{\u00b6 5} In his sole assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to dismiss the two counts of criminal gang activity. Defendant\u2019s contention rests on his assertion that R.C. 2923.42(A) is facially unconstitutional. Particularly, defendant asserts that R.C. 2923.42(A) violates the United States and Ohio Constitutions because it is vague, criminalizes membership in an organization, and inflicts cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant\u2019s contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>{\u00b6 6} An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss de novo. <em>State v. Benton </em>(2000), 136 Ohio App.3d 801, 805, 737 N.E.2d 1046. Thus, an appellate court does not give deference to the determination of the trial court. <em>Akron v. Frazier </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 718, 721, 756 N.E.2d 1258. See, also, <em>Tamarkin Co. v. Wheeler </em>(1992), 81 Ohio App.3d 232, 234, 610 N.E.2d 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">{\u00b6 7} All statutes enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality. <em>Desenco, Inc. v. Akron </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 535, 538, 706 N.E.2d 323; <em>Hughes v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 305, 307, 681 N.E.2d 430. \u201cAn enactment of the General Assembly is presumed to be constitutional, and before a court may declare it unconstitutional it must appear beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation and constitutional provisions are clearly incompatible.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus. The party challenging the constitutionality of the statute bears the burden of proving its constitutional infirmity. <em>Beagle v. Walden </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 59, 61, 676 N.E.2d 506, quoting <em>Fabrey v. McDonald Village Police Dept. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 351, 352, 639 N.E.2d 31; <em>Arnold v. Cleveland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 35, 38-39, 616 N.E.2d 163. To prove the constitutional infirmity of a statute, the challenger must demonstrate that a clear conflict exists between the statute and some particular provision or provisions of the United States or Ohio Constitution. <em>Xenia v. Schmidt </em>(1920), 101 Ohio St. 437, 130 N.E. 24, paragraph two of the syllabus. Accordingly, R.C. 2923.42 enjoys the presumption of constitutional validity, and the burden lies on defendant to demonstrate its constitutional shortcomings.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 2923.42(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cNo person who actively participates in a criminal gang, with knowledge that the criminal gang engages in or has engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity, shall purposely promote, further, or assist any criminal conduct, as defined in [R.C. 2923.41(C) ], or shall purposely commit or engage in any act that constitutes criminal conduct, as defined in [R.C. 2923.41(C) ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">{\u00b6 10} We will now separately discuss each of defendant\u2019s constitutional challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Vagueness</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">{\u00b6 11} Defendant argues that R.C. 2923.42(A) is void for vagueness and, thus, constitutes a denial of due process under the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution. As the federal and state vagueness analysis is identical, they will be addressed jointly. <em>State v. Williams, </em>148 Ohio App.3d 473, 2002-Ohio-3777, 773 N.E.2d 1107, at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Under the basic principles of due process, a statute is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. <em>Grayned v. Rockford </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222. Further, a statute is void for vagueness if its terms invite arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. <em>Kolender v. Lawson </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903. However, a statute does not need to avoid all vagueness. See <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 110, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222. As statutes are restricted to the use of words, there will always be uncertainties because we cannot expect strict certainty from our language. Id. Therefore, a statute will not be deemed void for vagueness if individuals of ordinary intelligence could comprehend it to the extent that it would fairly inform them as to the generally prohibited conduct. <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 601, 607, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830; <em>Coates v. Cincinnati </em>(1971), 402 U.S. 611, 614, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214. See <em>Colten v. Kentucky </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 104, 110, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 32 L.Ed.2d 584. The Ohio Supreme Court has specified that the void-for-vagueness doctrine implicates various values:</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[F]irst, to provide fair warning to the ordinary citizen so behavior may comport with the dictates of the statute; second, to preclude arbitrary, capricious and generally discriminatory enforcement by officials given too much authority and too few constraints; and third, to ensure the fundamental constitutionally protected freedoms are not unreasonably impinged or inhibited. Proper constitutional analysis necessitates a review of each of these rationales with respect to the challenged statutory language.\u201d <em>State v. Tanner </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 15 OBR 1, 472 N.E.2d 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">{\u00b6 14} Defendant specifically argues that R.C. 2923.42(A) is void for vagueness for two reasons. First, the statute requires an individual to \u201cactively participate\u201d in a criminal gang; however, the statute fails to define the term \u201cactive\u201d in the statute. Second, the statute states that an individual shall \u201cpurposely promote, further, or assist any criminal conduct\u201d; yet, an individual cannot reasonably know what actions constitute promoting or furthering criminal conduct in violation of the statute. To facilitate review, we will separately address the statutory language that defendant argues is void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u201cActively Participate\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">{\u00b6 15} When construing the relevant provisions of a statute, this court strives to ascertain and effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent. See, e.g., <em>Black-Clawson Co. v. Evatt </em>(1941), 139 Ohio St. 100, 104-106, 22 O.O. 63, 38 N.E.2d 403; <em>State ex rel. Myers v. Spencer Twp. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1917), 95 Ohio St. 367, 373, 116 N.E. 516. As the statutory language provides the most reliable indicator of that intent, we turn to the words themselves. <em>Layman v. Woo </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>485, 487, 678 N.E.2d 1217, citing <em>State ex rel. Gareau v. Stillman </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 63, 64, 47 O.O.2d 187, 247 N.E.2d 461. When a term is not defined by statute, it is accorded its common, ordinary meaning. <em>Cleveland v. GSX Chem. Servs. of Ohio, Inc. </em>(May 7, 1992), 8th Dist. No. 60512, 1992 WL 95735. Furthermore, R.C. 1.42 states that \u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">{\u00b6 16} The common and ordinary meaning of \u201cactively\u201d is \u201ccharacterized by action rather than by contemplation or speculation\u201d or \u201cbeing in a state of action; not passive or quiescent.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1984) 54; American Heritage Dictionary (3d Ed.1992) 18. The common and ordinary meaning of \u201cparticipates\u201d is \u201cto take part in something (as an enterprise or activity)[.]\u201d Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary (1993) 1646. Accordingly, an individual \u201c \u2018actively participates\u2019 in some enterprise or activity by taking part in it in a manner that is not passive.\u201d <em>People v. Castenada </em>(2000), 23 Cal.4th 743, 747, 97 Cal.Rptr.2d 906, 3 P.3d 278. As applied to R.C. 2923.42(A), the common and ordinary meaning of \u201cactively participates in a criminal gang\u201d is involvement with a criminal gang that is more than nominal or passive. See id., interpreting \u201cactively participates in any criminal street gang,\u201d which is contained in CaLPenal Code 186.22(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to mean involvement that is more than passive. See, also, <em>Helton v. State </em>(1993), 624 N.E.2d 499, 510, fn. 15 (construing Indiana\u2019s Gang Statute, Ind.Code 35-45-9-3,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requirement that one \u201cactively participate^] * * * in a group\u201d to require more than mere nominal, inactive, purely technical, or passive membership). Consequently, after applying the common and ordinary meaning of \u201cactively participates,\u201d we find that R.C. 2923.42(A) is not void for vagueness due to its failure to define these terms. See <em>Helton, </em>624 N.E.2d at 507 (rejecting void-for-vagueness challenge to Ind.Code 35-45-9-3 prohibiting active participation in criminal street gang); <em>Castenada, </em>23 Cal.4th at 752, 97 Cal. Rptr.2d 906, 3 P.3d 278 (finding that legislature\u2019s wording of \u201cactively participates,\u201d as contained in CaLPenal Code 186.22(a), is not void for vagueness).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\u201cPurposely Promote, Further, or Assist Any Criminal Conduct\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 2923.42(A) provides that criminal liability will not be imposed unless the defendant has \u201cpurposely promoted], furthered], or assisted] any criminal conduct.\u201d As Ohio has yet to specifically address this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>language,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we turn to California law for guidance. In particular, we find that the language of R.C. 2923.42(A) virtually mirrors CahPenal Code 186.22(a), which imposes liability on a defendant who \u201cwillfully promotes, furthers, or assists in any felonious criminal conduct by members of that gang[.]\u201d In <em>People v. Green </em>(1991), 227 Cal.App.3d 692, 703-704, 278 Cal.Rptr. 140, the court found that the language of 186.22(a) was synonymous with the definition of an aider and abettor of a crime<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, therefore, the phrase was well defined and not void for vagueness. In Ohio, an aider and abettor of a crime is one who \u201cassist[s] or facilitate^] the commission of a crime, or [who] promote[s] its accomplishment.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 243, 754 N.E.2d 796; <em>Horstman v. Farris </em>(1999), 132 Ohio App.3d 514, 527, 725 N.E.2d 698; <em>State v. Sims </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 56, 58, 10 OBR 65, 460 N.E.2d 672; <em>State v. Jones, </em>7th Dist. No. 97CA99, 2002-0hio-2660, at \u00b6 36. As the definition of an aider and abettor, under Ohio law, is practically identical to the language contained in R.C. 2923.42(A), and in conjunction with the determination in <em>Green, </em>we also find that the phrases should be viewed as synonymous. Therefore, for a defendant to be criminally liable under R.C. 2923.42(A), he would also have to be criminally liable as an aider or abettor to a crime committed by a fellow gang member or members. See <em>Green, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at 704, 278 Cal.Rptr. 140. Accordingly, \u201cpurposely promoted], further[ed], or assisted] any criminal conduct\u201d has been well defined under Ohio law. Consequently, R.C. 2923.42(A) is not void for vagueness due to its inclusion of this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">{\u00b6 18} We hold that defendant has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that R.C. 2923.42(A) is void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Criminalizes Membership in an Organization</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">{\u00b6 19} Defendant next argues that R.C. 2923.42(A) is unconstitutional because it criminalizes membership in an organization. However, before an individual can be charged with and convicted of criminal gang activity, the statute requires an express showing that (1) the individual actively participates in a criminal gang, with knowledge of the criminal gang; (2) the individual engages in or has engaged in the pattern of criminal gang activity; and (3) the individual purposely promotes, furthers, or assists any criminal conduct. <em>Williams </em>at \u00b6 17. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>As such, the state may not prosecute an individual unless he has the specific intent or purpose to further the gang\u2019s criminal actions. Id. Therefore, R.C. 2923.42(A) does not unconstitutionally criminalize membership in an organization because \u201cthe statute does not impermissibly establish guilt by association alone[.]\u201d Id., citing <em>Helton, </em>624 N.E.2d at 508-509. Moreover, the right to association, as guaranteed by the United States and Ohio Constitutions, does not provide protection to those organizations that commit a felony. See <em>United States v. Choate </em>(C.A.9, 1978), 576 F.2d 165, 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">{\u00b6 20} Defendant has failed to demonstrate that R.C. 2923.42(A) is unconstitutional on the basis that it criminalizes membership in an organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Inflicts Cruel and Unusual Harm</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">{\u00b6 21} Finally, defendant argues that R.C. 2923.42(A) is unconstitutional because it inflicts cruel and unusual harm. In particular, defendant claims that an individual\u2019s mere membership in the organization would subject him to prosecution, thereby inflicting cruel and unusual punishment. However, we have already determined that R.C. 2923.42(A) does not criminalize mere membership in an organization. Consequently, R.C. 2923.42(A) does not inflict cruel and unusual punishment because the state could not prosecute an individual for merely being a member in an organization. Accordingly, we find that R.C. 2923.42(A) cannot be deemed unconstitutional on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">{\u00b6 22} As defendant has failed to satisfy his burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of R.C. 2923.42(A) beyond a reasonable doubt, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss both counts of criminal gang activity. Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">{\u00b6 23} Defendant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b43-11\">Carr and Whitmore, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-8\">.
