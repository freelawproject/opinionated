For the reasons below, the trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions that the trial court conduct an in-camera inspection of the documents requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-15\">{\u00b6 2} Plaintiffs-appellees Kevin L. Trangle, M.D., and Betty Trangle (\u201cthe Trangles\u201d) filed this medical malpractice action against Cesar Rojas, M.D. (\u201cRojas\u201d), Kim, Collis &amp; Associates, Inc. (\u201cKCA\u201d), and Lutheran Hospital. In their complaint, the Trangles allege that Dr. Rojas negligently performed a cervical paraspinal nerve block on Kevin Trangle that left him paralyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>{\u00b6 3} On July 10, 2001, the Trangles propounded a second set of interrogatories and request for production of documents to Lutheran seeking information on a potential negligent credentialing claim because they learned that Rojas had been convicted of drug trafficking in March 2001. Lutheran objected to these requests, stating that they were vague, overbroad, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Lutheran also objected, asserting the \u201cpeer review\u201d privilege. Among the requests for production were the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c3. Copies of any and all communications received by Lutheran Hospital or its predecessors, from other healthcare institutions, universities, colleges, licensing boards, individuals or other entities regarding the Defendant, Cesar Rojas, M.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c4. Copies of any administrative files or personnel files maintained by Lutheran Hospital with respect to the Defendant, Cesar Rojas, M.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c5. Copies of any and all releases of information provided by the Defendant, Cesar Rojas, M.D. to Lutheran Hospital authorizing Lutheran Hospital to obtain documents regarding his education, training, or other matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 7} Among the interrogatories were the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c2. Please identify the name or names of individuals who participated in the appointment process of Defendant Cesar Rojas, M.D. to the medical staff of Lutheran Hospital.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c6. Describe, in detail, any type of investigation or inquiry performed by Lutheran Hospital to obtain verification of Defendant, Cesar Rojas, M.D.\u2019s education, medical training, and continuing education and identify the names of those individuals who performed or participated in this investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c10. Identify the name, address and position with Lutheran Hospital those individuals who participated in the investigation and review process of Cesar Rojas M.D.\u2019s application for staff privileges at Lutheran Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c11. State the name .of any committee or committees who were responsible for conducting investigation and review of Cesar Rojas, M.D.\u2019s application for staff privileges at Lutheran Hospital and any subsequent renewal applications for staff privileges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-13\">{\u00b6 12} \u201ca. State the dates on which the above-named committee(s) met with regard to reviewing Cesar Rojas, M.D.\u2019s application and/or renewal for staff privileges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">{\u00b6 13} The Trangles obtained leave of court to amend their complaint to add a claim for negligent credentialing against Lutheran. On September 18, 2001, they filed an amended complaint asserting that Lutheran \u201cwas negligent in faffing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>to exercise due care in the selection of Defendant, Cesar Rojas, M.D. and in granting him medical privileges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 14} On December 3, 2001, the Trangles moved to compel Lutheran to \u201cprovide sufficient and complete responses\u201d to their second set of discovery-requests. Lutheran opposed the motion, arguing that the information sought was protected by the peer review privilege and thus nondiscoverable. The Trangles argued in response that the peer review privilege attaches only to documents, testimony, and opinions \u201cproduced or created\u201d by a credentialing committee. On March 21, 2002, without conducting a hearing or an in-camera inspection, the trial court issued the following order:</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel filed 12/03/2001 is granted in its entirety. Defendant Lutheran Hospital is hereby ordered to provide complete responses to plaintiffs\u2019 Second Set of Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents within thirty days of the date of journalization of this order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 16} Lutheran appeals, advancing the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in ordering Lutheran Hospital \u2018to provide complete responses to plaintiffs Second Set of Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents\u2019 because the documents and responses sought are protected from discovery by Ohio\u2019s Peer Review Statutes, R.C. 2305.24 through 2305.251, and, further, the discovery requests are irrelevant and otherwise objectionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">{\u00b6 18} As a preliminary matter, although Rojas and KCA have filed an appellate brief, they do not have standing to assert their interests in this appeal. The discovery at issue was not propounded to them but rather to Lutheran. Moreover, neither Rojas nor KCA is entitled to assert the peer review privilege claimed by Lutheran because, pursuant to R.C. 2305.24, Lutheran\u2019s quality assurance committee is the holder of the peer review privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\"> {\u00b6 19} An appellate court reviews any claimed error relating to a discovery matter under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Lightbody v. Rust </em>(2000), 137 Ohio App.3d 658, 663, 739 N.E.2d 840. An abuse of discretion means more than an error of law or an error of judgment. It implies an attitude on the part of the trial court that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">{\u00b6 20} The confidentiality of information furnished to quality assurance and utilization review committees of health care facilities is governed by statute. R.C. 2305.24 provides that \u201c[a]ny information, data reports, or records made available to a quality assurance committee or utilization committee of a hospital * * * shall be confidential.\u201d Further, R.C. 2305.251 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>{\u00b6 21} \u201cProceedings and records of all review committees described in section 2305.25 of the Revised Code shall be held in confidence and shall not be subject to discovery or introduction in evidence in any civil action against a health care professional, a hospital, * * * arising out of matters that are the subject of evaluation and review by the review committee. No person in attendance at a meeting of a review committee or serving as a member of a review committee shall be permitted or required to testify in any civil action as to any evidence or other matters produced or presented during the proceedings of the committee or as to any finding, recommendation, evaluation, opinion, or other action of the committee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 22} The privilege granted by R.C. 2305.24, 2305.25, and 2305.251 is not absolute. R.C. 2305.251 provides the following exception to this privilege of confidentiality:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cInformation, documents, or records otherwise available from original sources are not to be construed as being unavailable for discovery or for use in any civil action merely because they were presented during proceedings of a committee nor should any person testifying before a committee or who is a member of the committee be prevented from testifying as to matters within the person\u2019s knowledge, but the witness cannot be asked about the witness\u2019 testimony before the committee or opinion formed by the witness as a result of a committee hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 24} Lutheran argues that the peer review privilege is not limited to materials \u201cproduced or created\u201d by a credentialing committee but rather extends to information and documents submitted to the peer review committee from outside sources. The Trangles argue that all information and documents that are presented to a hospital\u2019s credentialing committee that come from outside sources are discoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Kalb v. Morehead </em>(May 19, 1998), 4th Dist No. 97 CA 2499, 1998 WL 254028, the court applied the plain language of the statute and concluded that the privilege does not extend to records or information otherwise available from original sources. The <em>Kalb </em>court concluded that if a defendant\u2019s personnel file contained records generated and available from other original sources, they would be discoverable. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">{\u00b6 26} The Ohio Supreme Court has stated: \u201cThe purposes of R.C. 2305.25 are clear. The statute extends limited protection to those who provide information to certain review boards and committees to encourage the free flow of information without threat of reprisal in the form of civil liability. See <em>Jacobs v. Frank </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 111, 113, 573 N.E.2d 609, 612. The statute also seeks to protect those serving on committees and committee employees for the obvious reason that it could be difficult to staff a committee absent such protections.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><em>Browning v. Burt </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 544, 562, 613 N.E.2d 993. However, the court further explained that \u201cR.C. 2305.25 does not provide blanket immunity to a hospital for negligence in granting and/or continuing staff privileges of an incompetent physician.\u201d Id. at 562, 613 N.E.2d 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">{\u00b6 27} In <em>Wilson v. Barnesville Hosp., </em>7th Dist. No. 01 BA 40, 2002-Ohio-5186, 2002 WL 31163394, the court explained that to provide a blanket privilege to all documents contained in a credentialing file would frustrate the purpose behind the peer review statute. The court reasoned at \u00b6 23-26:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cIn <em>McCarthy v. Western Reserve Care System </em>(June 11, 1999), 7th Dist. No. 97 C.A. 76 [1999 WL 420578], this Court explained, \u2018The purpose of peer review and quality assurance is to allow independent third parties to review both the individual and team performance of health care providers in an effort to improve the overall quality of health care.\u2019 Id. at 4. However, if all materials viewed and utilized by peer review committees were deemed undiscoverable, a hospital could never be held accountable for its choice in staffing by truly independent third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThis is precisely why courts continue to recognize the tort of negligent credentialing; so that hospitals may be held accountable by third parties for the breach of their duty to hire only competent physicians. In <em>Albain v. Flower Hospital </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 251, 553 N.E.2d 1038, paragraph two of the syllabus, the court discussed the claim of negligent credentialing as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c \u2018[A] hospital has a direct duty to grant and to continue such privileges only to competent physicians. A hospital is not an insurer of the skills of private physicians to whom staff privileges have been granted. In order to recover for a breach of this duty, a plaintiff injured by the negligence of a staff physician must demonstrate that but for the lack of care in the selection or retention of the physician, the physician would not have been granted staff privileges, and the plaintiff would not have been injured.\u2019 Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cIn order to meet this burden, a party must be able to demonstrate what information was gathered by a hospital with respect to the selection or retention of a physician. If we were to give R.C. 2305.251 the narrow reading suggested by the Hospital, parties could no longer meaningfully challenge the hiring choices made by their health care providers. Because there appears to be no other reasonable alternative means for discovering the basis of a peer review committee\u2019s decision to credential a physician, hospitals would be left to self-police their own actions if these materials were undiscoverable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">{\u00b6 32} Having determined that R.C. 2305.251 does not provide an absolute privilege, we must now determine what items are protected by the statute and what items should be produced. In <em>Gates v. Brewer </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 347, 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>OBR 392, 442 N.E.2d 72, the court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to quash a subpoena duces tecum that requested all records concerning the physician\u2019s performance and ordered an in-camera inspection. In its decision, the <em>Gates </em>court found that the following records were protected from discovery by R.C. 2305.251:</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(1) Any records or transcript of proceedings of a review committee defined in R.C. 2305.25 which considered the conduct of the defendant; (2) any evidence produced or presented at such proceedings unless said evidence (information, documents or records) became available to the subpoenaed witness (in this case, Mr. Turner) in any other capacity besides as a member of said committee; (3) any finding, recommendation, evaluation, opinion, or other action of said committee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 34} Thus, any documents generated by the hospital for peer review purposes are privileged under the statute. As previously stated, any documents available from their original sources are discoverable from a hospital, in this case, Lutheran Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">{\u00b6 35} The trial court in this case ordered Lutheran to provide complete responses to all of the Trangles\u2019 interrogatories and request for production of documents without regard to privileged materials. When a trial court is presented with a situation in which a party attempts to prevent the introduction of certain evidence by asserting the privilege defined in R.C. 2305.251, it is incumbent upon the trial court to hold an in-camera inspection of the information, documents, or records in question to determine the admissibility of the evidence in relation to R.C. 2305.251. <em>Gates v. Brewer, </em>2 Ohio App.3d at 349, 2 OBR 392, 442 N.E.2d 72. The trial court should have conducted an in-camera inspection to determine which information, documents, or records were discoverable and which were privileged. Failure to conduct such an in-camera inspection constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 36} Lutheran also argues that the names of credentialing committee members are privileged under the statute. In interrogatories 2, 6,10, and 11, the Trangles seek the identity of individuals who participated in the process of appointing Rojas or who investigated his qualifications and applications for staff privileges. R.C. 2305.251 expressly states that members of a review committee cannot be called to testify. R.C. 2305.251 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cNo person in attendance at a meeting of a review committee or serving as a member of a review committee shall be permitted or required to testify in any civil action as to any evidence or other matters produced or presented during the proceedings of the committee or as to any finding, recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>mendation, evaluation, opinion, or other action of the committee or a member thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">{\u00b6 38} Therefore, because members of the review committees may not testify as to matters produced or presented during review committee proceedings, the identities of these individuals cannot lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Therefore, the Trangles\u2019 motion to compel such information should have been denied. If the Trangles seek to depose any individuals who happen to be on the review committee for some other purpose, those individuals are not prohibited from testifying as to those other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 39} Finally, Lutheran argues that all discovery related to the hospital\u2019s credentialing committee is objectionable as irrelevant because the Trangles have failed to establish any basis for their claim of negligent credentialing. Civ.R. 26(B)(1) provides that \u201c[p]arties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.\u201d The scope of relevancy in discovery matters is within the broad discretion of the trial court. <em>Baynard v. Oakwood Village </em>(Oct. 16, 1997), Cuyahoga App. 71711, 1997 WL 638807. By arguing that none of the Trangles\u2019 discovery requests is relevant because the Trangles have failed to establish any basis for their negligent credentialing claim, Lutheran is in a sense arguing the merits of its case. Such an argument is more properly suited for a dispositive motion filed with the trial court. Moreover, the Trangles may be able to produce evidence substantiating their negligent credentialing claim after discovery has been completed. Therefore, this argument is premature and not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 40} Nonetheless, the trial court erred in ordering \u201ccomplete\u201d responses to the second set of interrogatories and request for production of documents without first conducting an in-eamera inspection to determine the privileged matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 41} The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for an in-camera inspection of the requested documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b587-8\">Patricia Ann Blackmon, P.
