Paul Corcoran was his direct supervisor. Corcoran and Strausbaugh had worked together since 1991, and enjoyed what both described as a good working relationship originally. The relationship soured in July and August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>when, according to the complaint, the supervisor began to swear at Strausbaugh on a regular basis, call him derisive names, and direct sexually suggestive gestures toward him. Strausbaugh averred that Corcoran blew kisses at him and touched him in an offensive manner by patting him on the buttocks, and by pulling his head toward Corcoran\u2019s crotch to simulate a sexual act. Strausbaugh alleged that he found the conduct to be abusive and offensive, and that Corcoran continued the pattern in spite of repeated requests for him to refrain. As the result of Corcoran\u2019s actions, which Strausbaugh alleged were done maliciously, in bad faith, and/or wantonly and recklessly, Strausbaugh claimed that he was entitled to damages for severe emotional distress, mental anguish, humiliation, embarrassment, and loss of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b6 3} ODOT answered the complaint, admitting the nature of the employment relationship but denying all other material allegations and setting forth affirmative defenses. As part of the pretrial proceedings, the Court of Claims held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Corcoran\u2019s alleged \u201cconduct was manifestly outside the scope of his employment or official responsibilities,\u201d or if he \u201cacted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\u201d R.C. 2743.02(F).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court decided:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cBased upon the totality of the evidence presented at the hearing, the court finds that Paul Corcoran acted within the scope of his employment with defendant at all times and during all interactions regarding plaintiff that are at issue in this case. The court further finds that Paul Corcoran did not act with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner toward plaintiff. Consequently, Paul Corcoran is entitled to personal immunity pursuant to R.C. 9.86 and the courts of common pleas do not have jurisdiction over civil actions against him based upon his alleged actions and inactions in this case.\u201d (June 14, 2000 Decision, at 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court entered judgment reflecting its preliminary decision, and made the express determination, pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B), that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay.\u201d (June 14, 2000 Judgment Entry.) Strausbaugh did not appeal from the personal immunity judgment. After the court denied a motion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ODOT for summary judgment, it bifurcated the trial into the issues of liability and damages, and proceeded accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 6} The parties stipulated to the admission of the immunity hearing transcript and exhibits for the trial on liability. That transcript indicated that the workplace environment could be described as being \u201cvulgar,\u201d or, as the trial court noted, \u201c \u2018rough,\u2019 at best.\u201d After the joint exhibit was admitted, Strausbaugh rested, relying on the transcript and other evidence that he submitted with his memorandum opposing ODOT\u2019s motion for summary judgment. ODOT called four witnesses, including Strausbaugh as on cross-examination, Corcoran, and two department supervisors, then rested its defense. There was no rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court rendered a decision that found that Strausbaugh and Corcoran had engaged in \u201cverbal altercations where obscene language was used.\u201d It found that the situation changed from a joking fashion to one tinged with anger. It also concluded that Corcoran blew kisses to Strausbaugh and, on two occasions, patted him on the buttocks. Nonetheless, the court determined that Corcoran\u2019s conduct was commonplace harassment rather than sexual harassment and that it did not amount to intentional infliction of emotion distress. (Nov. 21, 2001 Decision, at 8.) The court also found for ODOT on the negligent supervision claim. Without mentioning the public policy tort claim, the court concluded, \u201cPlaintiff has failed to satisfy his burden of proof on any of the claims alleged in his complaint.\u201d (Nov. 21, 2001 Decision, at 8.) The court journalized a judgment in favor of ODOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 8} Strausbaugh presents two assignments of error for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cASSIGNMENT OF ERROR 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting judgment to appellee on appellant\u2019s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cASSIGNMENT OF ERROR 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred in failing to render judgment for appellant on his claim for public policy tort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">{\u00b6 13} Strausbaugh argues in support of his first assignment of error that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard in granting judgment to ODOT on his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. He contends that the court erred when it considered his own conduct toward others as a factor in deciding the claim. He also asserts that the court incorrectly applied the concept of \u201ccommunity\u201d as incorporating the context of his specific working environment. Finally, Strausbaugh suggests that the court\u2019s finding of no- liability was the product of its either having imposed nonexistent comparative harassment or assumption of the risk standards, or having applied an unrecognized defense that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Corcoran\u2019s conduct was welcomed or otherwise condoned by Strausbaugh. These arguments present us with questions of law, which we review on a de novo basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 14} During oral argument of this appeal, ODOT suggested for the first time that Strausbaugh was precluded by his failure to appeal the immunity decision from relitigating issues that relate to his supervisor\u2019s intent and conduct. We disagree for two reasons. First, the record clearly reveals that ODOT did not offer the preclusion argument at the trial level, either in its motion for summary judgment or at trial. The Court of Claims found that genuine issues of fact remained to be litigated as to all elements of Strausbaugh\u2019s claims and overruled ODOT\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Furthermore, ODOT stipulated to the admission of the immunity hearing transcript as evidence for the purpose of the trial on the issue of liability. ODOT, thus, acquiesced in the court\u2019s consideration of the same testimony and exhibits in deciding the claims on the merits. We are mindful of language from this court\u2019s decision in <em>Gudin v. W. Res. Psychiatric Hosp. </em>(June 14, 2001), Franklin App. No. 00AP-912, 2001 WL 664389, that arguably supports ODOT\u2019s position that Strausbaugh should have been precluded from reoffering proof as to Corcoran\u2019s intent and conduct; however, we do not view that language to be controlling here where the parties obviously consented to the trial court\u2019s deciding issues related to Corcoran\u2019s conduct based upon resubmitted testimony. Moreover, reviewing courts do not generally consider questions that were not raised at the trial level, <em>State ex rel. Porter v. Cleveland Dept. of Pub. Safety </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 258, 259, 703 N.E.2d 308, citing <em>State ex rel. Quarto Mining Co. v. Foreman </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 78, 81, 679 N.E.2d 706; but, rather, may deem such issues as waived on appeal. <em>Stuller v. Price </em>(Sept. 20, 2001), Franklin App. No. 00AP-1355, 2001 WL 1098028. Thus, ODOT\u2019s suggestion that Strausbaugh should have been precluded from attempting to prove that Corcoran intended to cause serious emotional distress or that his conduct was extreme and outrageous is not an issue that we will consider for the first time here. Second, the standards for determining liability under respondeat superior (i.e., if Corcoran intended to cause Strausbaugh to suffer serious emotional distress or if his conduct was so extreme and outrageous that it exceeded the bounds of decency), differ from the statutory standards for determining immunity (i.e., if he went beyond the scope of his employment by acting maliciously, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless fashion toward Strausbaugh). See <em>Dodge v. United States of Am. </em>(S.D.Ohio 2001), 162 F.Supp.2d 873, 884 (\u201cOhio courts have stated that supervisors may act within the scope of their employment, thus subjecting their employer to respondeat superior liability, when they engage in sexually harassing behavior toward a subordinate employee.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>{\u00b6 15} Intentional infliction of emotional distress was first recognized as a separate claim for relief by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Yeager v. Local Union 20 </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 369, 6 OBR 421, 453 N.E.2d 666, where the court stated, at the syllabus: \u201cOne who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes serious emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for such bodily harm.\u201d To establish his claim, Strausbaugh needed to show (1) that Corcoran either intended to cause serious emotional distress or knew or should have known that his actions would result in serious emotional distress to Strausbaugh; (2) that Corcoran\u2019s conduct was so extreme and outrageous that it went beyond all possible bounds of decency and that it can be considered as utterly intolerable in a civilized community; (3) that Corcoran\u2019s actions were the proximate cause of Strausbaugh\u2019s psychic injury; and (4) that Strausbaugh\u2019s mental anguish was serious and of a nature that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it. <em>Cochran v. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 888, 896, 742 N.E.2d 734, citing <em>Pyle v. Pyle </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 31, 34, 11 OBR 63, 463 N.E.2d 98; and <em>Oglesby v. Columbus, </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-1289, 2002-Ohio-3784, 2002 WL 1726033, at \u00b6 10, quoting <em>Irvine v. Akron Beacon Journal, </em>Summit App. No. 20804, 2002-0hio-3191, 2002 WL 1371184, at \u00b6 48-51. We emphasize that major outrage is essential to the tort, and the mere fact that the actor knows that the other will regard the conduct as insulting, or will have his feelings hurt, is not enough. See <em>Garrison v. Bobbitt </em>(1999), 134 Ohio App.3d 373, 382, 731 N.E.2d 216, quoting <em>Foster v. McDevitt </em>(1986), 31 Ohio App.3d 237, 240, 31 OBR 520, 511 N.E.2d 403. Only conduct that is truly outrageous, intolerable, and beyond the bounds of decency is actionable; persons are expected to be hardened to a considerable degree of inconsiderate, annoying, and insulting behavior. <em>Petrarca v. Phar-Mor, Inc. </em>(2001), Trumbull App. No. 2000-T-0121, 2001 WL 1117015. Insults, foul language, hostile tempers, and even threats must sometimes be tolerated in our rough-and-tumble society. <em>Breitenstein v. Moraine </em>(Nov. 5, 1992), Montgomery App. No. 13375, 1992 WL 317444. See, also, <em>Powell v. Grant Med. Ctr. </em>(2002), 148 Ohio App.3d 1, 6, 771 N.E.2d 874, quoting <em>Paugh v. Hanks </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 72, 78, 6 OBR 114, 451 N.E.2d 759. See, also, <em>Risch v. Friendly\u2019s Ice Cream Corp. </em>(1999), 136 Ohio App.3d 109, 115, 736 N.E.2d 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">{\u00b6 16} Strausbaugh\u2019s argument requires us to address two questions of law: (1) In determining whether a defendant\u2019s conduct is sufficiently extreme and outrageous, may a factfinder consider the context or environment in which the acts occur? (2) If so, may the factfinder also consider the plaintiffs role in creating or participating in that environment? Because we answer both questions in the affirmative, we see no prejudicial error in the Court of Claims\u2019 analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>{\u00b6 17} When it rendered its decision, the trial court recited the requisites of proof set forth in <em>Pyle </em>and restated in <em>Cochran, Oglesby, </em>and <em>Irvine; </em>then it described the standard it used to determine that Strausbaugh did not prove Corcoran\u2019s conduct to be extreme and outrageous. In doing so, the court quoted from <em>Yeager:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c \u2018* * * It has not been enough that the defendant has acted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal, or that he has intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that his conduct has been characterized by \u201cmalice,\u201d or a degree of aggravation which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort. * * * Generally, the case is one in which the recitation of the facts to an average member of the community would arouse his resentment against the actor, and lead him to exclaim, \u201cOutrageous!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c \u2018* * * The liability clearly does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities. * * *\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">{\u00b6 20} Applying this standard to the facts of this case, the court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c* * * [T]he type of language commonly used in the district nine garage is \u2018rough\u2019 at best. Similarly, the conduct of the employees, including plaintiff, was more than occasionally \u2018inconsiderate and unkind.\u2019 It is within this \u2018community\u2019 that the court must judge whether Corcoran\u2019s words and actions were \u2018extreme and outrageous.\u2019 In this particular working environment it cannot be said that plaintiff was forced to endure more than mere insults and indignities. Thus, plaintiff has failed to prove this critical element of his claim for emotional distress.\u201d (Nov. 21, 2001 Decision, at 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">{\u00b622} In a nutshell, Strausbaugh\u2019s argument contends that the trial court misconstrued the meaning of \u201ccommunity\u201d by focusing upon the workplace environment and considering what effect his own conduct had upon creating it. In one sense we agree. The term \u201ccommunity\u201d is broader than the workplace. It is meant to convey a more inclusive cross-section of society. Yet we do not believe the trial court\u2019s consideration of appellant\u2019s conduct constituted error. In determining whether the community would be shocked by certain conduct, it is appropriate to consider its context. What the community deems outrageous at a funeral or church service might be deemed merely an annoyance or an indignity at a social gathering. Strausbaugh would restrict the analysis solely to Corcor-an\u2019s conduct to determine whether it was extreme and outrageous. This approach is both unrealistic and unsupported by the Restatement position that <em>Yeager </em>adopted. As the Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965), Section 46.9(g), recognizes, there are situations where the acts of the plaintiff minimize or remove the element of outrage. One such circumstance is extreme provocation. Id. That is precisely the situation here. Strausbaugh contributed to, if not created, the crude, abusive environment about which he now complains. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>a prime player in using foul language and crude gestures. Several witnesses at the immunity hearing testified that Strausbaugh was the chief architect in creating a crude and vulgar workplace. They testified that he would commonly grab his crotch and make comments such as \u2018Tve got something for you to suck on\u201d; \u201cI got your lunch right here, big boy\u201d; \u201cYou want some of this?\u201d These witnesses also indicated that Strausbaugh commonly used foul language, including the \u201cF\u201d word. In fact, \u201cfuck\u201d was described as being his favorite word. One witness relayed an occasion where his coworkers bet Strausbaugh that he could not go all day without saying it. They were right. These witnesses indicated that Strausbaugh\u2019s offensive conduct was often aimed at Corcoran and that he called his supervisor a \u201cdickhead,\u201d flipped him \u201cthe bird,\u201d and told him \u201cfuck you\u201d in response to orders. A female coworker relayed an incident where Straus-baugh referred to black males as reportedly having \u201cbig ones,\u201d then grabbed his crotch and said he had a \u201cbig one, too.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 23} In terms of the atmosphere in general, one comment is particularly insightful. When asked to describe a situation where employees made sexual references to coworkers who were bent over, one witness stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cWell, there\u2019s so many circumstances of that it\u2019s hard to describe just one, but I\u2019ve done that myself. Someone might be bent over and you walk up and make a comment like, \u2018Hey, while you\u2019re down there, you know, you want to do me a favor <em>* * </em>*,\u2019 and things like that daily.\u201d (Exhibit 1, Tr. at 213-214.) While vulgarity toward an individual is not excusable <em>solely </em>because it is commonplace, as a leading purveyor of vulgarity appellant helped to create the situation about which he now complains. As the Restatement indicates, the acts of the plaintiff may minimize or remove the element of outrage. Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965), Section 46.9(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b6 25} The Court of Claims properly considered both the context in which Corcoran\u2019s conduct occurred and Strausbaugh\u2019s part in creating that environment, in determining whether Corcoran\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. Much as equity demands that a plaintiff must come to the chancellor with clean hands, the law may properly inquire into Strausbaugh\u2019s own conduct in this context. While the Court of Claims may have slightly misconstrued the concept of community, it did not err, considering the context within which the offending conduct occurred. Any error in this regard was harmless. See Civ.R. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 26} Strausbaugh also criticizes the trial court\u2019s reliance upon <em>Yeager, </em>and argues that the decision is based on \u201cthe outdated language of the Restatement.\u201d He urges that \u201cmore recent, better reasoned decisions\u201d by the First District Court of Appeals in <em>Meyers v. Hot Bagels Factory, Inc. </em>(1999), 131 Ohio App.3d 82, 721 N.E.2d 1068, and by the Second District Court of Appeals in <em>Garrison </em>require a conclusion that Corcoran\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. Yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>both of those courts cited <em>Yeager </em>with approval and used a contextual analysis in their review.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">{\u00b6 27} <em>Meyers, </em>which involved a customer who was verbally attacked by a store owner, recognized that conduct must be viewed in context to determine whether it is culpable conduct, because \u201c \u2018[t]here are situations naturally fraught with antagonism and emotion where a person must be expected to endure the resultant antagonism and mental anguish.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meyers, </em>131 Ohio App.3d at 94, 721 N.E.2d 1068, quoting <em>Stepien v. Franklin </em>(1988), 39 Ohio App.3d 47, 51, 528 N.E.2d 1324. See, also, <em>Local Lodge 1297 v. Allen </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 228, 490 N.E.2d 865. <em>Meyers </em>noted that Ohio has adopted Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965), Section 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 28} <em>Garrison </em>arose in a public employment context, as did this case. In reviewing a denial of summary judgment and immunity, the court commented that \u201c[t]he resolution of these kinds of cases is fact-intensive and often depends on distinctions between conduct that seems outrageous and conduct that is undesirable, but not quite offensive enough to be called outrageous.\u201d <em>Garrison </em>at 379, 731 N.E.2d 216. Its \u201cfact intensive\u201d analysis led the court to conclude that those issues should be resolved by the ultimate trier of the facts, the jury in that case. But, more importantly, the court considered Garrison\u2019s own conduct, observing that he had been a competent employee with few discipline problems who had shown no evidence of aggression in five years of service. The court concluded: \u201cCompared to acts found \u2018outrageous\u2019 in other cases, the defendants\u2019 acts * * * would be outrageous <em>if Garrison did nothing to warrant such treatment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 134 Ohio App.3d at 381, 731 N.E.2d 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 29} A comparison of the decision by the Court of Claims with the decisions in <em>Meyers </em>and <em>Garrison </em>leads us to conclude that each of these courts undertook a similar analysis. The Court of Claims correctly applied controlling legal principles to the evidence before it and simply came to a different result than <em>Meyers </em>and <em>Garrison </em>based upon the facts. The court borrowed certain phrases like \u201crough,\u201d \u201cinconsiderate and unkind,\u201d and \u201ccommunity\u201d from <em>Yeager </em>in its effort to articulate the basis of its conclusion, but it did not create a new legal standard. We do not view the trial court\u2019s choice of words or its explanation as reflecting that it applied any new or inappropriate standard. The trial court\u2019s analysis does not manifest a prejudicial misapplication of the law. Strausbaugh\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">{\u00b6 30} We look now to the second assignment of error, which involves Strausbaugh\u2019s public policy tort claim. The trial court decision does not expressly address that claim or state reasons for its ruling that appellant failed to prove it. The parties concurred during oral argument, however, that the Court of Claims did issue a final judgment denying liability on that theory. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>reviewing the court\u2019s decision, we agree because it expressly states that \u201cplaintiff has failed to satisfy his burden of proof on any of the claims alleged in his complaint.\u201d Thus, we have jurisdiction to review this appeal as the Court of Claims\u2019 decision and judgment are final and appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 31} Strausbaugh argues that proof offered at trial established a compensable claim and that the court\u2019s judgment was contrary to the weight of the evidence. During oral argument, ODOT raised issue preclusion as a basis for overruling the second assignment of error. For the reasons we fully explained in rejecting the preclusion argument in deciding the first assignment of error, we reject it here also. ODOT additionally argues that, because the evidence at trial showed Strausbaugh to be a union member whose employment is subject to a collective bargaining agreement, he was not an at-will employee and cannot recover on a public policy tort theory. In one sense we agree with appellee; however, we again reject the state\u2019s contention that the mere existence of a collective bargaining agreement preempts a common-law tort remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 32} In <em>Gudin, </em>we addressed whether the existence of a collective bargaining agreement preempts the claims of workers subject to the agreement. We followed the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc. </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 399, 108 S.Ct. 1877, 100 L.Ed.2d 410, where the court analyzed similar federal preemption issues. We concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c* * * [S]tate-law claims are preempted in two situations: (1) if the state claim is founded on rights created by collective bargaining agreements; or (2) if the rights are created by state law but the application of the law is dependent on an analysis or interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement. * * *\u201d <em>Gudin </em>at 9, citing <em>Sinea v. Denman Tire Corp. </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 44, 62, 732 N.E.2d 1033; and <em>Street v. Gerstenslager Co. </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 156, 160, 658 N.E.2d 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">{\u00b6 34} We noted, however, that \u201c \u2018 \u201cnot every dispute * * * tangentially involving a provision of a collective-bargaining agreement, is pre-empted.\u2019\u201d\u201d <em>Gudin, </em>at 8, quoting <em>Lingle, </em>at 413, 108 S.Ct. 1877, 100 L.Ed.2d 410, fn. 12. While \u201cclaims predicated on allegedly wrongful acts directly related to the terms and conditions of a plaintiffs employment are generally preempted by the collective bargaining agreement,\u201d if a \u201cclaim is premised upon personally abusive conduct by the employer and its supervisors (or conduct that is not arguably sanctioned by the labor contract), the * * * claim is not preempted. See, e.g., <em>Lightning v. Roadway Express, Inc. </em>(C.A.11, 1995), 60 F.3d 1551, 1556-1557 (employee\u2019s IIED claim based upon verbal abuse by supervisors and co-workers not preempted).\u201d Id. at 10-11. Here, Strausbaugh\u2019s public policy tort claim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>premised entirely on the allegedly abusive conduct of his supervisor. Therefore, the claim is not preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">{\u00b6 35} But <em>Gudin </em>involved an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, <em>not </em>one for discharge in violation of public policy under <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs., Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981, and its progeny. Greeley\u2019s claims are limited to employee-at-will situations that involve discharge or disciplinary action. Here, Strausbaugh neither pled nor proved that he was an employee at will or that he received any form of discipline or was discharged. In <em>Greeley </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus, the court held that \u201c[pjublic policy warrants an exception to the <em>employment-at-will doctrine </em>when an employee is <em>discharged or disciplined </em>for a reason which is prohibited by statute.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>Painter v. Graley </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 377, 639 N.E.2d 51, at paragraph three of the syllabus, the court extended the foundation supporting viable claims for relief beyond statutory pronouncements to include clear expressions of policy evident from other sources, such as constitutions, administrative rules, and the common law. The court later held, in <em>Collins v. Rizkana </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 65, 652 N.E.2d 653, syllabus, that \u201ca cause of action may be brought for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy based on sexual harassmenVdiscrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">{\u00b6 36} But to establish a claim for tortious violation of public policy, Straus-baugh had to plead and prove that he was an employee at will. See <em>Stephenson v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. </em>(Oct. 26,1999), Franklin App. No. 99AP-77, 1999 WL 969817, citing <em>Haynes v. Zoological Soc. of Cincinnati </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 254, 652 N.E.2d 948, syllabus. He failed to do so. The evidence indicates that he was subject to a collective bargaining agreement between his union and ODOT. Thus, he is not an at-will employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 37} Moreover, Strausbaugh did not allege or prove that he was discharged or otherwise disciplined in violation of public policy. In fact, the record is devoid of any evidence to this effect. Instead, the essence of his claim was that he was mistreated or harassed in violation of public policy. \u201cNeither Greeley nor its progeny have recognized a tort for harassment in violation of public policy.\u201d <em>Bell v. Cuyahoga Community College </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 461, 465, 717 N.E.2d 1189. In <em>Hillman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(N.D.Ohio 2002), 190 F.Supp.2d 1029, the plaintiffs inability to prove that he was either actually or constructively discharged defeated his claim for wrongful discharge as the result of alleged age discrimination. As observed by the court in <em>Evans v. Toys R Us-Ohio, Inc. </em>(S.D.Ohio 1999), 32 F.Supp.2d 974, \u201cA review of relevant case law shows that the public policy tort has not been extended to claims for failure to promote or retaliation.\u201d Id. at 990, citing <em>Bell. </em>In <em>Bools v. Gen. Elec. Co. </em>(S.D.Ohio 1999), 70 F.Supp.2d 829, 832, the court stated: \u201cOur research indicates that Ohio appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>courts seem hesitant about expanding the exception [to] the doctrine of employment-at-will beyond claims for wrongful termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c[I]n Ohio, the Supreme Court or the General Assembly creates new causes of action.\u201d <em>Silverman v. Am. Income Life Ins. Co. of Indianapolis, Inc. </em>(Dec. 18, 2001), Franklin App. No. 01AP-338, 2001 WL 1607635. This court is not inclined to create or recognize a cause of action for harassment in violation of public policy based upon these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 39} The trial court did not err by entering judgment in favor of ODOT on Strausbaugh\u2019s public policy tort claim. Because Strausbaugh failed to prove he was an at-will employee or that he was discharged or disciplined in violation of public policy, the judgment was not contrary to the weight of the evidence. Strausbaugh\u2019s second assignment of is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 40} Having overruled appellant\u2019s assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Ohio Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b480-9\">Lazarus and Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b480-10\">William H. Harsha III, J., of the Fourth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-18\">. This appeal concerns only the claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and tortious violation of public policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\">. \u201cIf the Court of Claims determines that the employee was acting within the scope of employment, in furtherance of the interests of the state, the state has agreed to accept responsibility for the employee\u2019s acts. R.C. 9.86 and 2743.02(A). In that event, only the state is subject to suit, and the litigation must be pursued in the Court of Claims. If the Court of Claims determines that the employee\u2019s acts did not further the interests of the state, i.e., the employee was acting outside the scope of his employment, maliciously, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner, the state has not agreed to accept responsibility for the employee\u2019s acts and the employee is personally answerable for his acts in a court of common pleas.\u201d <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Shearer </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 284, 287, 595 N.E.2d 862.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
