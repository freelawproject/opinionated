The purported amendment, which was approved by more than 75 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>percent of the owners of units in the condominium, added the following restriction: \u201cEach unit conveyed after May 1, 1998 shall be for the purpose of owner occupancy.\u201d The association contends that the trial court erred by granting the motion of plaintiffs-appellees Jeffrey and Dolores Horne for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">{\u00b6 2} Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the trial court correctly rendered summary judgment in favor of the Hornes. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 3} The declaration of the Northland Condominium Owners Association, recorded November 15, 1991, contains the following provision, at Section 1, Article XVIII, pertaining to the power to amend the declaration:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cExcept as hereinafter provided, amendment of this Declaration or the other Condominium organizational documents shall require the consent of Unit Owners exercising not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of Unit Owners. Notwithstanding the foregoing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cA. The consent of all Unit Owners shall be required for any amendment effecting a change in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c1. The boundaries of any Unit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c2. The undivided interest in the Common Areas appertaining to a Unit or the liability for common expenses appertaining thereto:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c3. The number of votes in the Association appertaining to any Unit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-13\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c4. The fundamental purposes to which any Unit or the Common Areas are restricted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">{\u00b6 10} Section 2 of the same article provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-15\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cAn amendment to this Declaration, or the Drawings or the By-Laws, adopted with the consents hereinbefore provided, in a writing executed with the same formalities as this Declaration by two officers of the Association and containing a certification that the amendment was duly adopted in accordance with the foregoing provisions, shall be effective upon the filing of the same with the Auditor and Recorder of Clark County, Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-16\">{\u00b6 12} In 1998, it was proposed to amend the Declaration to add the following restriction to Subsection 0, Section 2, Article III (restrictions):</p>\n<p id=\"b261-17\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cEach unit conveyed after May 1, 1998 shall be for the purpose of owner occupancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>{\u00b6 14} This amendment was evidently approved by over 75 percent of the voting power of the association, but the Hornes returned a ballot expressing their disapproval of the amendment. Notwithstanding the disapproval of the Hornes, the association caused the amendment to be filed with the Clark County Auditor and Clark County Recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">{\u00b6 15} The Hornes brought this action to declare the amendment invalid and to enjoin its enforcement. The Hornes filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion and rendered summary judgment in favor of the Hornes. From that judgment, the association appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 16} The Northland Condominium Owners Association asserts the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe court erred by interpreting the amendment just the opposite of what it said.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe court erred in finding that the result of the election was unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that the plaintiffis] had no notice of such prohibition at the time of purchase and that a unanimous vote of the owners was required to pass.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">{\u00b6 21} The essence of all these assignments of error is that the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment in favor of the Hornes.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">{\u00b6 22} In support of their motion for summary judgment, the Hornes submitted an affidavit in which they averred that copies of the provision in the declaration of condominium providing for amendments, and of the ballot signed and returned by them expressing disapproval of the amendment proposed by the association, were true and accurate copies. The association did not rebut this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">{\u00b6 28} Clearly, the proposed amendment purports to change the fundamental purposes to which any unit is restricted, by providing that each unit must be occupied by its owner. Thus, according to the clear terms of Article XVIII, the consent of all unit owners was required. Equally clearly the Hornes, owners of a unit, did not consent. Therefore, as a matter of law, the amendment never became effective, and the Hornes are entitled to the relief they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">{\u00b6 24} We agree with the Hornes that the association\u2019s first three assignments of error are immaterial. Regardless of whether the trial court, in its decision, misstated the proposed amendment, regardless of whether the Hornes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>had notice of the proposed prohibition at the time they purchased their unit, and certainly regardless of whether the result of the election is deemed \u201cunreasonable,\u201d the consent of all unit owners to an amendment of this kind, required by the declaration itself, is lacking. Accordingly, the amendment never became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 25} All of defendant-appellant Northland Condominium Owners Association\u2019s assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 26} All of defendant-appellant Northland Condominium Owners Association\u2019s assignments of error having been overruled, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b263-9\">Wolff, P.J., and Frederick N. Young, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
