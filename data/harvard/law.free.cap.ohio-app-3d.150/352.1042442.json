(\u201cCMB\u201d). OHIC argues that the trial court erred in holding that the policy provided defendants-appellees, Sherri Watkins and her son, Sean, with up to one million dollars in coverage <em>each </em>for their loss-of-consortium claims arising from the medical malpractice claim of Sherri\u2019s husband and Sean\u2019s father, defendant-appellee, John M. Watkins. In case number CA2002-03-064, defendants-appellants, John, Sherri, and Sean Watkins, appeal from that same judgment, arguing that the trial court erred in declaring that the policy does not provide new limits of coverage for any wrongful death action brought by Sherri and Sean if John dies as a result of his injuries during a yearly policy period subsequent to the one in which he made his medical malpractice claim. These appeals have been consolidated for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In June 1999, John M. Watkins suffered a massive stroke. In June 2000, Mr. Watkins brought a medical malpractice action against Dr. Thomson and CMB. Mr. Watkins\u2019s wife, Sherri, and their son, Sean, brought loss-of-consortium claims against Dr. Thomson and CMB. At the time of Mr. Watkins\u2019s stroke, Thomson and CMB were covered by a professional liability insurance policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>issued by OHIC, which had coverage limits of one million dollars for each person, with a total liability limit of three million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">{\u00b6 3} In November 2001, Dr. Thomson and CMB filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, asking the trial court to declare the rights and responsibilities of the parties with respect to the policy. OHIC, Mr. Watkins, and his wife and son were all named as defendants in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">{\u00b6 4} On February 12, 2002, the trial court issued a judgment declaring that the policy\u2019s \u201cEach Person Limit\u201d provision, which limited coverage to one million dollars for all claims arising out of Dr. Thomson\u2019s alleged malpractice, was unenforceable pursuant to <em>Schaefer v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 553, 668 N.E.2d 913. The trial court held that R.C. 3937.44, which expressly allows insurance policies to treat all claims arising from bodily injury to one person as a single claim, applied only to motor vehicle policies and not to professional liability policies. Specifically, the trial court found that professional liability insurance policies do not fall within the ambit of R.C. 3937.44 because they do not provide coverage for injuries caused by an <em>accident. </em>The trial court also found that if Mr. Watkins dies from his injuries after the expiration of the policy year in which he brought his malpractice claim and his wife and son brought their loss of consortium claims, the policy does not provide new limits of coverage for any wrongful death action brought by Sherri and Sean Watkins in that subsequent policy year.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">{\u00b6 5} OHIC and the Watkinses have filed separate appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">{\u00b6 6} OHIC\u2019s sole assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred in its judgment that: (A) R.C. 3937.44 does not apply to medical malpractice liability policies; (B) professional liability policies are not included in the statutory phrase \u2018any liability policy\u2019; (C) injury caused by negligence including medical negligence is not an \u2018accident\u2019; and (D) the \u2018each person limit\u2019 in OHIC\u2019s (post-S.B.20) policy is unenforceable with respect to this (post S.B. 20) claim under <em>Schaefer v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 76 Ohio St.3d 553, 668 N.E.2d 913.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">{\u00b6 8} OHIC essentially argues that the trial court erred by declaring the policy\u2019s \u201cEach Person Limit\u201d on coverage unenforceable pursuant to <em>Schaefer, </em>and by finding R.C. 3937.44 inapplicable to professional liability insurance policies because losses sustained by occurrences like medical malpractice are not \u201caccidents\u201d covered by that statute. We agree with these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">{\u00b6 9} The policy at issue obligates OHIC to pay claims involving an allegation of injury or death to a person, for which Dr. Thomson and CMB become legally obligated to pay because of professional services they provided or failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>provide to that person. As stated in its \u201ccoverage summary,\u201d the policy is subject to coverage limits of one million dollars for \u201cEach Person,\u201d up to a total limit of three million dollars. The policy\u2019s coverage limits are further defined in Section IV of the policy, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cSECTION IV \u2014 LIMITS OF COVERAGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cA. Two limits apply to the amount we will pay for \u2018claims\u2019. These limits are shown on the coverage summary and apply as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c1. The Each Person Limit is the most we will pay for all \u2018claims\u2019 arising out of \u2018professional services\u2019 provided or which should have been provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201ca. to any person; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">{1114} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cAny derivative \u2018claims\u2019 share in the Each Person Limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c2. The total liability limit is the most we will pay for all \u2018claims\u2019 covered by this policy. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">{\u00b6 17} A \u201cderivative claim\u201d or action is a lawsuit resulting from an injury to another person, such as one spouse\u2019s action for loss of consortium arising from an injury to the other spouse caused by a third person. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.1999), at 455. A \u201closs of consortium\u201d refers to a loss of the benefits that one spouse is entitled to receive from the other or that a child is entitled to receive from his or her parent, including companionship, cooperation, aid, affection, and, between spouses, sexual relations. See id. at 304 (defining \u201cconsortium\u201d) and 958 (defining \u201closs of consortium\u201d). Such losses give rise to a cause of action, which can be recoverable as damages in a personal injury or wrongful death action. Id. at 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">{\u00b6 18} Under the policy\u2019s terms, Sherri and Sean Watkins are not entitled to separate per-person limits of coverage for their loss-of-consortium claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">{\u00b6 19} Nevertheless, the Watkinses argue that the policy\u2019s \u201cEach Person Limit\u201d is unenforceable pursuant to <em>Schaefer, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 553, 668 N.E.2d 913. In that case, the Ohio Supreme Court, relying on its prior decision in <em>Savoie v. Grange Mut Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 500, 620 N.E.2d 809, held that \u201c[e]aeh person who is covered by an uninsured motorist policy and who is asserting a claim for loss of consortium has a separate claim subject to a separate per person policy limit. A provision in an insurance policy which reaches a contrary result is unenforceable.\u201d <em>Schaefer </em>at syllabus. <em>Schaefer </em>was subsequently held applicable to general liability policies as well as uninsured motorist cases. See, e.g., <em>Jones v. U.S.A.A. Ins. Co. </em>(Mar. 31, 2000), Lake App. No. 98-L-253, 2000 WL 522292.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>{\u00b6 20} However, in an effort to overturn <em>Savoie </em>and its progeny, the General Assembly passed Senate Bill 20, which added a new section to the Ohio Revised Code, R.C. 3937.44, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cAny liability policy of insurance including, but not limited to, automobile liability or motor vehicle liability insurance that provides a limit of coverage for payment for damages for bodily injury, including death, sustained by any one person in any one accident, may, notwithstanding Chapter 2125. of the Revised Code, include terms and conditions to the effect that all claims resulting from or arising out of any one person\u2019s bodily injury, including death, shall collectively be subject to the limit of the policy applicable to bodily injury, including death, sustained by one person, and, for the purpose of such policy limit shall constitute a single claim. Any such policy limit shall be enforceable regardless of the number of insureds, claims made, vehicles or premiums shown in the declarations or policy, or vehicles involved in the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 22} The Watkinses argue, and the trial court agreed, that because R.C. 3937.44 specifically refers to liability policies that provide coverage \u201cfor bodily injury * * * sustained by any one person in any one <em>accident * </em>* (emphasis added), the statute applies only to motor vehicle liability policies and not to professional liability policies. However, this contention is at odds with the plain words of the statute, which state that the provision applies to \u201c[a]ny liability policy of insurance <em>including, but not limited to, automobile liability or motor vehicle liability insurance </em>* * (Emphasis added.) R.C. 3937.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 23} The Watkinses also argue that the occurrence of medical malpractice is not an \u201caccident.\u201d The trial court agreed with this argument, finding that an act of professional negligence did not fall within the term \u201caccident.\u201d We conclude, however, that an occurrence of medical malpractice falls within the definition of \u201caccident\u201d as that term is used in R.C. 3937.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. Chapter 3937 does not define the term \u201caccident.\u201d R.C. 1.42 provides that \u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d Under Ohio law, the ordinary meaning of \u201caccident,\u201d as used in liability insurance policies in which the term is undefined, refers to \u201cunintended and unexpected happenings.\u201d <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1993), 990 F.2d 865, 871-872. Furthermore, in interpreting such policies, it has been held that the question of whether an occurrence is an \u201caccident\u201d is viewed from the standpoint of the insured. See <em>Kish v. Cent. Natl. Ins. Group of Omaha </em>(1981), 67 Ohio.St.2d 41, 48, 21 O.O.3d 26, 424 N.E.2d 288 (\u201cAbsent any enforceable contractual provisions to the contrary, the perspective that governs the determination of whether an occurrence is an accident for uninsured motorist and accident insurance purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>is that of the insured.\u201d). We conclude that it is appropriate to apply these principles in determining the common and ordinary meaning of the word \u201caccident\u201d as used in R.C. 3937.44, which applies to \u201c[a]ny liability policy of insurance including, but not limited to, automobile liability or motor vehicle liability insurance[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 25} In this case, it is undisputed that Mr. Watkins\u2019s injuries were unintended and unexpected from the standpoint of both the insured, Dr. Thomson, and the parties alleging coverage under the policy at issue, the Watkinses. There is no question that Dr. Thomson did not intend to injure Mr. Watkins, nor did Dr. Thompson expect that his treatment of Mr. Watkins would result in injury to him. Therefore, Dr. Thomson\u2019s alleged malpractice constituted an \u201caccident\u201d for purposes of R.C. 3937.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in finding R.C. 3937.44 inapplicable to this case. Because that statute does apply, the policy\u2019s \u201cEach Person Limit\u201d is enforceable. Hence, Sherri and Sean Watkins are not entitled to separate per-person limits of coverage for their loss of consortium claims, but, instead, must share in the same Each Person Limit as John Watkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 27} OHIC\u2019s assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 28} In their appeal, the Watkinses present the following proposition of law, which we shall treat as their assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cA medical malpractice insurer cannot combine limits of liability for separate and distinct bodily injury and wrongful death that occur during different policy periods under a \u2018claims made\u2019 policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">{\u00b6 30} The Watkinses contend that the trial court erred in finding that if Mr. Watkins dies from his injuries after the expiration of the policy year in which he brought his malpractice claim and his wife and son brought their loss-of-consortium claims, the policy would not provide new limits of coverage for any wrongful death action brought by Sherri and Sean Watkins in that subsequent policy year. The Watkinses argue that when a claim for bodily injury and a claim for wrongful death arise during separate policy periods under a professional liability \u201cclaims made\u201d policy, separate liability limits should be held to apply during each \u201cclaims made\u201d policy period, even when the claims arise from the same act of alleged medical malpractice. We disagree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">{\u00b6 31} Section I of the policy reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-12\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cSECTION I \u2014 INSURING AGREEMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-13\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cA. \u2018Claims\u2019 Covered By This Policy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>{\u00b6 34} \u201c1. We will pay \u2018claims\u2019 which the \u2018insured\u2019 becomes legally obligated to pay because of \u2018professional services\u2019 provided or which should have been provided. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c2. We will consider a \u2018claim\u2019 first made at the earlier of the following times:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201ca. when the \u2018insured\u2019 first gives us written notice that a \u2018claim\u2019 has been made; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cb. when the \u2018insured\u2019 first gives us written notice of incidents or circumstances which may result in a \u2018claim\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">{\u00b6 39} Section IV of the policy states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cSECTION IV \u2014 LIMITS OF COVERAGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">{\u00b641} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cB. The Limits of Coverage apply separately to each consecutive annual period * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-13\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cC. If a \u2018claim\u2019 is first reported to us during the policy period or any applicable extended reporting period alleging injury or death arising from \u2018professional services\u2019 provided or which should have been provided to the same person on a repeated basis or involving the continuous treatment of the same illness, injury, or condition, that \u2018claim\u2019 will be considered a single \u2018claim\u2019 under this policy, regardless of whether the \u2018professional services\u2019 were provided during more than one policy period and the \u2018claim\u2019 will be subject exclusively to the Limits of Coverage of the current policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">{\u00b6 44} As the trial court stated in rejecting the claim the Watkinses are now raising on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThe policy is rather specific. It only covers claims for professional negligence that are made during the policy year in which the insured first gave written notice of <em>incidents or circumstances which may result in a claim. </em>This notice was given by the Watkinses in the policy year April 1, 2000 to April 1, 2001 and the limits of coverage applicable to that policy year control the extent of the liability of the defendant for all claims made during that year. This would include any claim made for a death which occurs in a * * * policy year [subsequent to the policy year in which] the claim was first made * * *.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">{\u00b6 46} The Watkinses essentially acknowledge that the terms of the policy do not support their position, but argue, nonetheless, that we should find those provisions unenforceable. However, the Watkinses have failed to provide us with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>a convincing rationale for ignoring the plain, unambiguous terms of the policy, nor can we think of any.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">{\u00b6 47} In light of the foregoing, the Watkinses\u2019 assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 48} The trial court\u2019s judgment in case number CA2002-03-055 is reversed with respect to its findings that R.C. 3937.44 is inapplicable to professional liability policies, that the Each Person Limit provision of the liability policy in question is unenforceable, and that the Watkinses are each entitled to a separate per-person limit with respect to Dr. Thomson and CMB\u2019s professional liability policy with OHIC. Pursuant to App.R. 12(B), judgment is hereby entered in OHIC\u2019s favor with respect to those issues. The trial court\u2019s judgment in case number CA2002-03-064 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b390-7\">Walsh, P.J., and Valen, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
