Appellant began working for appellee on October 16, 1995, as a part-time mammog-rapher and became a full-time employee on June 9, 1996. Thereafter, appellant began working in appellee\u2019s mobile mammography unit, operating a van containing a motorized mammography unit and performing mammographies at various locations. In September 1998, appellant resigned from appellee to take another job; however, she returned to appellee on November 22, 1998, and resumed her previous duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">{\u00b6 3} On January 6, 1999, appellant slipped on ice while operating the mobile unit and sustained a wrist injury. On that same date, appellee approved appellant\u2019s request for medical leave of absence. In an operative note for the January 12, 1999 surgical procedure, the injury was diagnosed as a comminuted distal radial fracture with significant dorsal comminution. Appellant filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with appellee, a self-insured employer, indicating that she had sustained a wrist fracture. On January 26, 1999, appellee certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>appellant\u2019s claim for \u201cFracture, right -wrist.\u201d It also approved various surgeries, treatments, and physical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 4} On March 4, 1999, Dr. Karl Kumler indicated in his treatment notes that appellant\u2019s wrist fracture was progressing well and that he had a \u201cslight concern\u201d of possible reflex sympathetic dystrophy (\u201cRSD\u201d). He also indicated that he was concerned about appellant\u2019s hand function due to finger stiffness and referred her to a hand therapist. He completed a C-9 Form and returned it to appellee. The form indicated, among other things, that appellant had finger swelling. On March 11, 1999, Tammy Riggenbach, a certified hand therapist, opined that appellant may have RSD. On March 12, 1999, Riggenbach wrote a letter to Dr. Kumler, appellant\u2019s treating physician, indicating that she believed that appellant had RSD relating to her wrist injury and suggested that Dr. Kumler to consider using stellate ganglion block injections (\u201cblocks\u201d or \u201cblock injections\u201d) to arrest the RSD. Riggenbach also related to Dr. Kumler that such injections would be complicated by the fact that appellant had vagal response, which may cause a person to go into shock when pricked with needles.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 5} In a March 15, 1999 C-9 statement, Dr. Kumler requested that stellate ganglion blocks be permitted to arrest the RSD. Appellee denied any treatment of blocks. Riggenbach claims that appellee told her that the claim was denied because RSD was a pre-existing condition. On March 18, 1999, Riggenbach prepared a report for Dr. Kumler, and appellee expressing her concern that RSD was denied on the basis of a pre-existing condition. Riggenbach also expressed that appellant\u2019s hand was not functional due to pain and RSD symptoms. On March 19, 1999, Riggenbach spoke with Charlene Cordle at Mount Carmel East regarding RSD literature she could provide to Patricia Rutter, supervisor of appellee\u2019s Employee Health Services. Apparently, a record of the heated conversation was made, and Riggenbach was told by her supervisor that a complaint had been made regarding the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">{\u00b6 6} On March 22, 1999, Dr. Kumler requested in a C-9 that appellee allow the RSD in appellant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim and authorize consultations for appellant with Dr. Claire Wolfe and Dr. Scott Berliner to diagnose RSD. On that same day, appellee approved consultations with Drs. Wolfe and Berliner. Appellee claims that it denied the allowance of RSD as part of appellant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim because no test or doctor had ever diagnosed RSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">{\u00b6 7} On March 24, 1999, Dr. Berliner, an anesthesiologist, examined appellant. Dr. Berliner issued a report to Dr. Kumler and appellee indicating that appellant had signs of autonomic instability and block injections may be used to see whether her sympathetic system was playing a role in her symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">{\u00b6 8} On April 1, 1999, appellant had a consultation with Dr. Wolfe. Dr. Wolfe authored a report to Dr. Kumler and appellee, in which she opined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>there was \u201cno question\u201d that appellant had RSD and indicated that there was a real possibility of loss of major function if not treated aggressively. Dr. Wolfe also stated that the most consistent diagnostic test for RSD was a triple-phase bone scan. She also indicated that she believed such a test was not necessary, as appellant\u2019s clinical picture was so classic and dramatic. Further, she believed that appellant should be given the option to receive block injections.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">{\u00b6 9} Appellee\u2019s Human Resources Policies and Procedures Manual (\u201cmanual\u201d) contains a leave of absence policy, under which an employee may take a maximum of twenty-six weeks of medical leave, which includes twelve weeks\u2019 leave under the Family Medical Leave Act. In April 1999, appellee maintains that it began to prepare for appellant\u2019s return to work after the twenty-six-week medical leave by attempting to find temporary modified duty work for appellant. Appellee sent appellant\u2019s treating physicians forms requesting that they indicate appellant\u2019s work restrictions. The doctors never responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">{\u00b6 10} On April 7, 1999, appellee wrote a letter to appellant requesting that she undergo a triple-phase bone scan consistent with Dr. Wolfe\u2019s report. Appel-lee indicated that after receiving the results of the scan, it would determine whether to allow RSD as part of the workers\u2019 compensation claim. Appellant did not undergo the triple-phase bone scan, citing as her reason her vagal response and the invasiveness of the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">{\u00b6 11} On April 12, 1999, appellant\u2019s counsel sent a letter and fax to appellee indicating that appellant was in dire need of block injections. On April 13, 1999, appellee approved one block injection from Dr. Berliner in order to diagnose RSD. His report after the April 20, 1999 block was inconclusive, but appellee approved two more blocks on April 26, 1999. On May 5, 1999, Dr. Kumler requested an undefined number of block injections due to appellant\u2019s good response to the previous three, which appellee denied. However, appellee did approve three additional blocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">{\u00b6 12} On May 7, 1999, appellant filed a motion with the Industrial Commission of Ohio (\u201ccommission\u201d) to have her workers\u2019 compensation claim allowed for the additional conditions of RSD and right frozen shoulder syndrome. Also, on May 7, 1999, Sheila Harris, manager for appellee\u2019s Employee Health Services, wrote to Dr. Kumler explaining that she was trying to find temporary modified duty work for appellant and asking him for appellant\u2019s work restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">{\u00b6 13} On May 12, 1999, appellee informed appellant that all further treatments would be put on hold pending a commission decision. Appellant then contacted her private health insurance carrier, Holy Cross Insurance (\u201cHoly Cross\u201d) and requested further block injections. Appellee also claims that it informed Holy Cross that appellant may need additional blocks and that it would reimburse Holy Cross if the RSD and blocks were allowed by the commission.' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Holy Cross approved appellant\u2019s request on May 13, 1999. Appellant received three more block injections.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">{\u00b6 14} On June 22, 1999, appellant underwent an examination by Dr. John Cunningham at the request of appellee. Dr. Cunningham issued a report on that date opining that appellant had sustained right hand, arm, and shoulder RSD as a result of the January 6,1999 accident. He stated that the three additional blocks since March 1999 were appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">{\u00b6 15} On July 20, 1999, after twenty-six weeks of leave, appellant had not returned to work, had not requested extended leave, and had not contacted appellee to announce when she would return to work. On August 27, 1999, Mary Kelley, director of Human Resources for appellee, sent appellant a letter terminating her employment, citing that she had exhausted her leave and had not provided a return-to-work date. Appellant advised appellee that she deemed the termination a violation of the workers\u2019 compensation anti-retaliation statute and explained the various attempts from her doctors to communicate her return-to-work dates. On September 27, 1999, appellee sent a letter to appellant telling her that Riggenbach had advised that she could return to some nature of work on September 16, 1999, and advised her that it would look into a job for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">{\u00b6 16} During the summer of 1999, appellant alleges that she discussed with supervisors in appellee\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Center various jobs she might have been able to perform relating to mammography. The only mammography-related job she thought she could perform was bone-density testing, and she requested employment performing bone-density tests. However, appellee told her that it had no position that exclusively performed such testing. In September and October 1999, appellee offered appellant three jobs: nuclear medicine technologist at Mount Carmel West, radiographer at Mount Carmel East, or radiographer at St. Ann\u2019s Hospital. Appellant declined the offers because she was not certified to do the nuclear medicine job, and the other jobs required the use of two hands. Appellant told Dr. Lori Sullivan that she still thought she could do bone-density testing, and Dr. Sullivan noted such on C-84 and C-9 forms she sent to appellee. Appellant alleges that appellee told its employees in its Women\u2019s Health Center not to discuss their jobs with appellant and told them to advise appellant that all job discussions would be conducted through the Human Resources Department. Appellee later advised appellant that there were no bone-density jobs available.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">{\u00b6 17} Subsequently, on October 14, 1999, the commission allowed RSD as an additional condition but denied right frozen shoulder syndrome. After RSD was allowed, appellee authorized every RSD treatment request and paid such treatment bills. In addition, from January 1999 to June 2000, appellee paid $999 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>appellant every two weeks for temporary total disability compensation with regard to her workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">{\u00b6 18} On February 23, 2000, appellant filed an action against appellee, alleging (1) wrongful termination in violation of R.C. 4123.90 (the Ohio workers\u2019 compensation anti-retaliation statute); and (2) an employer\u2019s intentional tort claim for appellee\u2019s intentional, malicious, and bad-faith conduct in denying, delaying, suspending, and interrupting appellant\u2019s treatment and for appellee denying, delaying, and appealing the orders of the allowance of RSD. In June 2000, appellant was released to return to full-time employment, and on June 28, 2000, she began full-time employment with Ohio State University as a mammog-rapher with modified lifting requirements. On April 16, 2001, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment. Appellant filed a memorandum contra on May 8, 2001. On May 15, 2001, appellee filed a reply and motion to strike appellant\u2019s affidavit submitted with her memorandum contra. On March 7, 2002, the trial court issued a decision and entry granting (1) appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and (2) appellee\u2019s motion to strike appellant\u2019s affidavit. Appellant appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment, asserting the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c[1.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant, by employing facts proffered solely by the party moving for summary judgment (appellee), in its analysis of the facts of the case, to support granting appellee summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c[2.] The trial court erred in granting appellee summary judgment by finding that appellee did not violate Revised Code \u00a7 4123.90, the workers compensation anti-retaliation statute, when the facts demonstrate that appellee took punitive action against appellant as a direct result of appellant pursuing her workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[3.] The trial court erred in holding that an employer\u2019s intentional tort, under the <em>Balyint [v. Arkansas Best Freight Sys., Inc. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 126, 18 OBR 188, 480 N.E.2d 417] theory, is limited to situations wherein a self-insured employer suspends payment of compensation to an injured worker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant argues in her first assignment of error that the trial court relied solely upon the facts proffered by appellee, to the exclusion of the facts proffered by her. Appellant claims that the trial court\u2019s ignoring her version of the facts was apparent by its order, in which the facts she proffered were rarely, if ever, discussed. However, this court reviews a trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment de novo. <em>Wille v. Hunkar Laboratories, Inc. </em>(1998), 132 Ohio App.3d 92, 96, 724 N.E.2d 492. Because this court makes an independent review of the record and does not rely upon the order of the trial court, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>court\u2019s factual recitation, whether complete or incomplete, is not prejudicial to appellant. Therefore, this assignment of error is overruled. Nevertheless, in conducting our analysis under her other assignments of error, we will take note of the evidence appellant contends that the trial court disregarded, as well as all other evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 23} Appellant argues in her second assignment of error that the trial court erred in granting appellee summary judgment when it found that appellee did not violate R.C. 4123.90, the anti-retaliation statute, when the facts demonstrated that appellee took punitive action against appellant as a direct result of appellant\u2019s pursuing her workers\u2019 compensation claim. Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is appropriate when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party, said party being entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor. <em>Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club, Inc. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 367, 369-370, 696 N.E.2d 201. \u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment, the court of appeals conducts an independent review of the record and stands in the shoes of the trial court.\u201d <em>Mergenthal v. Star Banc Corp. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 100, 103, 701 N.E.2d 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 24} Appellant argues in her brief that her R.C. 4123.90 retaliation claim is based upon appellee\u2019s (1) denial of and/or delay in approving her medical treatment, (2) failure to immediately notify the commission that it was contesting the medical treatment and allowance issues, (3) unilateral suspension of all treatment in appellant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim following the filing of her motion for the additional allowance of the RSD and right frozen shoulder syndrome, and (4) termination of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">{\u00b6 25} Initially, appellee argues, as it did in the trial court, that the court should not address the theories set forth in (1), (2), and (3) above because appellant\u2019s complaint alleged that her R.C. 4123.90 cause of action was based solely on her discharge. Appellee points out that appellant never filed a motion to amend her complaint to raise these new claims, and, thus, she waived the right to assert the new conduct that she now claims as a basis for the R.C. 4123.90 claim. Appellant\u2019s complaint sets forth her cause of action under R.C. 4123.90 as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c47. Defendant, as a direct and proximate result of Plaintiffs filing and pursuing her workers\u2019 compensation claim, discharged and terminated her employment relationship with Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c48. Plaintiff, as a direct and proximate result of Defendant\u2019s wrongful termination of Plaintiffs has suffered damages as described in Revised Code Section 4123.90.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Thus, it is clear that appellant\u2019s complaint did not raise the reasons listed in (1), (2), and (3) as possible grounds of recovery under R.C. 4123.90. Her complaint lists only her termination and discharge as a reason for recovery. As a result, appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment did not address these issues and addressed only the R.C. 4123.90 claim as it related to appellant\u2019s discharge. Our review of the record reveals that the first time appellant raised these new theories of recovery under R.C. 4123.90 was in her memorandum contra appel-lee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In its reply memorandum, appellee urged the trial court to disregard these new arguments raised for the first time in appellant\u2019s memorandum contra. In its March 7, 2002 decision and entry, the trial court did not directly address the issue. Instead, the trial court failed to reach the merits of these newly raised claims by finding that there was no precedent for allowing a'cause of action under R.C. 4123.90 for allegedly punitive actions by an employer in the handling of an employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. Thus, the trial court found that the only conduct actionable was appellant\u2019s termination from employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 29} Civ.R. 8(A) sets forth the necessities for pleading a claim for relief and provides in relevant part: \u201cA pleading that sets forth a claim for relief * * * shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the party is entitled to relief, and (2) a demand for judgment for the relief to which the party claims to be entitled.\u201d The purpose of Civ.R. 8(A) is to give the defendant fair notice of the claim and an opportunity to respond. <em>Fancher v. Fancher </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 79, 82-83, 8 OBR 111, 455 N.E.2d 1344. We are mindful that Civ.R. 8(A) does not require the plaintiff to plead the legal theory of recovery. <em>Illinois Controls, Inc. v. Langham </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 512, 639 N.E.2d 771, paragraph six of the syllabus. We also recognize that the plaintiff is not \u201c \u2018bound by any particular theory of a claim but that the facts of the claim as developed by the proof establish the right to relief.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 526, 639 N.E.2d 771, quoting MeCormac, Ohio Civil Rules Practice (2d Ed.1992) 102, Section 5.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\"> {\u00b6 30} This court is permitted to affirm a trial court\u2019s decision on different grounds. See 5 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1999), Appellate Review, Section 585. In affirming the trial court\u2019s decision that appellant may not recover under the grounds delineated in (1), (2), and (3) above, we find that appellant\u2019s complaint failed to give appellee fair notice of the claim and an opportunity to fully respond. Appellant could not fairly raise these new reasons underlying her R.C. 4123.90 claim for the first time in her memorandum contra. Appellant\u2019s complaint was filed on February 23, 2000. Her memorandum contra was not filed until May 9, 2001. The record reveals no indication during that fifteen-month period that appellant was seeking recovery under R.C. 4123.90 for any reason other than her termination. It would be inequitable to allow her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>untimely raise these new arguments at that late juncture without first amending her complaint or, at a minimum, raising the issues in some other pleading or form. This is particularly true in light of the fact that the discovery cutoff was March 31, 2001. Thus, appellee would have been unable to conduct any further discovery to investigate these new grounds under R.C. 4123.90. As indicated above, the purpose of Civ.R. 8(A) is to give a defendant fair notice of the claim and an opportunity to respond. We do not believe that appellant\u2019s complaint or subsequent pleadings allowed appellee fair notice of the claim and an equitable opportunity to respond to the new grounds set forth in (1), (2), and (3) above. Therefore, although we agree with the trial court that appellant may not recover based upon these grounds under R.C. 4123.90, we find so for a different reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 31} Thus, we are left with the only ground stated in appellant\u2019s complaint for her cause of action under R.C. 4123.90; that is, that appellee\u2019s termination of her employment was in retaliation for her filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim. R.C. 4123.90 states, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cNo employer shall discharge, demote, reassign, or take any punitive action against any employee because the employee filed a claim or instituted, pursued or testified in any proceedings under the workers\u2019 compensation act for an injury or occupational disease which occurred in the course of and arising out of his employment with that employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">{\u00b6 33} As this court explained in <em>Sidenstricker v. Miller Pavement Maintenance, Inc. </em>(Oct. 25, 2001), Franklin App. No. 00AP-1146, 2001 WL 1286419:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe basic purpose of workers\u2019 compensation is to protect and provide a remedy for employees injured in the course of their employment. Section 35, Article II, Ohio Constitution; <em>Bailey v. Republic Engineered Steels, Inc. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 38, 40-41 [741 N.E.2d 121]; <em>Village v. Gen. Motors Corp., G.M.A.D. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 129, 133 [15 OBR 279, 472 N.E.2d 1079]; <em>Guy v. Arthur H. Thomas Co. </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 183, 186 [9 O.O.3d 138, 378 N.E.2d 488]. To accomplish that purpose, the workers\u2019 compensation legislation balances the rights and duties of employers and employees by striking a bargain between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cAs part of the \u2018balance,\u2019 employer participation in the workers\u2019 compensation system is generally compulsory, and participating employers must comply with the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. R.C. 4123.01(B)(2). One provision of the Act, R.C. 4123.90, statutorily embodies a clear public policy that employers not retaliate against employees who exercise their statutory right to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim or pursue workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>Bryant [v. Dayton Casket Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 367], 371, 374 [23 O.O.3d 341, 433 N.E.2d 142]; <em>Boyd [v. Winton Hills Med. &amp; Health Ctr., Inc. </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 150], 161 [727 N.E.2d 137]; <em>Vince v. Parma Comm. Gen. Hosp. </em>(Jan. 21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>1988), Cuyahoga App. No. 53180 [1988 WL 5165], unreported (\u2018The laudable objective of this provision is that employees may not be intimidated from recovering for their injuries by the fear of reprisals by their employer, up to and including discharge from employment\u2019). If an employer does retaliate against an employee by discharging the employee for filing or pursuing a workers\u2019 compensation claim, R.C. 4123.90 provides a basis for the employee to bring an action for retaliatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThe scope of the statute is nevertheless narrow, and R.C. 4123.90 does not prevent an employer from discharging an employee who is unable to perform his or her duties. Employees who have filed for workers\u2019 compensation benefits may be discharged for just and lawful reasons. The statute protects only against termination in direct response to the filing or pursuit of a workers\u2019 compensation claim. <em>Markham [v. Earle M.

See <em>Chandler v. Empire Chem., Inc., Midwest Rubber Custom Mixing Div. </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 396, 650 N.E.2d 950, citing <em>Jackson v. RKO Bottlers of Toledo, Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1984), 743 F.2d 370, 375. If the plaintiff meets her initial burden in establishing a prima facie case, then the burden shifts to the defendant to give a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the action. See id., citing <em>Burrus v. United Tel. Co. </em>(C.A.10, 1982), 683 F.2d 339, 343. If the defendant gives a nondiscriminatory reason, then the plaintiff must show that the articulated reason was only a pretext for the adverse action. See id. This court has applied the foregoing analysis to R.C. 4123.90 claims. <em>Oliver v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-229, 2002-Ohio-5005, 2002 WL 31111841; <em>Sidenstricker, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">{\u00b6 38} In the present case, assuming arguendo that appellant has established a prima facie case, appellee has sustained its burden of articulating a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for its termination of appellant. Appellee premised its summary judgment motion on its having terminated appellant\u2019s employment because appellant was absent from work for a period of time longer than allowed under appellee\u2019s medical-leave policy. Appellee supported its motion with the deposition of appellant, the affidavit of Patricia Rutter, the affidavit of Sheila Harris, and the affidavit of Mary Kelley. Harris averred that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>she had sent correspondence to Dr. Kumler, explaining that appellee wanted to find temporary modified-duty work for appellant to perform and asking Dr. Kumler to advise her of appellant\u2019s work restrictions. She averred that she received no response from Dr. Kumler and no definitive return-to-work date. She attached the letter she had sent to Dr. Kumler as an exhibit to her affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">{\u00b6 39} Kelley averred in her affidavit that under appellee\u2019s leave of absence policy, set forth in Section 745.0 of its human resources manual, appellee\u2019s employees are allotted a maximum of twenty-six weeks of leave. She indicated that if an employee exceeds the maximum of twenty-six weeks of leave, appellee\u2019s policy is to terminate his or her employment. Kelley further averred that on August 27, 1999, she sent a letter to appellant terminating her employment for exceeding her twenty-six weeks of leave and for failing to provide a definitive return-to-work date. In addition, Kelley stated that from 1999 to 2000, approximately nineteen other employees were terminated for exceeding their allotted twenty-six weeks of leave. Kelley attached as an exhibit to her affidavit the letter she sent to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">{\u00b6 40} Appellant testified in her deposition that appellee explained to her that she had a total leave period of twenty-six weeks. She said she did not recall if she ever had any conversations with appellee regarding extending the leave beyond twenty-six weeks, but she knows she never actually requested that her leave be extended beyond the twenty-six weeks. Appellant also specifically indicated that her employment was terminated because she had exhausted the twenty-six weeks of leave, and her doctors had not supplied a return-to-work date. In her deposition, she never indicated any other reason for the termination when provided an opportunity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ. * * * Other than the expiration of your 26 weeks of leave and the fact that your doctor had not supplied a return-to-work date, are you aware of any other reasons for your termination from Mt. Carmel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">{\u00b6 43} Appellant also testified that Drs. Kumler, Cunningham, and Sullivan provided return-to-work dates. However, she indicated that the return-to-work dates were all estimated. She further stated that she could not return to work on the dates they estimated due to the nonfunctionality of her hand. She admitted that there was no point in time when she gave appellee a definitive date that she could return to work. We also note that this court, as well as the trial court, could only find the June 10, 1999 report from Dr. Kumler in the record, and such did not provide a definitive return-to-work date, indicating only a return to \u201csome kind\u201d of employment in the \u201cnear future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>{\u00b6 44} R.C. 4123.90 \u201cdoes not prevent an employer from discharging an employee who is unable to perform his duties; it merely prevents an employer from discharging an employee because the employee pursues a workers\u2019 compensation claim.\u201d <em>Barker v. Dayton Walther Corp. </em>(1989), 56 Ohio App.3d 1, 3, 564 N.E.2d 738. \u201cIf the company policy is neutral in its application, the correlation between the timing of the discharge and the claim is not sufficient to meet the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Metheney v. Sajar Plastics, Inc. </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 428, 432, 590 N.E.2d 1311. As a result, an employee\u2019s termination under an employer\u2019s medical leave policy is not considered a retaliatory discharge if the company policy is neutral in its application. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">{\u00b6 45} In the present case, even if appellant\u2019s evidence sets forth a prima facie case under R.C. 4123.90, appellee\u2019s evidence presented a neutral reason for terminating appellant\u2019s employment. In her deposition, appellant stated that she was never able to go back to her prior job and indicated that the return-to-work dates were all estimated. She stated that no doctor had ever told her that in his or her opinion, she could return to being a full-time mammographer. She further acknowledged that she could not return to work on the various dates they estimated due to the nonfunctionality of her hand. She admitted that there was no point in time when she gave appellee a definitive date that she could return to work. The evidence establishes that she could not return to full-time employment until June 2000, when her hand became functional enough to perform her duties as a mammographer. Because appellant did not return to work, her absence from the workplace exceeded the time allowed under appellee\u2019s medical-leave policy, and appellee terminated her employment. A bona fide company policy prohibiting long-term absences or excessive absenteeism rebuts the inference that an employee who violates the policy was terminated for retaliatory motives. <em>Vince v. Parma Comm. Gen. Hosp. </em>(Jan. 21, 1988), Cuyahoga App. No. 53180, 1988 WL 5165.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 46} Because we have found that appellee articulated a legitimate nonretali-atory reason for its action, appellant could only escape summary judgment by showing that appellee\u2019s proffered reason was a mere pretext. Appellant responds with various arguments. Appellant first maintains that the conduct, omissions, and decisions of appellee relating to her workers\u2019 compensation claim were what caused or greatly contributed to her extended absence from work. However, appellant fails to demonstrate that this was true. Appellant cites no evidence showing that her condition worsened or was exacerbated by appellee\u2019s handling of her claim. Appellant also does not demonstrate that appellee\u2019s actions in suspending her medical treatment during its contest of her claim contributed to her failure to return to work within twenty-six weeks. To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>contrary, appellant admits that she continuously received treatment for her injury, even while appellee was contesting the allowance of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">{\u00b6 47} Appellant also claims that appellee acted to prevent her from timely returning to work by quashing the conversations between her and Women\u2019s Health Center, by not offering sedentary substitute work, and solely limiting its job offers to jobs that required extensive use of both hands. However, appellee\u2019s efforts at finding suitable substitute work for appellant beginning in April 1999 would tend to demonstrate that it did not seek to terminate appellant\u2019s employment based upon the filing of her claim. Such interest in finding substitute work was apparent in its letter to Dr. Kumler requesting that he provide appellant\u2019s work restrictions. Further, it is undisputed that even after terminating appellant\u2019s employment, appellee continued to try to find employment for appellant. There is no evidence that these efforts were not genuine. Evidence that the employer offered an injured worker a number of substitute assignments when the employee was medically able to return to work has been found to weaken any inference of retaliatory conduct under R.C. 4123.90. <em>Markham, </em>supra, at 493, 741 N.E.2d 618. In addition, even if appellant\u2019s allegations are true that appellee told its employees at the Women\u2019s Health Center not to discuss their job descriptions with appellant and to advise her that all job discussions would be conducted through the Human Resources Department, such is not evidence that appellee attempted to keep appellant from returning to work. Rather, such instructions would be reasonable, given that the Human Resources Department would be better able to describe the necessary job qualifications and available positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">{\u00b6 48} Appellant also maintains that the undocumented allegation that nineteen other employees of appellee were terminated was not sufficient to remove any discriminatory pretext in appellee\u2019s decision to terminate appellant. She asserts that appellee should have been required to prove that the nineteen other employees were on leave of absence for similar reasons and that the leave of absence policy was the sole reason for its termination of appellant. However, Kelley, as director of Human Resources for appellee, specifically testified that these nineteen employees were terminated for the exact same violation of the leave policy. She testified to such based upon her personal knowledge, and appellant gives no reason as to why such information should not be admissible. Further, the reason for the leave of absence of the nineteen employees is largely irrelevant. We need only determine that the leave of absence policy was applied universally and nondiscriminatorily to appellant and these nineteen employees regardless of the reason for their leaves of absence. It has been held that an affidavit of a human resources manager containing examples of ten employees who had been disciplined under the company\u2019s policy on absenteeism, most of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>whom had absences that were not the result of injuries covered by workers\u2019 compensation, demonstrated a legitimate nonretaliatory basis for appellant\u2019s discharge. See <em>Boggs v. Conrad </em>(Sept. 27, 1999), Mahoning App. No. 98 CA 120, 1999 WL 783952.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">{\u00b6 49} Appellant\u2019s claim that the September 1999 offers of employment were not reasonable or genuine because they were clearly beyond her physical abilities is unsupported by the record. As noted previously, appellee received no response from Drs. Kumler and Sullivan regarding any work restrictions. Further, although vague, Drs. Kumler and Cunningham did indicate that appellant would be able to return to work at the end of summer or early fall. Riggenbach indicated that appellant would be able to return to work in September 1999. Thus, appellee had very little medical support regarding appellant\u2019s work restrictions, and what vague information it could gather from the medical evidence seemed to indicate that appellant would be able to return to employment in the fall of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">{\u00b6 50} Because appellant\u2019s evidence does not show that appellee\u2019s reason for terminating appellant\u2019s employment is pretext, she has failed to meet her burden under R.C. 4123.90. See <em>Bianco v. Trumbull Mem. Hosp. </em>(July 13, 2001), Trumbull App. No. 2000-T-0126, 2001 WL 799942 (violation of leave policy not a pretext when employee had completed a six-month leave of absence, yet failed to return to work on the appointed date and failed to provide the necessary forms that would have allowed for an extension of her leave of absence, while also indicating to employer that she was still under restrictions and would be unable to resume prior duties). Even construing the evidence most strongly in favor of appellant, we find that there are no genuine issues of material fact as to appellant\u2019s claim for retaliatory action based upon R.C. 4123.90. Therefore, the trial court properly granted appellee\u2019s summary judgment motion in that respect. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">{\u00b6 51} Appellant argues in her third assignment of error that the trial court erred in holding that she was not entitled to recovery for her employer\u2019s intentional tort under <em>Balyint v. Arkansas Best Freight Sys., Inc. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 126, 18 OBR 188, 480 N.E.2d 417. In her complaint, appellant claims that the following wrongful and illegal acts of appellee formed the basis of a <em>Balyint </em>claim: (1) appellee wrongfully and intentionally refused to additionally recognize her workers\u2019 compensation claim for RSD, and (2) appellee intentionally and wrongfully refused to provide appellant with immediate, appropriate, and necessary medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">{\u00b6 52} We first note that, just as appellant did with regard to her cause of action under R.C. 4123.90, appellant raised several additional grounds for recovery under <em>Balyint </em>in her memorandum contra appellee\u2019s motion for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>mary judgment that were not set forth in her complaint. In addition to the grounds delineated in her complaint and set forth above, appellant raised in her memorandum contra that she was entitled to recovery under <em>Balyint </em>on the following grounds: (1) appellee\u2019s denial of her claim for RSD on the basis that said condition was a \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d; (2) appellee\u2019s unreasonable delay in requesting the bone scan diagnostic test from March 4 or 15, 1999 to April 7, 1999; and (3) appellee\u2019s termination of appellant\u2019s employment. In its decision, the trial court did not address these three additional arguments propounded for the first time in appellant\u2019s memorandum contra. As we found with respect to appellant\u2019s second assignment of error above, appellant\u2019s belated raising of such grounds was prejudicial to appellee. We are mindful that even if a complaint neither contains allegations on a legal theory nor suggests or intends to advance that theory, the. complaint may still be sufficient if it \u201ccontain[s] allegations from which an inference fairly may be drawn that evidence on these material points will be introduced at <em>trial.\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) <em>Fancher, </em>supra, at 82, 8 OBR 111, 455 N.E.2d 1344. In the present case, however, appellee could not have been fairly expected to infer that appellant was going to claim entitlement to recovery under <em>Balyint </em>based upon the three wholly different grounds raised in her memorandum contra. Appellant\u2019s late revelation of such grounds in her memorandum contra did not give appellee a fair opportunity to respond to such and conduct any additional discovery and investigation that may have been necessary. Therefore, as the trial court did, we will address only the two grounds raised in the complaint under the cause of action pursuant to <em>Balyint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">{\u00b6 53} In <em>Balyint, </em>an employee asserted a claim against his employer alleging that the employer negligently, wantonly, recklessly, intentionally, willfully, maliciously and arbitrarily terminated his temporary total disability compensation. The employer filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss on the grounds that the employee failed to comply with R.C. 4123.90. The Ohio Supreme Court concluded that R.C. 4123.90 was not an exclusive remedy and that the employee could select the remedy best calculated to afford the greatest recovery. Id. at 129-130, 18 OBR 188, 480 N.E.2d 417. One other such remedy was an intentional tort action. Id. at 129, 18 OBR 188, 480 N.E.2d 417. The court defined intentional tort as \u201c \u2018an act committed with the intent to injure another, or committed with the belief that such injury is substantially certain to occur.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 128, 18 OBR 188, 480 N.E.2d 417, quoting <em>Jones v. VIP Dev. Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 90, 472 N.E.2d 1046, paragraph one of the syllabus. Accordingly, the court in <em>Balyint </em>held that \u201c[a]n employee of a self-insured employer may maintain a cause of action against the employer for the intentional and wrongful termination of workers\u2019 compensation payments.\u201d <em>Balyint, </em>supra, at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>{\u00b6 54} Appellant\u2019s specific contentions are (1) claims under <em>Balyint </em>are not limited to situations in which a self-insured employer suspends payment of compensation to an injured worker, but also include situations where a self-insured employer rejects an allowance and suspends all medical treatment; and (2) claims under <em>Balyint </em>are not limited to instances of intentional acts, but additionally include acts done in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">{\u00b6 55} It appears that there is case law to support appellant\u2019s proposition that acts done in bad faith may form the basis for a <em>Balyint </em>claim. See <em>Kokitka v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 89, 94, 652 N.E.2d 671 (addressed a claim under <em>Balyint </em>that a self-insured employer acted in bad faith in the course of administering and resisting employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claims); <em>Hall v. Marion Power Shovel, Inc. </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 23, 603 N.E.2d 427 (Marion County Court of Appeals addressed a claim under <em>Balyint </em>that a self-insured employer acted in bad faith as a result of active malice, fraud, or insult as employee\u2019s insurer in contesting his claim for benefits before the commission, thereby delaying treatment and benefits that were ultimately awarded to him).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 56} However, we find that based upon the reasoning in <em>Kokitka </em>and <em>Hall, </em>appellant can show no genuine issue of material fact demonstrating that she is entitled to relief pursuant to <em>Balyint. </em>In <em>Kokitka, </em>an employee was awarded temporary total disability payments, but such payments legally ceased after she returned to work. The employee argued that, under <em>Balyint, </em>her employer acted in bad faith in failing to continue to pay temporary total compensation beyond such period. The Ohio Supreme Court found no obligation ever arose to pay an employee for a second, separate period of temporary total disability as no order to make such payments was ever made. Based upon this, the Ohio Supreme Court found no cause of action was tenable under <em>Balyint </em>because, unlike <em>Balyint, </em>the actions of the employer in <em>Kokitka </em>were permitted by law, and therefore did not rise to the level of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">{\u00b6 57} In <em>Hall, </em>an employee was injured in the course of his employment with his self-insured employer and thereafter received temporary total disability benefits, which were eventually terminated. Nine months later, the employee\u2019s treating physician recommended that he undergo further surgery, but the employer refused to approve the surgery and recommence temporary total disability benefits. Although the employee eventually underwent surgery and received all requested workers\u2019 compensation benefits, he brought an action against his employer under <em>Balyint, </em>alleging that his claims were unreasonably delayed and that he had suffered resulting financial ruin because of the employer\u2019s lack of good faith in processing his claims. The employee contended that the employer had no l\u00e9gal basis or good-faith justification for contesting his request for surgery and temporary total disability benefits and that the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>actions were for the sole purpose of delay. On appeal after summary judgment was granted to the employer, the court found <em>Balyint </em>clearly distinguishable from the cause before the court because no legal duty on the part of the present employer had yet occurred. The court stated that there could be no bad faith because the employer did not do anything that was not permitted by law or the dictates of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the Industrial Commission\u2019s administrative rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">{\u00b6 58} In the present case, we find <em>Balyint </em>distinguishable for the same reasons explained in <em>Kokitka </em>and <em>Hall. </em>In the current case, at the time appellee allegedly acted in bad faith in the handling of appellant\u2019s claim, no duty to make any payments on the part of appellee had yet occurred. Appellee\u2019s duties commenced only as of the date the commission allowed the additional claim for RSD. Further, we find, as did the courts in <em>Kokitka </em>and <em>Hall, </em>that because appellee acted in accordance with the law, its actions did not constitute \u201cbad faith.\u201d For the sake of completeness, we will address appellant\u2019s arguments regarding her various allegations of bad faith individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">{\u00b6 59} With regard to her argument that appellee acted in bad faith in refusing to additionally recognize her workers\u2019 compensation claim for RSD, we find it unsupported by the evidence presented. Appellant argues that there was a \u201cunanimity\u201d of medical opinions that appellant suffered from RSD as a direct result of her right wrist fracture. Appellant points to numerous pieces of evidence to demonstrate that appellee rejected her allowance of RSD in bad faith: (1) Dr. Kumler\u2019s March 4, 1999 office notes that indicate he believed appellant had RSD; (2) appellee\u2019s reference material used in researching medical conditions, the Milliman <em>&amp; </em>Robertson Healthcare Guidelines, which indicates that when symptoms persist after one month of therapy, the caregiver should consider RSD; (3) the March 12, 1999 report of Riggenbach, appellant\u2019s hand therapist, sent to Dr. Kumler, in which Riggenbach stated that appellant demonstrated all four of the cardinal signs of RSD and that stellate block injections should be considered immediately; (4) the March 15, 1999 C-9 statement of Dr. Kumler in which he indicates that appellant should undergo block treatments to arrest RSD; (5) Riggenbach\u2019s report on March 18, 1999 expressing great concern for RSD\u2019s being denied; (6) Riggenbach\u2019s March 19, 1999 telephone call to Charlene Cordle at Mount Carmel East urging appellee to approve treatment for RSD; (7) Dr. Kumler\u2019s C-9 on March 22, 1999, requesting recognition of RSD; (8) Dr. Berliner\u2019s March 24, 1999 report, in which he opined that appellant had signs of autonomic instability and expressing hope that his report would help get approval for blocks; and (9) Dr. Wolfe\u2019s April 1,1999 report, in which she stated that there was no question that appellant had RSD and that there were diagnostic tests that could be done to establish the presence of RSD, the most consistent test being a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>triple-phase bone scan, but such a test was totally unnecessary as \u201cproof\u2019 of RSD because the clinical picture was so classic and dramatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">{\u00b6 60} We see no genuine issue of material fact as to any bad faith in appellee\u2019s refusal to allow RSD until the commission approved such. With regard to Dr. Kumler\u2019s March 4,1999 office note, we agree with appellee that this office note clearly does not diagnose RSD and does express some equivocation as to whether appellant suffered from RSD. He indicated a \u201cslight concern\u201d of \u201cpossible\u201d RSD, while also indicating that the swelling did not show the smooth red skin that is typically seen with RSD. Further, although the Milliman &amp; Robertson Healthcare Guidelines may have explained the risk of RSD for those who suffer complex bone fractures, certainly they do not establish that appellant necessarily suffered from RSD. Also, the Milliman &amp; Robertson Healthcare Guidelines indicate that RSD is an \u201cuncommon\u201d complication of a fracture and that confirmation of RSD is through a bone scan, which appellant never underwent.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">{\u00b6 61} With regard to Dr. Kumler\u2019s March 15, 1999 C-9 report, Dr. Kumler stated that he was \u201cconcerned\u201d regarding RSD. This can hardly constitute a diagnosis of RSD. He also did not request the allowance of RSD in the March 15, 1999 C-9; rather, he requested only block injections. As to Dr. Kumler\u2019s March 22, 1999 request to allow RSD, appellee presented the testimony of Patricia Rutter. Her testimony was that this request was denied because no test had ever diagnosed RSD prior to the request, and she had no medical record from any doctor conclusively diagnosing such. Rutter also testified that she did not have Dr. Kumler\u2019s March 22, 1999 office notes, which included an assessment of RSD, at the time she made the decision to deny the allowance. Clearly, Ohio Adm.Code 4123-19-03(I)(5) and (K)(5) permit appellee to reject a claim for benefits that is not supported by proper medical evidence. Also, nowhere in Dr. Berliner\u2019s March 24, 1999 report did he diagnose RSD. Despite appellant\u2019s claim that Sheila Harris testified in her deposition that she believed Dr. Berliner\u2019s March 24, 1999 note confirmed RSD, Harris, in fact, did not indicate the note to which she was referring and admitted that she was not the primary administrator in appellant\u2019s claim. Further, Dr. Berliner himself explicitly testified in his deposition that prior to April 28, 1999, he was not certain appellant had RSD. Further, although Riggenbach did express her opinion several times that appellant had the classic symptoms of RSD, Riggenbach is not a licensed physician, and appellee could not rely on her diagnosis. See Ohio Adm.Code 4123-5-18(A) (compensation shall not be approved by the commission in a claim unless supported by a report of a physician duly licensed to render medical treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">{\u00b6 62} Dr. Wolfe\u2019s April 1, 1999 office note caused appellee to request that appellant undergo a bone-scan test to conclusively diagnose RSD. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Dr. Wolfe did opine that appellant had RSD, appellee was certainly permitted to request that appellant take the diagnostic test that Dr. Wolfe suggested for the first time on April 1, 1999. Appellee timely requested that appellant take such test on April 7, 1999, but appellant refused such scan because it was an invasive procedure and she had vagal response. Any such delay after that point cannot be attributed to bad faith by appellee, given appellee\u2019s reasonable desire to have some diagnostic evidence of RSD. Evidence was presented that RSD can worsen rapidly without aggressive treatment. Thirty-three days elapsed from the first mention of RSD by Dr. Kumler on March 4, 1999, until appellee requested the bone scan on April 7,1999. The relatively short period involved mitigates against any bad faith' in appellee\u2019s handling of appellant\u2019s request for an additional allowance of RSD. For the foregoing reasons, we find that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to any bad faith in appellee\u2019s refusal to allow RSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">{\u00b6 63} Appellant next argues that appellee, in bad faith, refused to provide appellant with immediate, appropriate, and necessary medical treatment. The first instance specifically cited by appellant is appellee\u2019s failure to timely and appropriately provide block injection treatments from March 4, 1999 to April 20, 1999, after all medical opinions and the Milliman &amp; Robertson Healthcare Guidelines delineated that such treatment should be instituted. On March 12, 1999, Riggenbach indicated that appellant may have RSD and advised Dr. Kumler to consider using block injections to arrest the RSD. On March 22, 1999, Dr. Kumler\u2019s request for block injections was denied. Rutter testified that the injections were denied because there had been no test or diagnosis of RSD by a doctor. However, after Dr. Wolfe\u2019s April 1,1999 report, appellee did approve one block injection on April 13, 1999, for diagnostic purposes. Appellant was given the block injection on April 20, 1999. Because appellant tolerated the injections well and because the results were inconclusive, appellee then approved two more, which appellant received on April 28 and May 5, 1999. On May 5, 1999, Dr. Kumler requested unlimited blocks, which appellee denied. However, appellee approved three blocks and requested an independent medical examination. On May 7, 1999, appellant filed a motion with the commission to allow RSD as an additional claim. At that time, appellee stated that all further treatments, including block injections, would be put on hold pending the commission\u2019s decision. Rutter testified that she then called Holy Cross and informed them that they had denied the claim but that there may be additional requests for block injections. Rutter told Holy Cross that if Holy Cross paid for more block injections and the commission eventually allowed the claim, appellee would reimburse Holy Cross for the block injections. Dr. Berliner completed three more block injections on May 14, May 20, and June 4,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>{\u00b6 64} Considering the evidence discussed above, we find that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to any bad faith by appellee in denying the block injections. As explained above, appellee denied unlimited block injections from March 4 to April 20,1999, due to the absence of a diagnosis of RSD by any doctor or test. Despite this fact, appellee did approve one treatment for diagnostic purposes during this period. We simply have no evidence of bad faith in denying the claim, and appellant fails to point us toward any. Appellee has presented a good-faith basis for denying unlimited block injections during this period. Therefore, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 65} The second instance specifically cited by appellant to demonstrate bad faith in delaying her medical treatment is appellee\u2019s termination of all treatment in appellant\u2019s claim five days after appellant filed her motion for the allowance of RSD with the commission. However, we find no genuine issue of material fact as to bad faith. Appellee, as a self-insured employer, is not required to make payment of compensation or medical benefits for an additional condition until the commission allows the condition. Ohio Adm.Code 4123-19-03(E)(5) and (E)(7). Further, appellant\u2019s argument implies that she could receive no treatment during this period. Appellee suspended only the payment of such treatment while it contested the claim, as it may legally do. Appellant specifically testified in her deposition that she visited Dr. Eumler once per month from March until June 1999. She also testified that she had daily hand therapy with her therapist, Riggenbach, from March until August 1999. Additionally, she received numerous block injections after appellee informed her that it would not pay for further medical treatments.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{1\u00cd 66} Although appellant seems to make some argument that appellee suspended all treatment, including therapy related to her original, allowed injury, she fails to explain what treatment she had been receiving that was solely related to the allowed condition and unrelated to RSD. Further, as discussed above, Rutter testified that she informed Holy Cross that there may be further medical treatment for which it would reimburse Holy Cross if the additional claim for RSD were allowed. Thus, appellant knew that, through some source, her medical bills for further treatment were going to be paid, and she continued to receive proper medical treatment. Appellee was legally permitted to cease payment for this while the RSD claim was pending with the commission. Appellee made arrangements with Holy Cross regarding payment and reimbursement. This court finds that appellant has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that appellee exhibited bad faith in terminating payments for treatments related to her nonallowed condition pending the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">{\u00b6 67} Having reviewed the record, we agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that no genuine issue of material fact exists on the issue of appellee\u2019s bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>faith in handling appellant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. There is no evidence that appellee, other than by the normal and legal course of events, caused any delays in bad faith. See <em>Hall, </em>supra, at 27, 603 N.E.2d 427. We find no evidence in the record suggesting that appellee intentionally violated Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws, acted in bad faith, or otherwise failed to pay appellant\u2019s medical bills or approve a claimed condition without reasonable justification. Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">{\u00b6 68} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s three assignments of error are overruled, and judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b369-7\">Petree and Peggy Bryant, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
