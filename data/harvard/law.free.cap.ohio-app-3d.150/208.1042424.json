Crusoe pleaded no contest to possession of cocaine, a second degree felony. He was found guilty and sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 2} On appeal, Crusoe advances the following assignment of error and issue for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence recovered by the illegal search and seizure of his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cDid the Dayton police officers violate Mr. Crusoe\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights by searching him during the execution of a search warrant when he was not identified in the warrant and the warrant did not give authority to search all people found at that location?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">{\u00b6 5} In its appellate brief, the state has not responded to Crusoe\u2019s assignment of error on the merits. Rather, it contends that the issue has been waived because it was not raised in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">{\u00b6 6} The state stood by its waiver argument when this case was orally argued but also presented brief argument on the merits. Prior to the evidentiary hearing, counsel for Crusoe stated that the issue was \u201chow the execution of the warrant is an infringement of my client\u2019s rights.\u201d In our judgment, this statement put the state and trial court on notice of the issue presented here. Indeed, the trial court stated in its decision and order denying the motion to suppress:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[T]he police procedures followed in carrying out the search warrant were warranted under these circumstances and consistent with necessary safety precautions taken by police in the execution of their duties.\u201d We conclude that Crusoe has not waived the issue he presents here.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">{\u00b6 8} Essentially, Crusoe argues that the seizure of cocaine from his pocket was accomplished only because the police exceeded their prerogative to pat him down for their personal safety. See <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">{\u00b6 9} The facts are not in dispute. The police secured a search warrant to search 1101 Riverside Dr. Apt. C and \u201c \u2018Spank/ W/M 47-50 yrs.\u201d The warrant authorized the police to search for crack cocaine, other controlled substances, and other items related to the drug trade. Crusoe was not named in the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>{\u00b6 10} In executing a search warrant, it is standard procedure for the police to order all occupants of the premises to the floor, handcuff them, and pat them down for officer safety purposes. The occupants are then placed in a room, \u201cfield interrogated,\u201d and \u201c(run) for any wants or warrants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">{\u00b6 11} When the police entered the apartment, Crusoe and one Wooliver were in the kitchen. Officer Braun dealt with Wooliver, who had a gun in his pocket, and Officer Kowalski dealt with Crusoe.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{\u00b6 12} Officer Kowalski testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cI patted him down, felt him for any objects which I recognized to be weapons, or any objects which I recognized to potentially to be in the form of containers which may contain drugs or anything such as that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTrying to recognize any indication of weapons or anything, containers, or items which I recognized to contain drugs because that is what we were there for in the search warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cWhen I did reach his right front sweat pant pocket, I felt an object, a chunky object that I did hear rustling of a plastic bag, which after more than a year of working drugs, and I also worked the street for another seven, and I recognized that to be similar to packaging which is used to package crack cocaine. I asked Mr. Crusoe what he had in his pocket. And I received no answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cOkay. Did you do the whole body before you put your hand in his right pocket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-14\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-15\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cQ. Why? Why was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-16\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cA. Well, my main concern, since we already found one loaded weapon, was to first obtain, or see if I could locate another loaded weapon on Mr. Crusoe. Since that seemed to be the pattern there in that house and also knowing that we were there for drugs, for the purpose of drugs, and drug sales coming from the house, the pat down was to recognize any, any contraband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-17\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cQ. Did you feel anything on Mr. Crusoe that indicated that anything was a weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-18\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-19\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. And is the right front pocket the only pocket you went in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"an-dedup-0\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>{\u00b6 27} \u201cQ. What other pockets did you go inside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cA. His left front pant pocket. We do his pockets that the money that was on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cQ. Okay. How many bills were there? '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cA. I have no idea how many bills there were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cQ. I mean, was it like, was it kept as a money roll? Or was it just a few loose bills?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cA. I believe in his left pocket he had the larger bills neatly folded, twenty\u2019s, ten\u2019s. In his right pocket, which is where his crack was, it was like crumpled up one dollar bills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cQ. How thick were they? In the left pocket how thick were the bills? You said they were folded up. Were they folded up like in a big large stack? Or were they more or less loose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cA. They were folded dollar bills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cQ. How many?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cA. I would have to check the inventory. I don\u2019t know for sure. I can\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cQ. Could you tell that it wasn\u2019t a weapon from patting the left pocket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cA. Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-16\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cQ. Could you tell from feeling the right pocket it wasn\u2019t a weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-17\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cA. I didn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-18\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ. You didn\u2019t know, or no, you couldn\u2019t tell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-19\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cA. Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-20\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cQ. Which is your answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-21\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cA. Well, could you repeat the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-22\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cQ. Did you know from the right pocket, from the touching of the clothes, did you \u2014 did you know that there was a weapon in there or that there was not a weapon in there? Could you tell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-23\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cA. I did not know there was a weapon in there, no. But whatever item that was, I recognized to be similar to the packaging of crack cocaine. But until that item was revealed to me, I wasn\u2019t sure what it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-24\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cQ. Okay. So what indicates to you that a person may have crack cocaine in their pockets? What do you have to observe or feel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>{\u00b6 48} \u201cA. Well, number one, when we go into a crack house, or where crack is being sold from, I know that any items which is [sic] a chunky rock type substance similar to soap, I can feel that item through a thin plastic bag through sweat pants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cWhat \u2014 how do you feel a plastic bag through the sweat pants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cA. You can hear a plastic bag through sweat pants. When you roll your fingers over it, plastic just slides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cQ. Okay. Did you hear it slide that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cA. I could hear the plastic crinkling, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cQ. What \u2014 the point here is what could a person have in their</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">pockets when you are feeling on the outside that it would indicate to you that it night [sic] not be crack cocaine? I mean, coins, a piece of paper with a telephone number on it? What could be on the person that would indicate to you that it is not crack cocaine and you would just keep going?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-12\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cA. I don\u2019t think I can really answer that fairly to \u2014 it\u2019s a judgment that I make in an instant second. I don\u2019t have a plan on that as far as knowing what item would indicate to me what is not crack cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-15\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cQ. Obviously, an empty pocket, nothing there would indicate that there is no crack cocaine there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-16\">{\u00b6 57} pocket. \u201cA. Correct. If there\u2019s an empty pocket, I would assume an empty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-17\">{\u00b6 58} correct? \u201cQ. That is, nothing there would cause you not to search any further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-18\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cA. (No verbal response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-21\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cQ. My question is what is empty \u2014 what is a person allowed to have for you to feel in their pockets before you\u2019re going to look in the pockets?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-22\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cA. I use my own discretion at the time. There\u2019s no situation \u2014 I don\u2019t have a set pattern or plan. It\u2019s a discretionary decision that I make at the moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-23\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cQ. Let me ask you, how many search warrants have you executed in your career?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-24\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cA. Probably right around a hundred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-25\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cQ. Has there been a time when you\u2019re patting someone down and you have not gone inside their pockets?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-26\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>{\u00b6 66} \u201cQ. What was different about that case than Mr. Crusoe\u2019s case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">{\u00b6 67} pockets. \u201cA. One, when there\u2019s nothing in the pockets, I don\u2019t go in the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cQ. So, that is the empty pockets. Then what else is different?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cA. I use my discretion at that moment if something is found in the pocket, discretion based on what the item feels like and what I recognize it to be. I can\u2019t answer your question any other way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cQ. When you are \u2014 I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">{\u00b6 71} \u2018When you are doing these pat downs, and you\u2019re saying you have done a hundred, has there ever been a time when you have felt something that in your discretion has not felt to you like crack cocaine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-13\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-14\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cQ. Okay. What did that feel like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-15\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cA. Paper, just an empty piece of paper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-16\">{\u00b6 75} At some point after the crack cocaine was removed from Crusoe\u2019s pocket, it was learned that th\u00e9re was an active warrant for Crusoe\u2019s arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-17\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b243-18\">{\u00b6 76} The trial court provided no explanation, other than as quoted above, for implicitly determining that the crack cocaine was lawfully seized. The state has not asserted in its brief a theory upon which the seizure can be justified. At oral argument, the state offered the \u201cplain-feel\u201d exception to the warrant requirements as justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-19\">{\u00b6 77} We believe that Crusoe is correct that the police exceeded the bounds of a lawful <em>Terry </em>search in order to seize the crack cocaine. In <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson </em>(1993), 508 U.S. 366, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334, the case that recognized the plain-feel exception to the warrant requirement, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-20\">{\u00b6 78} <em>\u201cTerry </em>further held that \u2018[w]hen an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others,\u2019 the officer may conduct a patdown search \u2018to determine whether the person is in fact carrying a weapon.\u2019 392 U.S., at 24, 88 S.Ct., at 1881 [20 L.Ed.2d 889]. \u2018The purpose of this limited search is not to discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence.... \u2019 <em>Adams [v. Williams], </em>[407 U.S. 143] <em>supra, </em>at 146, 92 S.Ct. [1921], at 1923 [32 L.Ed.2d 612], Rather, a protective search \u2014 permitted without a warrant and on the basis of reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>suspicion less than probable cause \u2014 must be strictly \u2018limited to that which is necessary for the discovery of weapons which might be used to harm the officer or others nearby.\u2019 <em>Terry, supra, </em>at 26, 88 S.Ct., at 1882 [20 L.Ed.2d 889]; see also <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1049, and 1052, n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 3480-3481, and 3482, n. 16, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983); <em>Ybarra v. Illinois, </em>444 U.S. 85, 93-94, 100 S.Ct. 338, 343-344, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979). If the protective search goes beyond what is necessary to determine if the suspect is armed, it is no longer valid under <em>Terry </em>and its fruits will be suppressed. <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 65-66, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1904, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">{\u00b6 79} \u201cThese principles were settled 25 years ago when, on the same day, the Court announced its decisions in <em>Terry </em>and <em>Sibron. </em>The question presented today is whether police officers may seize nonthreatening contraband detected during a protective patdown search of the sort permitted by <em>Terry. </em>We think the answer is clearly that they may, so long as the officers\u2019 search stays within the bounds marked by <em>Terry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 80} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 81} \u201cIf a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect\u2019s outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately apparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect\u2019s privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer\u2019s search for weapons; if the object is contraband, its warrantless seizure would be justified by the same practical considerations that inhere in the plain-view context.\u201d Id. at 373, 375-376, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">{\u00b6 82} We find no fault with the police practice of ordering the occupants of a drug house to the floor, handcuffing them, and patting them down for weapons. By his own testimony, however, the patdown Officer Kowalski did upon Crusoe exceeded what was necessary to assure Officer Kowalski that Crusoe was not armed. Indeed, by his own testimony, Officer Kowalski was looking for drugs as well as weapons. Furthermore, it is not demonstrated by Officer Kowalski\u2019s testimony that the identity of the object in Crusoe\u2019s pocket as crack cocaine was immediately apparent to Officer Kowalski upon his touching Crusoe\u2019s pocket. Thus, the seizure of the cocaine cannot be justified on the authority of <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">{\u00b6 83} Nor on this record can the seizure be justified on the strength of the inevitable discovery doctrine. In <em>Nix v. Williams </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 431, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 81 L.Ed.2d 377, the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>{\u00b6 84} \u201cIf the prosecution can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the information ultimately or inevitably would have been discovered by lawful means \u2014 here the volunteers\u2019 search \u2014 then the deterrence rationale has so little basis that the evidence should be received.\u201d Id. at 444, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 81 L.Ed.2d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 85} Here, there was an outstanding warrant for Crusoe\u2019s arrest, which would have justified a search incident to arrest pursuant to that arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">{\u00b6 86} The state did not attempt to establish that the police would have ultimately or inevitably discovered the cocaine had Crusoe been searched incident to an arrest pursuant to the arrest warrant. Nor does the state argue inevitable discovery on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">{\u00b6 87} On similar facts, the trial court in <em>State v. Lynch </em>(June 6, 1998), Montgomery App. No. 17028, 1998 WL 288936, determined that \u201cthere (was) insufficient evidence that (drugs \u2014 described as \u2018small and easily moveable\u2019) would have been ultimately and inevitably discovered in the absence of police misconduct, as Defendant could have relocated them or otherwise disposed of them.\u201d We deferred to the trial court\u2019s discretion in making that finding and affirmed the order of suppression. In the absence of any evidence that the police would have ultimately or inevitably discovered the crack cocaine through a search incident to Crusoe\u2019s arrest on the arrest warrant, the seizure cannot be justified on the authority of <em>Nix v. Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">{\u00b6 88} The assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">{\u00b6 89} The judgment will be reversed, and this matter will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-11\">Fain and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
