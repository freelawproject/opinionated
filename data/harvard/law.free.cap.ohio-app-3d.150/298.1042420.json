Foster, to increase appellant\u2019s child support obligation. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-17\">{\u00b6 2} The parties were married and had two children together, Brandon, born August 1, 1992, and Kelsie, born October 10, 1995. The parties\u2019 marriage was terminated by decree of dissolution filed in September 1998. Pursuant to an agreed shared-parenting plan, appellant\u2019s monthly child support obligation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>fixed at $325 per child, per month. Appellant was allocated both dependency tax exemptions for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">{\u00b6 3} In February 2001, appellee filed a motion with the trial court requesting that appellant\u2019s child support obligation be increased and that she be allocated the dependency tax exemption for one of the children. Appellee alleged that both parties\u2019 incomes had risen and that she now incurred a significant child care expense as a result of her work schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">{\u00b6 4} At a hearing on the motion, appellee presented evidence that she is employed by Kemper Sports Management as an office manager. She earns $10.75 per hour, works 40 hours per week, and receives no overtime pay or bonuses. Extrapolated, her yearly income is $22,360. Due to her full-time employment, appellee incurs a yearly child care expense of $6,100.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant\u2019s income was not so easily ascertainable, since he is self-employed in the auto repair business. Together with a 50 percent partner, he owned Mt. Healthy Auto Body Shop, Inc., an \u201cS\u201d corporation, and S <em>&amp; </em>K Properties LLC, a limited liability corporation. While he submitted his 1998, 1999, and 2000 personal tax returns to the court, he redacted his gross income from the 1999 and 2000 forms. The trial court thus looked to the corporate tax returns to determine appellant\u2019s income. The trial court attributed to appellant one half of the amount reportedly paid to corporate officers, and added to this one half of the depreciation deduction claimed by both the corporations. The trial court also determined that appellant had recurring property distributions from the corporations and included this amount in his yearly income as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">{\u00b6 6} At the time of the hearing, appellant had sold his interest in both corporations to his partner. Appellant anticipated opening a new, franchised auto repair business in Lebanon. Following the advice of his accountant, appellant planned to reduce his yearly salary to $30,000 for the first several years of the shop\u2019s operation. The trial court concluded that to the extent appellant\u2019s income was reduced, it was done so voluntarily, and refused to use this lower figure when determining appellant\u2019s child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">{\u00b6 7} Upon considering the foregoing evidence, the trial court granted appel-lee\u2019s motion in part. Averaging appellant\u2019s income over the three prior years, the trial court determined that his yearly income, for purposes of determining child support, was $72,893.67, and increased appellant\u2019s monthly child support obligation to $632.77 per child, per month. However, the trial court declined to reallocate the dependency tax exemptions, finding that appellant would receive the greater tax benefit from the deductions. Appellant appeals the trial court\u2019s decision, raising three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred in affirming the magistrate\u2019s decision as the decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence and it did not consider evidence in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">{\u00b6 9} We first note that it is well settled that a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to modify child support will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Booth v. Booth </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 142, 144, 541 N.E.2d 1028. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of law or judgment; rather, it implies that the decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant contends that the calculation of his child support obligation was made in error because the trial court failed to consider his year 2000 IRS form W-2 entered into evidence. Rather, the trial court specifically found that appellant failed to submit his W-2 forms for 1999 or 2000. Appellant contends that the income indicated on his W-2 form definitively establishes his yearly income and that the trial court erred by not using this figure when calculating his child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">{\u00b6 11} Appellee concedes that the trial court erroneously stated that appellant failed to submit his 2000 W-2 into evidence when he had in fact done so. However, appellee submits that the trial court\u2019s failure to consider appellant\u2019s 2000 W-2 does not constitute an abuse of discretion. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">{\u00b6 12} When determining a parent\u2019s income for purposes of calculating child support, the trial court must verify the income \u201cwith suitable documents, including, but not limited to, paystubs, employer statements, receipts and expense vouchers related to self-generated income, tax returns, and all supporting documentation and schedules for the tax returns.\u201d R.C. 3119.05.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Federal and state tax documents provide a proper starting point to calculate a parent\u2019s income, but they are not the sole factor for the trial court to consider. See <em>Houts v. Houts </em>(1995), 99 Ohio App.3d 701, 706, 651 N.E.2d 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">{\u00b6 13} In many cases, income for child support purposes is not equivalent to the parent\u2019s taxable income. See <em>Helfrich v. Helfrich </em>(Sept. 17, 1996), Franklin App. No. 95APF12-1599, 1996 WL 532185. R.C. 3119.01 defines \u201cincome\u201d for purpose of calculating child support, as \u201ceither of the following: (a) For a parent who is employed to full capacity, the gross income of the parent; (b) For a parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>who is unemployed or underemployed, the sum of the gross income of the parent and any potential income of the parent.\u201d R.C. 3119.01(C)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cGross income\u201d is defined by statute as \u201cthe total of all earned and unearned income from all sources during a calendar year, whether or not the income is taxable, and includes income from salaries, wages, overtime pay, and bonuses to the extent described in division (D) of section 3119.05 of the Revised Code; commissions; royalties; tips; rents; dividends; severance pay; pensions; interest; trust income; annuities; social security benefits, including retirement, disability, and survivor benefits that are not means-tested; workers\u2019 compensation benefits; unemployment insurance benefits; * * * and all other sources of income. \u2018Gross income\u2019 includes * * * self-generated income; and potential cash flow from any source.\u201d R.C. 3119.01(C)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b6 15} At trial, appellant was less than forthright about his annual income. He provided the trial court with income tax returns for the years 1999 and 2000, yet redacted those portions of the returns that refer to his gross income. While appellant argues that the references to his gross income were redacted in order to prevent disclosure of his present wife\u2019s income, the redaction effectively precluded the trial court from determining his gross income. The trial court was then left to examine the other evidence before it to determine appellant\u2019s gross income. Looking at the tax returns of Mt. Healthy Auto Body, the trial court observed that the corporation paid compensation to its two officers totaling $83,660. S &amp; K Properties did not compensate the corporate officers during these years. The trial court allocated one half of the compensation by Mt. Healthy Auto Body to appellant, one of two corporate officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">{\u00b6 16} While the trial court did not consider appellant\u2019s 2000 form W-2, its determination of appellant\u2019s income is supported by other evidence in the record. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when determining the amount of appellant\u2019s gross income for child support purposes. The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe trial court erred in calculating child support where it included the full amount of depreciation expenses of Mt. Health [sic] Auto Body, Inc. without regard to the nature of the depreciation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">{\u00b6 18} In his second assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by attributing to him one half of the depreciation deductions for both Mt. Healthy Auto Body, Inc. and S <em>&amp; </em>K Properties, LLC. The corporate tax returns indicate that both corporations took depreciation deductions in 1998, 1999, and 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>{\u00b6 19} When determining the gross income of a self-employed parent, the trial court is to deduct ordinary and necessary expenses from the parent\u2019s gross receipts. Pursuant to R.C. 3119.01(C)(9)(b), ordinary and necessary expenses \u201c[do] not include depreciation expenses and other noncash items that are allowed as deductions on any federal tax return of the parent or the parent\u2019s business,\u201d except as \u201cspecifically included in \u2018ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in generating gross receipts\u2019 by division (C)(9)(a) of this section[.]\u201d R.C. 3119.01(C)(9)(a) defines ordinary and necessary expenses as \u201cactual cash items expended * * * and includes depreciation expenses of business equipment.\u201d The exclusion of other types of depreciation deductions \u201cis designed to ensure that a parent\u2019s gross income is not reduced by any sum that was not actually expended in the year used for computing child support.\u201d <em>Bam v. Bam </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 781, 784, 596 N.E.2d 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">{\u00b6 20} Appellant contends that the depreciation expenses incurred by the corporations in 1998, 1999, and 2000 are attributable solely to business equipment items, such as desks, chairs, cabinets, and computers, and expensed as actual cash items for those years. Thus appellant concludes that the trial court erred by considering the depreciation as a noncash expense under R.C. 3119.01(C)(9)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 21} Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the record does not indicate that the items for which the depreciation deductions were taken represent actual cash expenses incurred in the year in which the deductions were claimed. Appellant testified that the deductions for S &amp; K Properties were for building depreciation while at least a portion of the Mt. Healthy Auto Body deductions were related to building improvements when the shop was first purchased. He also testified that the deductions reflect depreciation for office equipment and shop tools and equipment, but did not testify that the actual cash expenditures were made in the tax years in which the deductions were claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant\u2019s accountant, Steven Potter, testified that Mt. Healthy Auto Body took a \u201cSection 179\u201d expense deduction of $7,947 in 2000 for computers and office furniture purchased that year. According to Potter, the total depreciation deduction claimed that year by Mt. Healthy Auto Body was $24,317. Review of the magistrate\u2019s decision reveals that the trial court excluded the $7,947 depreciation deduction for ordinary and necessary expenses when determining the total depreciation deduction attributable to appellant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Potter\u2019s testimony otherwise confirms that the depreciation deductions were not based on actual cash expenses during the reporting tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>{\u00b6 23} The type of items for which some of the depreciation deductions were taken may be considered necessary and ordinary expenses. However, the actual cash expense must be incurred in the same tax year in order to exclude the depreciation deduction from the calculation of gross receipts under R.C. 3119.01(C)(9)(b). Absent evidence that the depreciation deduction represents actual cash expenses incurred in the year that the deduction was taken, R.C. 3119.01(C)(9) mandates that the depreciation deduction be included in the parent\u2019s gross income for that year. See, also, <em>Baus, </em>72 Ohio App.3d at 784, 596 N.E.2d 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 24} Upon review of the record, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by including one half of the depreciation deductions when calculating appellant\u2019s gross income. The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Assignment of Error No. 3</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that the property distributions received by Mr. Foster in 1998, 1999, and 2000 are includable as income in computing child support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">{\u00b6 26} Appellant received property distributions from Mt. Healthy Auto Body and/or S &amp; K Properties in 1998,1999, and 2000. The trial court found that these distributions were a source of recurring income since appellant \u201cconsistently received such distributions.\u201d The trial court accordingly included the distribu- \u25a0 tions in appellant\u2019s gross income for each corresponding year.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">{\u00b6 27} Under R.C. 3119.01(C)(7), nonrecurring income is excluded from a parent\u2019s yearly gross income when calculating child support. \u201cNonrecurring income\u201d is defined as \u201can income or cash flow item the parent receives in any year or for any number of years not to exceed three years that the parent does not expect to continue to receive on a regular basis.\u201d R.C. 3119.01(C)(8). Our review of the record confirms that appellant consistently received cash distributions, not reflected on his W-2, from Mt. Healthy Auto Body and S &amp; K Properties. We therefore find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant could expect to receive such distributions in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">{\u00b6 28} Appellant argues that he can no longer expect to receive the yearly distributions because he has sold his interest in both corporations. The trial court considered this fact and found that appellant was voluntarily underemployed to the extent that he chose to lower his income in the immediate future.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">{\u00b6 29} The determination that a parent is voluntarily underemployed will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Rock v. Cabral </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 108, 112, 616 N.E.2d 218. The record indicates that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>voluntarily sold his interest in the two corporations in order to pursue a new business opportunity, one that he hopes will be even more lucrative than his prior ventures. However, the immediate effect of appellant\u2019s decision is to reduce his annual income by more than $30,000. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding appellant voluntarily underemployed. Accord <em>Woloch v. Foster </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 806, 649 N.E.2d 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b335-6\">Powell and William W. Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-11\">. In analyzing the motion, the trial court applied R.C. Chapter 3119, which replaced R.C. Chapter 3113, repealed March 22, 2001. Neither party argues that the new statute was applied in error. Accordingly we will review the assignments of error applying R.C. Chapter 3119.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b333-8\">. The trial court added a total of $10,815 to appellant\u2019s 2000 gross income for depreciation deductions. This figure is derived by subtracting $7,947 from the $24,317 depreciation deduction claimed by Mt. Healthy Auto Body, dividing it in half, and adding to it half of the depreciation deduction claimed by S &amp; K Properties, $5,260.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
