Metz and Albert T. Brown Jr. as counsel for a medical malpractice lawsuit filed against a doctor and others for injuries suffered by their daughter, Tesha Lanae Thompson, at her birth. The Thompsons executed a contingency-fee agreement dated January 24, 1997, whereby counsel would receive certain percentages of any amount recovered by the Thompsons, if litigation progressed beyond identified milestones. The remuneration percentages ranged from thirty-three and one-third percent to forty-five percent of the total recovery by the Thompsons. The Thompsons were also responsible for their counsel\u2019s trial-preparation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">{\u00b6 2} Before the malpractice lawsuit progressed to trial, the defendants offered a certain sum of money as a total settlement of all the Thompsons\u2019 claims. At that time, Donald Thompson filed an application for appointment as guardian of the estate of his daughter in the probate court, as well as an application to settle his daughter\u2019s claims in the medical malpractice lawsuit. The settlement application included a request for attorney fees in an amount that was forty percent of the total proffered settlement amount and that also included reimbursement for trial-preparation expenses. Donald Thompson attached to his settlement application copies of the contingency-fee agreement, the trial-preparation expenses, and a report from the child\u2019s neurologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">{\u00b6 3} The probate court appointed Donald Thompson as guardian of his daughter\u2019s estate on January 11, 2001. The probate court then approved the settlement in the full amount proposed and ordered the payment of counsel\u2019s trial-preparation expenses. But the probate court then ordered as payment for attorney fees an amount that was only thirty-three and one-third percent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>settlement amount, rather than the forty percent that had been proposed by Donald Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">{\u00b6 4} In its opinion on the issue of attorney fees, the probate court held that it had ordered only thirty-three and one-third percent of the settlement as attorney fees because Donald Thompson had not sought prior court authorization to proceed with the settlement. The probate court noted that Sup.R. 71(1) required that the application for authority to settle the child\u2019s claims be filed before the fiduciary entered into a contingency-fee contract with an attorney for legal services. The probate court noted that its Loc.R. 71.2 required the court\u2019s approval of an application for authority to enter into a contingency-fee agreement before such an agreement was executed. The probate court also noted that its approval would not have been required had the contingency-fee agreement not exceeded thirty-three and one-third percent of the total recovery. The probate court noted that, in the absence of prior court approval, Loe.R. 71.2(C) set a maximum attorney fee of thirty-three and one-third percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 5} Metz filed various post-judgment motions, including a motion for reconsideration of the probate court\u2019s ruling on attorney fees and a motion to declare Sup.R. 71 and Loc.R. 71.2 unconstitutional. Metz also appealed the probate court\u2019s judgment to this court. This court then granted a limited stay of the appeal and remanded the matter to the probate court \u201cfor the sole purpose of permitting said court to consider and determine the various post judgment motions filed therein.\u201d Following the remand, the probate court denied Metz\u2019s motion for reconsideration. This court then lifted the stay on the appeal. Metz now raises four assignments of error. His is the only brief before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">{\u00b6 6} In his first assignment of error, Metz argues that the probate court erred by denying attorney fees in an amount equaling forty percent of the total settlement amount. This court will not reverse the probate court\u2019s determination of an appropriate fee award absent a showing of an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 7} Sup.R. 71(1) provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cPrior to a fiduciary entering into a contingent fee contract with an attorney for services, an application for authority to enter into the fee contract shall be filed with the court, unless otherwise ordered by local court rule. The contingent fee on the amount obtained shall be subject to approval by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Metz argues that the contingency-fee agreement in this case was executed on January 24, 1997, nine months before Sup.R. 71'became effective.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, Metz argues, \u201cat that time, there was no requirement to obtain court authorization to enter the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">{\u00b6 9} Metz is correct that Sup.R. 71 was not effective until after the Thompsons had executed the contingency-fee agreement. But Metz ignores that former C.P.Sup.R. 40 was in effect at the time the fee contract was executed, and that the former rule was analogous to Sup.R. 71.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Former C.P.Sup.R. 40(H) provided, in part, \u201cPrior to a fiduciary entering into a contingent fee contract with an attorney for services, an application for authority to enter into the agreement shall be filed with the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 10} We reject Metz\u2019s contention that the probate court was required to follow the terms of the contingency-fee agreement in this case, where no application for authority to enter into the agreement had been approved by the court. Even if Sup.R. 71 was not effective until October 1997, because the prior rule was of similar import, Metz should have brought the contingency-fee contract to the probate court\u2019s attention prior to January 11, 2001. Moreover, even if a contingency-fee contract had been approved by the probate court, the probate court would still have had jurisdiction to look into the reasonableness of the approved fee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">{\u00b6 11} Furthermore, R.C. 2111.18 provides that a guardian of the estate of a ward may settle a claim for personal injury \u201cwith the advice, approval, and consent of the probate court.\u201d The Ohio Supreme Court has held that a probate court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the entire amount of settlement funds, which includes attorney fees to be drawn therefrom.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">{\u00b6 12} Metz next argues that the probate court in this case failed to review the reasonableness of the attorney fees as required by Sup.R. 71(A), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Loc.R. 71.2(A), and DR 2-106. We agree that such a review was not conducted by the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">{\u00b6 13} DR 2-106, provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(A) A lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(B) A fee is clearly excessive when, after a review of the facts, a lawyer of ordinary prudence would be left with a definite and firm conviction that the fee is in excess of a reasonable fee. Factors to be considered as guides in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(2) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(3) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(4) The amount involved and the results obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(5) The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-12\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(6) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-13\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(7) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-14\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(8) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cAlthough it is true that in most cases a contingent fee agreement between the parties should be upheld, the foregoing statutes and rules establish that the probate court is not bound by a prior agreement of the parties, and in fact, where necessary the probate court may intervene to alter the fee. In all cases, the probate court must \u2018look at all the evidence to determine the reasonable value of an attorney [sic] services.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-16\">{\u00b6 25} This court has previously remanded cases because, in determining the amount of attorney fees, the probate court had failed to determine reasonableness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Similarly, in this case, the record does not demonstrate that the probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>court addressed the reasonableness of the attorney fees. Therefore, we must reverse the judgment of the court and remand this matter to allow the probate court to thoroughly review all of the evidence presented in order to determine the reasonable value of the attorneys\u2019 services in light of DR 2-106. Metz\u2019s first assignment of error is well taken and is accordingly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">{\u00b6 26} In his second and third assignments of error, which are presented together, Metz argues that the probate court erred by failing to declare Sup.R. 71 unconstitutional as applied, and that Sup.R. 71 and Loc.R. 71.2 violate Section 10, Article I of the United States Constitution. That provision states, in part, \u201cNo State shall * * * pass any * * * Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts * * Metz argues that Sup.R. 71 and Loc.R. 71.2 violate the Contracts Clause of the United States Constitution to the extent that the rules purport to void a contract for legal representation that is otherwise in compliance with DR 2-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">{\u00b6 27} Initially, we note that we have already concluded under the first assignment of error that we cannot say that there was any compliance with DR 2-106, because the probate court failed to consider DR 2-106 in evaluating the reasonableness of the attorney fees. Moreover, under Section 5, Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, the Supreme Court of Ohio has general superintendence over all courts in the state, with the power to prescribe rules governing practice and procedure within the courts. And a common pleas court has inherent power to make reasonable rules governing practice and procedure where such rules do not conflict with the Constitution or with any valid statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Clearly, the probate court recognized that attorney fees were owed under the contract, limited itself to reviewing the amount, and did not void Metz\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\"> {\u00b6 28} In light of specific legislative enactments permitting a probate court to review attorney fees, for example, R.C. 2111.18 and R.C. 2113.36, any argument that the probate court was without inherent power to review the amount of the contingent attorney fee is meritless. All legislative enactments enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Metz\u2019s bare assertion that he suffered constitutional deprivations is not enough to overcome the presumption of constitutionality. Moreover, \u201c \u2018If an argument exists that can support this assignment of error, it is not this court\u2019s duty to root it out.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> With regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Metz\u2019s claimed ex post facto violation, the Ohio Supreme Court has noted that the United States Supreme Court views this constitutional protection to be applicable in criminal matters.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">{\u00b6 29} Thus, we cannot agree with Metz that Sup.R. 71 is unconstitutional as applied to him or that it, along with Loc.R. 71.2, violates provisions of the United States Constitution. Accordingly, Metz\u2019s second and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">{\u00b6 30} In the fourth assignment of error, Metz alleges that the probate court\u2019s award of fees violated public policy. He cites no legal authorities for this proposition. \u201cPublic policy is a legal principle which declares that no one can lawfully do that which has a tendency to be injurious to the public welfare. The principle must be applied with caution and limited to those circumstances patently within the reasons upon which the doctrine rests.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In general, parties of equal bargaining power are free to enter into any agreement the terms of which are enforceable by law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But, as Metz must surely realize, that freedom is, in fact, on occasion actually limited by public-policy reasons.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> With regard to alleged constitutional violations, on occasion the Ohio Supreme Court has allowed rational restrictions on an individual\u2019s right guaranteed under the Ohio Constitution, without violating that right.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, in the complete absence of citation to any legal authorities as required by App.R. 16(A)(7),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Metz has not persuaded this court that the circumstances before us are such that the probate court\u2019s reduction of the attorney fees violated public policy. Accordingly, Metz\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>{\u00b6 31} For the reasons given in our response to the first assignment of error, the judgment of the probate court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with law and with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-6\">Doan, P.J., and Hildebrandt, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">.
