For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">{\u00b6 2} On or about October 27, 1999, plaintiff-appellee Pamela J. Brown\u2019s husband, Thomas Ellis Brown, died in an automobile accident. At the time of his death, Mr. Brown was employed at Wang Global. Appellant provided life insurance coverage to employees of Wang Global. At the time of his death, Mr. Brown was covered under appellant\u2019s Accidental Death Benefit policy. As spouse and beneficiary under Mr. Brown\u2019s policy, appellee attempted to collect death benefits from appellant. The policy provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-15\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cSECTION II - EXCLUSIONS &amp; LIMITATIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-16\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cA. A loss shall not be a Covered Loss if it is caused by, contributed to, or resulted from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-17\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c1. Suicide, attempted suicide, or a purposeful self-inflicted wound;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-18\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-19\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cC. No benefits will be paid for a Covered Loss contributed to, either directly or indirectly, by a Covered Person\u2019s being:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>{\u00b6 8} \u201c1. under the influence of any controlled substance, unless such controlled substance was prescribed by a physician and taken in accordance with the prescribed dosage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">{\u00b6 9} Mr. Brown\u2019s policy also provided for enhanced benefits paid to the beneficiary \u201cwhich equals 10% of the Principal Sum up to a maximum $10,000.\u201d However, such enhanced benefit will not be paid \u201cif the driver of the automobile in which the Insured was riding was either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c1. intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201ca. An Insured will be conclusively presumed to be intoxicated if the level of alcohol in his/her blood exceeds the amount at which a person is presumed, under the law of the locale in which the accident occurred, to be intoxicated if operating a motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">{\u00b6 12} Karen Doyle, Senior Claims Specialist of Zurich American Insurance, was assigned to Mr. Brown\u2019s claim. Doyle reviewed the police report, Mr. Brown\u2019s death certificate, and the toxicology report. On April 7, 2000, Doyle informed appellee that her claim was denied because Mr. Brown had a blood-alcohol content of 0.16, and the fatal accident was a result of Mr. Brown\u2019s intoxication, which was not accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">{\u00b6 13} On September 13, 2000, appellee filed a complaint against appellant, alleging bad faith and breach of contract. On November 3, 2000, appellee filed a motion for default judgment alleging that appellant failed to plead or otherwise defend. On November 14, 2000, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion, and set the matter for a damage hearing before a magistrate on January 25, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">{\u00b6 14} At the January 25, 2001 hearing, appellee was present and represented by counsel; however, appellant failed to appear. On March 12, 2001, the magistrate issued her decision awarding appellee $54,000 in compensatory damages, $300,000 in punitive damages, and $118,000 in attorney fees, plus $225 in court costs. Appellant did not file objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">{\u00b6 15} On April 3, 2001, the trial court approved and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision entering final judgment in favor of appellee against appellant in the amount of $472,000 with interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum, and court costs in the amount of $225. Also on April 3, 2001, appellee filed a motion for prejudgment interest. On April 17, 2001, the trial court referred the case to an evidentiary hearing for June 5, 2001, on appellee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">{\u00b6 16} On April 19, 2001, appellant filed a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment claiming excusable neglect. On May 4, 2001, appellee filed a memorandum opposing appellant\u2019s motion. The matter was assigned to a magistrate on June 25, 2001, for a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion. The hearing was continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>July 3, 2001, at which time all parties were present at the hearing and represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">{\u00b6 17} In a decision rendered on December 4, 2001, the magistrate denied appellant\u2019s motion for relief from judgment, holding that appellant failed to demonstrate entitlement to relief. No objections were filed to the magistrate\u2019s decision. On January 14, 2002, the trial court approved and adopted the December 4, 2001 decision of the magistrate. Appellant appeals, assigning the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cFirst Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in holding that the named defendant is not entitled to relief from judgment for failure to demonstrate excusable neglect where the uncontroverted evidence demonstrated that the summons and complaint served on appellant were lost in the mailroom and never made it to the attention of any individual with the capacity to respond on behalf of the appropriate company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cSecond Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in holding that a company answering on behalf of the named defendant could not demonstrate that \u2018Zurich US\u2019 is not a legal entity where a party moving for relief from judgment need only allege a meritorious defense, not prove it will prevail on the defense, and where the trial court did not consider vacating the judgment as void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThird Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe trial court decision is void to the extent that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over appellee\u2019s bad faith and punitive damages claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">{\u00b6 24} Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are interrelated and, as such, will be addressed together. In its first and second assignments of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in holding that appellant was not entitled to relief pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B). Specifically, in its first assignment of error, appellant argues that it properly demonstrated excusable neglect in that the appropriate person at Zurich American did not receive notice of the summons and complaint. Additionally, in the second assignment of error, appellant alleges that it properly alleged a meritorious defense by asserting that \u201cZurich US\u201d is merely a trade name and not an entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">{\u00b6 25} Without reaching the merits of appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error, we note that although appellee has not argued that appellant has waived its right to appeal, appellant failed to file objections to the magistrate\u2019s December 4, 2001 decision denying its Civ.R. 60(B) motion. Objections to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>a magistrate\u2019s decision must be filed within 14 days of the filing of the decision of the magistrate. Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(a). If a party fails to file written objections, the trial court may adopt the decision of the magistrate, unless the trial court determines that there is an error of law or other defect on the face of the magistrate\u2019s decision. Civ.R. 53(E)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">{\u00b6 26} Here, the magistrate rendered the decision on December 4, 2001. Appellant had until December 18, 2001, to file objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. However, appellant failed to do so. The trial court approved and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision on January 14, 2002. A party who does not file written objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision may not raise on appeal issues on the merits that might have been the basis of the objections. <em>Clendenen v. Fannin Realty, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-1295, 2002-Ohio-4548, at \u00b6 17, 2002 WL 2025117; <em>McBroom v. Bob-Boyd Lincoln Mercury, Inc. </em>(Oct. 22, 1998), Franklin App. No. 98AP-229, 1998 WL 734702. See, also, Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(b) (\u201cA party shall not assign as error on appeal the court\u2019s adoption of any finding of fact or conclusion of law unless the party has objected to that finding or conclusion under this rule\u201d); <em>Metcalf v. Winnen </em>(1985), 21 Ohio App.3d 174, 21 OBR 185, 487 N.E.2d 351, paragraph one of the syllabus (where the defendants and their attorney fail to attend a hearing before a referee, and then fail to file objections to the referee\u2019s report which is subsequently adopted by the trial court, they are precluded from raising issues on the merits of the case on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">{\u00b6 27} This court, in construing Civ.R. 53, has \u201cheld that the failure to file objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision under Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(b) constitutes the waiver of the right to appellate review \u2018of all but plain error.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Montgomery </em>(Oct. 28, 1999), Franklin App. No. 99-749, 1999 WL 1126441, quoting <em>Federal Prop. Mgt. v. Brown </em>(June 25, 1999), Montgomery App. No. 17424, 1999 WL 961275. In appeals of civil cases, the plain error doctrine is not favored and may be applied only in the extremely rare case involving exceptional circumstances where error seriously affects the basic fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process itself. <em>Goldfuss v. Davidson </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 679 N.E.2d 1099, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">{\u00b6 28} Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(b) provides appellant with the mechanism to raise its Civ.R. 60(B) merit issues before the trial court. Appellant failed to utilize this method by not filing objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. \u201cAs <em>Goldfuss </em>makes clear, plain error is to be used very sparingly and would not be warranted in the absence of circumstances raising something more than a mere failure to object.\u201d <em>R.G. Real Estate Holding, Inc. v. Wagner </em>(Apr. 24, 1998), Montgomery App. No. 16737, 1998 WL 199628. This case does not present any exceptional circumstances where the trial court\u2019s adoption of the magistrate\u2019s decision affects \u201cthe basic fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process.\u201d Id. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>we recognize that appellant can move to have the default judgment set aside under Civ.R. 60(B)(1) and (5) after the time for appeal has run pursuant to the requirements set forth in <em>GTE Automatic Elec., Inc. v. ARC Industries, Inc. </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 146,1 O.O.3d 86, 351 N.E.2d 113, we do not reach the merits of appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error due to its failure to comply with Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(b). Therefore, the trial court did not err in approving and adopting the decision of the magistrate. Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are not well taken and are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">{\u00b6 29} In its third assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over appellee\u2019s causes of action for bad faith and punitive damages pursuant to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). Appellant contends that \u201c \u2018[t]here is no dispute that the plan at issue in this dispute is an ERISA plan governed by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\u2019 \u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief, 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">{\u00b6 30} ERISA, Section 1001 et seq., Title 29, U.S.Code, is a comprehensive statutory scheme to regulate pension and retirement benefits. <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 85, 90, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 77 L.Ed.2d 490. \u201cThe policy behind Congress\u2019 enactment of ERISA\u2019s comprehensive and uniform regulation of employee benefit plans was to prevent employer abuse in the denial of benefits under the plans, and to guarantee the safety and well-being of all employee beneficiaries of private retirement and welfare benefit plans. Section 1001, Title 29, U.S.Code.\u201d <em>Eichner v. Celtic Life Ins. Co. </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 281, 282, 596 N.E.2d 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">{\u00b6 31} ERISA broadly preempts state law relating to employee benefit plans. <em>Richland Hosp., Inc. v. Ralyon </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 87, 91, 516 N.E.2d 1236. While federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over ERISA claims for breach of fiduciary duty, state courts have concurrent jurisdiction with federal courts over ERISA claims to recover benefits due under the terms of the employee benefit plan, to enforce rights under the plan, and to clarify rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan. Id. at 92, 516 N.E.2d 1236. Thus, as long as state courts apply federal law, they may award benefits due under ERISA plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">{\u00b6 32} In this case, the affirmative defense of the ERISA preemption issue raised by appellant is not jurisdictional in nature but a matter of choice of law. <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux </em>(1987), 481 U.S. 41, 56, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (\u201call suits brought by beneficiaries or participants asserting improper processing of claims under ERISA-regulated plans be treated as federal questions governed by \u00a7 502[a]\u201d). Therefore, the issue must be raised in a timely manner (prior to trial), or it is waived for purposes of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>{\u00b6 33} We observe that appellant failed to set forth the ERISA preemption argument in a timely manner. While appellant raised the issue in its Civ.R. 60(B) motion, appellant failed to preserve the issue. Issues not presented for consideration before the trial court will not be entertained by this court. See <em>State ex rel. Woltz v. Columbus </em>(Oct. 10, 1991), Franklin App. No. 91AP-576, 1991 WL 224160 (failure to plead an affirmative defense when the defense has not been incorporated into the pleadings before final resolution of the lawsuit constitutes a waiver of the defense); Civ.R. 8(C) (in pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively any matter constituting an affirmative defense). Therefore, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error lacks merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">{\u00b6 34} Based on the foregoing, appellant\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b142-7\">Brown and Harsha, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b142-8\">William H.
