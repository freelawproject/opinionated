ORS 164.045. The three-year Statute of Limitations of ORS 131.125(5) had run. Nevertheless, the state argued that the limitation period was subject to ORS 131.125(6)(a), because the indictment alleged that defendant had breached a fiduciary duty that he owed the victims. Defendant filed a demurrer to the indictment, which the trial court sustained. The state appeals and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">ORS 131.125(6)(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">\u201cIf the offense has as <em>a material element either fraud or the breach of a fiduciary obligation, </em>prosecution may be commenced within one year after discovery of the offense by an aggrieved party * * * and who is not a party to the offense * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In <em>State v. Mills, </em>77 Or App 125, 711 P2d 209 (1985), we interpreted the \u201cmaterial elements\u201d of a crime to be those elements that must be proved to obtain a valid conviction. 77 Or App at 129. Although the indictment alleges that defendant breached a fiduciary obligation to the victims, a fiduciary obligation is not a material element of the crime of theft, which can be proved without evidence of fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty. Therefore, ORS 131.125(6)(a) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
