(Stats. 1867-68, p. 107.)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-16\">But there is no finding in the record that the lands in controtroversy are upon or within the \u201c town site \u201d of <em>Red Bluff, </em>or that the lands in controversy, or any lands, were ever entered by the county judge of Tehama \u201c under Acts of Congress and instructions of the Department of the Interior,\u201d or otherwise; or any finding of other facts showing that the county judge ever acquired or held the title to the lots in dispute, or could legally convey the title therein or thereto to Henry Wasson, or to any other person. Nor is there any finding that the defendant is the owner, or entitled to the possession, or that he has any right in or to the lands, except that derived from the county judge through the certificate aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Morrison, C.
