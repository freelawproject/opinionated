The .exception in favor of Sundays relates to the daily publishing of the notice, and not to the period of time during which the publication is to be continued.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-14\">This decision is in no manner overruled or modified by <em>People </em>v. <em>McCain, </em>50 Cal. 211, cited by appellant, but is in accordance with it.

Article vii of the complaint avers (and the plaintiff is concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>by the averment), that the city council passed a resolution ordering the work on the 3rd day of March, 1874, and published an invitation for sealed proposals for five days in the \u201c Oakland Daily News,\u201d beginning on the 4th day of March, 1874. The 4th day of March, 1874, was Wednesday, and the fifth day for publication of the resolution was Monday. On the 9th day of March the award was made to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\">Section 5 of the Act of April 4th, 1864 (see Stats. 1863-64, p. 333), requires that a notice inviting sealed proposals shall be published for five days in a daily paper to be designated by the council. And by subdivision 6 of \u00a7 24 of the same act, it is provided that \u201c the publication of notices required by the provisions of the act shall be published daily (Sundays excepted) in a newspaper to be designated by the city council of said city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Excluding Sunday from the five days required for the publication, the last publication should have been made on Monday, the 9th day of March. It does not appear that any publication was made on that day, and if it was, the award on the 9th was premature. <em>(The People of the City etc. </em>v. <em>McCain, </em>50 Cal. 210; <em>Same </em>v. <em>Mc</em>Cain, 51 id. 360; Pol.
