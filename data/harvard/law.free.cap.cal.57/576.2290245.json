It cites <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Clement, </em>10 Barn. <em>&amp; </em>C. 472; and. also cites from the decision in Cro. Eliz. 496 : <em>\u201c </em>My enemy is an extortionist. Though the words are alleged to have been spoken of the plaintiff, the Court says it is not material, for it could not so appear to those that heard them.\u201d (Townshend on Slander and Libel, \u00a7 131; 2 Stark, on Ev. *453; <em>King </em>v. Herne, Cowp. 184; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>4 Wend. 324.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-5\"><em>H. Edgerton, </em>and <em>C. Edgerton, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-6\">The complaint alleges that the telegram was <em>published </em>of and concerning the plaintiff. Published <em>ex vi termini </em>imports that the telegram was understood by some one who read it, or by whom it was read. Webster thus defines the verb publish: \u201c To make public ; to make publicly known.\u201d It is one of the requisites of a \u201c publication \u201d of a defamatory writing that it be understood. To constitute a slander, it is essential that the slanderous words be spoken in the presence of third persons. Yet it has been held, that an allegation that the defendant <em>published </em>the words is sufficient, without alleging specially the presence of others. (Townshend on Slander and Libel, 3d ed. p. 570; <em>Duel </em>v. <em>Agan, </em>1 Code R. 134; <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>3 Iowa, 316.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-7\">By a parity of reasoning, an averment that a defamatory Writing was published <em>of and concerning </em>the plaintiff is equivalent to an averment that it was \u201c made publicly known \u201d <em>of and concerning </em>him.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b597-8\">Ross, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The complaint alleges that the defendant \u201c made, subscribed, and published, concerning said plaintiff, a libel, to wit: That said defendant did * * * make and send to R. O. De Witt (plaintiff\u2019s brother), * * * by telegraph, a dispatch in the words and figures following: ' Fort Jones, March 21st, 1876. To R. O. De Witt, Yreka.\u2014He has been stealing, and I want you <em>to </em>come and clear him. If not, I will put him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>through for it. H. Wright.\u2019\u201d And the complaint alleges that the words \u201che \u201d and \u201c him \u201d were intended by the defendant to mean the plaintiff, and \u201c that said publication was false, and a libel on said plaintiff.\u201d The defendant interposed a demurrer, which was overruled. It ought to have been sustained. According to the averment of the complaint, the \u201cpublication\u201d consisted of the making and sending of the telegram to R. O. De Witt.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">That the matter therein stated is libelous <em>per se, </em>is not disputed. But to enable the plaintiff to maintain an action on it, it is essential not only that it should have been written concerning the plaintiff, but also that it was so <em>understood </em>by at least some one third person. (Townshend on Slander and Libel, \u00a7\u00a7 108, 95, 96; <em>Miller </em>v. Maxwell, 16 Wend. 9; <em>Woolworth </em>v. <em>Meadows, </em>5 East, 231; <em>Bourke </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>2 Car. <em>&amp; </em>P. 307..) There is nothing in the complaint to indicate that E. O. De Witt knew who was meant by the words \u201c he \u201d or \u201c him \u201d; and if he did not know, it is clear that one of the essential elements of the cause of action was wanting. By \u00a7 460 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is rendered unnecessary to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts for the purpose of showing the <em>application to the plaintiff </em>of the defamatory matter, but it is sufficient to state, generally, that the same was published or spoken <em>concerning </em>plaintiff; but this section, in our opinion, does not do away with the necessity of the averment that the person or persons who read the writing or heard the words <em>lenew </em>the plaintiff was meant. Without such knowledge, as already observed, there could be no cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded, with directions to the Court below to sustain the demurrer to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Morrison, C. J., McKinstry, J., Sharpstein, J., Myrick, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
