To restrain this threatened sale, the plaintiff commenced an injunction suit, in which he recovered judgment against the defendant on the 27th of September, 1873, perpetually enjoining the enforcement of the execution. This judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court at the October Term, 1874, and on the 27th of September, 1875\u2014more than two years and six months after the issuance of the execution\u2014plaintiff commenced the action, out of which this case arises, to recover damages for maliciously issuing the execution. The lower Court sustained a demurrer to the complaint in the action, upon the ground that the cause of action was barred by subdivision 1 of \u00a7 339 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that is the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">By the section referred to,. two years is prescribed as the period within which must be commenced an action upon an obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument in writing. \u201c Liability \u201d is defined: \u201c Amenability or responsibility to law : the condition of one who is subject to a charge or duty which may be judicially enforced.\u201d (Abbott\u2019s Dict. 38.) And it may arise from contracts expressed or implied, or in consequenc eof torts. (Bouvier\u2019s Dict., word \u201c liability.\u201d) The liability sought to be enforced in this action was one which originated in tort. When the defendant caused an execution to be issued upon the satisfied judgment, and to be levied upon the property of the plaintiff, he was guilty of a breach of duty which rendered him amenable to the plaintiff for damages. This breach of duty constituted the gist of the action which the plaintiff brought against the defendant, and his right of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>accrued at the time of the breach of duty, and not when the judgment in the injunction suit was rendered or affirmed by the appellate tribunal. And the Statute of Limitations commenced to run from the time of the alleged breach of duty. When misconduct or negligence constitutes a cause of action, the Statute of Limitations begins to run from the time when the defendant had been guilty of such misconduct or negligence. <em>(Pillar </em>v. <em>S. P. R. Co. </em>52 Cal. 43; <em>Harpending </em>v. Meyer, 55 id. 555; <em>Howell </em>v. Young, 5 Barn. &amp; C. 266.) The running of the statute in this case, therefore, commenced on the 4th of March, 1873\u2014the day when the execution was wrongfully issued and levied\u2014and it was not suspended by the injunction proceedings to restrain the enforcement of the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">But it is contended, that the damages which plaintiff was entitled to recover did not accrue until the litigation resulting from the suit by injunction had been ended by the judgment of the Supreme Court. Damages which result from a tort do not constitute separate causes of action. They are parts of the tort itself, for which the cause of action is given ; and the cause of action arises immediately on the happening of the injury, and is not postponed to the damages thereby occasioned. (Angell on Lim. \u00a7\u00a7 298-300.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">As the time prescribed by the statute had run before the plaintiff commenced his action, his cause of action was barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Boss, J., and McKinstry, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
