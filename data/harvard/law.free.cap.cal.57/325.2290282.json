(Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 580.) The allegation of damages in each count of the complaint, with the exception of the words \u201c attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d is in the words of \u00a7 3336 of the Civil Code. The words \u201c attorney\u2019s fees \u201d may be rejected as surplusage. The evidence is not before us, and it cannot be assumed that the jury included attorney\u2019s fees in their verdict. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The order dismissing the motion for a new trial was an order <em>\u201c </em>after judgment,\u201d and appealable, and the order was erroneous. <em>(Calderwood </em>v. <em>Peyser, </em>42 Cal. 113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Although there is but one transcript, there are two <em>appeals </em>before us, as distinct as if they had been separately noticed\u2014 one from the judgment, and the other from the order denying a new trial. It is hardly necessary to add, that, in sucli cases, the affirmance of the judgment on direct appeal therefrom, on the judgment roll, should not prevent the Court below from setting aside the verdict or findings (and the judgment based thereon), if it should be satisfied that the motion for a new trial should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The judgment on direct appeal therefrom is affirmed. The order dismissing the motion for new trial is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings on the motion for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
