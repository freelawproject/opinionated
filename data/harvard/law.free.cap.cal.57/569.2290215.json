The prosecuting witness testified that he was standing near the bed, when defendant sprung from it and struck at him; that the witness returned the blow, and that the fight continued until he received the knife-wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">Mrs. William Clavey testified that she visited the room where the fight took place immediately after it ceased, and found the defendant there. The following is taken from the recital of proceedings in the bill of exceptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u201c Question by the defense\u2014\u2018 Describe fully the condition of his head and face.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201c The prosecution objected to the question. The Court sustained the objection. The witness answered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201c ' His face was cut, bruised, and swollen.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201cThe Court said to the witness: \u2018Do not-answer that-question.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">\u201c The defense then asked the following question: \u2018 State what the appearance of the defendant\u2019s head and face was at that time;,\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">\u201c The prosecution objected to the question. The Court sustained the objection, and refused to allow the question, to which ruling the defendant then and there duly excepted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">\u201c The witness continued, in substance, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-11\">\u201c \u2018 There was blood on the blanket and pillow and sheet of defendant\u2019s bed.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-12\">\u201c The defense asked the following question:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-13\">\u201c \u2018 Over what extent was the blood spread around? \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-14\">\u201c The prosecution objected to the question. The Court sustained the objection, and the defendant duly excepted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">Any evidence tending to show the nature of the injuries received by the defendant at the hands of the prosecuting witness was certainly admissible, and would have aided the jury in determining whether the defendant acted only in necessary self-defense. So the extent to which the bed was blooded would corroborate the statement either of the prosecuting witness or of the defendant, as to there having been any beating of the latter before he arose from his recumbent position.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">It cannot be claimed that no injury was done to the defendant at the trial, because some of the questions above cited were <em>answered </em>by the witness. They were answered in direct disobedience to the order of tlv Court, which expressly held that the testimony was improper. Under such circumstances, we must suppose that the jury disregarded the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-17\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b590-18\">Morrison, C. J., Ross, J., Sharpstein, J., and Myrick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
