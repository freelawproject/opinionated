That in November, 1876, said corporation reincorporated, and duly filed its certificate thereof in the office of the clerk of said county of Santa Clara, and a certified copy in the office of the Secretary of State. Afterwards, in December, 1876, the stockholders of said corporation took the necessary steps to extend their corporate existence for the period of fifty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">This corporation existed on the first day of January, 1873, and was formed under the laws of this State, and therefore might elect to continue its existence under the provisions of the Code. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 287.) Having done so, it was after that a Code corporation, and its certificate of incorporation was prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>erly filed in the office of the cleric of the county where the original articles of incorporation were filed. The certificate which it was required to file for the purpose of extending the term of \u25a0 its corporate existence was filed in the same office. It seems to us that the requirements of the law were complied with in this respect. The denial of the right of the corporation to collect tolls is based in the complaint exclusively upon the ground that no such corporation exists. If it exists, it has a right to collect such tolls as the Board of Supervisors may authorize it to collect. Whether it is collecting more than it is authorized to collect, is a question which does not arise upon the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Morrison, C.

Conceding the validity of the proceedings taken by the \u201c Santa Cruz Gap Turnpike Joint Stock Company,\u201d under the provisions of the Code, for the purpose of prolonging its existence, the extension of its existence as a corporation did not, in my opinion, carry with it the right to collect any tolls beyond the period of twenty years from the date of its original organization, at the expiration of which period, according to the law applicable to its original organization, the road in question was to become a free public highway.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
