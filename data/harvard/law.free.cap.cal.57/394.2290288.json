(<em>Weaver </em>v. Fairchild, 50 Cal. 360; <em>French </em>v. <em>Fyan, </em>3 Otto, 169; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Dale, </em>44 Cal. 562; <em>Johnson </em>v. Towsley, 13 Wall. 72; <em>Hosmer </em>v.

If it be issued in the absence of legislation directing a disposition of the property described, or by an officer who is not invested with the power to sign the same, or for an estate prohibited, its validity may be controverted in any action, either directly or collaterally; but if the authority to issue the patent depends upon the existence of particular facts in reference to the condition, or location of the property, or the performance of certain antecedent acts, and officers have been appointed for the ascertainment of these matters in advance, who have passed upon them, and given their judgment, then the patent, though the judgment of the officers be in fact erroneous, cannot be attacked collaterally by parties showing title subsequently derived from the same source.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The appeal was first heard in Department One, and the following judgment was made:</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b415-5\">The Coubt:</author>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Ejectment. Plaintiff deraigned from the Western Pacific Railroad Company. Defendant offered to prove that the lands in controversy were, at the time when the lands along the line of the road were withdrawn from pre-emption, private entry and sale, within the limits of a Mexican grant then <em>sub judice, </em>and therefore within a \u201c Government reservation,\u201d as that expression is used in the Act of Congress of 1864. (13 Stats. 358.) We think the Court below erred in sustaining the objection to this proof. If the land was within a reservation, it did not pass by the patent to the railroad company. It was so held in <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Sanger, </em>92 U. S. 761. In effect, the officers of the Government were expressly prohibited from issuing to the company a patent purporting to convey the lands thus reserved. The case comes within the doctrine laid down in <em>Doll </em>v. <em>Meador, </em>16 Cal. 295, and the cases subsequently recognizing the authority of that case. The validity of a patent purporting to grant lands which the officers of the Government have no authority, under any circumstances, to convey, may be controverted in any action, directly or collaterally. The patent is <em>void, </em>and a defendant in an action of ejectment may prove the facts showing its invalidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Subsequently, on petition for rehearing, the following order was made by the Court in Bank.</p>\n<author id=\"b415-10\">The Coubt :</author>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">The rehearing is denied. The decision comes within the rule laid down in <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>50 Cal. 64.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
