The defendant had previously been indicted for the larceny of the same property, tried, found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>guilty, a new trial granted, and the indictment dismissed. On the trial of the present indictment the prosecution was permitted to introduce, against the objections of defendant, the reporter\u2019s notes of the testimony of Manuel de Arena, a witness at the trial of the first indictment\u2014evidence being given that Arena was without the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The Court erred in permitting the reporter\u2019s notes to be read in evidence. It is provided by \u00a7 1870 of the Code of Civil Procedure (subd. 8), that, at a trial, may be given in evidence \u201c the testimony of a witness deceased, or out of the jurisdiction, or unable to testify, given in a former action between the same parties relating to the same matter.\u201d The Penal Code, \u00a7 1102, provides : \u201c The rules of evidence in civil actions are applicable also to criminal actions, except as <em>otherwise provided </em>in this Code.\u201d Section 686 of the Penal Code, under the head \u201c Rights of a defendant in a criminal action,\u201d declares : \u201cIn a criminal action the defendant is entitled: * * * 8. To produce witnesses on his behalf, and to be confronted with the witnesses against him, in the presence of the Court, except that where the charge has been preliminarily examined before a committing magistrate, and the testimony taken down by question and answer in the presence of the defendant, who has, either in person or by counsel, cross-examined or had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness; or where the testimony of a witness on the part of the people, who is unable to give security for his appearance, has been taken conditionally, in the like manner, in the presence of the defendant, Avho' has, either in person or by counsel, cross-examined, or had an opportunity to cross-examine, the witness, the deposition of such witness may be read, upon it being satisfactorily shown to the Court that he is dead or insane, or cannot with due diligence be found within the State. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">There can be little doubt of the meaning of the foregoing citation. The defendant in a criminal action is entitled \" to be confronted with the witnesses against him, in the presence of the Court \u201d\u2014that is, the Court in which \u201c the action \u201d is being tried\u2014except in the instances specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Devine\u2019s case <em>(People </em>v. Devine, 46 Cal. 48) was tried in the District Court before the Codes took effect, and it does not appear that the attention of the Supreme Court was called to any similar provision in the former Criminal Practice Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Morrison, C.
