A person <em>entitled </em>to the administration may, by request, empower the Court to appoint some other person. (\u00a7 1379, Code Civ. Proc.) But being a married woman, she was not herself entitled to administer, and could therefore confer no rights on respondent by her request. She could not delegate power that she did not herself possess. (\u00a7 1370, Code Civ. Proc.; \u00a7 2304, Civ. Code; <em>Estate of Morgan, </em>53 Cal. 243.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>P. J.

The public administrator a\u00a1)plied for letters, and a counter-application was made by the nominee of a married daughter of the intestate. Under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, we see no way of escaping the conclusion, that in such a case the public administrator has the first right. There' have been, at various times, so many amendments to the Code concerning the right of administration, that it is quite difficult to extract a harmonious <em>system; </em>indeed, in the case at bar, we see no reason why the husband of the female heir may not administer, other than the rule as furnished to us by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Order reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
