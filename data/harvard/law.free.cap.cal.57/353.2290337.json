Upon investigation the Court found the charges unsustained. Within five days thereafter the defendant delivered to the clerk of the Court, and served upon plaintiff, a memorandum of his costs in the proceeding, amounting to $451.40; and thereupon the clerk entered a judgment acquitting the defendant of the charges, and that he recover of the plaintiff, described therein as the People of the State of California in the relation of Oscar Alderman, the amount of the defendant\u2019s costs. On motion made, the Court struck out the bill of costs, and from this order the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Assuming that the people of the State were parties to the proceeding, the clerk had no power to enter judgment against the State, for the reason that the statute did not authorize it. The statute declares that if on the hearing \u201c it appears that the charge is sustained, the Court must enter a decree that the party informed against be deprived of his office, and must enter a judgment for $500 in favor of the informer, and such costs as are allowed in civil cases.\u201d There is in this statute no warrant for a judgment against the State for costs. And assuming, without deciding or intimating, that under its provisions the Court might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>have allowed the defendant costs against the informer, it did not do so in this case. The defendant not having been allowed costs, there could be no error in striking his bill of costs from the files.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
