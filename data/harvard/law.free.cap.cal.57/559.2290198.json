The language of the statute is, that the fact of previous conviction must be charged in the indictment. The Court cannot interpolate the words \u201c or in the information.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tisdale, ante, </em>p. 104.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-11\"><em>A.

J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">The appeal in this case is taken upon the judgment roll alone, and the ground relied upon for a reversal is, that the punishment was in excess of that authorized by law. The prosecution was by information, and the conviction was of the crime of petit larceny. The information charged a previous conviction of a similar offense, and the judgment of the Superior Court was, \u201c that the said Joseph Carlton be punished by imprisonment in the State prison of the State of California for the term of four years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">Section 666 of the Penal Code provides, that \u201c every person who, having been convicted of petit larceny, or of an attempt to commit an offense which if perpetrated would be punishable by imprisonment in the State prison, commits any crime after such conviction, is punishable as follows; * * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>\u201c 3. If the subsequent conviction is for <em>petit larceny, </em>or for an attempt to commit an offense which if perpetrated would be punishable in the State prison, then such person is punishable by imprisonment in such prison not exceeding five years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The record shows that upon the arraignment of the defendant he pleaded \u201c not guilty of the offense charged in the information,\u201d and as to the prior conviction, \u201cthat it is true.\u201d On this appeal, two points are made on behalf of the appellant: 1st, that the provisions of the Penal Code on this subject do not apply, except in prosecutions by <em>indictment; </em>and 2nd, that the question of prior conviction should have been submitted to, and should have been passed upon by, the jury. We will first consider the second point.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">By \u00a7 1158 of the Penal Code it is provided, that, \u201c whenever the fact of a previous conviction of another offense is charged in an indictment, the jury, if they find a verdict of guilty of the offense for which he is indicted, must also, unless <em>the answer of the defendant admits of the charge, </em>find whether or not he has suffered such previous conviction.\u201d And \u00a7 1093 of the same Code provides, that, \u201c if the indictment be for a felony, the clerk must read it, and state the pica of the defendant to the jury; and in cases where the indictment charges a previous conviction, and the defendant has confessed the same, the clerk, in reading such indictment, shall omit therefrom <em>all that relates to such previous </em>conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">It is clear, from the foregoing sections, that it was not necessary for the jury to pass upon the question of <em>previous conviction, </em>for the Code provides that when the defendant has <em>confessed the same, </em>that part of the indictment that charges a previous conviction <em>shall not he read to the jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The fact of a previous conviction was set out in the information in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 969 of the Penal-Code, and the only question which remains to be considered is the first point presented on behalf of the appellant. The Penal Code speaks of an <em>indictment </em>only, and it is therefore contended that its provisions do not apply to a prosecution by <em>information. </em>Section 8, article i, of the Constitution declares, that \u201c offenses heretofore required to be prosecuted by <em>indictment </em>shall be prosecuted by information, after examination and commitment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>by a magistrate, or by <em>indictment </em>with or without such examination and commitment \u201d <em>\\ </em>and by the Act of April 9th, 1880. it is provided, that \u201c \u00a7 682 of the Penal Code is amended so as to road as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">\u201c Every public offense must be prosecuted by indictment or information and by the same act a new section was added to the Penal Code: \u201c The following is added as a new section to said Code, to be known as \u00a7 809:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">\u201c When a defendant has been examined and committed, as provided in \u00a7 872 of this Code, it shall be the duty of the district attorney, within thirty days thereafter, to file in the Superior Court of the county in which the offense is triable an information charging the defendant with such offense. The information shall be in the name of the people of the State of California, and subscribed by the district attorney, and shall be in form like an indictment for the same offense.\u201d (Amdts. 1880, Penal Code, p. 10.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">The last two sections are found in the Act of April 9th, 1880, which is entitled \u201c An Act to amend \u00a7 682 \u201d (and other sections, naming them), \u201c and to repeal \u00a7\u00a7 969 and 1025 of the Penal- Code, and to add a new section thereto, to be known as \u00a7 809, to provide for prosecution by information, and to adapt the provisions of said Code thereto.\u201d (Amdts. 1880, Penal Code, p. 10.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Other sections of this amendatory act are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\u201c Section 888 of said Code is hereby amended so as to rend as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">\u201c All public offenses triable in the Superior Courts must be prosecuted by indictment or information, except as provided in the next section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">\u201c Section 949 of said Code is hereby amended so as to read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">\u201c.The first pleading on the part of the people is the indictment or information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">There are other sections applicable to this subject, but the foregoing quotations will show that it was the intention of the Legislature to make the provisions of the Penal Code equally applicable to prosecutions by information and indictment. After the examination contemplated by \u00a7 809 has been had, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>left to the discretion of the district attorney to prosecute either by indictment or information; and whether one form or the other is pursued, the fact of a previous conviction may be set forth. If the defendant pleads not guilty to such charge, the issue must be tried by a jury; but if he pleads guilty thereto, as he did in this case, no such trial is required under the provisions of the law in existence at the time the defendant in this case was tried and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Sharpstein, J., Myrick, J., Ross, J., and McKinstry, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
