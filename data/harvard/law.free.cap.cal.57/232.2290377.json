Then, if issue by affidavits is raised, such issues, under precedent and practice for one hundred years, must be tried by Court, and not by a jury, as every person is entitled under the laws of the land; and it is depriving a person of property without due process of law, and without being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>properly summoned, and is void. <em>(Belcher </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>53 Cal. 635; <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>95 U. S. 714.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b253-5\">Certainly mere signing a bond on appeal is not an appearance in case. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1014.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b253-6\">Nor does a person thereby waive <em>trial </em>by jury. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 631; art. i, \u00a7 7, Const.

Y. 463 ; <em>Matoon </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>6 Cal. 57, 59); and the sureties thereby waived a jury trial. <em>(Russell </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>2 Cal. 245, 247; 16 id. 249; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Keep, </em>38 Ala. 315.)

The sureties on the undertaking upon appeal were notified of the motion for judgment, and failed to appear. We see nothing in the point that \u00a7 942 of the Code of Civil Procedure, allowing judgment on motion against the sureties, where they have subscribed such an undertaking as is required by that section, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
