Thus, in \u00a7 113, it is cited, showing that a member of a corporation may have all the rights, and be liable to all the duties, without his having a certificate, his rights being determined by the transfer book. In \u00a7 271, the language of the opinion is cited, showing when a member cannot dispute the existence of the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>JET.

(Civ. Code, \u00a7 3386 <em>; Cooper </em>v. <em>Pena, </em>21 Cal. 404; <em>Lester </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>12 Barb. 503; <em>Troy &amp; Boston R.

No one of such subscribers is shown to have joined in the formation of the corporation plaintiff, or to be a member thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The present action is not brought to recover an <em>assessment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">If the subscription paper could be treated as an agreement to purchase stock of the company, there would be no mutuality in the contract, since the presumption is that the corporation had no stock to sell. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 343, 344.) The complaint does not allege, nor does the evidence establish, that plaintiff owned any stock, or that the disposition of stock by sale was authorized by the by-laws, or by vote of the stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">If the subscription paper was signed <em>after </em>the corporation was formed, and even if the subscription can be considered as the equivalent of a subscription for stock, plaintiff has no power to treat the subscribers differently from other stockholders, or to recover from them other than the amounts of assessments duly levied.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Ross, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
