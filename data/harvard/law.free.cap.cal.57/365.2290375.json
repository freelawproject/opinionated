It is not denied that they were \u201cdoing business under the firm name of Martin &amp; Grorrill,\u201d and it is found that they agreed with the plaintiffs to purchase from them twenty-five thousand bricks, at the price of twelve dollars per thousand. If they entered into that agreement, their liability did not depend upon their being partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-17\">During the progress of the trial, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel remarked, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>that all the defendants wanted to prove was that the bricks were rejected, which was sustained by the Court, and excepted to by the defendants.
