The fact that the improvement is more beneficial to one portion than another, furnishes no reason to wholly exempt any portion. <em>(New York and New Haven R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>42 Conn. 279; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayor of New York, </em>8 Vroom, 415; <em>Westar </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em>80 Pa. 505; <em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Village of Portchester, </em>71 N.

It came too late. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 649; <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>50 Cal. 444.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>McKinstry, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The District Judge ought to have sustained plaintiff\u2019s objection to the settlement or allowance of an exception to the ruling of the Court striking out a portion of defendant\u2019s answer. The proposed bill, containing such exception, was not presented until more than three months after the ruling or decision was made. The order to strike out was made November 14th, 1879, and the <em>\u201c </em>proposed bill \u201d is dated March 26th, 1880, and of course could not have been presented until that day. It appears from the judge\u2019s certificate, that, at the settlement of the bill, plaintiff\u2019s attorney, \u201c having reserved the right so to do, objected to the allowance of that portion of the bill relating to the striking out of a portion of defendant\u2019s answer, etc., * <em>* </em>* on the ground that the same was not presented in due time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The Act of March 20th, 1878, to organize Levee District No. 1, of Sacramento County (Stats. 1877-78, p. 853), defines the boundaries of the levee district, and provides for the election of <em>three </em>trustees, <em>one </em>assessor, <em>and one tax collector. </em>The seventh section provides that the <em>assessor </em>shall assess the real estate and personal property in the district, etc. In the case before us, the assessment was made by three <em>commissioners </em>appointed by the supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The fifteenth section of the act reads: \u201c If the board of trustees shall adopt any <em>plan </em>or scheme, or project any work of reclamation, * * * which, in their judgment, is more beneficial to one part of the district than to another, they may report <em>such plan </em>to the Board of Supervisors of said county in the manner provided by \u00a7 3455 of the Political Code. All subsequent proceedings for the purpose of assessing and collecting the moneys necessary to complete the work specified in said report shall be prosecuted under \u00a7\u00a7 3456, 3459, 3460, 3461, 3462, 3463, 3465, and 3466 of the Political Code.\u201d Section 3456 of the Political Code provides for the appointment, \u201c by the board by which the district was formed,\u201d of three commissioners, \u201c who must view and assess <em>upon the lands situated within the district </em>a charge proportionate to the whole expense and the benefits which will result from such works,\u201d etc. The Act of 1878 does not provide for any report of a plan, except where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>trustees have adjudged that one portion will be <em>more benefited </em>by the scheme projected than another. In the case at bar, the trustees did so adjudge\u2014although their report, assuming it to be a plan, did not indicate their judgment as to which portions of the lands would be more benefited\u2014as it may be assumed (without deciding the question) that the report or plan gave to the supervisors power to appoint commissioners. It will be seen, by reference to \u00a7 7, that, in ordinary cases, it is the duty of the assessor to assess <em>all the real property </em>in his district. This, separated from the fifteenth section, would seem to make the levee district a district for taxation or assessment purposes as well. It is, perhaps, a legislative declaration (which by all the cases is held conclusive) that all the lands within the district will be benefited.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">In addition to what has already been conceded, for the purposes of the argument, it may further be assumed that the Legislature has power either to establish the boundaries of an assessment district or to authorize the supervisors of a county to appoint commissioners to establish such boundaries, and whose report, showing what lands they have in fact assessed, shall fix and determine the lands constituting the assessment district. Assuming still further (but not so deciding, because the determination of the question is not herein necessarily involved), that \u00a7 7 defines an assessment district coextensive with the levee district, it might be doubted whether the Legislature had power in the same act to provide for the election either of trustees or commissioners with authority to determine that some of the lands (of which it has been legislatively declared that they would be benefited by the works of reclamation) would in fact not be benefited at all. But assuming, for the purposes of this decision, that the Legislature had power to invest the commissioners appointed by the Board of Supervisors with authority to relieve a part of the tracts of land within the levee district of all assessment, the question still remains, Has the Legislature done that thing ? We are of opinion that the language employed by the Legislature will not permit such construction. The language of \u00a7 15 of the Act of 1878 is: \u201cIf the board of trustees shall adopt any plan or scheme which, in their judgment, is <em>more </em>beneficial to one part of the district than another, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>shall report such plan,\u201d etc. And \u00a7 3456 of the Political Code reads: \u201c The board * * must appoint three commissioners, who must view and assess upon <em>the lands situated within the </em>(levee) <em>district </em>a charge proportionate,\u201d etc. There is nothing in the language used in either of these sections which necessitates a construction which alone can give validity to the assessment sought to be enforced in this action. The very words \u201c <em>more </em>beneficial \u201d indicate that all .are benefited in some degree, and the power to assess \u201c upon the lands \u201d of the district is a power only to assess all the lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Morrison, C.
