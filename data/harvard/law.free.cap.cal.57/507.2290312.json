The judgment of board of land commissioners and District Court confirms the same <em>to them. </em>(See Act of Congress of 3d of March, 1851, \u00a7 13, \u201c To settle private land claims in California.\u201d) But if the Court should be of the opinion that the same is not void, then the patent shows by its recital that Joaquin Y. Castro held the title to the San Pablo Banch as trustee, and as such trustee could not convey the same. (\u00a7\u00a7 870, 871, Civ. Code; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>1 Hoffm. L. Cas. 105; Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, \u00a7 55 Hittell Laws.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-5\">The mortgage and sale by Castro was only of the right, title, and interest which he (Castro) had at the date of the mortgage, and did not include a subsequent-acquired title by him. <em>(Gee </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>14 Cal. 473, 474; <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Semple, </em>25 id. 452, 453; <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>12 Pick. 47; <em>Comstock </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>13 id. 116; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Ewiny, </em>6 Cush. 34; <em>Duchess of Kingston Case, </em>2 Smith Lead.

Co. </em>49 id. 335.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-6\">The doctrine of relation, or the \u201c fiction of law,\u201d which authorizes a court to antedate so as to render operative a grant which would be otherwise without effect, is only to be applied to promote the ends of justice, and for the security of those who stand in privity with the party named in the grant. <em>(Newhall </em>v. <em>Sanger, </em>2 Otto, 766; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Chouteau, </em>13 Wall. 92.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-7\"><em>Eli P. Chase, </em>for Appellant May.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-8\">The complaint is unintelligible, and the defect was especially pointed out by the demurrer. No person can tell where the starting point is in the survey and description set forth in the complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-9\">For a starting point in the description there is a choice of nine \u2022 different township corners, and a range of twelve miles north and south, and the same distance east and west; and starting at either, he is within the description contained in the complaint, and neither would embrace the same land contained in a survey from either of the other corners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-10\">The question naturally arises, At which of the four corners of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>township 1, range 4, or which of the four in township 1, range 5, is the starting point? And the same question arises in reference to township <em>2, </em>ranges 4 and 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-5\">It is insisted that the plaintiff has failed to incorporate a description in his complaint that will apprise the defendant, the Court, or the officer designated to execute the judgment, where the land is situated (\u00a7 455, Code Civ. Proc.), and the complaint is ambiguous, unintelligible, and uncertain for that reason, and for the same reason it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-6\">The question is not whether we can start at one of these corners, and, following the description, find the land in controversy, but whether we can start at either of the corners and not find it. A pleading is to be construed most strongly against the pleader. <em>(Snow </em>v. <em>Halstead, </em>1 Cal. 361; <em>Chipman </em>v. <em>Emeric, </em>5 id. 50; <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>9 id. 50; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>30 id. 572.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-7\">This rule applies where the pleader stands upon his pleading, and maintains its sufficiency in law in the presence of a demurrer or other hostile attack.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-8\"><em>B. S. Brooks, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-9\">The legal title which passed by the confirmation and patent passed by the foreclosure sale and sheriff\u2019s deed to J. M. Tewksbury, plaintiff\u2019s grantee, as was decided by the Supreme Court in <em>Littlefield </em>v. <em>Nichol, </em>42 Cal. 372.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-10\">As the patent vests the legal title absolutely in Joaquin Y. Castro, his deed of his entire interest, legal and equitable, transfers it. It is true that a court of equity might, if circumstances warranted it in a proper case with the patentee or his assignee, and all the <em>cestuis qui trust, </em>and others claiming an interest before it, <em>by its decree, convert the patentee or his grantee into a trustee in invitem. </em>But that cannot be done in an action of ejectment in favor of one claiming a mere fraction (/si^) of the whole. A court of equity could not entertain 359 suits to declare or establish a trust. Every one of the <em>cestuis qui trust </em>would have a right to be heard. There is no allegation here of any trust or of any facts upon which the Court could create one. The case of <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Blandear, </em>17 Cal. 70, was a bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>in equity, all the parties were before the Court, <em>and the trust was expressly declared in the deed. </em>The rule in regard to such trusts is declared in \u00a7 870 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-5\">The interest which a sheriff might convey under a general execution is very different from that which passes under a foreclosure sale. A foreclosure sale relates back to the mortgage, and converts it into a deed of conveyance.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b530-6\">Morrison, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">This is an action of ejectment to recover a portion of what is called the \u201c San Pablo Rancho,\u201d and the appeal is taken from the late District Court of Contra Costa County. There are numerous parties defendant, only two of whom, Peter Magraff and Mary E. May, have appealed, the former from the judgment and order denying a motion for a new trial, and the latter simply from the order denying the motion for a new trial. Numerous errors have been assigned to the proceedings in the District Court, which we will proceed to examine and dispose of.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">1. The first objection that we will notice is that the complaint is fatally defective, on the ground that it contains no definite description of the land sued for, as it does not give the starting point. The only evidence on the subject is that of one Taylor, who was called as a witness on behalf of the.plaintiff, and testified as follows: \u201c I am a surveyor. [Here insert map.] I made that survey and made that map, and I know the land there shown. The different parties, as shown in the diagram at the margin of the map to have been in possession of the different tracts, were in possession of those tracts at the time I made the survey. The starting point mentioned in the description is certain and definite, and there can be but one such point.\u201d We think the complaint sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">2. The next point made on the appeal relates to the legal operation and effect of the patent under which plaintiff claims title. The patent, among other matters, contains the following recitals : \u201c Whereas, it appears from a duly authenticated transcript filed in the General Land Office of the United States, that pursuant to the provisions of the Act of Congress approved the 3rd day of March, 1851, entitled \u2018An Act to ascertain and settle the private land claims in the State of California,\u2019 Joaquin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Ysidro Castro, administrator of the estate of Francisco Maria Castro, deceased, as claimant, filed his petition on the 9th day of October, 1852, with the commissioners, to ascertain and settle the private land claims in the State of California, sitting as a board in the city of Los Angeles, in which petition he claimed the confirmation of title to a tract of land known by the name of \u2018 San Pablo,\u2019 situated in the county of Contra Costa, and State aforesaid, said claim being founded on two Mexican grants to the heirs of Francisco Maria Castro, deceased. * * * And whereas, the board of land commissioners aforesaid, on the 17th day of April, 1855, rendered a decree of confirmation in favor of the claimant, which decree or decision having been taken by appeal to the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of California, the said District Court, in the case entitled ' <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Joaquin Ysidro </em>Castro,\u2019 rendered its decision, as follows, to wit: \u2018 It is by the Court hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the said decision be and the same is hereby affirmed, and it is likewise further ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the claim of the said appellee is a good and valid claim, and the same is hereby confirmed to the extent of four square leagues. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\u201c\u2018Now know ye, that the United States of America, in consideration of the premises, and pursuant to the provisions of the Act of Congress aforesaid of the 3rd of March, 1851, and the legislation supplemental thereto, have given and granted, and by these presents do give and grant, unto the said Joaquin Y. Castro, and to his heirs, the tract of land embraced and described in the foregoing survey; but with the stipulation that in virtue of the 15th section of the said act, neither the confirmation of this said claim nor this patent shall affect the interests of third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\u201c \u2018 To have and to hold the said tract of land, with the appurtenances, unto the said Joaquin Y. Castro, and to his heirs and assigns forever, with the stipulation aforesaid.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">It is claimed on behalf of the appellant that the above patent is void, but no authority is cited in support of such a view, and we are unable to see any good reason for such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The proceedings before the board of land commissioners show that Joaquin Y. Castro presented his petition before that board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>as administrator, and the patent grants the land to him, not in his representative, but in his personal, capacity; but this does not affect the validity of the instrument. The most that can be contended for is that the patent should have issued to Castro as administrator, and that therefore he holds the lands granted as trustee for the heirs of Francisco Maria Castro; but even if the patent had issued to him as such administrator, it would have vested in Joaquin Y. Castro the legal estate, with power of disposition, as has been held by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In the case of <em>Bonds </em>v. Hickman, 29 Cal. 465, the Court says: \u201cWe cannot hold the patent void because it was issued to the administrator of the deceased assignee of the warrant, for it is not forbidden by law to be so issued in such cases. It is not shown upon the face of the patent that it was issued for land to which the deceased had the right of pre-emption; and if such was in truth the case, though not recited in the patent, it is not liable to be attacked collaterally on that ground.\u201d And in the same case, when again before the Court (32 Cal. 204), the learned Judge delivering the opinion of the Court, says: \u201c The defendant objects that it does not appear that the deed from James Smith to the plaintiff was made by him as the administrator of Robert Smith, deceased. The patent was to \u2018 James Smith, administrator of Robert Smith, deceased.\u2019 The title, which passed by reason of the patent and the proceedings on which it was founded, vested in James Smith, the patentee named. Whether he held it in tifust for others we are not informed by the case before us, and we are not aware that it could in any event be a proper subject of inquiry in this action. We are of opinion that the Court erred in excluding the deed from James Smith to the plaintiff, and for that reason the judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The plaintiff in this action deraigns title through Joaquin Y. Castro; and the legal title was vested in him at the time this action was brought. <em>(Littlefield </em>v. Nichols, 42 Cal. 372.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The validity, operation, and effect of this patent were under consideration, and were passed upon by the Court in the case of <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Dougherty </em>(32 Cal. 458), and it was there held that the patent vested the legal estate in Joaquin Y. Castro, under whom plaintiff claims title in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>3. Two or three other points are made on this appeal, which we will briefly dispose of.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The identity of \u201c Perre \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>Perez \u201d is sufficiently established, and it appears that the two names represented but one and the same person.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The deed from Nicholas Hunsaker was executed by him as sheriff, and although somewhat informal, is substantially good.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">4. There is sufficient evidence in the transcript to prove a delivery of the deed from Tewskbury to Sherman, the plaintiff in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">5. It was claimed on behalf of the plaintiff, that the mortgage from Joaquin Y. Castro and wife to Perre, under which the plaintiff\u2019s title was derived, was intended to convey, and did convey, the entire Rancho de San Pablo, and that was the construction placed upon the mortgage by the District Court. The language of the instrument is, \u201c That the said parties of the first part, for and in consideration of the sum of six thousand dollars to them in hand paid by the said party of the second part, do grant, bargain, sell, and confirm unto said party of the second part, and to his heirs and assigns, all the estate, right, title, interest, claim, and demand whatever, as well in law as in equity, of the said parties of the first part, of, in, and to all that certain tract or parcel of land lying, being, and situate in the county of Contra Costa aforesaid, and more particularly known and described as the Rancho de San Pablo, bordering upon the bay of San Francisco and San Pablo, and containing about five leagues, <em>meaning to convey all of the right, title, interest, claim, and demands, and inheritance as heirs of </em>the late Francisco M. Castro and his wife Gabriella Berryessa, deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">It appears from the transcript, that Francisco M. Castro departed this life on or about the 5th day of November, 1831, and left surviving him his widow Gabriella, and eleven children, of whom the mortgagor was one, and by his last will and testament he devised one-half of the Rancho de San Pablo to his wife, and the remaining half to be divided equally among his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">It also appears that Joaquin Y. Castro, on the 9th day of October, 1852, filed his petition before the board of land commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>sioners, in Which he stated that the title of which he asked confirmation was founded upon two Mexican grants to the heirs of Francisco Maria Castro, and in said petition he represented himself to be the administrator of the estate of his deceased father, Francisco Maria Castro. It is true that the patent ran to him and his heirs, and therefore vested in him, Joaquin, the legal title; but it is nevertheless apparent upon the face of the record, that a trust was vested in him in favor of the heirs of Francisco.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Of all these facts the mortgagee must be deemed to have had notice, actual or implied; for certainly the facts were such as to have put any reasonable person upon inquiry, which inquiry, if properly pursued, would have led to a knowledge of the existing facts. It is very apparent that Joaquin Y. Castro never did claim any greater interest in the Pancho de San Pablo than the undivided interest which he derived from his father and mother; and we are of the opinion that it was that interest and that alone which he intended to mortgage to Perre. 'The language is: \u201c Meaning to convey all of the right, title, interest, claim, and demands, and inheritance as heirs of the late Francisco M. Castro and his wife Grabriella Bcrryessa.\u201d Whatever interest was vested in him and his wife, as the heirs of the deceased father and mothel, was conveyed by the mortgage, and it was never intended or contemplated that the entire rancho should be affected by the mortgage lien. The language of the mortgage and all the surrounding circumstances lead us to this conclusion. The foreclosure and sale, therefore, vested in the purchaser an undivided interest in the rancho, and not the entire property.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">6. Appellants, in their briefs, insist that, as Joaquin had no title at the time the mortgage was executed, the title subsequently acquired by him did not inure to the benefit of his mortgagee. In support of this proposition authorities are cited to the effect that a conveyance without covenants of warranty, or, in other words, a deed of release or quitclaim, simply passes the title which the grantor has at the time. But that principle has no application to this case, for two reasons: first, the mortgage purports to convey an estate in fee-simple ; and secondly, the rule invoked does not apply to <em>mortgages. </em>These questions were fully and ably considered by Chief Justice Field, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>case of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Baker </em>14 Cal. 612, and we accept the language and reasoning of that case as presenting a correct exposition of the law. (See also <em>Lent </em>v. Morrill, 25 Cal. 500; <em>The Vallejo Land Association </em>v. Vlera, 48 id. 579.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The appellants Mary E. May and Peter Magraff were grantees of undivided interests in the rancho, deraigning title to such interests from the same common source, and are therefore tenants in common with the plaintiff. The judgment against them for their interests was, therefore, erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Judgment and order reversed as to Peter Magraff; and as to Mary E. May, the order denying a new trial is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Myrick, J., Sharpstein, J., Thornton, J., Ross, J\u201e concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
