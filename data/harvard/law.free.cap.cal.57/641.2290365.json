The judgment compounds interest. Of the $1,600 due September 28th, only $1,360 was the principal, and the balance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>$200 interest. Interest cannot be compounded except in accordance with the stipulation of the parties. (Doe v. <em>Vallejo, </em>39 Cal. 285; <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Tutt, </em>11 id. 316; Parsons on Contracts, 147; Hittell\u2019s Gen. Laws, art. 3858; Civ.

The proceeding in this case was an action at law, and the defendant had a right to a trial by jury. The admission that the transaction was a mortgage eliminated all the equitable features from the case. The Court has no power to send an ordinary suit at law to a referee for trial. ( <em>Grimm </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>19 Cal. 140.) The parties are entitled to a trial by jury upon the legal issues. ( <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>19 Cal. 457; <em>Treadway </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>12 Nev. 116; Const, art. 1, \u00a7 7.) \u201c If there are other issues in the case not involving the examination of a long account, the Court has no compulsory power to send them to a referee for trial.\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>24 Cal. 424; Code Civ.

The Court found, and the pleadings admit, that the deed to plaintiff was intended as a mortgage. It is claimed that the judgment <em>over </em>against the defendant was erroneous. Section 2928 of the Civil Code provides that a \u201c mortgage \u201d does not bind the mortgagor personally unless there is an express covenant therein to that effect. But here there is evidence that defendant had promised to pay the sum of $1,600, on or before the 28th day of September, 1878. The fact is admitted by the answer, and it is recited in the bond, which was executed by the plaintiff, contemporaneously with the execution of the deed, by defendant. The recital was recognized to be correct by defendant, who accepted a delivery of the bond, and indeed relies upon it as evidence that the deed was intended as a mortgage. There was no error in entering the personal judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">2. The judgment does not illegally compound the interest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>By the terms of the contract between the parties the sum of $1,600 \u201cbecame due\u201d September 28th, 1878, and the decree properly provided for legal interest on such sum from that date. (Civil Code, \u00a7 1917.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">3. The Court was not bound to ascertain at the trial whether it would be \u201c to the advantage \u201d of defendant to have the lots sold separately. It may be the duty of the <em>sheriff </em>to make sale of the lots separately, and it would seem to be the right of the mortgagor to direct the order of the sale; but defendant is not called on to <em>plead </em>that it would be to his disadvantage to have the lands sold in gross, and such a plea creates no material issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">4. It is said the Court had no power to make the order of reference. The language of this first subdivision of \u00a7 639 of the Code of Civil Procedure indicates that the power of the Court to refer depends upon the <em>pleadings </em>on the one side or the-other. The reference is made \u201c when the trial of an issue of fact \u201d requires the examination of a long account. A reference for such purpose may, under our State Constitution, be made in any <em>equity </em>suit, when either party alleges facts showing an accounting to be necessary. Here the allegations with reference to an \u201c open, current, and mutual account \u201d are made in the answer to a bill in equity. The defendant was not entitled as of right to his trial by jury. Equity had acquired jurisdiction for the purpose of decreeing the deed to have been intended as a mortgage, and for its foreclosure, even if the matter of accounting was not of itself a subject of concurrent equity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">5. If the <em>order </em>of reference was broader than the Court was authorized to make, the report shows that the referees confined themselves to two questions; the alleged account, and the matter of the absence of plaintiff from the State. The latter question was material <em>only </em>in case there had been an open, mutual, and running account, and the referees reported that there never had been such. No exception was taken to the report of the referees or to any particular action on their parts. As to the other issues made by the pleadings, the <em>Court </em>heard all the testimony necessary for determining the same, and there is no pretense that defendant offered further testimony with respect to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
