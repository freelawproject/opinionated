O\u2019Connor, Bailiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-13\">\u201c The Court having met pursuant to adjournment, the Judges proceeded to their respective seats upon the Bench. Charles E. Pickett, being then present in the court-room, suddenly obtruded himself upon the Bench, and into the chair of Crockett, J., and announced that he had as good a right to occupy a seat upon the Bench of said Court as the said Crockett had, and the said Pickett thereupon, being commanded by the Chief Justice to leave the said chair, peremptorily refused to do so, and was subsequently removed therefrom by actual force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-14\">\u201cWhereupon, it is now here by the Court adjudged that the said Charles E. Pickett is guilty of a contempt of this Court, committed in its immediate presence, by unlawfully interfering with its proceedings in manner aforesaid, and by disorderly, contemptuous, and insolent behavior towards the Court and the Judges thereof then present as aforesaid, it is now here ordered and adjudged by the Court, that for such, his contempt aforesaid, he, the said Charles E.

Pickett being still present, and having been adjudged guilty of the contempt of the Court aforesaid, in manner and form aforesaid, and the judgment of the Court in that behalf having been then and there announced in open Court, he, the said Charles E. Pickett, then and there insolently and contemptuously used and addressed to the Court then and there, being in open session, the following language in reference to the said judgment, to wit, \u2018I defy your authority.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\">\u201c Whereupon and before committing the said Charles E.

Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">The complaint contains two counts. In each count the acts complained of were committed while the defendants were sitting as the Supreme Court of this State. In substance, the complaint is that the defendants, sitting as a Court, knowing that he had not committed a contempt, and not having acquired jurisdiction over his person, falsely, willfully, and maliciously adjudged the plaintiff guilty of contempt, and ordered his imprisonment. The plaintiff asked judgment against defendants for $100,000 damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">We are not aware of any principle upon which this action can be maintained. There is no question but that the Supreme Court of this State had jurisdiction to adjudge as to contempts, and to punish therefor. It therefore had jurisdiction of the subject-matter. In the recent case of <em>Turpen </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>56 Cal. 65, we had occasion to consider a case similar to this in principle, and in which we referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>13 Wall. 334, where it was held that judges of courts of record of superior or general jurisdiction are not liable to civil actions for their judicial acts, even when the acts are in excess of their jurisdiction, and are alleged to have been done corruptly and maliciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">We are of opinion that the complaint shows upon its face that plaintiff had no cause of action against the defendants, and that the demurrer was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
