No note accompanied the mortgage. The Court below found that the mortgage, according to its terms, was due and payable August 16th, 1876, and that plaintiff\u2019s testator received it after maturity, and subject to all equities existing between the parties thereto; that there was no debt due said Sbarboro by defendant at the time of the giving, of the mortgage; that there was no consideration for the mortgage, and that the same was not negotiable; that defendant had not been guilty of any fraud or negligence to plaintiff\u2019s detriment, and that plaintiff acquired nothing by the purchase of the mortgage, as against defendant.
