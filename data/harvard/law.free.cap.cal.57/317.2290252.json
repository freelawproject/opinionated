(Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 318-325; <em>McCracken </em>v. <em>City and County of San </em>Francisco, 16 Cal. 591; <em>Simson </em>v. Eckstein, 22 id. 581; <em>Arrington </em>v.

The special findings of the jury having been found for the defendants, and being inconsistent with the general verdict, the former controls the latter, and judgment should have been given for defendant accordingly. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 625; <em>Leese </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>20 Cal. 426; <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>Higby, </em>23 id. 489.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-9\">The second question submitted to the jury, \u201c Was it, under a claim of right, made in good faith ? \u201d is not a distinct and controlling element of a defense under the statute, as contra-distinguished and separate from the term \u201c adverse possession.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-10\">The law is now well settled, that it is of no consequence whether the defendants\u2019 \u201c claim of title \u201d is made in good or bad faith, honest or dishonest, provided the possession has been <em>adverse; that is, inconsistent with the title of the claimant who is out of possession.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-11\">\u201c It is the nature of the Statute of Limitations, when applied to civil actions, to mature a wrong into a right by cutting off the remedy. To warrant its application in ejectment, the books require color of title by deed or other documental semblance of right in the defendant, <em>only when the defense is founded on a constructive adverse possession.\u201d (Humbert </em>v. <em>Trinity </em>Church, 24 Wend. 587 ; <em>Bogardus </em>v. <em>Trinity Church, </em>4 Sandf. Ch. 633-738; <em>Munroe </em>v. <em>Merchant, </em>26 Barb. 383-402.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>B. S. Brooks, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-5\">In <em>McCracken </em>v. <em>The City, </em>16 Cal. 635, it is said, that \u201cto render a possession adverse, so as to set the Statute of Limitations in motion, it must be accompanied with <em>a claim of title, </em>and this claim, when founded\" upon a written instrument, as being a conveyance of the premises, must be asserted in good faith in the belief that he has good right to the premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-6\">In the following cases, in this Court, the \u201c claim of title \u201d is commented upon as a necessary element of the defense. <em>(Nieto </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>21 Cal. 455; <em>Page </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>28 id. 605; <em>King </em>v. <em>Randlett, </em>33 id. 318; <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Daugoney, </em>33 id. 505; <em>Simson </em>v. <em>Eckstein, </em>22 id. 580; <em>LeRoy </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>30 id. 229.) And the same has been held in many recent cases, down to <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>54 Cal. 547.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b339-7\">The Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In this action, which is ejectment, the defendants pleaded, among other defenses, the Statute of Limitations. The jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff, and the following answers to the following special issues: \u201c 2. Was it (the possession of the land by the defendants), under a claim of right, made in good faith? No. 3. Was it adverse to plaintiff? Yes. 4. Did it continue for five years uninterruptedly before the commencement of this action? Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Assuming that the question of good faith entered into the question of adverse possession (and the Court below instructed the jury that it did), the finding that defendants held adverse possession of the disputed premises necessarily included a finding that such holding was in good faith. But the jury in another and distinct finding declared that the holding was not, under a claim of right, made in good faith. Upon the assumption that the question of good faith was material, the findings on the question of adverse possession were therefore contradictory. On the other hand, if the question of good faith was immaterial, the finding that defendants had held adverse possession of the premises for the statutory period would control the general verdict, and the defendants would be entitled to judgment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the verdict. But as the case was submitted to the jury upon the theory that good faith was a necessary element in the defense of adverse possession, and as upon that theory the findings of the jury are contradictory, we think it proper to remand the cause for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for anew trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
