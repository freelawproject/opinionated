Their cattle, when in a very poor condition, and in a dry season when there was no food for them except at a distance, were excluded by the defendants from land where the plaintiffs had a right to have them, from which a cause of action arose, and by which they suffered some damage. The nonsuit was improperly granted, and the judgment and order denying defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial are consequently reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">Sharpstein, J., and Myrick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
