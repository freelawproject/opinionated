By the Act of March 30th, 1878 (Stats. 1877\u201478, p. 645), the mayor and council were authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>to provide by ordinance for the licensing, regulating, restraining, suppressing, and prohibiting, or either, of any or all hawkers, peddlers, etc., in said city; to fix the amount of license tax, and to enforce the payment of the license tax by fine and imprisonment, or either.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We are not advised by the petition in this case, or by the-complaint upon which the warrant was issued, that the vegetables, for the vending of which the petitioner was arrested, were the productions of this State; but granting such to be the case, we see no conflict between the section of the Political Code and the city ordinance. The Political Code is for the State at large, and relates to traveling peddlers; while the ordinance is authorized by the Legislature, and is a part of the local police regulation of the city, and relates to matters within the city. Our attention has not been called to any general statute which, in terms or by implication, prohibits the imposition of a license tax as a police regulation. In the absence of such prohibition, we apprehend that a city may pass such ordinances as may be consistent with its charter. The ordinance in question is in harmony with, though perhaps of different application from, the Political Code. There being no conflict, the ordinance, in this respect, is not affected by the new Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The petitioner is remanded to custody, and the writ dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">McKinstry, J., Sharpstein, J., Ross, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
