There was a small warehouse there, in which goods were occasionally placed. These goods were simply thrown out on the bank, without notice or warning to the consignees.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b482-12\">Ross, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">This action was brought to recover damages for the alleged loss, by the defendant, of certain grain sacks, shipped by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>plaintiffs at the City of San Francisco, over defendant\u2019s road, and destined for Jacinto, in Colusa County. The complaint charges that defendant was, at the times therein mentioned, a common carrier of goods for hire, between San Francisco and Jacinto, and that the plaintiffs delivered to defendant, between the 11th of June and the 23d of July, 1874, the sacks for transportation to the point named, and paid the freight thereon, and that defendant failed in its duty as common carrier, by which failure the goods were lost, to the plaintiffs\u2019 damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\">The defendant, by its answer, denied that it ever was a common carrier between San Francisco and Jacinto, but averred that its route on that line terminated at Knight\u2019s Landing; denied that it received the goods in question for transportation to any point beyond Knight\u2019s Landing, to which point, it averred, it safely transported them, and there delivered the same to the Central Pacific Bailroad Company, a competent carrier, carrying to Jacinto, the place of address.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">There is no dispute about the fact that the sacks were safely carried by the defendant to Knight\u2019s Landing, and were there placed on board the boat Governor Dana, by which they were safely transported to Jacinto, at which point they were placed on the bank of the river at the landing. From this place it appears they were lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">There was no evidence of any special contract on the part of the defendant to carry the sacks to any point beyond its own route. If, therefore, its own route terminated at Knight\u2019s Landing, its liability ceased when it carried the goods to that point and delivered them in safety on board of the boat Governor Dana. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2201.) But did the defendant\u2019s route terminate at Knight\u2019s Landing ? was one of the important issues in the case. It is contended by the counsel for appellant, that the affirmative of this proposition is indisputably shown by the evidence. We do not think that can be fairly said from the record before us. It is true that Mr. Gunn, the secretary of the defendant, testified explicitly that at the time of the transaction in question the defendant\u2019s route ended at Knight\u2019s Landing, and that the boats plying on the Sacramento Biver between that point and Jacinto were owned and operated by the Central Pacific Bailroad, a separate and distinct corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>ration. And there was other testimony corroborative of his statement. But there was other testimony still going to show that the defendant operated and had control of the entire route from San Francisco to Jacinto. Thus, shortly after the goods in question were shipped, Capt. Foster, who it is shown had charge of the boats plying between ICnight\u2019s Landing and Jacinto, wrote the following letter to one of the plaintiffs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-3\">\u201c Office of the California Pacific R. R. Co., Saceamento, July 24th, 1874.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">\u201c A. Bullard, Esq., <em>Chico.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\"><em>''Dear </em>Sir\u2014Yours of the 20th instant, relating to agent at Jacinto, is received. Galland &amp; Aronson act as agents for the company at Jacinto, to the extent of receiving and delivering goods, collecting bills, etc. Communications relating to business other than the above should be addressed to me at Sacramento, or to J. C. Stubbs, General Freight Agent, San Francisco. Yours truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">(Signed) \u201c Albebt Foster.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Here is a letter from the agent having control of all the boats plying between Knight\u2019s Landing and Jacinto, in response to a letter from one of the plaintiffs (and in respect to this very freight), entitled \u201c Office of the <em>California Pacific Railroad </em>Company,\u201d and in which he informs Bullard that Galland &amp; Aronson act as agents for the company (the California Pacific Eailroad Company) at Jacinto, to the extent of \u201c <em>receiving and delivering goods, </em>collecting bills, etc.\u201d In addition to this, several witnesses testified that, for goods shipped by the boats from Jacinto and other points beyond Knight\u2019s Landing, receipts were usually given in the name of the California Pacific Eailroad Company, and that the money for such freights, as well as for passage from these points, was paid to the California Pacific Eailroad Company. This testimony was sufficient to sustain the finding involved in the verdict of the jury, that the route of the defendant extended to Jacinto.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">It is next urged for the appellant, that, if this be true, the goods in question were delivered at Jacinto, in the manner usual at that place. Jacinto, it appears, was, at the time referred to in the record, a small landing place on the Sacramen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>to Elver, having less than twenty inhabitants. The consignees of the goods resided some miles from there. And there was testimony given at the trial that it was customary in delivering freight at Jacinto to place it on the bank of the river, whether the consignee was present or not. Whether a deposit of the goods in this manner would have been a good delivery, if there was nothing else in the case on that subject, need not be determined, for the reason that there is testimony in the record going to show that the defendant had agents at Jacinto for the reception of goods consigned to that place, whose duty it was to receive them. The letter from Foster, already quoted, distinctly states that \u201c Galland &amp; Aronson act as agents for the company at Jacinto, to the extent of <em>receiving and, delivering goods, </em>collecting bills, etc.\u201d There is other testimony in the case which, though evasive, also tends to show, not only that Galland &amp; Aronson were agents for the defendant at Jacinto for the purpose of receiving and delivering goods, but that they had a freight house there, in which freight other than their own, transported by the defendant, might have been, and sometimes was, put. We extract from the testimony of Alley, who was clerk on the Governor Dana at the time the plaintiffs\u2019 goods were shipped:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-3\">\u201c Q. Was not Galland and Aronson the agents at Jacinto for the purpose of receiving and delivering goods at that point ? A. Were they not what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">\" Q. Were they not agents of the company at Jacinto for the purpose of receiving and delivering goods at that point ? A. I never understood that they were agents of the company more than collecting bills ; that is all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">\u201c Q. Only collecting bills ? A. That is as far as their-agency extended, to my knowledge. I never knew they had any authority to act as agents otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u201c Q. Whom did you get that from, and where ? A. Well, I do not know where I got it from ; that is the general impression that I had. I do not know as any one told me so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">\u201c Q. Captain Foster would know more about their position towards the company than you would, wouldn\u2019t he ? A. Yes, sir; he would be apt to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">\u201c Q. They did used to take a hand sometimes in receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>goods up there, didn\u2019t they ? A. Well, I cannot say that they ever did, only this way, that they would almost always have goods of their own.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-3\">\u201c Q. I am speaking of other people\u2019s goods. A. Ho, sir. Well, many, many times\u2014they had not done so many times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">\u201c Q. I suppose so; they may have been off to Chico, but have they not done so sometimes ? A. Have not they received there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">\u201c Q. Eeceived goods belonging to other people there at Jacinto? A. How do you mean, give a receipt for the goods?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201c Q. Ho; they don\u2019t have to give receipts to receive goods where there is only five men in a town. A. They have received goods this way: I have said to Aronson, \u2018 There is So-and-So\u2019s goods \u2019; for instance, ' There is Papst\u2019s goods,\u2019 or \u2018 Mudd <em>&amp; </em>Mitchell\u2019s goods \u2019; and he said, ' All right \u2019; that is all the reception there was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\u201c Q. That is enough for me. They used to receive money up there, too, didn\u2019t they? A. Yes, sir; they have collected money for the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">\u201c Q. They were generally at the landing on the bank, as you call it, when these boats arrived ? A. It cannot be otherwise, because their goods came right to the landing where their freight house was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">\u201c Q. That had to be ? A. They had to be there; their freight house was right on the edge of the river.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">\u201c Q. You have never put other people\u2019s freight besides theirs in that little house, have you? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">\u201c Q. That belonged to the neighborhood round about ? A. We have put it in. They have not asked us to do, nor told us to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">\u201c Q. The company has done it? A. We have done so, for this reason: We would say, we do not want to leave them out on the bank, and we will put it in your warehouse, we would say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-13\">\u201c Q. That is very reasonable. How often have you done that little thing ? A. Well, I cannot tell how often: a number of times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-14\">\u201c Q. Did you ever call Aronson out when these bags were being delivered, or any bags, and count them out to him? A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Yes, sir. I looked round for him once to count a lot of bags for a consignee, but I could not find him. I wanted him to do it to satisfy the consignee that we had delivered the goods correctly. I could not find him; he was not there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">\u201c Q. I am asking you, when you have been discharging freight at Jacinto, whether you have not called Aronson to come and overlook the count ? A. I have done so; yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">If the defendant had agents at Jacinto for the reception of goods consigned to that point, and such agents neglected to receive and care for the plaintiffs\u2019 goods, and by reason of such neglect the goods were lost, the defendant is undoubtedly liable therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">On the question of fact involved, the finding was against the defendant. We cannot say it was not correctly so. Those facts being thus determined, judgment properly went for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">McKee, J., and McKinstry, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
