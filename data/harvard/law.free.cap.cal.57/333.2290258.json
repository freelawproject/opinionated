Said no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>tice shall be published at least once a week, for four successive weeks, in a newspaper printed in the county in which the application is made, if there is one; if there be none so published, then a newspaper published in any county adjoining said county.\u201d (Section 8 of Act of 1852, as amended April 27th, 1863; Hittell\u2019s General Laws, p. 554.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The proceeding is <em>in </em>invitum, and as the insolvency Court could acquire jurisdiction only after the notice had been published <em>at least </em>as often as <em>once a week, </em>for four successive weeks, the record should show a compliance with this material requirement by testimony which is unambiguous. The Court should have required proof that the exact publication had been made which the statute required. oThe words \u201cat least\u201d relate as well to the frequency of the publication as to the period during which it is to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The statute evidently contemplates that each of the three last publications (of the four) shall occur with an interval of not more than <em>one week </em>between it and that which immediately precedes it. It does not provide that the publication shall be made at least once in four successive weeks, but\u2014in effect\u2014that there shall be four publications not more than seven days apart. If, therefore, the affidavit can be construed as stating that there was one publication during each of four successive weeks, it does not prove that the publication is such as is required by the statute. There may have been twelve or thirteen days between two of the publications, and, if so, the direction of the statute that the publication must be \u201c at least once a week \u201d has not been obeyed. The word^s \u201c at least \u201d were not employed in the Act of Congress construed in <em>Ronkendorff </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>4 Peters, 349, and even if we were inclined to follow the views there expressed by Mr. Justice McLean, a distinction may be drawn between the language of the Act of Congress considered in that case, and the language of the Act of the Legislature which we are called on to construe in the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Sharpstein, J., McKee, J., Mtrick, J., and Ross, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Thornton, J., dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
