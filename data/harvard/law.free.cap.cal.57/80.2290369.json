There is a prayer for general relief, and the facts found by the Court entitle the defendants to a decree of dissolution. Under these circumstances, the question whether it should be decreed or not, was one which addressed itself to the sound discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>of the Court which tried the case. And its judgment will not be disturbed, unless it be made to appear that such discretion has been abused. (N. <em>C. &amp; S. C. Co. v. Kidd, </em>37 Cal. 282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Nor did the Court err in decreeing a sale of all the partnership property, which would include debts due to the firm. It might have provided for the collection of these ; but it was within the power and discretion of the Court to decree a sale of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The appeal is from the judgment, and as that appears to he sufficiently supported by the findings, it follows that it must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Myrick, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
