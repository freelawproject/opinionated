D. Haynie.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">S &amp; Q was the contractor on a public construction project for the City of Stockton. Hartford was its surety on a bond furnished in accordance with the provisions of section 4200 et seq. of the Government Code. Haynie was a subcontractor on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Haynie sued S &amp; Q and Hartford to recover the balance allegedly due for work performed. In a separate action S &amp; Q sought damages from Haynie for negligence in connection with a part of the contract not sublet to Haynie. The cases were consolidated for trial and recovery was in favor of Haynie in his action against S &amp; Q and Plartford and also in S &amp; Q\u2019s action against Haynie.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Thereafter S &amp; Q alone appealed from the judgment entered in each action. Hartford did not appeal from the judgment entered against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\"> The petition filed in this court does not disclose that S &amp; Q has complied with the provisions of section 942 of the Code of Civil Procedure requiring an undertaking to stay execution of a money judgment. Under such circumstances this court would not be warranted in ordering a stay of execution.  \u201cThere is no constitutional right to an appeal; the appellate procedure is entirely statutory and subject to complete legislative control. A corollary of this rule is that the Legislature may impose any condition or restriction upon the granting of a stay of execution pending an appeal.\u201d <em>(Trede </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>21 Cal.2d 630, 634 [134 P.2d 745].)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">Supersedeas may not be granted Hartford because it may only be allowed in connection with an appeal actually taken. <em>(Ex parte Ralston, </em>119 U.S. 613 [7 S.Ct. 317, 30 L.Ed. 506]; <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>110 Cal.App.2d 660 [243 P.2d 556], and eases cited therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">Neither party has asserted sufficient facts to warrant the issuance of a writ of prohibition even if this were a matter in which prohibition is a proper remedy. Each had an adequate remedy by appellate procedures which has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>pursued. Under such circumstances it is improper to issue a writ of prohibition. (3 Witkin, California Procedure, pp. 2506-2510.)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The stay order issued in the case of <em>S &amp; Q Construction Company </em>v. <em>M. D. Haynie et al., </em>which is numbered 71699 on the docket of the Superior Court of the County of San Joaquin, is discharged; and the stay order issued in the case of <em>M. D. Haynie </em>v. <em>S &amp; Q Construction Company, </em>a corporation, and <em>Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, </em>a corporation, which is numbered 72364 on the docket of the Superior Court of the County of San Joaquin, is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The order to show cause heretofore issued is discharged and the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Pierce, P. J., and Friedman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 4, 1963.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
