Sonners to pay $92,500 for defendant\u2019s residence in Beverly Hills, together with all carpets and draperies. This offer was typed in plaintiff\u2019s office on a printed form provided by plaintiff and designated: \u201cDeposit Receipt, Purchase and Sale Agreement and Agreement: Broker's Commission. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">On the same day at approximately 6 p. m. Miss Joelson telephoned the $92,500 offer to defendant, who replied that he would not sell for less than $97,500. She inquired as to whether he would give a counteroffer and defendant replied in the affirmative and requested Miss Joelson to come to his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">Miss Joelson proceeded to defendant\u2019s home, where they discussed: reduction of escrow period from 90 to 30 days, finally arriving at a 60-day escrow period; a price of $97,500 and the appliances which would pass with the property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>She drew lines through the words \u201cNinety two thousand\u201d arid wrote \u201cNinety-Seven Thousand\u201d above the original typed words. She drew lines through the figure \u201c92,500.00\u201d and wrote \u201c97,500\u201d above the original typed figure. She drew lines through the figures $5,000, $5,000, $82,500 and $92,500 and on the margin of each wrote the figures 5,000, 5,000, 87,500 and 97,500. Defendant initialled each of the six changes made by her. Defendant also drew lines through the figures \u201c90\u201d concerning the escrow period, wrote the figures \u201c60\u201d in the same space and initialled this change. Defendant then signed in one place on the bottom portion of the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Miss Joelson then left and later the same evening telephoned the buyers. She informed them that the price was raised to $97,500; escrow period shortened to 60 days; and that the seller (i.e. defendant) had authorized and instructed her to include the appliances. The buyers replied that they wanted time to think about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">On the next day, Saturday, Miss Joelson told the buyers that defendant would sell for $97,500 including the appliances; and that he (i.e., defendant) had given her authority to say the appliances were included, to which the buyers replied that they would like to try a compromise of $95,000. That evening Miss Joelson telephoned defendant and he stated, \u201cNo, I will not sell the house for $95,000. It has to be $97,500. \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">On Sunday, the following day, Miss Joelson showed the house to the buyers and while they sat in Miss Joelson\u2019s automobile she added the six appliances, whereupon the buyers initialled the changes in price, escrow and the appliances. That evening Miss Joelson telephoned defendant and stated that she had sold the house for $97,500, which included the appliances.3 After reading the list of appliances and changes, to which defendant replied, \u201cthat\u2019s fine,\u201d defendant said to Miss Joelson, \u201cyou march yourself down to the Escrow at the Bank of America, title search has been started, everything is set for you. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">On Monday, June 22, 1959, pursuant to instructions by defendant, Miss Joelson left the deposit receipt with the escrow officer. On the following day, Tuesday, June 23, 1959, the escrow officer informed Miss Joelson that he (i.e., escrow officer) was instructed by defendant not to write up escrow instructions, that defendant had told him that he (i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>defendant) wanted the termite clause omitted from the escrow instructions, although the termite clause was in the deposit receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">On the same day Miss Joelson went to defendant\u2019s office and later saw defendant, who said that he had nothing to say to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Later the bank prepared escrow instructions which called for sale of the residence with all carpets and draperies, and the six appliances. The buyers signed one set of escrow papers and deposited $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Still referring to Tuesday, June 23, Mr. Danielson telephoned Miss Joelson, said he was attorney for defendant, and at defendant\u2019s request he had read the deposit receipt, which he thought provided that $10,000 would be paid outside of escrow and wanted to know from Miss Joelson when and where the $10,000 would be paid to his client. Mr. Danielson also mentioned: that only wall to wall carpets would be sold; that there would be no termite inspection; and that possession would not be given until his client\u2019s (i.e., defendant\u2019s) apartment was ready. Miss Joelson asked if she could satisfy his client by depositing additional monies in escrow and Mr. Danielson said he would find out.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">On Thursday, June 25, another $5,000 was deposited by the buyers. Plaintiff deposited in escrow the $5,000 received as a down payment, and buyers signed one set of escrow instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Mr. Danielson testified that he had notified defendant that $15,000 was now deposited in escrow. He further testified that Miss Joelson had telephoned that there was no problem concerning carpets because the buyers agreed to take only the wall to wall carpets. He further admitted that payment of $10,000 outside of escrow was not again mentioned in this or in later conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Defendant and buyers had two or three conversations after the escrow was opened in which defendant mentioned that the buyers were getting the appliances and granted buyers\u2019 request to have their remodeling contractor enter the premises in furtherance of buyers\u2019 remodeling plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Certain escrow amendments were prepared at defendant\u2019s request and typed by the escrow officer pursuant to instruction by defendant\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">On February 2, 1960, plaintiff filed its complaint for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>broker\u2019s commission. Defendant\u2019s answer was filed March 21, 1960. The pretrial conference was held on June 2, 1961, and the conference order was filed June 12, 1961. It incorporates by reference a joint pretrial statement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">On November 29, 1961, the findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed.6 Judgment was entered on December 4, 1961.7</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Before discussing the various contentions raised by defendant on this appeal, a further summary of the essential facts will be helpful in bringing the problems presented into sharp focus.8</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\"><em>First, </em>on June 19, 1959, defendant seller executed a written and subscribed counteroffer and verbally told and authorized the saleslady, Miss Joelson, to insert certain appliances in said written counteroffer;</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\"><em>Second, </em>on June 21, 1959, pursuant to the aforesaid verbal authorization, Miss Joelson did in fact insert the appliances in defendant\u2019s written counteroffer;</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\"><em>Third, </em>subsequently, on June 21, 1959, the buyers accepted the counteroffer containing the list of appliances; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\"><em>Fourth, </em>on June 21, 1959, Miss Joelson informed defendant that the buyers had accepted the counteroffer and defendant verbally reaffirmed his counteroffer and his authorization to Miss Joelson to insert the appliances in the counteroffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Defendant contends that \u201cThe Writing Upon Which Plaintiff Relies as a Binding Agreement Between Buyers and Owner [i.e. defendant] Is Invalid Under the Statute of Frauds. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">The thrust of defendant\u2019s contention is that the real estate saleslady, Miss Joelson, could not alter the counteroffer signed by defendant unless authorized to do so in writing; that since Miss Joelson was not authorized by written instrument to insert the six appliances in defendant\u2019s counteroffer, plaintiff did not procure a buyer ready, able and willing to purchase on the terms subscribed by defendant (i.e. when defendant subscribed his written counteroffer it did not contain the six appliances).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">It is established that for a broker to recover a commission he must procure within the time specified in his employment contract a buyer ready, able and willing to purchase on the terms authorized. <em>(Andrews </em>v. <em>Waldo, </em>205 Cal. 764, 771 [272 P. 1052] ; <em>McRae </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>170 Cal. 74, 78 [148 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>P. 215] ; <em>Lawrence Bloch Co. </em>v. <em>Palston, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 300, 307 [266 P.2d 856] ; <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Glendon, </em>124 Cal.App.2d 634, 638 [268 P.2d 1089].)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">When the buyers accepted the written counteroffer, said counteroffer bore defendant\u2019s signature and contained the list of appliances.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The first question to be resolved is whether Miss Joelson had authority to insert the six appliances in defendant\u2019s counteroffer after defendant had executed the counteroffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">There is substantial evidence in the record to establish that defendant in fact gave verbal authority to Miss Joelson to insert the six appliances in his counteroffer. The trial court found (finding of fact V) that when defendant executed the counteroffer he \u201ctold and authorized said Rose Joelson to insert in said deposit receipt the appliances\u201d and that she, pusuant to defendant\u2019s instructions \u201cinserted and listed in said instrument, the appliances enumerated as aforesaid . . . on June 21, 1959 in her car when parked in front of the home of Defendant, who was not in the car at the time.\u201d There is substantial evidence to establish the fact and the trial court found (finding of fact VI) that after the buyers accepted the counter offer \u201cincluding said appliances inserted and listed by Rose Joelson. . . . [she] informed Defendant that buyers had accepted his changes and would purchase the real and personal properties therein described including the appliances as provided in the agreement. When Rose Joelson informed Defendant that the buyers had accepted his counter offer, Defendant reaffirmed his said counter offer including the appliances and his authorization to Rose Joelson to insert the appliances.\u201d There is substantial evidence to establish the fact and the trial court found (finding of fact X) that \u201cDefendant accepted and approved all terms including aforesaid appliances inserted in Exhibit 2 and did ratify, confirm, approve and reaffirm that Defendant did authorize Rose Joelson to insert and list said appliances in said Exhibit 2. Defendant did ratify, confirm and reaffirm said changes and the list of appliances inserted as aforesaid as the act of Defendant after Defendant had signed said instrument Exhibit 2 as seller.\u201d There is substantial evidence to establish the fact and the trial court found (finding of fact XV) that defendant \u201caccepted the buyers and approved and reaffirmed his counter offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Defendant devotes many pages of argument to the proposition that verbal authority to insert the list of appliances into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the signed counteroffer is violative of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Whether or not defendant\u2019s verbal authorization given to insert the appliances in defendant\u2019s signed counter offer was legally effective at the time said authorization was given, it is clear that once the list of appliances was in fact inserted in defendant\u2019s signed counter offer, defendant could then reaffirm it by the adoption of his prior signature. It is stated in 37 Corpus Juris Secundum, Frauds, Statute of, section 202, page 696:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\"><em>\u201cAn adoption of a prior signature </em>made by the parties, with the intent to authenticate the instrument, is sufficient to comply with the requirements of the statute of frauds.\u201d (Italics shown.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Defendant\u2019s next contention is that defendant\u2019s obligation to pay plaintiff its commission was dependent upon the consummation of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Defendant\u2019s reliance upon the case of <em>Lawrence Block Co. </em>v. <em>Palston, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 300 [266 P.2d 856] is misplaced. What was stated in <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Vickter Manor, Inc., </em>47 Cal.2d 875 [306 P.2d 783] is dispositive of defendant\u2019s contention,  The court stated at pages 880-881 as follows in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">\u2018\u2018[3] Defendants rely on <em>Lawrence Block Co. </em>v. <em>Palston </em>(1954) 123 Cal.App.2d 300, 305-306 [266 P.2d 856], It is there correctly determined that \u2018To entitle a broker to a commission for a sale of real property it must be established that in pursuance of his contract and within the time specified therein, he found a purchaser ready, able, and willing to buy on the terms and conditions specified in the contract of employment, or, if the exact terms are not specified in his contract, upon terms satisfactory and acceptable to his employer.\u2019  However, defendants assert, the only right of plaintiffs to recover a commission grows out of the written deposit receipt between the buyer and seller, and therefore the following statement in the Block Company case is controlling: \u2018Where the only agreement to pay a broker a commission is contained in the contract between his principal and the customer, the broker\u2019s right to compensation is dependent upon performance of that contract.\u2019 But this statement does not indiscriminately control every three-party writing signed by the broker, his principal, and the customer. [4] Such a three-party writing may unequivocally specify, or where uncertain may be construed or shown by extrinsic evidence to mean, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the broker has fully performed the duties of his employment and earned his commission by having obtained a buyer ready, able, and willing to proceed with a purchase in accord with those terms of the writing which define the seller\u2019s offer\u2014the offer for which the seller employed the broker to produce a qualified acceptor. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Plaintiff did obtain a buyer ready, able and willing to proceed with a purchase in accord with those terms of defendant\u2019s reaffirmed counteroffer. (See findings of fact\u2014footnote 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The court went on to state at page 881:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">\u201cEven if we assume that the agreement between plaintiff brokers and defendant corporation can properly be construed to mean that plaintiffs were not to receive their commission until consummation of a final agreement between the corporation and the buyer . . . [the] plaintiffs and the buyer did everything which the agreement required of them and that consummation was prevented solely by the arbitrary refusal of defendant ... to proceed with the transaction. [6] In these circumstances, the defendants will not be allowed to take advantage of their own remissness to defeat plaintiff\u2019s recovery. [Citations.]\u201d (See <em>Lathrop </em>v. <em>Gauger, </em>127 Cal. App.2d 754, 770 [274 P.2d 730]; 9 Cal.Jur.2d, Brokers, \u00a7 95, p. 266.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">It is equally clear that \u2018 \u2018 Competition of said sale pursuant to said instrument Exhibit 2 was prevented solely by the arbitrary refusal by Defendant as seller to proceed with the transaction.\u201d (Finding of fact XII-footnote 6.) And that \u201cDefendant arbitrarily, and without cause, refused to sign the escrow papers or proceed with the sale and perform his agreement Exhibit A.\u201d (Finding of fact XVI\u2014footnote 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Exhibit 2 contains a provision for reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cif suit be commenced to collect said commission.\u201d Plaintiff requests that this court allow reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees for services rendered on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\"> A contract for a reasonable attorneys \u2019 fee in enforcing its provisions embraces an allowance for legal services rendered upon appeal as well as during trial. <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>54 Cal.2d 264, 272 [5 Cal.Rptr. 317, 352 P.2d 725] ; <em>Dankert </em>v. <em>Lamb Finance Co., </em>146 Cal.App.2d 499, 503-504 [304 P.2d 199].) The trial court fixed the sum of $750 as reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees for services rendered in that court. It appears that $500 is a reasonable sum to be allowed for attorneys\u2019 fees on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The judgment is affirmed, and defendant is ordered to pay to plaintiff additional attorneys\u2019 fees on this appeal in the sum of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Wood, P.
