On appeal, the defendant claims that his guilty pleas were constitutionally defective because the court\u2019s canvass was inadequate and his pleas were not knowing and intelligent. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our disposition of the defendant\u2019s appeal. On July 16, 2008, the defendant pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to possession of less than four ounces of marijuana, evading responsibility and assault of a police officer. He also admitted a violation of probation. In exchange for the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas and admission, pursuant to a <em>Garvin </em>agreement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court delayed sentencing for four months on the condition that the defendant not be arrested for any new conduct before his sentencing hearing; if he violated that condition, he would not be permitted to withdraw his guilty pleas and would be subject to the maximum sentence allowed for the offenses to which he pleaded guilty and for his violation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Near the outset of the plea canvass, when the court explained that the defendant could either enter his pleas or proceed with his violation of probation hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>defendant expressed some confusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court responded that it could not accept the defendant\u2019s pleas if he did not understand his options and, therefore, instructed the defendant that he should return on August 6, 2008, for a hearing on the violation of probation charge. The defendant insisted, however, that he was ready to plead immediately. After asking the defendant, \u201cwhat don\u2019t you understand?\u201d and ascertaining that he knew that his pleas would be permanent, the court recommenced the plea canvass. Throughout the canvass, the defendant consistently responded that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>understood the proceedings and that he had not been coerced into pleading guilty. He also confirmed that defense counsel had \u201cexplained everything\u201d and that he was satisfied with counsel's representation. The court accepted his pleas and his admission and set a sentencing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In violation of the <em>Garvin </em>agreement, the defendant was arrested before the scheduled sentencing date. Subsequently, on December 17, 2008, the court sentenced him to the maximum term of thirteen years incarceration on his guilty pleas and probation violation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The defendant claims that his guilty pleas were not knowing and intelligent and, therefore, were constitutionally defective. He claims, as well, that the court\u2019s canvass was inadequate. We assess these interwoven claims together. He concedes that the claims were not preserved and requests review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As our Supreme Court has held in other cases, the record is adequate for <em>Golding </em>review because it contains a full transcript of the plea hearing and the claim is of constitutional magnitude because an inadequate plea canvass implicates due process rights. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>280 Conn. 69, 90, 905 A.2d 1101 (2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1269, 127 S. Ct. 1491, 167 L. Ed. 2d 236 (2007). The defendant\u2019s claim fails to satisfy the third <em>Golding </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>prong, however, because he has not established that a constitutional violation clearly exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Several important constitutional rights are waived by a defendant entering a guilty plea; therefore, due process requires that the waiver be knowingly and voluntarily made, and that it be affirmatively disclosed in the record. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243-44, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969). Specifically, \u201cwe require the record to disclose an act that represents a knowing choice among available alternative courses of action, an understanding of the law in relation to the facts, and sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences of the plea.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>284 Conn. 433, 451, 936 A.2d 611 (2007). \u201c[W]e conduct a plenary review of the circumstances surrounding the plea to determine if it was knowing and voluntary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burgos, </em>118 Conn. App. 465, 468, 984 A.2d 77 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The defendant claims that there were two defects in the plea canvass rendering it inadequate and that he did not waive his rights knowingly and voluntarily.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, he contends that the court failed to explain that he was giving up his right to a jury trial,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as required by Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 (5),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because the court mistakenly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>stated that the defendant was waiving his right to a <em>\u201chearing </em>before a judge or jury\u201d; (emphasis added); instead of a \u201ctrial\u201d and, therefore, that the record does not disclose that he knowingly and voluntarily gave up this right. Second, he contends that the court failed to explain the specific intent element of the charge of assault of a police officer,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as required by Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 (l),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> rendering the canvass inadequate and the record devoid of adequate evidence that he entered his plea to this charge knowingly and voluntarily. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 was designed to ensure that guilty pleas comport with due process; however, a guilty plea \u201cmay satisfy constitutional requirements even in the absence of literal compliance with the prophylactic safeguards of [Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 39-19 and 39-20].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnwell, </em>102 Conn. App. 255, 259, 925 A.2d 1106 (2007). In other words, \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d is sufficient. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>117 Conn. App. 436, 444, 979 A.2d 576 (2009), cert. denied, 295 Conn. 907, 989 A.2d 604 (2010). For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 419-20, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986), in which the trial court asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>a defendant in a plea canvass whether he understood that he was giving up his \u201c \u2018right to trial\u2019 \u201d without specifying a <em>jury </em>trial, our Supreme Court concluded that the plea canvass was constitutionally sufficient because the trial court expressly mentioned waiver of the right to trial and the defendant had both prior experience with criminal proceedings and adequate representation by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In the present case, the court\u2019s explanation of the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to a jury trial substantially complied with Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 (5), despite the fact that the court substituted the word <em>hearing </em>for the word <em>trial. </em>The court explained to the defendant before beginning the plea canvass that if he chose not to plead guilty, \u201cthe other cases you have will be placed on the trial fist and we will try those . . . .\u201d Later, the court again expressly informed the defendant that if he chose not to plead guilty, \u201cyou can have your trial.\u201d Additionally, the defendant twice affirmed that defense counsel adequately had explained everything and that he was satisfied with counsel\u2019s representation. Furthermore, the court clarified that the defendant was giving up the right to be heard \u201cbefore a judge or jury, to have an attorney represent you at that hearing, to present defenses, confront accusers, cross-examine witnesses, and you are giving up your right against self-incrimination.\u201d By expressly mentioning and describing the defendant\u2019s right to a trial, and by confirming that the defendant had access to adequate representation, the court substantially complied with Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The defendant\u2019s second argument, which is that the court did not explain adequately an element of the assault charge, is likewise unavailing. \u201cIt is well established that a plea of guilty cannot be voluntary in the sense that it constitutes an intelligent admission that the accused committed the offense unless the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>has received real notice of the true nature of the charge against him, the first and most universally recognized requirement of due process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnwell, </em>supra, 102 Conn. App. 259. This rule is embodied in Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 (1). For substantial compliance with that section, notice need not be provided by the court itself. \u201c[E]ven without an express statement by the court of the elements of the crimes charged, it is appropriate to presume that in most cases defense counsel routinely explain the nature of the offense in sufficient detail to give the accused notice of what he is being asked to admit. . . . [U]nless a record contains some positive suggestion that the defendant\u2019s attorney had <em>not </em>informed the defendant of the elements of the crimes to which he was pleading guilty, the normal presumption applies.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 259-60. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Heyliger, </em>114 Conn. App. 193, 200-202, 969 A.2d 194 (2009), this court found a \u201cpositive suggestion\u201d that it should not apply the presumption when a defendant expressly contended that defense counsel had not informed her of the elements of the charges and neither the trial court nor the attorneys initiated further discussion on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In the present case, the defendant argues that there was a positive suggestion that he had not been informed of the nature and elements of the charges; however, this contention is not supported by the record. Both the defendant and defense counsel stated during the plea canvass that they had discussed the elements of the charges. Although the defendant also expressed some confusion during that exchange, when the court queried, \u201cwhat don\u2019t you understand?\u201d the defendant\u2019s uncertainty pertained to whether the court would accept the plea deal, not the elements of the charges. Thus, this exchange was not a positive suggestion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>defense counsel failed to explain the charges, and the court could presume that defense counsel did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Moreover, the defendant was put on notice of the intent element of this charge later in the canvass, which likewise was sufficient to establish substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 (1). During her summation of the charges, the prosecutor described the defendant\u2019s crashing his car into the police officer\u2019s vehicle and \u201chitting him head-on in order to get away.\u201d This description of the defendant\u2019s intentional conduct gave him notice of the intent element and satisfied his due process rights. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>253 Conn. 1,39-40, 751 A.2d 298 (2000) (defendant acquired notice of element omitted by court from reading of charges by court clerk and state\u2019s summation). Finally, at the conclusion of the court\u2019s canvass, and after the court had heard the defendant\u2019s pleas, defense counsel represented to the court that he had explained the elements of all of the charges to the defendant. Accordingly, the plea canvass was not defective, and the defendant\u2019s pleas and admission were entered knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37-39, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\"> \u201cA <em>Garvin </em>agreement is a conditional plea agreement that has two possible binding outcomes, one that results from the defendant\u2019s compliance with the conditions of the plea agreement and one that is triggered by his violation of a condition of the agreement. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em>[242 Conn. 296, 300-302, 699 A.2d 921 (1997)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Petaway, </em>107 Conn. App. 730, 732 n.2, 946 A.2d 906, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 926, 958 A.2d 162 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\"> The transcript states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">\u201cThe Court: So, you know, if you feel that you are being pressured or between a rock and a hard place, you can have your hearing, you can have your trial.
