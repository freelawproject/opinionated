Hogberg and Richard A. Hogberg, appeal from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the defendant, the department of social services (department). The dispositive issue on appeal is whether, pursuant to the department\u2019s Uniform Policy Manual, the defendant properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>determined that the medical conditions of Richard Hogberg did not constitute exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress that would have warranted an increase in his minimum monthly needs allowance (allowance) under the medicaid program. See Department of Social Services, Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 1570.25 (D) (3) (Uniform Policy Manual). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. Lynda Hogberg, the institutionalized spouse,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has been residing at Milford Health Care Center since approximately September 1, 2004. On September 22, 2006, Richard Hogberg, the community spouse,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed an application, on behalf of his wife, with the department for medicaid benefits. In an \u201cAssessment of Spousal Assets, Notification of Results\u201d issued on March 2,2007, the department concluded that Lynda Hogberg was not currently eligible for medicaid assistance. Specifically, the department found that the total value of the plaintiffs\u2019 assets at the time of institutionalization was $817,406.71. The department found that Lynda Hogberg\u2019s share of the spousal assets was $718,866.71, and Richard Hogberg\u2019s share of the assets was $99,540. Consequently, because the maximum amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 retained assets exceeded the total of $101,140\u2014the community spouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>resource allowance of $99,540 plus $1600,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the limit for an institutionalized spouse\u2019s countable assets<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014the department determined that Lynda Hogberg was ineligible for medicaid assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">On April 23, 2007, the plaintiffs requested an administrative hearing to contest the denial of the title XIX<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> medicaid application of Lynda Hogberg and the assessment of spousal income and assets.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>held on May 17, 2007, the plaintiffs argued that Richard Hogberg suffered from four significant medical conditions\u2014the removal and replacement with a plastic unit of a valve in his heart, thyroid removal, hiatal hernia and glaucoma\u2014that constitute exceptional circumstances. According to the plaintiffs, these conditions require him to expend an extraordinary amount of money each month on prescription medications, medical insurance premiums, housekeeping and on yard work and snow removal expenses that are necessary to maintain his independence at home. Consequently, the plaintiffs claimed that Richard Hogberg\u2019s exceptional circumstances result in monthly expenses that exceed his income by a significant amount\u2014hence, circumstances that are demonstrative of his significant financial duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">As a final argument, the plaintiffs contended that if Richard Hogberg were denied the opportunity to pay for his prescriptions, he would be at an increased risk for hospitalization or the need for long-term care. Thus, they argued that his exceptional circumstances threatened his ability to remain in the <em>community.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In a decision dated July 18, 2007, the hearing officer found the following facts. At the date of the hearing, the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining funds totaled $167,569.79,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Richard Hogberg was seventy-one years old. On the basis of four reports from Richard Hogberg\u2019s treating physicians that were submitted as evidence, the hearing officer found that Richard Hogberg suffers from diabetes, hypertension, a hiatal hernia, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism. Moreover, his aortic valve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>has been replaced. Richard Hogberg takes the following medications due to his conditions: Synthroid, folic acid, Nexium, simvastatin, Travatan, Toprol, Diovan HCT and warfarin. Richard Hogberg is no longer able to do yard work, and his performing snow removal is not encouraged. In addition to yard work and snow removal services, he also pays for housekeeping services. The hearing officer found that if Richard Hogberg failed to take his medications, he would be at an increased risk of hospitalization or long-term care.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She also found that he \u201csuffers from the normal frailties of old age and [that] his circumstances are not exceptional for a seventy-one year old individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">After reciting the applicable regulations and the foregoing factual findings, the hearing officer denied the appeal, determining that Richard Hogberg did not qualify for a diversion of income from Lynda Hogberg\u2019s assets in order to provide him with a higher monthly income than his allowance. The hearing officer specifically concluded that there was \u201cno evidence that [Richard Hogberg\u2019s] circumstances prevent him from taking care of his activities of daily living. I consider [him] to suffer from [the] normal frailties of an older individual and not to be exceptional. I do not consider the need for increased costs relating to medical insurance and prescription medications to be an exceptional expense.\u201d The hearing officer concluded that because Lynda Hogberg\u2019s assets exceeded the title XIX asset limit of $1600, she was ineligible for medicaid assistance. The plaintiffs requested reconsideration of the hearing officer\u2019s decision on August 1,2007. The request was denied on August 13, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, the plaintiffs timely filed an administrative appeal with the court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The court determined that the record supported the finding that Richard Hogberg did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress because his specific medical conditions were not severe and unusual, which are requirements under Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 1570.25 (D) (3) (a). Additionally, the court also flatly rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Richard Hogberg\u2019s living situation falls under the purview of the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d provision because he suffers from significant medical conditions that require expenditures for prescriptions, medical insurance premiums, housekeeping and yard work and snow removal services at his home. In its memorandum of decision, the court noted that the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d provision was not intended to insure community spouses against indebtedness. Instead, the purpose of the provision is to provide additional income for those community spouses suffering from extraordinary or unusual circumstances that make it financially stressful to continue living independently in the community. On the basis of the Uniform Policy Manual,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the court disagreed with the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that exceptional circumstances mean any circumstances that generate expenses not provided for in the allowance. Rather, given the language and legislative history of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (B), the court stated that an increase in the allowance should be made available to alleviate a true financial hardship that is thrust upon the community spouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>by extraordinary circumstances and is beyond the community spouse\u2019s control. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the court failed to consider the reliable and substantial evidence in the record in concluding that Richard Hogberg\u2019s health did not constitute an exceptional circumstance. The plaintiffs argue that the medical documentation submitted at the hearing supports their claim that Richard Hogberg has a need for additional assets and a need for higher monthly income than is permitted by the allowance calculation. Specifically, they argue that this need is \u201cdue to his exceptional circumstances including, but not limited to his extensive and extraordinary medical conditions, costs of necessary medication, and other costs necessitated by his physical restrictions, all of which constitute exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress to him because they directly threaten his ability to remain in the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Conversely, the department argues, inter alia, that because the hearing officer found that Richard Hogberg suffered from the \u201c \u2018normal frailties of old age\u2019 \u201d and that his circumstances were \u201c \u2018not exceptional for a seventy-one year old individual\u2019,\u201d the hearing officer, as a consequence, also found that his conditions were \u201cneither \u2018unusual\u2019 nor \u2018severe\u2019 \u201d\u2014two required elements of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d under Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 1570.25 (D). Because there is substantial evidence in the record to support this finding, the department argues that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">We begin our analysis by setting forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201c[JJudicial review of the [department\u2019s] action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act [(UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189], and the scope of that review is very restricted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jim\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>Auto Body </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>285 Conn. 794, 803, 942 A.2d 305 (2008). \u201c[R]eview of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency on the weight of the evidence or questions of fact. . . . Our ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Dolgner </em>v. <em>Alander, </em>237 Conn. 272, 280, 676 A.2d 865 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">\u201cThe substantial evidence rule governs judicial review of administrative fact-finding under the UAPA. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j) (5) and (6). An administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence if the record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . The substantial evidence rule imposes an important limitation on the power of the courts to overturn a decision of an administrative agency . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 281. \u201cIt is fundamental that a plaintiff has the burden of proving that the [department], on the facts before [it], acted contrary to law and in abuse of [its] discretion .... The law is also well established that if the decision of the [department] is reasonably supported by the evidence it must be sustained.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>254 Conn. 333, 343-44, 757 A.2d 561 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">After a thorough review of the record, we cannot conclude that the department abused its discretion and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the court. Under Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 1570.25 (D) (3) (a), one of the prerequisites for circumstances to be found \u201cexcep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>tional\u201d is that they are both \u201csevere and unusual.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The hearing officer specifically concluded that Richard Hogberg was suffering from the \u201cnormal frailties of an older individual\u201d and that his \u201ccircumstances are not exceptional for a seventy-one year old\u201d man. If the medical conditions from which the community spouse suffers are not severe and unusual, \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d do not exist, and the department must deny the community spouse\u2019s request to increase the allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Furthermore, it is also clear that the court correctly applied the Uniform Policy Manual standards to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim concerning the effects of Richard Hog-berg\u2019s ailments on his daily life and on his ability to remain in the community. While the hearing officer found that Richard Hogberg incurred several expenses and hardships resulting from his ailments, what is more important is that not all of the expenses incurred as a result of his ailments were beyond his control,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and several were factored into the allowance formula.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the plaintiffs also argue that if Richard Hog-berg failed to take his medications, he would be at an increased risk of hospitalization or long-term care, there was no finding that Richard Hogberg was unable to take his medications or was at an immediate risk of being unable to take his medications. In light of the foregoing, the court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is appropriate and supported by evidence in the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-6\"> \u201cAn institutionalized spouse is a spouse who resides in a medical facility or long term care facility, or who receives home and community based services (CBS) under a Medicaid waiver, and who is legally married to someone who does not reside in such facilities or who does not receive such services.\u201d Uniform Policy Manual, \u00a7 4000.01; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (h) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\"> \u201cA community spouse is an individual who resides in the community, who does not receive home and community based services under a Medicaid waiver, who is married to an individual who resides in a medical facility or long term care facility or who receives home and community based services (CBS) under a Medicaid waiver.\u201d Uniform Policy Manual, \u00a7 4000.01; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (h) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\"> The community spouse resource allowance is defined as \u201cthe amount of the total available non-excluded assets owned by both [Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act] spouses which is protected for the community spouse and is not counted in determining the institutionalized spouse\u2019s eligibility for medicaid.\u201d Uniform Policy Manual, \u00a7 1500.01.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\"> See Uniform Policy Manual, \u00a7 4005.10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\"> \u201cTitle XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396s, commonly known as the Medicaid Act, is a federal-state cooperative program designed to provide medical assistance to persons whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of medical care.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sikand </em>v. <em>Wilson-Coker, </em>276 Conn. 618, 620, 888 A.2d 74 (2006). \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 17b-2 (8) designates the department as the state agency responsible for administering the state\u2019s medicaid program,\u201d Id., 621.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b572-9\"> In addition to the community spouse resource allowance, a community spouse is entitled to an allowance.
