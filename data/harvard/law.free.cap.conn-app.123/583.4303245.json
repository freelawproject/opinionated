The facility was operated by one or more of the defendants, Farmington Sports Arena, LLC (Arena), Dimensional Technology Group, LLC (Dimensional Technology), DiTommaso <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Associates, LLC (Associates), and Paul DiTommaso, Jr., individually (DiTommaso).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that the defendants were negligent by installing and maintaining a carpet surface in the facility that was unreasonably dangerous for soccer. The principal issue of this appeal is whether the plaintiffs claim is governed, on the one hand, by the traditional rules of law applicable to so-called premises liability claims, or, on the other hand, by rules of law that require more than those traditional rules, namely, that the plaintiff establish by expert testimony a standard of care particularly applicable to indoor soccer. The trial court, <em>Berger, J., </em>concluded that the latter was the applicable law and, accordingly, granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. We conclude that the plaintiffs claim is governed by the rules of law applicable to premises liability claims and that, pursuant to those rules, the plaintiffs claim survives summary judgment against Arena, Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso. We also conclude that the plaintiffs claim against Associates is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Accordingly, we reverse in part the trial court\u2019s judgment to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The plaintiff brought the actions underlying her appeal against the defendants in two separate actions, each pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-593, the so-called \u201cwrong defendant\u201d statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The first of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>actions was filed against Arena and alleged that Arena was in control or possession of the premises where Michelle incurred her injuries. The second action was filed against Dimensional Technology, Associates, and DiTommaso. In this action, the plaintiff asserted theories of successor corporate liability, unity of interest and ownership, and piercing the corporate veils. In response to the complaint in this action, several special defenses were filed, including the statute of limitations, res judicata and collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The defendants filed motions for summary judgment in both actions, claiming that, on the merits, the plaintiffs actions must fail for lack of evidence, inter alia, of the applicable standard of care and of notice to the defendants of any defect in the playing surface, as well as lack of evidence on the claims of piercing the corporate veils and on the plaintiffs theory of successor corporate liability. The defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions also reasserted their special defenses. After extensive submissions, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment filed by Arena. The court, therefore, concluded that the claim of negligence against Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso failed on the merits for the same reasons, and that the claims of piercing the corporate veil against DiTommaso and the successor corporate liability claim against Associates \u201cmust also fail.\u201d The court did not, however, specifically address the special defenses of the statute of limitations, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The plaintiff thereafter filed this joint appeal from the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Before addressing the merits of the plaintiffs appeal, we consider the alternate grounds for affirming the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>court\u2019s judgments; see Practice Book \u00a7 63-4 (a) (1) (A); raised by Associates, Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso, based on the special defenses filed by those defendants, and on the claimed lack of evidence supporting the plaintiffs claims of piercing the corporate veils and of successor corporate liability. Those alternate grounds arose out of the following procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In a complaint dated March 8, 2004, the plaintiff sued Associates for the injuries incurred by Michelle on March 9, 2002, at the Farmington Indoor Sports Arena, located at 21 Hyde Road in Farmington, claiming that Associates owned, controlled or possessed the soccer facility on the date of Michelle\u2019s injuries. During the coruse of discovery, it was determined, after the plaintiff deposed DiTommaso, that Associates could not have been the owner or possessor of the facility on that date because Associates was not in existence at that time, and that, at the time in question, the facility had been leased to Arena. Accordingly, on November 22, 2004, the trial court, <em>Lavine, J., </em>granted Associates\u2019 unopposed motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Thereafter, in a complaint dated January 5, 2005, the plaintiff brought the first of these actions that are the subject of this appeal, against Arena, pursuant to \u00a7 52-593. The plaintiff alleged that the correct entity to be sued for Michelle\u2019s injuries was Arena, which owned, controlled or possessed the soccer facility on the date of Michelle\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In a second complaint, dated November 22, 2005, the plaintiff brought the second of these actions, also pursuant to \u00a7 52-593, against Dimensional Technology, Associates and DiTommaso. In this action, the plaintiff alleged generally that she was asserting a claim \u201cagainst those entities/individuals who owned, controlled or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>possessed\u201d the facility, \u201cagainst those who directed others in the manner in which they owned, controlled or possessed\u201d the facility, \u201cor against those who are otherwise hable for the entities/individuals that owned, controlled or possessed\u201d the facility. More specifically, as to Associates, the plaintiff alleged that it \u201cis the successor to the other corporate defendants,\u201d namely, Arena and Dimensional Technology, and \u201cis essentially the same instrumentality as said defendants, [and] therefore, it is legally liable for the obligations of said defendants, including\u201d the plaintiffs claim. As to DiTommaso, the plaintiff alleged more specifically that \u201cthe unity of interest and ownership between . . . DiTommaso and the corporate defendants . . . was such that [he] was the alter ego of said corporate defendants,\u201d that his \u201ccontrol of [the] said corporate defendants amounted to such complete domination of the business, its practices, policies, finances, etc. that the independence of the corporate entities] ceased to exist,\u201d that as a result \u201cthe corporate veil of said defendants should be pierced as to . . . DiTommaso,\u201d and that he is therefore personally hable for the damages sustained by the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not make any specific allegations regarding Dimensional Technology. In sum, therefore, this second action is based on the general theory that, although Arena may be the corporate entity that was in control of the premises at the time of Michelle\u2019s injuries and that committed the underlying negligence, the other defendants\u2014Associates, Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso\u2014are nonetheless also liable based on the various theories of liability alleged against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We first consider Associates\u2019 argument that, as an alternate ground for affirming the judgment in its favor, the doctrine of res judicata precludes the present action against it. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, \u201cprevents a litigant from reasserting a claim that has already been decided on the merits. . . . Under claim preclusion analysis, a claim\u2014that is, a cause of action\u2014 includes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose. . . . <em>Moreover, claim preclusion prevents the pursuit of any claims relating to the cause of action which were actually made or might have been made. . . . Scalzo </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>224 Conn. 124, 127-28, 617 A.2d 440 (1992); see <em>DeLaurentis </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>220 Conn. 225, 239, 597 A.2d 807 (1991); <em>Connecticut Water Co. </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>204 Conn. 38, 43, 526 A.2d 1329 (1987). The doctrine of res judicata [applies] ... as to the parties and their privies in all other actions in the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction; <em>Wade\u2019s Dairy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>181 Conn. 556, 559, 436 A.2d 24 (1980); and promotes judicial economy by preventing relitigation of issues or claims previously resolved. <em>Scalzo </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>supra, 127; <em>Carothers </em>v. <em>Capozziello, </em>215 Conn. 82, 94, 574 A.2d 1268 (1990).\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection </em>v. <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co., </em>227 Conn. 175, 188, 629 A.2d 1116 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\u201cWe have adopted a transactional test as a guide to determining whether an action involves the same claim as an earlier action so as to trigger operation of the doctrine of res judicata. [T]he claim [that is] extinguished [by the judgment in the first action] includes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose. What factual grouping constitutes a transaction, and what groupings constitute a series, are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>be determined pragmatically, giving weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties\u2019 expectations or business understanding or usage. . . . <em>Orselet </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>206 Conn. 542, 545-46, 539 A.2d 95 (1988); see <em>Duhaime </em>v. <em>American Reserve Life Ins. Co., </em>200 Conn. 360, 364\u201465, 511 A.2d 333 (1986); see also <em>Nevada </em>v. <em>United States, </em>463 U.S. 110, 130-31 n.12, 103 S. Ct. 2906, 77 L. Ed. 2d 509 (1983); 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 24 (1982). In applying the transactional test, we compare the complaint in the second action with the pleadings and the judgment in the earlier action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection </em>v. <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co., </em>supra, 227 Conn. 189-90. Our scope of review on this issue is plenary. <em>Testa </em>v. <em>Geressy, </em>286 Conn. 291, 306, 943 A.2d 1075 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Application of these principles leads to the conclusion that the judgment rendered against the plaintiff and in favor of Associates in November, 2004, precludes the plaintiffs present claim against Associates. Although the claim in 2004 was based on the allegation that Associates was in possession or control of the soccer facility in question, and the present claim is based on allegations that Associates, as a successor company to Arena and as essentially the same instrumentality as Arena, is liable for the obligations of Arena, including the plaintiffs claim, the doctrine of claim preclusion nonetheless operates in this situation because the doctrine precludes, not only the same claim as previously asserted, but also any claim relating to the cause of action that might have been made. The present claim against Associates could have been made in the 2004 litigation. Simply because a different legal and factual theory is now asserted against the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>defendant based on the same transaction does not relieve the plaintiff of the constraints imposed by the claim preclusion doctrine. See <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Infinity Ins. Co., </em>282 Conn. 594, 608, 922 A.2d 1073 (2007); <em>Delahunty </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 582, 589, 674 A.2d 1290 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The plaintiff argues that this claim involves a transaction different from the first because the first set of allegations involved \u201cthe selection, purchase, installation and maintenance of an allegedly dangerous flooring surface,\u201d whereas the second set of allegations involves \u201cthe merger or consolidation of interests between [Associates] and the other corporate defendants.\u201d This argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Under the pragmatic method of evaluating whether the first and second claims are the same for purposes of claim preclusion, these two claims are the same. Although in form the second claim involves the alleged corporate consolidation and unity of instrumentality between Arena and Associates, in substance they both involve the claim of negligence in installing and maintaining the allegedly dangerous flooring. The claimed corporate identity between Arena and Associates is only relevant because of the underlying claim of negligence. Furthermore, both claims form a convenient trial unit\u2014 indeed, it is difficult to imagine a trial against Associates that also would not involve the underlying claim of negligence\u2014and the linkage in the second claim with the claim of negligence asserted against Arena indicates that their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties\u2019 expectations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">We next consider certain arguments made by Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso jointly as alternate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>grounds for affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment in their favor. They first argue that \u00a7 52-593, the so-called \u201cwrong defendant\u201d statute, does not apply in this case because this lawsuit is \u201cagainst a party against whom judgment was previously granted, plus two <em>additional defendants, </em>[namely, Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso], neither of whom had been sued at all in the past. To allow this would be an inappropriate extension of the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Thus, these defendants maintain that \u201c[i]n this case, the plaintiff never made any effort or attempt to pursue causes of action against either [Dimensional Technology or DiTommaso] prior to the running of the two year statute of limitations found in [General Statutes \u00a7] 52-584.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, the operation of [\u00a7 52-593] is void ab initio, and this suit cannot be maintained against any party, particularly\u201d Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We first note that because this question is one of statutory interpretation, our scope of review is plenary. <em>Marandino </em>v. <em>Prometheus Pharmacy, </em>294 Conn. 564, 574, 986 A.2d 1023 (2010). Furthermore, because this statute is not clear and unambiguous, we are not constrained by the plain meaning rule. <em>Cogan </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Auto Financial Corp., </em>276 Conn. 1, 7-8, 882 A.2d 597 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The argument by Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso overlooks both the language and purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>of \u00a7 52-593. This statute provides, in general terms, that if a plaintiff has failed to obtain judgment \u201cby reason of failure to name the right person as defendant therein,\u201d she may, within one year of the termination of the prior action, \u201cbring a new action <em>and the statute of limitations shall not be a bar thereto </em>. . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-593. \u201cUnder Connecticut law, a right person, as that term is used in \u00a7 52-593, is one who, as a matter of <em>fact, </em>is a proper defendant for the legal theory alleged.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cogan </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Auto Financial Corp., </em>supra, 276 Conn. 8. This language contemplates that, so long as the second action is brought within the one year time limitation, the defendant in that action may not avail itself of the statute of limitations. The general remedial purpose of this statute is to relieve a plaintiff of the statute of limitations consequences where the plaintiff made a factual mistake in selecting her original defendant for the legal theory of the action, so long as the plaintiff brings the second action against the \u201cright person\u201d within the one year period. Because the statute is remedial in nature, it should be construed broadly to accomplish its remedial purpose. See <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>285 Conn. 778, 792, 941 A.2d 932 (2008). In addition, \u201cany ambiguities should be resolved in a manner that furthers, rather than thwarts, the [statute\u2019s] remedial purposes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Under this language and purpose, the plaintiffs 2004 action, against Associates, qualifies as one in which the plaintiff failed to obtain judgment \u201cby reason of failure to name the right person as defendant therein . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-593. The plaintiffs theory of that action was negligence, based on control or possession of the soccer facility. Associates was not the factually \u201cright person\u201d to be sued because Associates did not exist at the time of the injury and, therefore, could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>have been in control or possession of the soccer facility; the \u201cright person\u201d for that theory was in fact Arena, which was the lessee of the soccer facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">We see nothing in either the language or purpose of the statute, however, to suggest that it does not apply where, as the argument by Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso implies, the defendants in the second action were not sued in the first action or in an action brought within the applicable statute of limitations. Indeed, this argument would render the statute a virtual nullity, because it would confine its application to a case in which the defendants in the second action\u2014 namely, the presumptive \u201cright\u201d defendants\u2014had already been sued in the first action or in an earlier action brought within the applicable statute of limitations\u2014in which cases there would have been no need for the second action.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso also argue that \u00a7 52-593 operates to the plaintiffs advantage <em>only </em>where \u201cthe plaintiff . . . made a good faith attempt to name the proper party in the earlier action,\u201d that is, where the naming of the wrong defendant was \u201cthe product of a reasonable and honest mistake of fact as to the identity of the truly responsible individual.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso argue that in this case, the \u201cplaintiff was careless in her attempts to name a proper defendant.\u201d Thus, in their reading of \u00a7 52-593, there is an element of fault that the plaintiff must dispel, and a level of care that she must demonstrate, in order to avail herself of the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">First, there is nothing in either the language or the purpose of the statute that suggests this level of inquiry. Indeed, it appears to us that in many, if not most, cases in which a plaintiff initially sues a \u201cwrong person,\u201d there will be some level of lack of care in factual investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>in selecting that person to be sued. The statute does not contemplate the kind of searching inquiry into the level of care taken by the plaintiff in her initial selection of a defendant that the defendants\u2019 argument would suggest. It focuses on the result of the plaintiffs decision-making process\u2014that the plaintiff failed to sue the factually \u201cright person\u201d\u2014and not on the method or quality of that process.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Second, the reliance by Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Isidro </em>v. <em>State, </em>62 Conn. App. 545, 771 A.2d 257 (2001), is misplaced. In that case, the plaintiffs original negligence action was against a state police trooper who, although the operator of the vehicle involved in the collision, was immune from liability. Id., 547. Thereafter, the plaintiff sought to sue the state on a theory of vicarious liability. This court held that \u00a7 52-593 did not save the second action from the defense of the statute of limitations because the first action had not been brought against the \u201cwrong person\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We held that a \u201cmistake as to legal theory, in this instance, immunity,\u201d rather than a factual mistake in choosing the defendant did not come within the reach of \u00a7 52-593; id., 549; and, therefore, the plaintiffs original action had not failed \u201cbecause she failed to name the proper defendant as a matter of fact.\u201d Id., 550. <em>Isidro </em>differs from the present case in that the plaintiff in the present case did make a factual mistake, rather than a mistake of legal theory, in suing Associates in the original action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso, relying on <em>Cogan </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Auto Financial Corp., </em>supra, 276 Conn. 1, also argue that the statute does not save the plaintiffs action because \u201cthe plaintiffs failure to name <em>all </em>of the defendants from whom she could have recovered in her original action does not constitute a \u2018failure to name the right person as defendant\u2019 within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 52-593.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 11. This reliance is equally misplaced. In <em>Cogan, </em>the plaintiff originally sued two defendants, the operator of a vehicle and her stepfather, under the family car doctrine, and secured a financial settlement equal to the full liability insurance coverage available under the stepfather\u2019s liability policy. Id., 3. The plaintiff in that action did not allege that the stepfather was the owner of the vehicle. Id., 9. Thereafter, having discovered that the vehicle had been leased by the stepfather, she sought to sue the defendant lessor of the vehicle. The court held that \u00a7 52-593 did not save the second action from the statute of limitations because the first action was against a factually proper defendant under the theory alleged, namely, the family car doctrine, which does not depend on ownership of the vehicle. Id., 9-10. In that context, the court stated that \u201cthe plaintiffs failure to name <em>all </em>of the defendants from whom she could have recovered in her original action does not constitute a \u2018failure to name the right person as defendant\u2019 within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 52-593.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 11. <em>Cogan </em>differs from this case because the plaintiff in this case did fail to name the factually correct defendant in the original action; her failure also to name all of the presumptively factually correct defendants whom she eventually named does not undermine that qualifying factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">DiTommaso argues that the evidence at the summary judgment proceedings showed that Dimensional Technology was the owner of the property located at 21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Hyde Road in Farmington; that the company had been formed by four members of the DiTommaso family in 2001; that the soccer facility portion of the premises was leased to Arena; and that the plaintiff produced no evidence by which to pierce the corporate veil as to DiTommaso. Thus, DiTommaso contends that the judgment in his favor should be affirmed on the alternate basis of a lack of evidence to justify personal liability. Although the record does contain the uncontroverted facts referred to by DiTommaso, we conclude that the plaintiff brought forth sufficient contrary facts to escape summary judgment on the theory of piercing the corporate veil.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Our standard of review for summary judgment is well settled. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . The test is whether the party moving for summary judgment would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the [defendant\u2019s] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>SS-II, LLC v. Bridge Street Associates, </em>293 Conn. 287, 293-94, 977 A.2d 189 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\u201cThe party opposing a motion for summary judgment must present evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue .... The movant has the burden of showing the nonexistence of such issues but the evidence thus presented, if otherwise sufficient, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>is not rebutted by the bald statement that an issue of fact does exist. ... To oppose a motion for summary judgment successfully, the nonmovant must recite specific facts . . . which contradict those stated in the movant\u2019s affidavits and documents. . . . The opposing party to a motion for summary judgment must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue. . . . The existence of the genuine issue of material fact must be demonstrated by counteraffidavits and concrete evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gianetti </em>v. <em>Health Net of Connecticut, Inc., </em>116 Conn. App. 459, 464-65, 976 A.2d 23 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">With respect to this issue, the plaintiff in her brief relies on the so-called identity rule for piercing the corporate veil. \u201cWhen determining whether piercing the corporate veil is proper, our Supreme Court has endorsed two tests: the instrumentality test and the identity test. . . . The identity rule has been stated as follows: If a plaintiff can show that there was such a unity of interest and ownership that the independence of the coiporations had in effect ceased or had never begun, an adherence to the fiction of separate identity would serve only to defeat justice and equity by permitting the economic entity to escape liability arising out of an operation conducted by one corporation for the benefit of the whole enterprise. . . . The concept of piercing the corporate veil is equitable in nature and courts should pierce the corporate veil only under exceptional circumstances.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>KLM Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tylutki, </em>75 Conn. App. 27, 32-33, 815 A.2d 688, cert. denied, 263 Conn. 916, 821 A.2d 770 (2003). There was sufficient evidence to create a question of fact on the plaintiffs claim that the corporate veil should be pierced as to DiTommaso.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The plaintiff brought forth evidence that DiTommaso was the main actor on behalf of the various corporate identities. All of the companies have the same members, namely, DiTommaso and his three siblings, each of whom has an equal number of shares, except for Associates, in which DiTommaso\u2019s parents each own 2 percent of the shares. There was evidence that the companies did not observe all corporate formalities. The various members of the companies did not hold designated corporate offices. Separate meetings were not held for the various companies; instead, one corporate meeting was held, where issues pertaining to all of the companies were discussed. No corporate minutes were kept. Furthermore, DiTommaso had ordered the flooring in question on behalf of Arena, although when he did so that corporate entity did not exist. As a member of Dimensional Technology, he gave permission to Arena to operate the soccer facility without paying any rent and without asking for rent. Finally, he permitted his father to determine which of the corporate entities would provide the security for the financing of loans taken out by Arena, although his father was not a shareholder of Arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">In sum, we conclude that the judgment in favor of Associates should be affirmed on the alternate basis of claim preclusion. We turn, therefore, to the merits of the case, namely, the application of the proper rules of liability to apply to the plaintiffs claims against the remaining defendants, namely, Arena, Dimensional Technology and DiTommaso. We refer herein to these remaining defendants as the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment for three reasons, namely, that the court improperly (1) held that she was required to establish a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>standard of care, (2) held that she failed to establish that the defendants breached their duty of care, and (3) disregarded the testimony and report of her expert witness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because these three reasons are intertwined with each other, we discuss them below accordingly. We agree with the plaintiff that the court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">This case lies at the intersection of two sets of rules oflaw. The first set involves so-called premises liability claims, exemplified by cases such as <em>Baptiste </em>v. <em>Better Val-U Supermarket, Inc., </em>262 Conn. 135, 811 A.2d 687 (2002), and <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Bell Court Condominium Assn., Inc., </em>223 Conn. 323, 612 A.2d 1197 (1992). \u201cIt is undisputed that the plaintiff in this case was a business invitee of the defendant and that, consequently, the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty to keep its premises in a reasonably safe condition.\u201d <em>Baptiste </em>v. <em>Better Val-U Supermarket, Inc., </em>supra, 140. \u201cA possessor of land has a duty to an invitee to reasonably inspect and maintain the premises in order to render them reasonably safe. <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Stancliff, </em>157 Conn. 216, 218, 251 A.2d 74 (1968). In addition, the possessor of land must warn an invitee of dangers that the invitee could not reasonably be expected to discover.\u201d <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Bell Court Condominium Assn., Inc., </em>supra, 327. Thus, in premises liability cases, the standard of care is imposed by law and is embodied in the nature of the duty. See <em>Baptiste </em>v. <em>Better Val-U Supermarket, Inc., </em>supra, 138 (issue of duty is question of law, and court sometimes refers to that duty as requisite standard of care). That standard of care or duty, imposed by law on those in control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>of the premises, owed to an invitee such as Michelle, includes keeping and maintaining the premises in a reasonably safe condition, reasonably inspecting the premises, and warning the invitee of dangers that the invitee could not reasonably be expected to discover.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The other set of rules of law involves situations in which the standard of care must be proven by expert testimony. This set is exemplified by cases such as <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 682 A.2d 106 (1996), and <em>LePage </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>262 Conn. 116, 809 A.2d 505 (2002). In <em>Santopietro, </em>our Supreme Court held that expert testimony on the standard of care applicable to umpires in a softball game was required in order for a jury to decide whether they had breached an assumed duty to maintain control of the game, because \u201c[i]f the determination of the standard of care requires knowledge that is beyond the experience of an ordinary fact finder, expert testimony [of that standard of care] will be required.\u201d <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 226. Similarly, in <em>LePage </em>the plaintiff claimed that the defendant day care provider had negligently permitted the plaintiffs infant to sleep on her stomach, thereby causing the infant\u2019s death from sudden infant death syndrome. The court held that expert testimony was required \u201cas to the standard of care . . . because knowledge beyond the ordinary person\u2019s purview [was] at issue.\u201d <em>LePage </em>v. <em>Home, </em>supra, 134 n.19. Thus, in this set of cases the plaintiff must produce expert testimony on the specific, applicable standard of care and its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The plaintiff contends that the first set of rules applies to her claim, namely, those rules governing premises liability, and that she met the requirements of those rules, particularly through the deposition testimony and affidavit of her expert. The defendants contend that the second set of rules applies to the plaintiffs claim, namely, that she was required to establish a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>standard of care applicable to indoor soccer facilities, and that her expert\u2019s testimony and affidavit failed to do so. We agree with the plaintiff. We conclude that the plaintiffs claim is governed by the rules of law applicable to premises liability, and that, by virtue of her expert witness\u2019 testimony and affidavit, she brought forth sufficient admissible evidence to avoid summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In order to understand fully the arguments of the parties, it is helpful to have in mind the particular facts presented by the parties in the trial court and the court\u2019s reasoning. We therefore turn, first, to those facts and that reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Most of the facts presented by both parties are, for purposes of this appeal, undisputed. Those undisputed facts are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">In November, 2001, DiTommaso, who was personally involved in maintaining the facility, selected and purchased cut pile, commercial grade carpeting on behalf of Arena for installation as the playing surface in the facility. At that time, there were at least two types of surface available for this purpose: commercial carpet of the type purchased; and a synthetic surface known as Astroturf. DiTommaso chose the carpet playing surface based on his many years of experience, including playing on similar surfaces and coaching at other indoor facilities, and based on a recommendation to him by a manufacturer\u2019s representative. A contractor was hired to install the carpet by laying it on top of the concrete floor of the facility. DiTommaso chose this surface over Astroturf because of his belief that Astroturf was very abrasive and would cause a bum if a player fell on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">There are no written government or industry standards regarding the use of playing surfaces for indoor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>soccer facilities. The major indoor soccer league in the United States used a surface similar to the carpet that was chosen by DiTommaso, and the United States Indoor Soccer Association, of which Arena was a member, had no standard prohibiting the use of such a surface. Such a surface was commonly used in indoor soccer facilities at the time. There had been no prior complaints or claims of injury at the facility or in the state based on the nature of the surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The Connecticut Junior Soccer Association (association) sanctions commercial indoor soccer facilities in Connecticut. In order for such a facility to gain its sanction, the facility must pass a basic site inspection. Arena was sanctioned by the association in 2001. That site inspection disclosed the surface to be lying flat and even, secured to the underlying surface, and without any visible defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">At the time of the injury, the surface was without any holes, cuts or tears, and was flat and smooth without any debris on it. Michelle\u2019s coach, who had prior experience with indoor soccer facilities, considered the surface to be normal for such a facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">In addition to these undisputed facts, the plaintiff brought forth the following evidence. The defendants did not perform any testing of the available surfaces to determine the relative safety of either for indoor soccer, and DiTommaso did not consider purchasing any other surface. He did not ask the carpet salesman whether one type of surface, as opposed to another, would be more safe, and did not have any conversations with anyone, including the salesman, about the safety qualities of potential surfaces. He selected the carpet surface based on his knowledge of what other soccer facilities were using, on his own personal experience, on the belief that the potential for rug bums would be less using the carpet rather than Astroturf and because a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>soccer ball moves more slowly on carpeting than on Astroturf.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">On March 9, 2002, Michelle was playing soccer at the facility. As she chased a ball toward the goal in an attempt to make a shot on goal, her foot stuck to the carpet surface and she fell. Although she may have come into contact with the goalie after she fell, she did not fall because of any such collision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a result of the fall, Michelle suffered a serious ankle injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In late 2003 or early 2004, Arena moved its soccer facility to a new facility. For the surface of that facility, DiTommaso purchased a different type of surface, namely, a synthetic \u201cField Turf and fill system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The plaintiff also presented the deposition testimony, taken on February 13, 2007, and an affidavit, dated May 17, 2007, of Benno M. Nigg, professor of biomechanics and director of the human performance laboratory, faculty of kinesiology, at the University of Calgary, Canada, as an expert witness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Attached to Nigg\u2019s affidavit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>a copy of the report that, as he stated in his affidavit, he \u201cgenerated as a result of the tests [he] conducted on the floor surface that existed at the indoor soccer arena.\u201d Nigg\u2019s curriculum vitae<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> runs to some forty-one pages and was presented to the trial court as another attachment to his affidavit. Nigg\u2019s affidavit, along with his accompanying report and curriculum vitae, were filed as exhibits in support of the plaintiffs memorandum of law in opposition to Arena\u2019s motion for summary judgment filed May 21, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Nigg testified<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as follows. Using the actual shoe worn by Michelle at the time of her injury and a portion of the actual carpet surface in use at Arena at the time, as well as a portion of a more modem synthetic sports surface, and based on Michelle\u2019s description, supplied to him by her attorney, of how her foot stuck to the surface before she fell, Nigg performed a standard test to quantify what happens between a soccer shoe and the Arena surface during the movement of a player\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>foot. Nigg testified that the synthetic surface he used was a standard sports surface that has been in use a long time and is commonly used in sports facilities. The test consisted of a series of experiments measuring the resistance created between the sole of the shoe and the surface during various athletic movements of the foot, namely, forefoot rotation, midfoot rotation and lateral traction. Nigg also testified that an operator or owner of an indoor sports facility should, in the absence of government or industry standards, perform tests for the safety of the surface before installing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The test that Nigg performed showed that resistance levels were significantly higher on the carpeted surface than on the synthetic surface. Nigg concluded, as a result, that there was a \u201csubstantially higher risk for injuries in the carpet condition compared to [the] synthetic . . . condition.\u201d In paragraph 4 of his affidavit, Nigg opined: \u201cThe flooring surface provided by the defendants was unreasonably dangerous and unfit for use at an indoor soccer arena because (a) it produced excessive translational and rotational traction forces, which typically result in higher injury frequencies, (b) because it showed significantly higher loading than synthetic sports surfaces found more frequently in sports arenas, and (c) because it created excessive forces on the foot, which can lead to ankle injuries such as the one sustained by [Michelle]. Based on the mechanism of injury described by [Michelle], my results indicate that the surface was a substantial factor in causing [Michelle\u2019s] injury.\u201d Nigg added, in paragraph 5 of his affidavit, that \u201c[m]y opinions are based upon my review of the documents forwarded to me in connection with this lawsuit, upon the tests my office and I performed on the floor surface that was located at the indoor soccer arena, upon the epidemiological data I have previously published, and upon my education, experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>and expertise in the field of biomechanics, engineering, medicine and kinesiology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Nigg acknowledged that he had no knowledge of specific indoor soccer industry standards or of a specific standard of care applicable to indoor soccer facilities. He did testify, however, with regard to industry standards, that such standards generally constitute a compromise among the members of the industry that is not necessarily related to the safety of the players. He also acknowledged that he had not spoken to the plaintiff or Michelle; he did not have Michelle\u2019s deposition testimony or medical records when he issued his report; and he had no information regarding the frequency of injuries on the carpeted surface, the fit of Michelle\u2019s shoes or her soccer position.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The trial court first concluded that there is \u201cnothing about a nondefective, carpeted floor that constitutes a dangerous condition per se.\u201d The court then stated that \u201c[t]he question of whether the carpeted floor was safe for indoor soccer involves industry standards, engineering and mechanics,\u201d and concluded further that the question of whether the carpet in question was dangerous required expert testimony because it is beyond the ordinary knowledge and experience of jurors. The court then assumed without deciding, because the defendants had indicated that they intended to move to exclude his testimony on the basis of <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 698 A.2d 739 (1997) (en banc), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S. Ct. 1384, 140 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1998),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that Nigg was qualified to testify in the case. Nonetheless, the court stated that \u201conly the defendants have provided evidence of the standard of care and the lack of notice about the alleged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>dangerous defect.\u201d The court discounted Nigg\u2019s statement in paragraph 4 of his affidavit that \u201c[t]he flooring surface provided by the defendants was unreasonably dangerous,\u201d by noting that Nigg had testified \u201cin his deposition that he is only able to testily as to causation.\u201d In addition, the court noted that Nigg was not able to testify as to the standard of care applicable to indoor soccer facilities or as to prior notice of any defect. In addition, the court noted that \u201ceven if the plaintiff could prove the applicable standard of care and this were a case where notice is not required, the risk of the alleged affirmative act would need to be foreseeable . . . [and] not even a scintilla of evidence suggests foreseeability.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Finally, the court determined that Nigg lacked personal knowledge of the essential facts of the case because he had not spoken with the plaintiff, Michelle, her father, who had witnessed her fall, or her coach; he had not examined Michelle\u2019s deposition or medical records when he issued his report; he had no information related to environmental conditions, the age or use of the facility, the frequencies of injury, the fit of her shoes, her soccer position, the place of injury, or what Michelle \u201cwas doing at the time of injury to gain a complete understanding of the biomechanics of the accident.\u201d Therefore, the court found \u201cthat Nigg does not have the personal knowledge about this case that would allow him to render an opinion with substantial value.\u201d This last finding appears to be a determination that, despite the court\u2019s earlier assumption, Nigg\u2019s testimony would not be admissible at trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 716-17, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Accordingly, the court granted the motions for summary judgment. We read the court\u2019s opinion as resting on several independent grounds. First, expert testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>was required to establish, the standard of care applicable to an indoor soccer facility and the breach thereof, and such testimony was lacking. Second, even if expert testimony on the standard of care was not required, there was no evidence of notice of the specific defect alleged. Third, even if expert testimony on the standard of care was not required and there was no requirement of evidence of notice, there was no evidence of foreseeability. Fourth, Nigg\u2019s testimony would be inadmissible in any event because of a lack of sufficient personal knowledge of the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">With this procedural background in mind, we turn now to the merits of the appeal. In this regard, we first consider our scope of review of the question of the admissibility of Nigg\u2019s testimony in this summary judgment proceeding and, applying the appropriate scope of review, address whether that testimony should have been considered as fully admissible. The plaintiff contends that our scope of review is plenary and that Nigg\u2019s testimony should have been considered as fully admissible. The defendants contend that our scope of review is limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion and that there was no such abuse of discretion in disregarding Nigg\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Ordinarily, a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of an expert\u2019s testimony at trial is subject to the deferential scope of review of abuse of discretion. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Metro-North Commuter Railroad Co., </em>292 Conn. 150, 157, 971 A.2d 676 (2009). That scope of review does not apply, however, where the trial court has excluded such testimony in connection with a summary judgment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">It is well settled that our scope of review of a trial court\u2019s determination on a motion for summary judgment is plenary. <em>SS-II, LLC v. Bridge Street Associates, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>supra, 293 Conn. 294. Where, as here, the trial court ruled the expert\u2019s testimony inadmissible in the course of summary judgment proceedings, it would be inconsistent with that plenary scope of review to subject a particular subset of the trial court\u2019s determinations in those proceedings, namely, the admissibility of an expert\u2019s opinion, to the highly deferential abuse of discretion scope of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Furthermore, it would be inconsistent with the well settled principles of summary judgment jurisprudence that the burden is on the movant to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact involved in the case, and that the facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, to subject the court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of Nigg\u2019s opinion to an abuse of discretion scope of review. The abuse of discretion standard for appellate review assumes that the trial court had discretion and therefore could have reasonably ruled either way; to apply a deferential scope of review to its ruling, where as here it excluded the expert\u2019s testimony, would be inconsistent with the movant\u2019s burden to establish that there is no genuine issue of fact, and with the notion that the facts are to be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Put another way, because the movant in a summary judgment proceeding has the burden to show that there is no genuine issue of fact and the facts are to be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, a trial court in such a proceeding would be obligated to exercise its discretion in favor of the nonmoving party\u2019s offer of evidence. Similarly, in applying our plenary scope of review to the question of the admissibility of Nigg\u2019s testimony, the same considerations compel us to resolve any doubts about that question in favor of admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Bristol Hospital, Inc., </em>79 Conn. App. 78, 84, 882 A.2d 1254 (2003), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>is misplaced. In that medical malpractice case, the trial court held a two day evidentiary hearing in response to the defendants\u2019 motion in limine to preclude the testimony of the plaintiffs proposed expert because the parties agreed \u201cthat a favorable ruling on that motion would be determinative of whether the plaintiff could maintain his action\u201d; id., 82; and on the basis of that evidentiary hearing the court ruled the testimony inadmissible in part. Id. Thereafter, the court granted the motion for summary judgment because, based on the prior ruling, the plaintiff would be unable to prove his case. Id., 83. In the ensuing appeal, we applied the highly deferential abuse of discretion scope of review to the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling. Id., 84. That case is distinguishable because the ruling in the trial court was akin to a ruling at trial, made on a full factual record, and not made during the course of a summary judgment proceeding.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Applying our plenary scope of review, therefore, to the plaintiffs offer of Nigg\u2019s testimony, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>that it should have been fully considered. \u201cThe general standard for admissibility of expert testimony in Connecticut is simply that the expert must demonstrate a special skill or knowledge, beyond the ken of the average juror, that, as properly applied, would be helpful to the determination of an ultimate issue. . . . Once the threshold question of usefulness to the jury has been satisfied, any questions regarding the expert\u2019s qualifications properly go to the weight, and not to the admissibility, of his testimony.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Margolis, </em>215 Conn. 408, 416-17, 576 A.2d 489 (1990). \u201cThe underlying principle is that if any reasonable qualifications can be established, the objection goes to the weight rather than the admissibility of the [expert\u2019s opinion] evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Bob\u2019s Coaster Corp., </em>133 Conn. 677, 682, 54 A.2d 270 (1946). In addition, Practice Book \u00a7 17-46 \u201csets forth three requirements necessary to permit the consideration of material contained in affidavits submitted in a summary judgment proceeding. The material must: (1) be based on personal knowledge; (2) constitute facts that would be admissible at trial; and (3) affirmatively show that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit. The requirements that the affidavit be based on personal knowledge and contain facts admissible at trial do not mean, however, that expert opinions in the form of affidavits may not be considered in a summary judgment proceeding. For the purposes of an expert\u2019s opinion, the expert\u2019s personal knowledge of facts is comprised of those materials on the basis of which he properly may render his opinion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>199 Conn. 473, 476, 507 A.2d 1387 (1986). These materials include those on the basis of which the expert forms an opinion, and include . . . hearsay .... See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>181 Conn. 562, 584, 436 A.2d 33 (1980). Furthermore, an expert\u2019s opinion is, for purposes of \u00a7 [17-46], a fact that would be admissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>at trial, assuming that the expert is qualified to render such an opinion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Danbury Hospital, </em>232 Conn. 242, 251-52, 654 A.2d 748 (1995). Thus, an expert\u2019s opinion may be based on secondhand sources, such as his training and experience, and information obtained from others. See id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pjura, </em>68 Conn. App. 119, 127, 789 A.2d 1124 (2002); <em>Eisenbach </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>45 Conn. App. 165, 179, 694 A.2d 1376, cert. denied, 241 Conn. 926, 696 A.2d 1264 (1997); C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 7.9.3, p. 534. Although an expert\u2019s opinion must be based on facts, \u201cthere is no rule of law declaring the precise facts which must be proved before [his] opinion may be received in evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>210 Conn. 652, 677, 557 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 824, 110 S. Ct. 84, 107 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Our code of evidence incorporates these standards. Section 7-4 (a) provides that an expert may give an opinion \u201cprovided sufficient facts are shown as the foundation for the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 7-4 (a). Section 7-4 (b) provides that those facts \u201cmay be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the proceeding. The facts need not be admissible in evidence if of a type customarily relied on by experts in the particular field in forming opinions on the subject . . . .\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 7-4 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Under these standards, Nigg\u2019s entire testimony, including his opinion that the carpet was unreasonably dangerous for an indoor soccer facility and was a substantial factor in causing Michelle\u2019s fall, was admissible for purposes of the summary judgment proceeding. His curriculum vitae dispels any reasonable doubt about his general qualifications as an expert in the field of biomechanics and related fields, and the defendants do not seriously question those qualifications. His personal knowledge, namely, of how Michelle was injured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>related to him by her counsel as described by her and her father, who witnessed the injury, and of the experiments that he and his colleagues conducted, about which he testified in detail, using the specific shoes she had been wearing at the time of the injury and the actual carpet from the defendants\u2019 facility, was sufficient for his opinion to be admissible. Also supporting the admissibility of Nigg\u2019s testimony was his comparison of the carpeted surface used by the defendants to the synthetic sports facility surface that he also used in his experiments, and the evidence that, subsequent to Michelle\u2019s injury, the defendants installed, in a different facility, a different, synthetic sports facility surface. \u201cThe plaintiff in all negligence cases may show that better, safer and more practicable devices than those used were available to the defendant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Delmore </em>v. <em>Polinsky, </em>132 Conn. 28, 31, 42 A.2d 349 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Thus, with regard to Nigg\u2019s personal knowledge, the defendants\u2019 arguments in support of the trial court\u2019s decision are unavailing. The facts that Nigg had not spoken to Michelle, her father or her coach, that he did not have her deposition or medical records when he issued his report, that he did not know of the environmental conditions at the time of the injury, or of the facility\u2019s age or its use, that he had no information regarding the frequency of injuries, or regarding the fit of her shoes, or her soccer position, all go to the weight, not the admissibility, of his testimony. Considering the range of Nigg\u2019s personal knowledge of the facts that he did have, we disagree with the trial court and the defendants that the absence of Nigg\u2019s personal familiarity with these facts rendered his opinion without substantial value. See <em>Shelnitz </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>200 Conn. 58, 67, 509 A.2d 1023 (1986) (\u201cdoctor may give an [expert] opinion . . . without having examined or treated the patient\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>The decision in <em>Porter </em>v. Thrane, 98 Conn. App. 336, 908 A.2d 1137 (2006), on which the defendants rely, is not to the contrary. In that case, this court held that the opinion of a residential real estate appraiser, who presented an updated appraisal report, had been improperly admitted into evidence because the appraiser \u201cdid not have the essential facts necessary to form an opinion about the value of the property.\u201d Id., 340. There, however, unlike the present case, the appraiser had not inspected the property, and no one from his office had done so since the original appraisal two years before; he never viewed the house or cottage on the property, even from a distance; and he was unfamiliar with the interior of the house on the property. On that record, this corut concluded that his testimony was \u201cbased on speculation and lack of personal knowledge.\u201d Id., 341. Nigg\u2019s personal knowledge, as we have outlined previously, is not in the speculative category as determined in <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Thrane, </em>supra, 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">With regard to the trial court\u2019s disregard of paragraph 4 of Nigg\u2019s affidavit, the defendants offer two contentions. First, they contend that, as the trial court determined, the statements he made in that paragraph were inconsistent with his deposition testimony and, therefore, were properly disregarded. Second, they contend, as an alternate ground for affirmation of the trial court\u2019s disregard of Nigg\u2019s affidavit, that we should adopt the federal \u201csham affidavit\u201d rule, pursuant to which a court, under some circumstances, disregards \u201can offsetting affidavit that is submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment when the affidavit contradicts the affiant\u2019s prior sworn deposition testimony.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re CitX Corp., Inc., </em>448 F.3d 672, 679 (3d Cir. 2006). \u201c[A sham affidavit is an] affidavit that contradicts clear testimony previously given by the same witness, [usually] used in an attempt to create an issue of fact in response to a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>summary judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">To the extent that the trial court disregarded Nigg\u2019s affidavit because it was merely inconsistent with his deposition testimony, we conclude that that is an insufficient reason for a trial court to disregard it entirely. The usual legal remedy for inconsistent statements by a witness is for the adversary to point them out for purposes of impeaching the witness\u2019 credibility; such an inconsistency is not ordinarily a ground for precluding the witness\u2019 testimony entirely. We see no reason for a different rule to prevail in a summary judgment proceeding, particularly given the fact that in such a proceeding the evidence is to be viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. We turn, therefore, to the defendants\u2019 contention that we should employ the \u201csham affidavit\u201d rule so as to preclude Nigg\u2019s affidavit in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The defendants argue that we should employ the sham affidavit rule to bar consideration of Nigg\u2019s affidavit\u2014particularly paragraph 4 thereof\u2014because in \u201chis affidavit, Nigg states that \u2018[t]he flooring surface provided by the defendants was unreasonably dangerous\u2019; yet he testifies in his deposition that he is only able to testify as to causation. Indeed, he attests that he has no position on standard of care or breach of duty.\u201d We need not decide in this case whether to adopt the sham affidavit rule because even if we were to do so, it would not suffice to bar Nigg\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">One of the corollaries of the sham affidavit rule is that an affidavit that supplements or amplifies prior deposition testimony, rather than contradicting it, does not violate the sham affidavit rule. <em>Langman Fabrics </em>v. <em>Graff Californiawear, Inc., </em>160 F.3d 106, 112 (2d Cir. 1998) (material issue of fact may be revealed by subsequent sworn testimony that amplifies or explains, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>rather than contradicts, prior testimony, \u201cespecially where the party was not asked sufficiently precise questions to elicit the amplification or explanation\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>488 F.3d 1026, 1030 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (affidavit that does not contradict but instead clarifies prior sworn testimony admissible). In his deposition, Nigg testified that, based on his tests, there was a substantially higher risk for injuries in the carpet condition compared to the synthetic condition. In paragraph 4 of his affidavit, Nigg opined: \u201cThe flooring surface provided by the defendants was unreasonably dangerous and unfit for use at an indoor soccer arena . . . .\u201d A careful examination of Nigg\u2019s deposition testimony does not disclose, however, the type of conflict between deposition testimony and subsequent affidavit material to which the sham affidavit rule applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The only deposition testimony that the defendants refer us to in support of their contention is testimony in which Nigg was asked repeatedly whether he had any information or opinion on the standard of care specifically applicable to indoor soccer facilities, such as whether there were any government or industry standards governing such facilities, whether he was familiar with the United States Indoor Soccer Association and any floor surfaces that that association might have recommended, and whether he had ever been the manager or administrator of a youth indoor soccer program. Our scrutiny of this testimony, however, discloses that it was wholly consistent with the plaintiffs claim in this case, namely, that the defendants maintained an unreasonably dangerous flooring surface for an indoor soccer facility, on the basis of premises liability, irrespective of any special standard of care applicable to such facilities. Thus, Nigg\u2019s affidavit, particularly paragraph 4 thereof, was merely supplemental to and an amplification of, and not contradictory to, his deposition testimony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Accordingly, even if we assume, without deciding, that the sham affidavit rule were to apply in Connecticut, it would not operate properly to bar Nigg\u2019s affidavit in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Having concluded that Nigg\u2019s testimony should have been considered by the trial court in full, we turn, now, to the principal basis of the trial court\u2019s decision, namely, that in the present case in order for the plaintiff to prevail she would have to produce expert testimony of the specific standard of care applicable to indoor soccer facilities and of the breach of that standard of care. We agree with the plaintiff, however, that her claim rests on the rules of law applicable to premises liability in which the law itself imposes the standard of care, namely, the duty to provide and to maintain premises in a reasonably safe condition. We conclude further that Nigg\u2019s affidavit was sufficient for the plaintiff to survive the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">First, it must be remembered that the plaintiffs claim by its terms rests on the nature of the premises, namely, the unsafe condition of the carpeted surface for purposes of indoor soccer. It does not rest on the nature of any particular actor\u2019s specialized conduct. Thus, in this respect, the claim differs from both <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 207, and <em>LePage </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 116, on which the defendants rely. In both of those cases the focus of liability was on the specialized conduct of the defendant actors: in <em>Santopietro, </em>the softball umpires and in <em>LePage, </em>the day care provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Second, it is salient in the present case that there are, all parties agree, no governmental standards governing the type of floor surface for indoor soccer facilities. This necessarily means that, if the operator installs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>and maintains a surface that is customarily used for such facilities; and if that surface is in fact dangerous, in the sense of being unreasonably unsafe, for the users of such a facility, as Nigg asserts based on his expertise; and if that danger has not yet manifested itself by prior accidents known to or discoverable by the parties, as is the case here; then the first person to suffer from such an initial manifestation, such as Michelle, would be without a remedy; whereas perhaps the second, third or fourth person to suffer thereby would have a remedy because the danger would have sufficiently manifested itself to justify such a recovery. We think that the law should permit the first person injured by the danger to recover, rather than waiting until more persons are so injured. Put another way, the law should compensate, and not penalize, the first person to bring the unsafe condition to light. Furthermore, to the extent that there are no industry standards governing such facilities, such standards or their absence would not be determinative in any event because such standards are merely evidentiary and not conclusive of a duty of care. <em>Considine </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>279 Conn. 830, 864-65, 905 A.2d 70 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">On the basis of the standard applicable to premises liability, Nigg\u2019s testimony was sufficient to withstand the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. His opinion that the defendants\u2019 surface was unreasonably dangerous for use as an indoor soccer facility is precisely the type of expert opinion in premises liability cases that our courts have long countenanced and deemed sufficient to prove negligence. See, e.g., <em>Delmore </em>v. <em>Polinsky, </em>supra, 132 Conn. 30 (\u201cThere was definite expert testimony that the arrangement of the steps was unsafe. This is sufficient to support a finding of negligence.\u201d). In addition, there was evidence on which the jury could have found that there were other surfaces that were more safe than that employed by the defendants. Such evidence is grist for the jury mill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>on the question of negligence in a premises liability case. See, e.g., id., 31. Furthermore, there was no need for the plaintiff to prove notice of the unsafe condition because the defendants were responsible for creating the unsafe condition. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>281 Conn. 768, 777, 918 A.2d 249 (2007); <em>Meek </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>72 Conn. App. 467, 474, 806 A.2d 546, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 912, 810 A.2d 278 (2002); <em>Tuite </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., 45 </em>Conn. App. 305, 308-309, 696 A.2d 363 (1997). Similarly, on the factual question of foreseeability, ordinarily, if a defendant was responsible for creating the unsafe condition, it is quintessentially a jury question as to whether he could foresee that harm of the general nature of that suffered was likely to result. See <em>Miranti </em>v. <em>Brookside Shopping Center, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 24, 30, 266 A.2d 370 (1969); <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>13 Conn. App. 493, 500-501, 537 A.2d 527 (1988). Given the evidence that the defendants installed and maintained an unsafe surface in their facility, a jury could reasonably find that injury to an athlete who played on the surface was foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We emphasize, of course, that we are not deciding whether Nigg\u2019s testimony must be believed. That will be a matter for the trier of fact at trial. We decide only that it should have been considered in full in these summary judgment proceedings and that, if believed, it, taken together with all of the other evidence supplied by the plaintiff, was sufficient for the plaintiff to withstand the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The judgment is affirmed as to DiTommaso Associates, LLC. The judgments are reversed as to Farmington Sports Arena, LLC, Dimensional Technology Group, LLC, and Paul DiTommaso, Jr., and the case is remanded with direction to deny their motions for summary judgment and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In this opinion BEACH, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-11\"> Although the complaint purports to name Michelle as a plaintiff, it is clear that the only proper plaintiff is Karen DiPietro, who brings the claim as the parent and next friend of Michelle.

There was also evidence, however, by way of Michelle\u2019s deposition, that she fell before she collided with the goalie because her foot had stuck to the surface. Therefore, there was clearly a factual issue in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\"> The plaintiff had previously, on February 13, 2007, disclosed Nigg as an expert who \u201cis expected to testify about the dangerous nature of the flooring surface provided by the defendants and how it was not fit to be used at an indoor soccer arena.\u201d More specifically, in that disclosure the plaintiff stated: \u201cDr. Nigg is expected to testily in accordance with his report that is attached hereto. Specifically, he is expected to testify that the flooring surface provided by the defendants was unreasonably dangerous and unfit for use at an indoor soccer arena because (a) it produced excessive translational and rotational traction values which typically result in high injury frequencies, (b) because it showed significantly higher loading than synthetic sports surfaces found more frequently in sports arenas, and (c) because it created excessive forces on the foot which can lead to ankle injuries such as the one sustained by [Michelle], all of which was a substantial factor in causing Michelle\u2019s injuries.\u201d The disclosure added that \u201c[t]he opinions of Dr. Nigg will be based upon his review of a number of relevant documents/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>materials in connection with this lawsuit, upon the tests he performed of those materials, upon the epidemiological data he has previously published, and upon his education, experience and expertise in the field of biomechanics, engineering, medicine and kinesiology.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b630-6\"> Nigg\u2019s curriculum vitae consists of the following: his personal and professional history, awards and special achievements; memberships and functions in national and international research groups; memberships on professional editorial boards; refereeships for professional journal papers and grant applications; collaborations with visiting researchers and scholars; supervision of postdoctoral fellows and Ph.D students; supervision of graduate level candidates in Zurich, Switzerland, and master\u2019s level candidates in Calgary; supervision of professional assistants, summer students and research students; research grants; invited lectures, both international and national; 300 publications; six publications submitted, accepted or in press; instances of cooperation with industry; and participation in court cases as an expert witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> We use the term \u201ctestified\u201d here to include both Nigg\u2019s deposition testimony, his affidavit, which was prepared after his deposition and presented to the trial court in connection with the summary judgment proceedings, and his written report that was attached to his affidavit. We discuss in the text the dispute over part of that affidavit, namely, paragraph 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\"> We, of course, express no opinion on whether Nigg\u2019s testimony would be subject to the <em>Porter </em>standards or, if it were, whether it would comply therewith. That is an issue that will require a hearing in the trial court if the defendants file an appropriate motion therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\"> We acknowledge that the federal rule is to apply an abuse of discretion standard to the question of the admissibility of expert opinion in the summary judgment context. See, e.g., <em>General Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 142-43, 118 S. Ct. 512, 139 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1997). We think, however, that for the reasons we have given it is more consistent with our summary judgment jurisprudence to apply a de novo standard of review, particularly when the trial court has excluded the expert opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">We are also aware of this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Croman, </em>52 Conn. App. 445, 448-49, 726 A.2d 1168 (1999), in which the court, after reciting the traditional rule of the admissibility of expert opinion testimony, including the trial court\u2019s discretion in such rulings, stated that \u201c[w]e agree with the conclusion of the trial court that the attorney affiant qualified as an expert witness.\u201d Id., 449. <em>Turner </em>is not controlling, however. The court did not focus its analysis on the question of the scope of appellate review of the trial court\u2019s ruling. Instead, the court focused its analysis on whether the witness had qualified as an expert witness. See id., 448-49. <em>Tamer </em>should not be read, therefore, as holding that when a trial court excludes an expert witness\u2019 testimony in the course of a summary judgment proceeding, the scope of appellate review of that ruling is limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>BISHOP, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9h\">concurring. Although I agree with part I of the majority\u2019s opinion and its conclusion that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants Farmington Sports Arena, LLC, Dimensional Technology Group, LLC, and Paul DiTommaso, Jr.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1 write separately because I believe that, in part II of its opinion, the majority misinteiprets the basis of the court\u2019s decision and, in suggesting that a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings in connection with a summary judgment procedure are inevitably subject to a plenary standard of review, the majority invites deviation from our well established decisional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In response to the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, the court determined that the plaintiff, Karen DiPietro, failed to establish the presence of a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to reach a jury on the basis that her expert, Benno M. Nigg, would not be able to offer evidence concerning the applicable standard of care and would not be able to testify that the defendants had prior notice of any alleged defect in the soccer playing surface. In addressing the plaintiffs claim on appeal concerning this issue, the majority characterizes the court\u2019s decision as a ruling on the admissibility of Nigg\u2019s testimony. In granting the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, however, the court explicitly stated that it was assuming, for purposes of ruling on the motions, that Nigg\u2019s conclusions were valid and persuasive. The court found, nevertheless, that Nigg\u2019s testimony was insufficient because he was not going to be able to testify concerning the standard of care or notice of the alleged defect, and the plaintiff had presented no other evidence in that regard. In other words, in this part of its decision, the court determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>that Nigg\u2019s testimony was legally inadequate, not inadmissible. Indeed, the court determined that the plaintiff could not satisfy her burden of proof to sustain a negligence action even with Nigg\u2019s testimony. Because the court explicitly credited Nigg\u2019s testimony, I do not think that it can fairly be read as excluding it in regard to the issues of notice and the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In rendering summary judgment in favor of the defendants, the court also appears to have determined that Nigg\u2019s testimony would be inadmissible at trial due to his lack of personal knowledge regarding the circumstances of the incident giving rise to the alleged injuries to the plaintiffs minor daughter, Michelle DiPietro (Michelle). My difficulty with the majority\u2019s response to this aspect of the court\u2019s ruling is the majority\u2019s suggestion that our review of any determination of admissibility by a trial court in a summary judgment context should be plenary. In making this assertion, I believe the majority overstates its point as applied to the procedural facts of this case, and, in the process, unnecessarily casts doubt on our bedrock jurisprudence that a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are, generally, subject to the more deferential standard of review for an abuse of discretion no matter the context in which they are made. See <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Croman, </em>52 Conn. App. 445, 726 A.2d 1168 (1999). In short, not every ruling on the admissibility of evidence made by a trial court in conjunction with a summary judgment hearing is subject to plenary review. Furthermore, this case presents no reason for this court to stray from our well established jurisprudence that atrial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, to the extent it is proper for the court to have made evidentiary rulings, are subject to a more deferential abuse of discretion standard despite the context in which they arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Here, it is not the court\u2019s ruling that Nigg\u2019s testimony would be inadmissible because of his lack of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>knowledge that we review, but, rather, we assess the correctness of the court\u2019s making such an evidentiary ruling in the face of conflicting evidence regarding Nigg\u2019s personal knowledge of the circumstances of Michelle\u2019s accident. \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Bristol Hospital, Inc., </em>79 Conn. App. 78, 87, 882 A.2d 1254 (2003). Because the court must, when deciding a motion for summary judgment, accept all facts alleged by the nonmoving party as true, it would be inappropriate to engage in weighing the evidence or the testimony submitted. <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Bachmann, </em>121 Conn. App. 220, 223, 994 A.2d 676 (2010) (trial court does not sit as trier of fact when ruling on motion for summary judgment). Thus, when there is a factual issue in dispute, the court should not resolve that issue on summary judgment, but, rather, that issue must be left to the fact finder for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In the case at hand, contrary to the defendants\u2019 assertions and the trial court\u2019s finding, Nigg\u2019s affidavit could reasonably support the conclusion that he received personal information from Michelle\u2019s family as to the circumstances of the accident. Rather than crediting this evidence as it was required to do, the trial court, instead, decided a material fact in concluding that Nigg had insufficient personal knowledge to permit him to testify. In doing so, the court improperly resolved a factual dispute rather than confining itself to whether such a dispute exists so as to survive the summary judgment motions. Consequently, I believe that we should accord plenary review to the court\u2019s determination that Nigg is not competent to testify, not on the basis that the court\u2019s evidentiary ruling should be accorded plenary review, but, rather, because the court was legally incorrect in engaging in such an assessment when the evidence was in conflict. Because the court acted beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>its scope of authority in this manner, its ruling is legally incorrect. Thus, although I agree with the majority that we should accord plenary review to the trial court\u2019s determinations in this summary judgment matter, I cannot share the majority\u2019s broad assertion that any review of a trial court\u2019s admissibility rulings in a summary judgment matter should be plenary simply because they arise in a summary judgment context. Accordingly, I concur with the outcome reached by the majority but not with its analysis in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-6\"> Although the court also granted the motion for summary judgment filed by DiTommaso Associates, LLC, for the purposes of this concurrence we refer to only Farmington Sports Arena, LLC, Dimensional Technology, LLC, and Paul DiTommaso, Jr., as the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
