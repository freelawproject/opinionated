We disagree. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of the present appeal. The plaintiff has filed claims for compensation under the federal Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq. (longshore act), and our state\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq. (state act), for injuries sustained to his left and right shoulder while he was in the employ of the defendant, a longshoring operation in the business of unloading cargo from ships. On September 27, 2002, the parties entered into a voluntary agreement under which the defendant accepted the compensability of the injury to the plaintiffs left shoulder under the state act. This agreement was approved by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">On October 3, 2003, however, the defendant filed a form 43, contesting the commission\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. The defendant claimed: \u201c[The plaintiffs] injury occurred over navigable waters in the course of [mjaritime employment. Exclusive jurisdiction for such injuries lies within [the] jurisdiction of [the longshore act].\u201d The commissioner agreed with the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>and the plaintiffs claims for benefits under the state act were dismissed. The plaintiff appealed to the board, which affirmed the commissioner\u2019s dismissal of the claims. The plaintiff then appealed from the board\u2019s decision to this court, and our Supreme Court transferred the appeal to itself and reversed the board\u2019s decision. The court, relying on its ruling in another case that had been argued the same day,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> noted that \u201cthe state has concurrent jurisdiction with the federal government over claims involving injuries sustained on navigable waters when the employer and the employee are locally based, the employment contract is performed locally, the injury occurred on the state\u2019s territorial waters and the employer was required under the state act to secure compensation for any land based injuries sustained by the employee.\u201d <em>DiBlase </em>v. <em>Logistec Connecticut, Inc., </em>283 Conn. 129, 135, 925 A.2d 311 (2007). Accordingly, the court concluded that the board improperly determined that the commissioner did not have jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim because \u201cthe plaintiff is a resident of Connecticut, the defendant is a coiporation with business locations in Connecticut, and the plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a laborer in its warehouses in Bridgeport and New Haven in unloading cargo ships in the harbor.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Subsequent to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>DiBlase, </em>the plaintiff filed a request for attorney\u2019s fees for unreasonable delay and unreasonable contest of benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-300.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>theory underlying the plaintiffs request was that the defendant unreasonably had challenged the commission\u2019s jurisdiction. The commissioner, however, found that the plaintiff \u201cfailed to meet his burden of proof that [the defendant] unreasonably contested and denied or unduly delayed benefits pursuant to ... \u00a7 31-300.\u201d It appears that the commissioner, in denying the request for attorney\u2019s fees, primarily was persuaded by the fact that the board previously had agreed with the defendant that there was no concurrent state jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims, only to be reversed by our Supreme Court. Accordingly, the commissioner denied the request for attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiff appealed to the board, which, in turn, affirmed the decision of the commissioner. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The sole issue raised by the plaintiff on appeal is \u201c[w]hether [the board] erred in affirming [the commissioner\u2019s] denial of the plaintiffs claim for attorney\u2019s fees on the basis of unreasonable contest and undue delay, as permitted by ... \u00a7 31-300.\u201d Our standard of review for workers\u2019 compensation issues is well established. \u201cThe commissioner is the sole trier of fact and [t]he conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . The review [board\u2019s] hearing of an appeal from the commissioner is not a de novo hearing of the facts. . . . [I]t is [obligated] to hear the appeal on the record and not retry the facts. ... On appeal, the board must determine whether there is any evidence in the record to support the commissioner\u2019s findings and award. . . . Our scope of review of [the] actions of the [board] is [similarly] . . . limited. . . . [However] [t]he decision of the [board] must be correct in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>law, and it must not include facts found without evidence or fail to include material facts which are admitted or undisputed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pantanella </em>v. <em>Enfield Ford, Inc., </em>65 Conn. App. 46, 52-53, 782 A.2d 141, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 930, 783 A.2d 1029 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">The gist of the plaintiffs argument is that the defendant\u2019s earlier challenge in <em>DiBlase </em>v. <em>Logistec Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 283 Conn. 129, constituted an impermissible collateral attack on the commission\u2019s jurisdiction. Having so alleged, the plaintiff posits that the defendant\u2019s action was ipso facto unreasonable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In support of his argument, the plaintiff cites <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>224 Conn. 96, 104, 616 A.2d 793 (1992), in which our Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle that a collateral attack on jurisdiction may be barred \u201cwhere the lack of jurisdiction is not entirely obvious\u201d and a party previously had an opportunity to challenge jurisdiction. Essentially, <em>Upjohn Co. </em>stands for the proposition that there are certain instances in which a court may <em>decline to review </em>a challenge to jurisdiction on the basis of collateral estoppel. To the extent that the plaintiff asks us to adopt the <em>Upjohn Co. </em>paradigm by grafting it onto the inquiry into the reasonableness of jurisdictional challenges, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The reviewability of a challenge and the reasonableness of a challenge, however, involve legally distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>inquiries. Thus, even were we to accept the plaintiffs argument that our Supreme Court should have <em>declined to review </em>the defendant\u2019s earlier challenge as a collateral attack on the court\u2019s jurisdiction, such a conclusion would not be dispositive of the issue of the <em>reasonableness </em>of the defendant\u2019s challenge. It also is particularly relevant that our Supreme Court reviewed the defendant\u2019s jurisdictional challenge on its merits. The court did not decline to review the challenge as a collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">The plaintiff, citing <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>4 Conn. App. 431, 494 A.2d 626 (1985) (case on which <em>Upjohn Co. </em>relied for support), also argues that \u201cthere [exists] no strong policy [reason] for providing the [defendant] with a second opportunity to litigate the issue of subject matter jurisdiction\u201d after entering into a voluntary agreement. Although the plaintiffs assertion may be true in the context of a typical tort action, we must be mindful that the fundamental purpose of the state act is \u201cto provide a prompt, efficient, simple and inexpensive procedure for obtaining benefits related to employment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Steams &amp; Wheeler, LLC v. Kowalsky Bros., Inc., </em>289 Conn. 1, 11, 955 A.2d 538 (2008). If we were to adopt the rationale advanced by the plaintiff and hold that a challenge to the jurisdiction of the commission is ipso facto unreasonable when an employer and employee have previously entered into a voluntary agreement, we would no doubt discourage parties from quickly entering into such agreements. Such a result would be an anathema to the goals of the state act.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">It is well established that the \u201cdecision to award attorney\u2019s fees is within the commissioner\u2019s discretion and dependent on the findings of fact.\u201d <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>Dept. of Development Services, </em>115 Conn. App. 306, 323, 971 A.2d 853, cert. denied, 293 Conn. 919, 979 A.2d 490 (2009); <em>Imbrogno </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>28 Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>113, 124, 612 A.2d 82, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 920, 615 A.2d 507 (1992). In determining that the defendant\u2019s jurisdictional challenge was not unreasonable, the commissioner relied heavily on the fact that both an earlier trial commissioner <em>and </em>the board had found merit to the defendant\u2019s challenge. The plaintiff has failed to provide any authority for why the commissioner was not entitled to take this into consideration, nor do we see any reason to conclude that this could not have served as a relevant factor in the commissioner\u2019s determination as to reasonableness. In sum, the circumstances of the present case do not persuade us to disturb the board\u2019s ruling that the commissioner did not abuse his discretion in finding the defendant\u2019s challenge to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-7\"> The third party administrator of the defendant employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation plan, LaMorte Bums and Company, was also a defendant in the proceedings before the commission and the board but has not participated in this appeal. For convenience, we refer in this opinion to Logistec Connecticut, Inc., as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b780-6\"> The case, <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Logistec Connecticut, Inc., </em>283 Conn. 1, 925 A.2d 257 (2007), presented identical issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-300 provides in relevant part: \u201cIn cases where, through the fault or neglect of the employer or insurer, adjustments of compensation have been unduly delayed, or where through such fault or neglect, payments have been unduly delayed, the commissioner may include ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee in the case of undue delay in adjustments of compensation and may include in the award in the case of undue delay in payments of compensation ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. ... In cases where the claimant prevails and the commissioner finds that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>employer or insurer has unreasonably contested liability, the commissioner may allow to the claimant a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\"> The plaintiff also argues that the \u201ccommissioner abused his discretion in determining that a challenge to subject matter jurisdiction is <em>always </em>a bona fide defense to the claims of a plaintiff for compensation.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) This argument consists of little more than bare assertions, and the plaintiff does not provide a material legal analysis related to it. Accordingly, we decline to review the merits of this claim. See <em>Knoblaugh </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>64 Conn. App. 32, 35 n.3, 779 A.2d 218 (argument that consists of mere bare assertion devoid of any legal authority inadequately briefed), cert. denied, 258 Conn. 916, 782 A.2d 1243 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
