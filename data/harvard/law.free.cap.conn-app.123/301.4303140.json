The petitioner claims that the court abused its discretion in denying his habeas petition because his trial counsel had provided him with ineffective assistance. We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the petitioner did not adequately brief his claim and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">This court\u2019s decisions in the petitioner\u2019s previous direct appeals provide the necessary factual background for the present case. In the early hours of February 24, 1996, the petitioner was involved in the attempted robbery of a Hartford taxicab driver that left the driver dead from multiple stab wounds to the chest. Later that day, after assurances from the police that he was not a suspect but merely a witness, the petitioner accompanied two officers to the police station. There, he gave an oral statement in which he implicated two individuals as the perpetrators of the robbery attempt. At some point during that evening, the petitioner\u2019s statement was reduced to writing by the officers and signed by the petitioner. At about 11 p.m., he was taken home by the police. His statements were not preceded by any Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings. On February 29, 1996, the petitioner waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and gave a fully voluntary statement to the police, in which he confessed to his involvement in the crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>66 Conn. App. 724, 729-30, 785 A.2d 1209 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The petitioner was charged with felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3), attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) and 53a-49 (a) (2), and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) and 53a-48 (a). Prior to trial, the petitioner filed a motion to suppress all of his oral and written statements, which the court denied at the pretrial suppression hearing. After a jury trial, the petitioner was acquitted of the charge of robbery in the first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>and found guilty of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree. The court declared a mistrial as to the felony murder charge. On March 2,1999, the petitioner was sentenced to thirty-seven years imprisonment. On appeal, this court affirmed the petitioner\u2019s conviction. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">After being retried on the felony murder charge, the petitioner was found guilty on October 4, 2002. The petitioner again filed a motion to suppress his statements to the police, which the court denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was sentenced to fifty years imprisonment to run concurrently with his previous sentence. On appeal, this court affirmed the petitioner\u2019s conviction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>86 Conn. App. 32, 860 A.2d 272 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 907, 868 A.2d 748, cert. denied, 545 U.S. 1107, 125 S. Ct. 2550, 162 L. Ed. 2d 281 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The petitioner was represented at the 1996 suppression hearing by attorney Kevin Randolph.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Randolph testified that his theory at the suppression hearing was that the petitioner had not been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and, therefore, his confession was not knowing and voluntary. Further, Randolph testified that he did not request the petitioner\u2019s school records evincing his disability because it would not have contributed to Randolph\u2019s theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u201cIn its oral memorandum of decision [on the motion for suppression], the court made only limited factual findings and, although the court did not explicitly conclude that the [petitioner] was not in custody at the time that he made the statements, that determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>is implicit in light of the fact that the court denied his motion to suppress. At trial, the state introduced both the [petitioner\u2019s] February 24 and February 29 statements, and the testimony of [Danixsa] Sanchez and [Phillip Milling, who were with the petitioner during the evening before the robbery] as part of its case-in-chief.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>supra, 66 Conn. App. 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">On December 1, 2006, the petitioner filed a second amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, following his original August 25, 2005 petition, claiming that he had received ineffective assistance of trial counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On October 3, 2008, the habeas court denied the petition. On October 6, 2008, the petitioner filed a petition for certification to appeal, which was granted. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The petitioner claims that the court abused its discretion in denying his habeas petition because it improperly concluded that he failed to demonstrate that his trial counsel provided him with ineffective assistance. The petitioner specifically claims that Randolph provided him with ineffective assistance by failing to present evidence of the petitioner\u2019s mental disabilities at the suppression hearing. The petitioner argues that his waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was not knowing and voluntary because of his low intelligence and reading and auditory comprehension disabilities. We decline to review this claim due to an inadequate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u201c[Reviewing courts are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to th[e] court through an inadequate brief. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly. . . . Where a claim is asserted in the statement of issues but thereafter receives only cursory attention in the brief without discussion or citation of authorities, it is deemed to be abandoned.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Raynor </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>117 Conn. App. 788, 796-97, 981 A.2d 517 (2009), cert. denied, 294 Conn. 926, 986 A.2d 1053 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u201cTo prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Morant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>117 Conn. App. 279, 301, 979 A.2d 507, cert. denied, 294 Conn. 906, 982 A.2d 1080 (2009), citing <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). \u201cBecause the petitioner must satisfy <em>both </em>prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test to prevail on a habeas corpus petition, this court may dispose of the petitioner\u2019s claim if he fails to meet either prong.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Morant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In his brief, the petitioner offers only case law in which a defendant\u2019s confession was found not to be knowing and voluntary due to the defendant\u2019s brain injury; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Timbana, </em>222 F.3d 688 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1028, 121 S. Ct. 604, 148 L. Ed. 2d 516 (2000); and argues that his mental state and confession in the present case are analogous. This hints at the possibility that trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient for not presenting this argument. The petitioner fails, however, to analyze why this falls below an objective standard of reasonableness required to show deficient performance by counsel. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 688. Further, the petitioner offers only a conclusory assertion that he satisfied the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>any analysis as to how he was prejudiced by the admission of his confession. We, therefore, decline to consider this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-6\"> See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478-79, 86 S.
