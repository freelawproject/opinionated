Metcoff and David B. Wilson, appeal from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the defendants, Irene Lebovics, Cy E. Hammond, John J. McCloy II, Sam Oolie and Michael J. Parrella, Sr., granting their motions to strike count two of the plaintiffs\u2019 revised complaint and count one of the plaintiffs\u2019 second substitute complaint. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly struck both counts, which alleged a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., and tortious interference with contractual relations, on the ground that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>counts failed to state a legally sufficient cause of action. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The following procedural history and facts, as alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 revised complaint and second substitute complaint, are relevant to our resolution of the issues on appeal. The plaintiffs were majority shareholders of Midcore Software Incorporated. In August, 2000, NCT Group, Inc. (NCT Group), and NCT Midcore, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a wholly owned subsidiary of NCT Group, entered into an \u201cagreement and plan of merger\u201d (agreement) with the plaintiffs and the remaining minority shareholder of Midcore Software Incorporated. The agreement provided for a merger between Midcore Software Incorporated and NCT Midcore, Inc., with NCT Midcore, Inc., being the surviving corporation. As part of the merger, the agreement provided that the plaintiffs were to receive shares of NCT Group stock and certain royalties on the third anniversary date of the merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">NCT Group failed to deliver the shares of stock and royalties at the designated time in 2003. The defendants were the executive officers and directors of NCT Group when NCT Group allegedly breached its agreement with the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs claim that NCT Group has been insolvent since 2002 and that, despite the plaintiffs\u2019 status as creditors of NCT Group, the defendants have \u201ccaused NCT Group to be unable to perform or refrain from performing its obligations to [the] [plaintiffs under the [ajgreement in 2003.\u201d Instead, as part of an alleged scheme to further their own interests, the plaintiffs claim that the defendants authorized fraudulent transfers of NCT Group assets, received exorbitant compensation, including bonuses and stock options, and engaged in self-dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">On November 25,2005, the plaintiffs filed a two count complaint against the defendants, claiming that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>breached their fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs, as creditors of NCT Group, and that their actions violated CUTPA. Neither NCT Group nor NCT Midcore, Inc., were named as defendants in the action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 21, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a revised complaint, again alleging breach of fiduciary duties in count one and CUTPA violations in count two. The defendants filed a motion to strike both counts of the revised complaint, which the court granted, and the plaintiffs then filed a substitute complaint in which they repleaded count one of the revised complaint and \u201creserve [ed] their right to appeal the decision to strike [the] second [CUTPA] count.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The substituted first count in the substitute complaint alleged that the defendants\u2019 actions constituted a tortious interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under their agreement with NCT Group. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants, as officers and directors of NCT Group, were aware of the corporation\u2019s obligations to the plaintiffs under the agreement and that they \u201cintentionally refused to cause delivery to [the plaintiffs] of the requisite number of shares of NCT Group stock due and owing to them under the [agreement.\u201d The defendants filed a motion to strike the count, and the court granted the motion in a memorandum of decision filed February 14, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">On February 29,2008, the plaintiffs filed their second substitute complaint. Again, they reserved their right to appeal from the court\u2019s decision that struck the CUTPA count in their revised complaint. The repleaded count in the second substitute complaint, alleging tortious interference with contractual relations, added allegations that the defendants\u2019 actions were outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>scope of their authority as officers and directors of NCT Group and that the failure to cause the issuance of the shares of NCT Group stock to the plaintiffs was part of a scheme to undermine the corporation for their own self- interests. The defendants filed a motion to strike the repleaded count of the second substitute complaint, and the court granted that motion in a memorandum of decision filed November 26, 2008. The court subsequently granted the defendants\u2019 motion for entry of judgment in favor of the defendants and rendered judgment thereon. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The standard of review in an appeal from the granting of a motion to strike is well established. \u201cBecause a motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court, our review of the court\u2019s ruling . . . is plenary. ... It is fundamental that in determining the sufficiency of a complaint challenged by a defendant\u2019s motion to strike, all well-pleaded facts and those facts necessarily implied from the allegations are taken as admitted.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>252 Conn. 641, 667, 748 A.2d 834 (2000). \u201cFor the purpose of ruling upon a motion to strike, the facts alleged in a complaint, though not the legal conclusions it may contain, are deemed to be admitted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Murillo </em>v. <em>Seymour Ambulance Assn., Inc., </em>264 Conn. 474, 476, 823 A.2d 1202 (2003). \u201cA motion to strike is properly granted if the complaint alleges mere conclusions of law that are unsupported by the facts alleged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>Alves, </em>262 Conn. 480, 498, 815 A.2d 1188 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The plaintiffs claim that the court improperly struck count two of their revised complaint which alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the defendants engaged in conduct that violated CUTPA. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that CUTPA should be interpreted to permit a cause of action against individuals acting in a corporate or agent capacity, provided the cause of action otherwise satisfies the criteria for a cognizable CUTPA claim. We conclude that the plaintiffs failed to state a legally sufficient cause of action under CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u201c[General Statutes \u00a7] 42-110b (a) provides that [n]o person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices <em>in the conduct of any trade or commerce. </em>It is well settled that in determining whether a practice violates CUTPA we have adopted the criteria set out in the cigarette rule by the federal trade commission for determining when a practice is unfair: (1) [W]hether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise\u2014in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers, [competitors or other businesspersons]. ... All three criteria do not need to be satisfied to support a finding of unfairness.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Bradley Memorial Hospital &amp; Health Center, Inc., </em>296 Conn. 315, 350, 994 A.2d 153 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In the CUTPA count of their revised complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that they were creditors of NCT Group, that the defendants owed a fiduciary duty to them as creditors of NCT Group,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the defendants preferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>themselves in the form of large salaries and benefits to the detriment of the plaintiffs, that the defendants acted out of self-interest and in bad faith, and have engaged in self-dealing as the directors and officers of NCT Group when NCT Group was insolvent. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants have refused to deliver the shares of stock due and owing to them under the agreement with NCT Group, that the conduct of the defendants occurred in their primary business, trade or commerce and that the aforesaid conduct was unfair, deceptive and unscrupulous. The gravamen of the plaintiffs\u2019 CUTPA claim is that the defendants refused to cause NCT Group to fulfill its obligations under the agreement for personal and wrongful reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In its memorandum of decision filed August 16, 2007, the court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 revised complaint, contrary to the legal conclusions stated therein, failed to allege any facts to support the claim that the defendants\u2019 conduct involved trade or commerce as defined in CUTPA. The plaintiffs had argued that the alleged conduct impacted trade or commerce because it concerned NCT Group\u2019s relationship with its creditors and, in particular, NCT Group\u2019s ability to pay the plaintiffs. The court disagreed and noted that the plaintiffs had failed to distinguish between the corporate acts of NCT Group and the decisions of the individual defendants that caused those acts: \u201c[T]he plaintiffs\u2019 argument . . . obliterates the corporate shield so that any act of the corporation may be attributed to its directors or officers so that the latter may be held hable under CUTPA.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court recognized that there are circumstances under which the individual acts of a corporate officer or director may form the basis of a CUTPA claim, but it concluded that the plaintiffs did not allege facts to support such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Here, the defendants, as officers and directors of NCT Group, were providing services to NCT Group, not the plaintiffs. It is well settled that purely intracorporate conflicts do not constitute CUTPA violations. <em>Ostrowski </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>243 Conn. 355, 379, 703 A.2d 117 (1997); <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>91 Conn. App. 619, 647, 882 A.2d 98, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 924, 925, 888 A.2d 92 (2005). Our Supreme Court has distinguished, however, internal corporate actions that also have the effect of usurping the customers, employees or assets of one business in favor of another business. <em>Ostrowski </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>supra, 379. In the present case, the plaintiffs did not allege that the defendants personally engaged in any business or commercial activity in competition with the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the present matter involves purely intracorporate matters, and the plaintiffs failed to allege any facts in their revised complaint that would satisfy CUTPA\u2019s requirement that the defendants\u2019 conduct implicated trade or commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The plaintiffs also claim that the court improperly struck count one of their second substitute complaint which alleged that the defendants engaged in conduct that constituted a tortious interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the agreement with NCT Group. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants\u2019 conduct was outside the scope of their authority as NCT Group officers and directors because they \u201crefusjed] to cause NCT Group to deliver the requisite shares\u201d of stock to the plaintiffs \u201csolely in order to benefit themselves in the form of stock options or warrants, excessive salaries, bonuses and other benefits.\u201d We conclude that the plaintiffs failed to state a legally sufficient cause of action for tortious interference with contractual relations under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\u201cA claim for intentional interference with contractual relations requires the plaintiff to establish: (1) the existence of a contractual or beneficial relationship; (2) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of that relationship; (3) the defendant\u2019s intent to interfere with the relationship; (4) that the interference was tortious; and (5) a loss suffered by the plaintiff that was caused by the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct.\u201d <em>Rioux </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>283 Conn. 338, 351, 927 A.2d 304 (2007). \u201c[N]ot every act that disturbs a contract or business expectancy is actionable. . . . [A]n action for intentional interference with business relations . . . requires the plaintiff to plead and prove at least some improper motive or improper means. . . . [A] claim is made out [only] when interference resulting in injury to another is wrongful by some measure beyond the fact of the interference itself.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Larsen Chelsey Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Larsen, </em>232 Conn. 480, 502 n.24, 656 A.2d 1009 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u201cHowever, it is well-settled that the tort of interference with contractual relations only lies when a third party adversely affects the contractual relations of two <em>other </em>parties.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wellington Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Redding Group, Inc., </em>49 Conn. App. 152, 168, 714 A.2d 21, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 905, 720 A.2d 516 (1998). \u201c[T]here can be no intentional interference with contractual relations by someone who is directly or indirectly a party to the contract. [T]he general rule is that the agent may not be charged with having interfered with a contract of the agent\u2019s principal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Appleton </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>53 Conn. App. 252, 267, 730 A.2d 88 (1999), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 254 Conn. 205, 757 A.2d 1059 (2000). \u201c[A]n agent acting legitimately within the scope of his authority cannot be held liable for interfering with or inducing his principal to breach a contract between his principal and a third party, because to hold him liable would be, in effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>to hold the corporation liable in tort for breaching its own contract . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wellington Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Redding Group, Inc., </em>supra, 168. In other words, an exception to the general rule applies if the agent \u201cdid not act legitimately within his scope of duty but used the corporate power improperly for personal gain.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In their second substitute complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that they had entered into a contractual relationship with NCT Group, that the defendants were aware of the existence of that contractual relationship, that the defendants entered into a fraudulent scheme to deprive the plaintiffs of their rights under the merger agreement for the sole purpose of ensuring that they would receive exorbitant salaries, stock options and other benefits, that the defendants caused NCT Group to become a mere conduit for their own mutual benefit and self-interests, and that such actions were not within the scope of the defendants\u2019 duties as officers and directors of NCT Group. Again, the gravamen of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that the defendants refused to cause NCT Group to fulfill its obligations under the merger agreement for personal and wrongful reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 second substitute complaint, contrary to the legal conclusions stated therein, failed to allege any facts to support the claim that the defendants did not act legitimately within the scope of their duties as officers and directors of NCT Group. The court stated that the plaintiffs failed to recognize that the wrongful <em>use </em>of authority does not necessarily mean that the conduct was outside the <em>scope </em>of that authority. The decision to issue or to not issue stock, the court noted, clearly was within the scope of the defendants\u2019 authority: \u201c[T]he court simply cannot conclude on the basis of any of the complaint\u2019s specifically alleged facts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>a decision not to issue the shares of stock was so inimical and hostile to any conceivable interest of N CT Group that this failure to act was outside of the defendants\u2019 authority. The defendants had the authority to make this decision, even though, according to the allegations of the complaint, they abused it.\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action should be stricken because holding the defendants liable effectively would be holding NCT Group liable in tort for allegedly breaching its own contract by failing to issue the shares of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The court properly struck count one of the second substitute complaint. The plaintiffs have failed to allege facts that would support their legal conclusion that the defendants\u2019 conduct in refusing to issue the shares of stock to the plaintiffs was outside the scope of their duties as officers and directors of NCT Group. \u201cIn determining whether an employee has acted within the scope of employment, coruts look to whether the employee\u2019s conduct: (1) occurs primarily within the employer\u2019s authorized time and space limits; (2) is of the type that the employee is employed to perform; and (3) is motivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer.\u201d <em>Harp </em>v. <em>King, </em>266 Conn. 747, 782-83, 835 A.2d 953 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u201cIf the measure of the applicability of [the intracorporate conspiracy] doctrine was keyed to the alleged wrongdoing of corporate officers, it would quickly become a meaningless concept. In every case of conspiracy . . . there are necessarily accusations of wrongful conduct. The test [therefore] is not the wrongful nature of the conspirators\u2019 actions but whether the wrongful conduct was performed within the scope of the conspirators\u2019 official duties. ... An employee acts within the scope of his employment as long as he is discharging his duties or endeavoring to do his job, no matter how irregularly, or with what disregard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>instructions.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 785-86.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">There are no allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 second substitute complaint that a \u201crefusal to cause\u201d shares of stock to be issued, whether to the plaintiffs or to any other individual or entity, is conduct that falls outside of the scope of the defendants\u2019 duties as officers and directors of NCT Group. Instead, the plaintiffs have ascribed sinister motivations to conduct taken in the normal course of corporate management. The second substitute complaint contains no allegations that the defendants affirmatively used their corporate power to interfere with the contractual relations between the plaintiffs and NCT Group. It is the passive act of not authorizing shares to be issued to the plaintiffs as creditors, characterized as fraudulent and self-dealing, that forms the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Instead of issuing shares of stock to the plaintiffs, the defendants made decisions that resulted in the payment of salaries and benefits to themselves and the corporation\u2019s employees. In so doing, there are no allegations that these decisions were concealed or made at a time, place or manner other than in the course of the business normally transacted by corporate management. Conclusory allegations of improper motivation are not sufficient in the absence of well pleaded facts to support them. <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>Alves, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 498. We conclude, therefore, that the court correctly determined that the plaintiffs failed to plead a cognizable tortious interference with contract claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>and properly struck cotint one of the second substitute complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In this opinion FLYNN, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\"> NCT Midcore, Inc., is now known as Midcore Software, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\"> The plaintiffs alleged in their revised complaint that they have commenced a separate action against NCT Group seeking damages in connection with these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\"> As previously noted, the court struck the first count of the plaintiffs\u2019 revised complaint that alleged breach of fiduciary duties.

Although I agree with part I of the majority opinion, I respectfully disagree with part II. In my opinion, the plaintiffs, Jerrold M. Metcoff and David B. Wilson, have alleged sufficient facts in their complaint to support their legal claim that the defendants\u2019 conduct in refusing to issue the shares of stock to the plaintiffs was outside the scope of their duties as officers and directors of NCT Group. The defendants are Irene Lebovics, Cy E. Hammond, John J. McCloy II, Sam Oolie and Michael J. Parrella, Sr. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from part II in which the majority concludes that the trial court correctly found that the plaintiffs failed to plead a cognizable tortious interference with contract claim and, thus, properly struck count one of the second substitute complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">As the majority notes, the standard of review in an appeal from the granting of a motion to strike is well established. \u201cA motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading, and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court. As a result, our review of the court\u2019s ruling is plenary. . . . We take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. . . . Thus, [i]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ventres </em>v. <em>Goodspeed Airport, LLC, </em>275 Conn. 105, 154, 881 A.2d 937 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1111, 126 S.

However, it is well-settled that the tort of interference with contractual relations only lies when a third party adversely affects the contractual relations of two other parties. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wellington Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Redding Group, Inc., </em>49 Conn.

[A]n agent acting legitimately within the scope of his authority cannot be held liable for interfering with or inducing his principal to breach a contract between his principal and a third party, because to hold him liable would be, in effect, to hold the corporation liable in tort for breaching its own contract . . .

The dispositive issue for the court was its determination that finding the defendants liable would effectively be holding NCT Group hable in tort for allegedly breaching its own contract by failing to issue the shares owed to the plaintiffs. More specifically, the court concluded that \u201cthe decision not to issue the shares was the type of decision that the defendants were employed or retained to perform in order for there to be a corporate act, and the court simply cannot conclude on the basis of any of the complaint\u2019s specifically alleged facts that a decision not to issue the shares of stock was so inimical and hostile to any conceivable interest of NCT Group that this failure to act was outside of the defendants\u2019 authority.\u201d In light of our scope of employment jurisprudence, however, I do not agree with this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u201cIn determining whether an employee has acted within the scope of employment, courts look to whether the employee\u2019s conduct: (1) occurs primarily within the employer\u2019s authorized time and space limits; (2) is of the type that the employee is employed to perform; and (3) is motivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer. . . . Ordinarily, it is a question of fact as to whether a wilful tort of the servant has occurred within the scope of the servant\u2019s employment . . . [b]ut there are occasional cases [in which] a servant\u2019s digression from [or adherence to] duty is so clear-cut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>that the disposition of the case becomes a matter of law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harp </em>v. <em>King, </em>266 Conn. 747, 782-83, 835 A.2d 953 (2003). Under the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine, a doctrine the majority cites to, the test is not the \u201cwrongful nature of the conspirators\u2019 actions but whether the wrongful conduct was performed within the scope of the conspirators\u2019 official duties. ... An employee acts within the scope of his employment as long as he is discharging his duties or endeavoring to do his job, no matter how irregularly, or with what disregard of instructions.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 785-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In <em>Harp, </em>the plaintiff, a real estate developer and architect, argued on appeal that the trial court improperly granted the motions for summary judgment filed by the defendants, employees of the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority (authority), because his claims were not barred by the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine. Specifically, he argued that his claims were not barred because the defendants were not acting within the scope of their employment when they engaged in their allegedly tortious conduct. Id., 782. Our Supreme Court disagreed and affirmed the judgment by concluding that \u201cthere is nothing in the record from which a fact finder could conclude that the defendants\u2019 allegedly tortious conduct had occurred outside the scope of their employment.\u201d Id., 783. Although the plaintiff submitted some evidence that tended to support his claim of disparate and unfair treatment, the court stated that he failed to explain why the defendants\u2019 actions fell outside the scope of the defendants\u2019 employment, even though all of those actions were undertaken in the discharge of their official duties and in the furtherance of the authority\u2019s business. Id., 785. Consequently, our Supreme Court determined that the plaintiffs contention that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>defendants were not acting within the scope of their employment was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The case before us is easily distinguishable from <em>Harp. </em>Here, the plaintiffs specifically alleged that the defendants entered into a fraudulent scheme with an outside lender that was designed to deprive the plaintiffs of their rights under the merger agreement for the sole purpose of ensuring that the defendants would receive exorbitant salaries, stock options and other benefits\u2014the scheme, according to the plaintiffs, had nothing to do with the interests of NCT Group, an insolvent corporation. The capital to fund the fraudulent scheme came from an outside lender to NCT Group. Pursuant to the scheme, NCT Group would next default on the outside lender\u2019s notes, eventually resulting in the conversion of the notes into more shares of NCT Group stock without the lender providing additional capital. On account of these loan transactions, the lender came to own substantially more shares of NCT Group stock than the corporation was authorized to issue. The lender dictated that the capital loaned to NCT Group was to be used principally by the defendants to fund their exorbitant compensation plan that was comprised of, inter alia, salaries, benefits, stock options and warrants. In turn, the defendants continued to grant these pyramiding stock options, warrants and rights to the lender so that if the company, as a result of this fraudulent scheme, was subsequently sold or merged, the defendants would be rewarded with a golden parachute. Thus, the defendants utilized the royalties owed to the plaintiffs in order to keep this scheme functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The defendants\u2019 self-dealing caused NCT Group to cease to function as an independent entity and was replaced by an organization that served as a mere conduit for the defendants\u2019 own mutual benefit and self-interests. The plaintiffs alleged that such intentional, unauthorized self-dealing was in fact destructive of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>interests of NCT Group and beyond the defendants\u2019 charged responsibilities and authority as officers or directors. In light of the foregoing, the plaintiffs stated in their second substitute complaint that the \u201c[defendants acted outside the scope of their authority as NCT Group directors and officers for self gain, without regard for the consequences of their actions, without regard for NCT Group\u2019s obligations under the [agreement, without regard for the injuries, damages, and losses their wrongful conduct would cause to [the] [plaintiffs, and in a manner totally devoid of any motivation or purpose to serve NCT Group, in refusing to cause deliveiy of said shares [owed] to the [p]laintiffs [under the agreement].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Given these allegations, I do not agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs failed to allege any facts to support the claim that the defendants did not act legitimately within the scope of their duties as officers and directors of NCT Group. Although I agree with the majority that the plaintiffs did not narrowly frame their allegations to aver that the defendants\u2019 \u201crefusal to cause\u201d shares of stock to be issued is conduct that falls outside the scope of their duties as officers and directors of NCT Group, this conclusion is not dispositive of the appeal. Rather, a corporate agent may be deprived of the immunity afforded to him by his status if he employed corporate power solely for his own benefit rather than for corporate purposes. See <em>Walsky </em>v. <em>Gastaldi, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket No. CV-89-0101368-S (July 26, 1990). To hold otherwise would allow any corporate agent, despite the severity of the allegations of self-dealing, to escape liability under a tortious interference with contract action by claiming that he possessed the general power through his employment position to make the decision or, alternatively, to refrain from performing the act at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>I would hold that under the specific facts as pleaded in this case the defendants exceeded the scope of their employment by declining to issue the plaintiffs\u2019 shares due under the merger agreement solely to line their own pockets at the direct expense of NCT Group. The plaintiffs have sufficiently explained why such actions are not confined within the authorized functions the defendants were charged with performing. Accordingly, I conclude that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to strike count one of the second substitute complaint and I would reverse the judgment and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
