The State was given until October 1, 1969, to enact statutes redistricting the State so as to correct the constitutional infirmity. Upon the State\u2019s failure to enact such statutes, the District Court, on December 15, 1969, entered an order establishing legislative districts in the State. This Court, on February 2, 1970, granted a stay of the District Court\u2019s December 15 order pending the filing and disposition of an appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">The respondents have now filed a motion to vacate the stay. I would grant the motion. The constitutionality of the present Indiana apportionment scheme was thoroughly briefed and argued in the three-judge District Court below. There is no reason to disturb the order of that court pending the disposition of the appeal by this Court. The date for the commencement of filing for the November 1970 election to the General Assembly is February 24, 1970. The Governor contends that without a stay the State will be forced to conduct the forthcoming election under the reapportionment plan of the District Court. By granting the stay, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>this Court has equally forced the respondents to go \u25a0through the election under the present scheme which was held unconstitutional by the District Court. Under these circumstances, I see no reason to stay the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
