I acknowledge this debt of my own free will and accord and not because of any threats of legal prosecution by the said firm. The debt which I acknowledge is for money loaned to me by the corporation in the form of certain drawing accounts and advances made during my period of employ, which drawing* account and advances were made on my written agreement to repay if I left the employ of the firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">I am leaving the employ of Douglas Lawson, Incorporated, after some five years of pleasant relationship, and I am leaving* not because of any action of any member of the corporation or of any act of the corporation itself. I am leaving to enter the fire general agency business in association with Mr. L. D. Paine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">I hereby bind myself to repay to the firm of Douglas Lawson, Incorporated the sum of $1,897.44 together with 5% interest, annually, such interest to be computed on the first of each month and added to the principal sum. To repay this debt I bind myself to pay $50. on the first day of October, 1937, and $50. on the first day of each month following until the first of October, 1938, at which time I bind myself to pay $100.-00 on the first of October, 1938, and on the first of each month following* until the entire debt with accumulated interest is paid in full.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>I also bind the firm of L. D. Paine, Inc., for myself and for Mr. Paine, whose signature is attached to this letter, to place all insurance business of L. D. Paine, Inc., which cannot be placed in the general agencies held by L. D. Paine, Inc. through the office of Douglas Lawson, Incorporated. It is our understanding with the firm of Douglas Lawson, Incorporated that any business which we offer to that firm and which is unacceptable to them will be placed at our discretion where we desire and such placements in no way violate the terms of the agreement which this letter constitutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-3\">I enter into this agreement with the firm of Douglas Lawson, Incorporated on the express understanding that as long as I live up to the terms of this agreement and the firm of L. D. Paine, Inc. lives up to this agreement, Douglas Lawson, Incorporated will not endeavor to collect any unpaid balance of my indebtedness nor take any action detrimental to my status with the insurance commissioner\u2019s office as a licensed broker or agent in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">It is understood that all my renewal and new commissions will be applied against this overdraft in addition to my monthly payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">Signed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">LAURENCE M.

D. PAINE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">Accepted for Douglas Lawson, Incorporated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">By:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">Huntington v. Frothingham, Vice-President.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">The defendant Fessenden demurred to the declaration, assigning as cause of demurrer (1) that the declaration is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>inconsistent with the written agreement set forth, in that the declaration alleges that the general agency business of L. D. Paine, Inc. was for the sale of fire insurance only, whereas there is nothing in said written agreement to show that general agency was limited to the sale of fire insurance only.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\">(2) That the written agreement set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration is inconsistent with the cause of action as set forth in said counts in that it does not therein appear that this defendant ever agreed to cause the corporation to do anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">(3) That the cause of action set forth in these counts is illegal and contrary to public policy in that it seeks to bind an officer of a corporation to take action as an officer in the future without regard to his duty at that time to the corporation and its stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The defendant Paine also demurred to the declaration, assigning as cause of demurrer the same causes assigned by the defendant Fessenden, and in addition thereto, assigned that as to count one of the declaration (1) That the plaintiff has not stated such a ease as entitles him to an action against this defendant. (2) That under the written agreement set forth, this defendant expressly disclaims any personal liability for the payment of the defendant Fessenden\u2019s indebtedness to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">After hearing, the demurrer of each defendant was sustained as to Counts II, III and IV, and the plaintiff was given leave to file an amended declaration on or before a specific date. No amended declaration was filed and the matter has been reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">At the time of argument before this Division, the defendants orally waived the ground of illegality as assigned in their respective demurrers.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>A careful reading of the instrument herein sued upon, discloses no basis for construing the same or any portion thereof, as creating a joint liability of the two defendants. It does not purport to be signed by the corporation, but on the contrary it appears to be signed by the two defendants individually, both of whom identified themselves as of the corporation. However, such a recital would not bind the corporation. <em>Guernsey v. Cook, </em>117 Mass. 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">It is very apparent that this written instrument created and contains several contracts. One contract is that of the defendant Fessenden, which is alleged and declared in count one of the declaration. Another contract is that of the same defendant which is alleged and declared in count three; and a third contract that of the defendant Paine, which is alleged and declared in count four. These several contracts created by one written instrument could properly be joined in one action by virtue of the provisions of Gen. Laws (Ter. Ed.) Chap. 231, \u00a74. <em>Grocers\u2019 Bank v. Kingman, </em>16 Gray 473. Said contracts, while contained in one instrument, are not the same, and, in accordance with the statute above referred to, are properly stated on different counts. <em>Colt v. Learned, </em>118 Mass. 380, cf. <em>Costigan v. Lunt, </em>104 Mass. 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u201cIt is an established rule -of law that a party to a contract like that of these defendants shall not be bound beyond the extent of the engagement which appears from the terms of the contract and the nature of the transaction to have been in his contemplation at the time of entering into it, and that his liability cannot, without his consent, be extended or enlarged either by the obligee or by operation of law\u201d. <em>Grocers\u2019 Bank v. Kingman &amp; others, </em>16 Gray 473-475.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Count II of the declaration alleging a joint liability finds no support within the four corners of the instrument declared upon. Therefore, let the following entry be made\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\">\n<em>Demurrers of the respective defendants sustained as to count II and overruled as to counts III and IV.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
