Laws, Ch. 231, sec. 135. The decision turns on the meaning to be given to that part of said statute which provides that, \u2014\u201cSuch party, within twenty days after the date of such notice from the Clerk or other official, shall pay to him the amount of such estimate.\u201d The facts shown by the docket are that on April 10,1940, the clerk issued a notice in writing to the defendant stating the amount of the estimated cost of the printing required for the appeal. It appears that the said notice was received and stamped by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>United States Post Office authorities at 5:30 P. M., on said April 10th. The evidence shows that it did not reach the defendant or her attorney until the morning of April 11th, 1940. It further appears that the amount of the estimate was,paid into court on May 1st, 1940. The plaintiff contends that \u201cthe deposit by the defendant on May 1, 1940, was twenty-one days from the date on the Clerk\u2019s notice\u201d . . . and, therefore, the defendant\u2019s appeal has not been properly perfected and should, therefore, be dismissed. It is obvious that if the date printed on the notice governs, his contention is sound. On the other hand it is also clear that if the date of its receipt controls then the payment was duly made and the motion is not tenable. The plaintiff\u2019s contention is not novel. It was left undecided in the case of <em>Neilson v. Malcolm Kenneth Co., </em>Mass. A. S. (1939) 1113, and cases there cited. Our Appellate Division, in the case of <em>Fifty Associates v. Berger Dry Goods Co., Inc., </em>No. 189039 (of 1929) Municipal Court of the City of Boston, (30 A. D. 323) in passing on a situation similar to that which is here presented, decided that \u201cdate\u201d used in the statute as originally passed meant only \u201ctime\u201d, and that the term \u201csuch notice\u201d, meant \u201cnotice given and received\u201d. It is unnecessary to again state the reasons there given which led to that conclusion. Suffice to say that we concur in the view there taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
