The appellant, Aubrey Bain, was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute Dilaudid, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and various substantive counts of distribution of Dilau-did, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Because we hold that the trial judge improperly refused to give a requested charge, we reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">During the course of trial, Bain properly requested the following charge which instructs the jury not to draw an adverse inference from his failure to testify.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2y\">The law does not compel a defendant in a criminal case to take the witness stand and testify, and, if he elects not to do so, no presumption of any kind can be raised against him, and no inference of any kind may be drawn by you from the fact he did not testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The first step in our analysis is whether Bain is entitled to such a charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">In <em>Bruno v. United </em>States, 308 U.S. 287, 60 S.Ct. 198, 84 L.Ed. 257 (1939), the Supreme Court held that the provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 632<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which legislates <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> against any presumption from a defendant\u2019s failure to testify requires that a defendant be given a properly requested charge<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> similar to the one requested here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Next, we must address the government\u2019s argument that the requested charge was superfluous because the essence of the requested instruction was contained in the following charge given by the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALx\">The law does not require of the defendant that he prove himself innocent nor is the defendant required to explain any matter which is not proved or about which you have a reasonable doubt, nor is he required to call any witnesses or produce any evidence but the burden is upon the Government to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-17\">. Since the burden is upon the Government to prove a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by proving beyond a reasonable doubt every essentia] element of the crime charged, the defendant has the right to rely upon the failure of the prosecution to establish such proof. The defendant may also rely upon evidence brought out on cross-examination of witnesses for the prosecution. The law does not impose upon the defendant the duty of producing any evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acq\">Fairly, we think the given charge might be termed a \u201cburden of proof\u201d charge. Its function is to inform the jury that the government must carry the burden proving the defendant\u2019s guilt. We think the given charge is significantly dissimilar to the \u201cfailure to testify\u201d charge requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-18\">It is not logically impossible for the government to have the burden of proof, but also allow a jury to draw an adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. <em>Cf. Baxter v. Palmigiano, </em>425 U.S. 308, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976) (in prison discipline proceeding state\u2019s decision must be based on substantial evidence, state may draw adverse inference from the inmate\u2019s failure to testify, but silence is insufficient alone to sustain the state\u2019s burden). Given this possibility, we think the requested charge gives the jury additional guidance to which the defendant is entitled. Support for this view is provided by the Supreme Court in <em>Taylor v. Kentucky, </em>436 U.S. 478, 98 S.Ct. 1930, 56 L.Ed.2d 468 (1978). In <em>Taylor </em>the state argued that a given instruction concerning the burden of proof also contained a requested, but not given, instruction concerning the presumption of innocence. In rejecting the state\u2019s argument, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">While the legal scholar may understand that the presumption of innocence and the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof are logically similar, the ordinary citizen well may draw significant additional guidance from an instruction on presumption of innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">We think the instant case is controlled by <em>Taylor </em>and the jury in Bain\u2019s case is entitled to the additional instruction that informs it to draw no adverse inference from the failure of the defendant to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Our last inquiry is whether the trial judge\u2019s error affected substantial rights of the parties or is nonreversible harmless error. We agree with Mr. Justice Frankfurter in <em>Bruno </em>that we are incapable of psychologically determining that the requested charge would have no affect on the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore think the failure to give the requested instruction rises to the level of reversible error. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>573 F.2d 284 (5 Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-10\">. Because we reverse this conviction, none of Bain\u2019s other arguments need be reached except Bain\u2019s requested charge concerning police testimony. His argument is insubstantial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b177-11\">. The charge is taken from Devitt &amp; Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice &amp; Instructions \u00a7\u00a7 12.10 and 12.11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b177-12\">. This section with minor variation is now found at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3481. The present section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-15\">In trial of all persons charged with the commission of offenses against the United States and in all proceedings in courts martial and courts of inquiry in any State, District, Possession or Territory, the person charged shall, at his own request, be a competent witness. His failure to make such request shall not create any presumption against him.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b177-19\">. Since we have decided this case on statutory ground, it is totally unnecessary to determine constitutional requirements. See <em>Adamson v. California, </em>332 U.S. 46, 67 S.Ct. 1672, 91 L.Ed. 1903 (1947); <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b177-20\">. See <em>Dickinson v. United States, </em>421 F.2d 630 (5 Cir. 1970); <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>366 F.2d 363 (9 Cir. 1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b177-21\">. The requested charge in <em>Bruno </em>was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-22\">The failure of any defendant to take the witness stand and testify in his own behalf, does not create any presumption against him; the jury is charged that it must not permit that fact to weigh in the slightest degree against any such defendant, nor should this fact enter into the discussions or deliberations of the jury in any manner.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b178-9\">. The government suggested in oral argument that Bain fares better without the requested instruction since the instruction waves the red flag to the jury that he has not testified. <em>See Lakeside v. Oregon, </em>435 U.S. 333, 98 S.Ct. 1091, 55 L.Ed.2d 319 (1978). Happily, we need not determine the psychological effect of this charge on the jury since Bain has, as a matter of trial strategy, chosen to take this chance and has requested an instruction to which he is entitled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b178-10\">RONEY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A7a\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">I respectfully dissent. In my judgment, the experienced trial judge\u2019s instructions fully communicated to the jury the fact that it could not consider any adverse presumption against defendant because he failed to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\"><em>Bruno v. United States, </em>308 U.S. 287, 60 S.Ct. 198, 84 L.Ed.2d 257 (1939), does not require a formula of words. Justice Frankfurter there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-13\">We conclude that the substance of the denied request should have been granted</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">308 U.S. at 294, 60 S.Ct. at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">The trial judge specifically instructed the jury on just what evidence it could consider, telling it that its verdict had to rest on that evidence alone. He then gave the instruction quoted in Judge Thornberry\u2019s opinion which, taken together with the rest of the charge, tells the jury that it cannot consider in any way the fact that the defendant produced no evidence, which encompasses the fact that he did not himself testify. The jury must have understood that it could draw no inference of any kind from defendant\u2019s failure to produce evidence, including his own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-17\">The other points on appeal being without merit, I would affirm the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
