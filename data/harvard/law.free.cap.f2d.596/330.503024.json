In 1971, Missouri General issued a comprehensive general liability insurance policy insuring Wholesale Materials Company, Inc. In 1972, Wholesale Materials Company, Inc., was named the defendant in a lawsuit for personal injuries filed in the Circuit Court of Forrest County, Mississippi. Pursuant to the terms of its policy issued to Wholesale Materials Company, Inc., Missouri General undertook the defense of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">Thereafter, during the course of the lawsuit, Missouri General became insolvent and a Receiver was appointed. Pursuant to Mississippi law, Mississippi Insurance Guaranty Association (hereinafter referred to as Guaranty Association), upon notice of the appointment of a Receiver for Missouri General, undertook the defense of the Mississippi suit. Subsequently, the Guaranty Association settled the lawsuit for $150,-000.00, and paid the sum of $150,000.00 out of its fund. As a result of the Receiver and the Guaranty Association both stating a claim to the reinsurance proceeds under the Agreement of Reinsurance No. 4191, General Reinsurance Corporation instituted this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>interpleader action, pursuant to Title 28, 1335 U.S.C. The case was submitted to the court below, without a jury, on the pleadings, stipulated facts and trial briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In holding that the Receiver of Missouri General was entitled to the reinsurance proceeds, the Court pointed to the plain language of the Reinsurance Agreement as mandating such a result. In the trial court\u2019s view, the interpretation of the Reinsurance Agreement entitling the Receiver to the reinsurance proceeds was consistent with both the State of Missouri\u2019s statutory scheme for winding up insurance companies and the weight of authority in other jurisdictions. Upon careful consideration of the records, the briefs and arguments of the parties, we affirm on the basis of the District Court\u2019s well reasoned opinion in <em>General Reinsurance Corporation v. Missouri General Insurance, et al., </em>458 F.Supp. 1 (W.D.Mo.1977), with, however, one addendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The following language from the case of <em>Homan v. Employers Reinsurance Corp., </em>345 Mo. 650, 136 S.W.2d 289, 298 (1939), supplies the basis for this Court\u2019s unwillingness to accept the third party beneficiary contention of appellant. The Supreme Court stated: \u201cIf the reinsurance contract was not to be subject to the provisions set out in the primary insurance contract, to wit, that any judgment against [the policyholder] be paid the contract could have been made definite and certain.\u201d In <em>First National Bank of Kansas City v. Higgins, </em>357 S.W.2d 139, 145, (Mo.) the Supreme Court quoted this excerpt from the <em>Homan </em>case and stated, \u201cWe are in complete agreement with the above statements * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In the context of the present case, Article I of Reinsurance Agreement No. 4191 provided, in part: \u201cIn no instance shall any insured of the Company or any claimant against an insured of the Company have any rights under this Agreement.\u201d By including the above clause in the Agreement of Reinsurance the parties have taken the course of action prescribed by the Court in <em>Homan, supra, </em>to avoid the reinsurer being held liable by the primary insured\u2019s policyholders, or their claimants. The clear intent of the parties to exclude original insureds and claimants against insureds from having any rights under the Agreement of Reinsurance is both definite and certain. In Article I of Agreement of Reinsurance No. 4191, General Reinsurance and Missouri General made very clear their intentions that General Reinsurance was not assuming the obligations of Missouri General on its policies. In so doing the parties foreclosed the possibility of General Reinsurance being held liable on a third party beneficiary theory to an original insured or to those who may claim under him.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
