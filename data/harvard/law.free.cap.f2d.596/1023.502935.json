We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-21\">In June, 1970, Plaintiff Mr. Magic Car Wash, Inc., (Mr. Magic), an independent marketer of motor gasoline which owns and operates a single retail service station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Mobil Oil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>Corporation (Mobil), a major, integrated petroleum company, entered into a supply contract whereby Mobil agreed to sell and Mr. Magic agreed to buy five million gallons of gasoline over a five-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">The price offered Mr. Magic was 2.5 cents per gallon lower than the regular dealer tank wagon price. Other considerations, including a cash loan and a $10,000 line of credit from Mobil, were included in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">The supply contract between the parties was established by two letters dated June 22nd and June 23rd, 1970. Mobil\u2019s June 22nd letter to Mr. Magic read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZN\">In order to meet offers that have previously been made to you by one or more of our competitors, we have agreed to give you a competitive discount .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">The letter closes with the statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-8\">Please sign and return the copy of this letter indicating your acceptance of these terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">The letter was \u201caccepted and agreed to\u201d with the signature of James Schaming, president of Mr. Magic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">The second letter, dated June 23rd, was even more explicit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-11\">On June 22, 1970, we (Mobil) made a Dealer Contract with you (Mr. Magic). In order to meet competitive conditions as represented by you and confirmed by your acceptance of this agreement, we have, as you know, furnished you with a (competitive discount and prepayment)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-17\">You have represented to us that a responsible competitor of ours has offered to you an agreement or agreements involving substantially the same benefits and on substantially the same terms as those contained in our agreements with you</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-18\">Again, the letter was \u201caccepted and agreed to\u201d by James Schaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-19\">On June 26, 1973, Mobil notified Mr. Magic of its intention to exercise its right to withdraw the competitive allowance, whereupon, on August 30, 1973, Mr. Magic timely exercised its right of termination of the agreement. Mobil released Mr. Magic from any further obligation under the contract and Mr. Magic entered into a supply arrangement with another refiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-20\">The Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Allocation Act or EPAA), was enacted on November 27, 1973. When, in March, 1974, FEA\u2019s Mandatory Petroleum Allocation Regulations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> adopted pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>thereto,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> required suppliers and dealers to return to the buyer-seller relationship as it existed on May 15, 1973, Mr. Magic and Mobil resumed dealing with each other. Following that compulsory re-establishment of Mobil\u2019s supplier relationship with Mr. Magic, a dispute arose as to the proper ceiling price of gasoline sold to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mobil alleged that the competitive situation that prompted the initial allowance was no longer present, and Mr. Magic should, therefore, be treated on a par with others in the relevant class of purchaser and, consequently, refused to reinstate either the competitive allowance or the credit arrangements which had been in effect during the base period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Upon resuming the buyer-seller relationship mandated by the FEA, Mobil contended that it was required to charge Mr. Magic the same dealer tank wagon price it had charged all lessee-dealer retailers on May 15, 1973. Mr. Magic then filed a complaint with the FEA alleging that Mobil was in violation of 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.62 by refusing to reinstate the competitive allowance and the credit arrangement which had been the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqn-dedup-0\">normal business practices of the supplier for that class of purchaser during the base period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">While this controversy was pending before the FEA, the agency invited both Mobil and Mr. Magic to comment on its Ruling 1975 \u2014 2 as it related to the pending appeal. Mobil replied by maintaining that the Ruling sustained its position because the discount granted Mr. Magic was granted solely on the basis of a competitive offer. Mobil further contended that the factors cited by Mr. Magic as cost justification had not resulted in any cost savings to Mobil, the supplier, and thus could not make the discount a customary price differential.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">Mr. Magic\u2019s reply took the position that knowledge of cost justification is peculiarly within the knowledge of the seller and that, consequently, the purchaser should have the benefit of a cost justification which had the effect of shifting the burden to the seller. Mr. Magic submitted no evidence to support its conclusory allegations of cost justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">Following that exchange, the FEA issued its final Appeal Decision and Order. The FEA ruled that Mr. Magic need only be included as a member of Mobil\u2019s class of purchaser, which includes all similarly situated retailers, rather than in a separate class based on the competitive allowance. We quote therefrom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-12\">The file in this matter demonstrates that Mobil offered the competitive allowance to Mr. Magic solely to meet the offer of a competitor. Mr. Magic has submitted no evidence to the contrary. That offer did not fall within any of the factors listed in Section 212.31<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to be taken into account in determining a \u201ccustomary price differential\u201d. (R \u2014 199).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-13\">After determining that Mr. Magic did not constitute a unitary class of purchaser, the agency further held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-14\">. Mobil must treat Mr. Magic as a member of its class of purchaser which includes other similarly situated retail dealers under FEA Regulations and Mr. Magic is not entitled to the competitive allowance .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-15\">Mr. Magic\u2019s petition for Rehearing or Modification and for a Stay of the FEA Decision were each denied, whereupon Mr. Magic commenced this action in the District Court, alleging that the FEA\u2019s decision was in excess of its statutory authority and was not based on substantial evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>District Court found that there was no evidence in the record to suggest that the discount was based on any of the factors suggested by Mr. Magic in its complaint, and upheld the FEA\u2019s determination that Mr. Magic\u2019s discount was solely a competitive discount. Summary judgment was entered for the FEA, whereupon Mr. Magic instituted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">The Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, P.L. 93-159, 87 Stat. 627, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 751, <em>et seq., </em>was enacted by Congress and approved by the President on November 27, 1973. In Section 2 of that Act, Congress, after determining that \u201cshortages of crude oil, residual fuel oil, and refined petroleum products . . . now exist or are imminent\u201d; that \u201csuch shortages have created or will create severe economic dislocations and hardships, etc.\u201d; and that \u201csuch hardships and dislocations . . . constitute a national energy crisis which is a threat to the public health, safety and welfare, and can be averted or minimized most efficiently and effectively through prompt action by the Executive branch of government,\u201d pronounced the following declaration of purpose in enacting the EPAA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-8\">(b) The purpose of this chapter is to grant to the President of the United States and direct him to exercise specific temporary authority to deal with shortages of crude oil, residual fuel oil, and refined petroleum products or dislocations in their national distribution system. The authority granted under this chapter shall be exercised for the purpose of minimizing the adverse impacts of such shortages or dislocations on the American people and the domestic economy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">Pub.L. 93-159, \u00a7 2, Nov. 27, 1973, 87 Stat. 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">This broad objective was reinforced by Section 4(a) of the Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which required the President, within 15 days after enactment, to issue a regulation to provide for the mandatory allocation of crude oil, residual fuel oil, and refined petroleum products, and at prices specified in such regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-12\">Section 4(b)(1) of the EPAA provides that \u201cregulation ... to the maximum extent practicable, shall provide for . . :\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-13\">(D) preservation of an economically sound and competitive petroleum industry; including the priority needs to restore and foster competition in the producing, refining, distribution, marketing, and petrochemical sectors of such industry, and to preserve the competitive viability of independent refiners, small refiners, non-branded independent marketers, and branded independent marketers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-14\">* sfc \u00a1(e * j)t *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-15\">(I) minimization of economic distortion, inflexibility, and unnecessary interference with market mechanisms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-16\">In compliance with the Congressional mandate of the Allocation Act, the President delegated<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that authority to the FEO.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Acting in accordance with that delegated authority, the agency adopted the allocation rules and price regulations here under challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-17\">As we stated in <em>Pasco v. </em>FEA, 525 F.2d 1391:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-18\">It was the duty of the FEA to enact regulations consistent with a proper interpretation of the Allocation Act\u2019s objectives and, having done so, to determine the questions of the application or non-application of such regulations to companies which are within the purview of the Act. In reviewing the discharge of an agency\u2019s function in interpreting the Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>promulgating regulations thereunder and applying and enforcing such regulations, this court has recognized that <em>where administrative control has been congression-aiiy authorized, the \u201cjudicial function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the conclusions approved by the administrative body.\u201d </em>(Emphasis Added.) (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">We have no difficulty in holding, as we do, that the actions of the agency, which are involved in this proceeding and which culminated in the April 22, 1975, final Appeal Decision and Order, were all well within the authority of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">Mr. Magic further contends that, as a high-volume purchaser, operating an independently-owned car wash, it was a \u201cclass of purchaser\u201d entitled to receive the price discount which it had been receiving from its supplier (Mobil) on May 15, 1973. Mr. Magic maintains that FEA\u2019s Ruling 1975 \u2014 2 supports its position and cites the following language from the Ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-6\">It is important to point out, however, that certain discounts may have been \u201ccompetitive discounts\u201d in form, having ostensibly been granted to meet a lower offer and with an affidavit having been executed by the buyer to the effect, but may nevertheless also be cost justified under the Robinson-Patman Act. For example, a retail gasoline dealer that owns its retail facility may have been able to obtain a discount from its supplier that was made in good faith to meet a lower bona fide offer. But the willingness of sellers on May 15, 1973, to afford such discounts also reflected cost savings to such sellers, by virtue of the fact that other sales by such sellers were to customers that operated retail facilities owned by and leased from the sellers, and the rental for the facilities was reflected, in part, in the purchase price of gasoline. Similarly, \u201ccompetitive\u201d discounts on May 15, 1973, may have reflected cost savings attributable to volumes purchased, or to the fact that the sales were to non-branded rather than branded buyers, since in sales to non-branded customers sellers ordinarily do not incur certain expenses or do not provide certain services (such as a trademark license) that are incurred or provided in connection with sales to branded customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-9\">Thus, as a general rule the FEA will not require classes of purchaser to be established to maintain price differentials which on May 15, 1973, were in effect only to meet an equally low offer of a competitor. But the FEA will look behind broad assertions that a particular differential was a \u201ccompetitive\u201d discount and will determine whether in fact the differential was extended to meet a competitive offer and, even if it was, whether it was equally justifiable on a cost basis. Where there is an equally strong cost justification for a \u201ccompetitive\u201d discount, FEA will require it to be continued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A54\">40 C.F.R. 10655.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-10\">Here, however, the record is devoid of any evidence that the discounts granted Mr. Magic were cost-justified to the supplier, Mobil, and, notwithstanding Mr. Magic\u2019s contention on appeal, there is, in Ruling 1975 \u2014 2, no presumption favorable to Mr. Magic such as had existed in a prior ruling.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The only evidence in the record, aside from the conclusory allegations of Mr. Magic, supports the findings of the FEA and the District Court that \u201cthe file in this matter demonstrates that Mobil offered the competitive allowance to Mr. Magic <em>solely </em>to meet the offer of a competitor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This very explicit statement was on two successive days \u201caccepted and agreed to\u201d by the president of Mr. Magic. There is nothing in the administrative record that would suggest an alternative explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-11\">On the basis of the administrative record, we hold that the agency\u2019s Appeal Decision and Order was rational and supported by substantial evidence, and the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>Court\u2019s finding of substantial evidence was not clearly erroneous. It was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">Mr. Magic further requested this Court to order a rehearing of this case at the administrative level. That request was denied by the District Court and properly so. Both parties had ample opportunity to present any available evidence during the administrative process. The agency specifically invited comment from them in the light of Ruling 1975-2. Mr. Magic\u2019s April 1, 1975, response thereto was, as hereinabove stated, that knowledge of cost justification is peculiarly within the knowledge of the seller and that, consequently, Mr. Magic should have the benefit of a cost justification which had the effect of shifting the burden to Mobil. Furthermore, as pointed out above, Ruling 1975-2 established no such presumption upon which Mr. Magic could stand, and Mr. Magic offered no evidence in support of its contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">We quote from FEA\u2019s Decision and Order of May 22, 1975:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-7\">Section 205.135(b)(1) of the FEA Procedural Regulations states that a request for modification or rescission of an order or interpretation <em>shall be processed only if \u201cthe application demonstrates that it is based on significantly changed circumstances.\u201d </em>The submission filed by Mr. Magic does not demonstrate or even allege that it is based upon significantly changed circumstances. The basis for that submission is the firm\u2019s assertion that the FEA\u2019s April 22 Decision is erroneous and its further claim that it is able to produce evidence to show that the competitive allowance which it received from Mobil was cost-justified. However, Mr. Magic was afforded a full opportunity to submit comments regarding the application of Ruling 1975 \u2014 2 to its situation with Mobil prior to the issuance of the April 22 Decision and Order and the comments which the firm filed were considered by the FEA in its determination of Mobil\u2019s Appeal. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsNz\">Mr. Magic\u2019s petition to reopen the administrative hearing failed to \u201cdemonstrate or even allege that it is based upon significantly changed circumstances\u201d. The Supreme Court has adhered to its practice of \u201cdeclining to require reopening of the record, except in the most extraordinary circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> No such situation is presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-11\">The District Court was not clearly erroneous in granting the agency\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">. Upon enactment of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974, P.L. No. 93-275, 88 Stat. 96 (May 7, 1974), implemented by Executive Order 11790, the Federal Energy Office was abolished, and all authority delegated to the President by the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act was vested in the newly established Federal Energy Administration. Upon enactment of the Department of Energy Organization Act, P.L. 95-91, August 4, 1977, Executive Order No. 12009, 42 F.R. 46267 (September 15, 1977), the Department of Energy assumed the responsibility for enforcing the pricing and allocation authority. Since FEA was the responsible agency at the time relevant to this case, appellee will be referred to as \u201cFEA\u201d throughout this Opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1081-12\">.

Section 4(a) of that Act imposed on the FEA the mandatory duty to regulate the price of oil. It provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-13\">Not later than fifteen days after the date of enactment of this Act, the President shall promulgate a regulation providing for the mandatory allocation of crude oil, residual fuel oil, and each refined petroleum product, in amounts specified in (or determined in a manner prescribed by) and at prices specified in (or determined in a manner prescribed by) such regulation. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-14\">(b) Subsequently, FEA issued Part 212\u2014 Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations (10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.1 <em>et seq.) </em>to regulate prices throughout the industry.
