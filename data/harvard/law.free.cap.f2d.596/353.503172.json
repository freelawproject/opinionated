Southern California Edison (\u201cEdison\u201d) maintains a high-tower power transmission line which runs parallel to and contiguous with the west side of appellants\u2019 property. Edison</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>has proposed the construction of a second high-tower transmission line, which appellants allege will be located parallel to the existing line and to the east of appellants\u2019 property. Appellants claim that if the proposed line is constructed it will adversely affect their property by trapping it between two high-tower lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">On October 21, 1975, appellants filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the United States, Edison, and officials of the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d), and the U.S. Forest Service. Appellants alleged that federal approval was required for Edison to construct the proposed transmission line because it must pass over federal land. Alleging that federal approval was \u201cimminent,\u201d appellants\u2019 initial complaint sought both a declaration that defendants\u2019 failure to issue an environmental impact statement violated the provisions of NEPA and in-junctive relief to prevent construction of the power line.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">On January 29, 1975, the district court dismissed the complaint with leave to amend for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court concluded that \u201c[f]rom the pleadings herein, it appears that no final agency action by defendants subject to review by this Court has occurred; that at this stage the project is neither a federal nor a federalized one; that no major federal action with respect thereto has occurred; and that the pending action accordingly is presented prematurely.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">On June 10, 1976, appellants filed an amended complaint alleging that the Forest Service and the BLM had given Edison \u201ctacit approval\u201d for construction of the proposed transmission line. In their complaint appellants conceded that \u201cno official action\u201d had been taken on Edison\u2019s application for a right-of-way over federal land. However, the complaint alleged that Edison had engaged in conversations with representatives of the Forest Service and the BLM and that Edison had purchased a right-of-way over \u201cvast amounts\u201d of private land on both sides of the federal land.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Appellants\u2019 complaint was dismissed without leave to amend with respect to Edison on July 21,1976, and with respect to the federal defendants on September 6, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Appellants argue on appeal that the allegations of their complaint were sufficient to state a claim for relief under the National Environmental Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmX\">\u201call agencies of the Federal Government shall\u2014 . . (C) include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on\u2014 (i) the environmental impact of the proposed action, . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">The key question on this appeal is whether the \u201ctacit approval\u201d alleged by appellants is the kind of \u201cmajor Federal action\u201d that must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement. While official action on Edison\u2019s request for a right-of-way across federal land for a high-tower transmission line would require an environmental impact statement, appellants\u2019 complaint does not allege that any such action has occurred. The complaint only alleges that preliminary conversations have taken place between Edison and representatives of the affected federal agencies. The complaint\u2019s allegation that \u201ctacit approval\u201d has been given ignores the fact that federal agencies cannot simply acquiesce by silence in the construction of a power line across federal land. <em>(Utah Power &amp; Light Co. v. United States, </em>243 U.S. 389, 37 S.Ct. 387, 61 L.Ed. 791 (1917).) Even if the BLM and the Forest Service are contemplating taking action on Edison\u2019s application, the point has not been reached at which this court may intervene to review appellees\u2019 failure to file an environmental impact statement. <em>(Kleppe v. Sierra Club, </em>427 U.S. 390, 96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>S.Ct. 2718, 49 L.Ed.2d 576 (1976).) Edison\u2019s alleged acquisition of a right-of-way over private lands is not sufficient to state a claim for relief under NEPA in the absence of federal action. Actions taken by Edison based on its own prediction of likely federal action are undertaken at Edison\u2019s own peril. <em>(Utah Power &amp; Light, supra, </em>243 U.S. at 408 \u2014 10, 37 S.Ct. 387.) Thus the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 complaint was entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The district court did not err by denying appellants discovery after their original complaint was dismissed with leave to amend. A district court may properly exercise its discretion to deny discovery where, as here, it is convinced that the plaintiff will be unable to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (4A <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 30.52, at 30-49 (2d ed. 1975).)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
