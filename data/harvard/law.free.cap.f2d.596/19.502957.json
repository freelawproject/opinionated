They appeal from their perjury convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 resulting from their testimony before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Each was convicted of two counts after a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York before Marvin E. Frankel, Judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each appellant raises one argument going to admissibility of evidence, and each makes an argument on sufficiency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find none of the arguments availing and therefore affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Succinctly stated, the Galaxy Fund, which appellants controlled, collapsed when the value of securities that they had caused it to buy from S.J. Salmon &amp; Co., an over-the-counter brokerage concern specializing in new issues, collapsed as did the brokerage concern itself. Counts One and Three of the indictment charged Maultasch and Reddock respectively with perjury in their testimony before the SEC concerning the underlying agreement or understanding between Galaxy and S.J. Salmon &amp; Co., by which the former would purchase the latter\u2019s securities offerings and the latter would underwrite a public offering of the stock of the company managing Galaxy. Counts Two and Four charged perjury in connection with denials of personal profit by Maultasch and Reddock respectively from one or more customer accounts at S.J. Salmon &amp; Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">In 1970, appellant Maultasch was an accountant, and appellant Reddock worked as a registered representative at Leyner Dres-kin &amp; Co. (Leyner Dreskin), a small securities firm. They consulted J. Richard Leyner, a partner of the firm, about forming a management company or a holding company that would run mutual funds and about obtaining Leyner Dreskin to underwrite a public offering of the shares of the company. Mr. Leyner advised them first to acquire control of a mutual fund. This appellants did in early 1971, acquiring Galaxy Fund (the Fund), a mutual fund with assets of over $1 million. They became officers and directors of the Fund itself as well as of the Galaxy Group, Inc., which served as the management company for the Fund and determined stock purchases for it. The management company had a negative net worth and no ready expectation of profits, but appellants did seriously discuss with Leyner Dreskin a public offering of Galaxy Group, Inc., stock; and Leyner Dreskin undertook to raise about $500,000 from such a sale. Appellants wanted more money, however, and Leyner Dreskin backed out (although Mr. Leyner remained a Fund director) but suggested the firm of S.J. Salmon &amp; Co. (Salmon). Salmon was a securities firm that had underwritten several \u201chot\u201d new issues. Appellants met with William Helman, Sheldon Salmon, and Jerome Truen, three of the partners in Salmon at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>its office in early 1971. Helman and Truen were subsequently to testify as principal witnesses for the Government that Salmon agreed at that time to underwrite the public offering of the Galaxy Group, Inc., stock and that appellants agreed to buy Salmon issues for the Fund. Maultasch shortly thereafter reported to Mr. Leyner that Salmon would participate in the underwriting and that it was \u201cexpected\u201d that the Fund would purchase Salmon stocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">After appellants and Salmon concluded the underwriting deal, the Fund began to acquire various Salmon stocks: between April 1971 and the end of that year the Fund\u2019s holdings of Salmon issues went from none to over $500,000 worth of these \u201chot\u201d stocks, equal to 60% of the Fund\u2019s assets at cost. Mr. Leyner resigned as a director of the Fund in September 1971 because of this \u201cextraordinary activity.\u201d In that same month Salmon completed the underwriting of the public offering of Galaxy Group, Inc., which received from Salmon a check therefor in the amount of $774,200 ($888,000 raised in the offering less $113,800 underwriting fees). The questions and answers at the SEC investigation relating to the charges in Counts One and Three based on these agreements and transactions are set forth in the footnote.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Counts Two and Four relate to the following transactions. In March 1971 Maul-tasch and Reddock visited Baron Motors, a Lincoln-Mereury dealership on Long Island, to purchase for each a new Lincoln Continental. Appellants told owner Bernard Cohen that they wanted to pay for the automobiles out of profits on stock transactions that they would effect in his name; they assured him that the stock transactions would be profitable because they would be new issues that \u201cautomatically\u201d would rise to a premium price. Mr. Cohen agreed to the proposed purchase procedure; and each appellant obtained a late model Lincoln Continental for which he put down $1,000, financing the balance of the $7,000 purchase price. Cohen prepared a letter agreement that set forth their understanding that appellants would pay the balance of the purchase price from profits on the stock transactions. Cohen testified that he received from Salmon a new account card which he filled out. Transactions were then effected in his name, and he received checks from Salmon. In accordance with the letter agreement, he applied the proceeds to payments on Maultasch\u2019s and Red-dock\u2019s cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">Mr. Helman, one of the Salmon partners, testified that in June 1971 he had new issue stock available which he asked Maultasch if he wanted to take \u201cpersonally\u201d; the latter replied that he did want to take the stock and gave Helman Cohen\u2019s name. And in July 1971, after a particularly profitable stock transaction executed in Cohen\u2019s name, Maultasch purchased two Mercury Capris and fully paid for them from the proceeds. Some of the \u201chot\u201d issues were just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">In the fall of 1971 appellants set up a similar arrangement with Bernice Seidman, who owned a women\u2019s clothing store on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Long Island, arranging to pay for clothing from profits from stock transactions. Just as for Cohen, an account was opened at Salmon in Bernice Seidman\u2019s name; after a profitable transaction Maultasch\u2019s and Red-dock\u2019s wives each bought about $1,000 in clothing paid for out of the proceeds in the Seidman account at Salmon. At the SEC interrogation each appellant denied that he had an agreement with any person who had an account at Salmon to share in the profits or losses. The questions and answers that formed the basis for Counts Two and Four are set forth in the footnote.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE: PRIOR CONSISTENT STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Appellant Maultaseh\u2019s first point relates to the testimony of Helman and Truen, the two Salmon partners, about their understanding of the arrangement by which the Fund would purchase the stock of Salmon issues. After cross-examination of these two witnesses about their agreements with the Government and their own criminal convictions for stock manipulation and fraud, the district court ruled that their declarations to two other Salmon partners as to the 1971 Galaxy arrangement were admissible as prior consistent statements, pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> through the testimony of these other Salmon partners. The objection on appeal is not that defense counsel\u2019s interrogation was insufficient to constitute an implied charge of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive under the Rule, nor that the Government improperly introduced the pri- or consistent statements in its affirmative case. Instead, the argument on appeal is that \u201c[rjather than requiring the Government to recall the declarants \u2014 Helman and Truen \u2014 to introduce their prior statements, the district court permitted the Government to elicit this evidence through [other Salmon partners] who were only present when they were made.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is to say, appellants contend that because the declarants, Helman and Truen, who did testify at trial, were apparently not present in the courtroom at the time that the trial judge admitted the other partners\u2019 testimony as prior consistent statements, the statements were hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-17\">But appellants made no request to the court or to the Government to have Helman and Truen recalled for cross-examination. Not having done so they are in no position to raise the objection now. <em>See United States v. Fuentes, </em>563 F.2d 527, 531 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 959, 98 S.Ct. 491, 54 L.Ed.2d 320 (1977). Defense counsel at trial never argued that the Government must elicit the prior consistent statements first from Helman and Truen as presumably it could readily have done. Counsel did ask that the court preclude the Government from introducing the prior consistent statements of any Salmon partner other than Helman <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but made no objection that clearly stated the specific ground now asserted on appeal; a claim of error now is unavailing. Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a); <em>see United States v. Fuentes, supra. </em>We do not decide whether prior consistent statements are admissible only through the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>mony of the attacked witness himself. We note, however, that other circuits have allowed statements elicited not from the attacked witness but from third parties. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Lanier, 578 </em>F.2d 1246, 1255-56 (8th Cir. 1978); <em>see also United States v. Zuniga-Lara, </em>570 F.2d 1286, 1287 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 961, 98 S.Ct. 3080, 57 L.Ed.2d 1128 (1978); <em>United States v. McGrath, 558 </em>F.2d 1102, 1107 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1064, 98 S.Ct. 1239, 55 L.Ed.2d 765 (1978). We also note that appellants can make no claim of surprise because the \u00a7 3500 material<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> included the grand jury testimony of the other Salmon partners which related almost entirely to the prior consistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Maultasch also argues that the district court erred in permitting Truen to testify on re-direct to Helman\u2019s prior consistent statements. The trial court proceeded, however, on the basis that Maultasch\u2019s counsel opened the door on cross-examination by asking Truen whether he and Helman had had discussions \u201cconcerning the Galaxy arrangements\u201d before and after a meeting with appellants. We believe that Judge Frankel correctly admitted this evidence as to \u201cprecisely what those discussions were,\u201d the subject of the re-direct testimony. We therefore need not consider whether it was also admissible under Fed.R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(B) as a prior consistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE: THE TWO WITNESS RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Appellant Maultasch argues that under the two witness rule of perjury cases,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for perjury on account of his statement that he had no beneficial interest in any customer accounts at Salmon. The Government counters that it is sufficient if two different witnesses each testify to a separate transaction \u2014 in this case the maintenance of Bernard Cohen\u2019s and Bernice Seidman\u2019s accounts \u2014 relying upon <em>United States v. Weiner, </em>479 F.2d 923, 928 (2d Cir. 1973). <em>Weiner </em>stated that the rule in this circuit means no more than that the independent corroborating evidence \u201cmust tend to substantiate that part of the testimony of the principal prosecution witness which is material in showing that the statement made by the accused under oath was false,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 927\u201428; the court held that if a defendant denies <em>any </em>transactions, the Government satisfies the two witness rule if one witness testifies to one transaction and another witness to another transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">We hold that the Government satisfied the two witness rule through the testimony of Bernard Cohen and Bernice Seidman to two different transactions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is a \u201cprimary compliance\u201d with the rule if \u201cthe second witness has given independent testimony of another, separate and distinct incident or transaction, which if believed, would prove that what the accused said under oath was false.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is to say, it is wholly immaterial whether the second witness corroborates the first witness \u201cin whole, in part or not at all.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\"><em>United States v. Freedman, </em>445 F.2d 1220, 1225-26 (2d Cir. 1971), is not to the contrary. <em>Freedman </em>did not involve two witnesses testifying to different transactions but one witness testifying to two transactions. The witness was corroborated as to one transaction but not the other; this court reversed the conviction because the trial judge had instructed the jury that it could convict solely on the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>uncorroborated transaction. Because the Government here relied on the testimony of two different witnesses, <em>Freedman </em>is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">In any event, there <em>was </em>sufficient evidence to meet the requirements of the two witness rule as to each transaction. Appellant Maultasch in fact appears to concede in his brief that the Government may have introduced sufficient proof of the Cohen transaction, a concession well advised in view of the letter agreement between appellants and Cohen as to the terms for financing their automobiles. There was also sufficient corroborative evidence of the Seidman transaction. Mrs. Seidman testified directly to the overall agreement by which Maultasch would use stock profits in an account in her name at Salmon to pay for clothing for his wife. There was corroborative proof that an account was opened in her name on November 22, 1971; that Maultasch gave Helman the names of persons to whose accounts Salmon should allocate the 3,000 shares of a new offering of Comfax stock remaining out of the 10,-000 offered to Maultasch after the purchase of 7,000 shares for the Fund; that 200 of those shares were purchased for Mrs. Seid-man\u2019s account on December 2, 1971, at $7 per share and resold on December 6, 1971, at 20V4 per share for a $4,040 profit; that of the $4,040 check that Salmon mailed to Mrs. Seidman on December 20, 1971, $1,400 was the basis in the stock and $600 the anticipated tax, leaving approximately $2,000 for clothing purchases by Mrs. Maultasch and Mrs. Reddock; and that on December 8, 1971, two days after the profit was generated in Mrs. Seidman\u2019s account, Mrs. Maul-tasch bought $1,000 worth of clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE: SALMON\u2019S STOCK MANIPULATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Appellant Reddock argues that the court improperly admitted evidence of Salmon\u2019s stock manipulations. The method of Salmon\u2019s manipulations and the kind of stock involved (\u201chot\u201d new issues that rose rapidly after issuance only to plummet rapidly), at least those manipulations as to which there was no proof of appellant\u2019s knowledge, he argues, were irrelevant as well as unduly prejudicial. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the testimony pertaining to Salmon manipulations but subsequently admitted that he intended to use \u201csome of\u201d the evidence to impeach the Salmon partners, key Government witnesses, and thus induced the court to admit the evidence that it was otherwise inclined not to admit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE: INTEREST IN CUSTOMER</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Appellant Reddock argues that the Government failed to show that the Cohen and Seidman accounts were \u201cnominee\u201d accounts. But the technical characterization was never an issue. Reddock told the SEC interrogator that he did not \u201cshare in profits or losses\u201d in any account; the Government sought to prove that he did. The argument concerning \u201cnominee\u201d accounts is not to the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Reddock also argues that the questions that the SEC interrogator posed to him were insufficiently precise. <em>See United States v. Slawik, </em>548 F.2d 75, 86 (3d Cir. 1977); <em>cf. United States v. Bronston, </em>409 U.S. 352, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973) (literally correct but unresponsive and misleading answer cannot form basis for perjury conviction). But appellant\u2019s suggestion that because the interrogator did not specifically mention the Cohen and Seidman accounts they may have slipped appellant\u2019s mind is not convincing. Such accounts, by means of which both Maultasch and Red-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>dock financed high-priced automobiles and substantial clothing purchases, would not tend to slip one\u2019s mind as would, for example, the carrying of a notebook into an apartment, <em>see United States v. Razzaia, </em>370 F.Supp. 577 (D.Conn.1973), the only case that appellant discusses at any length. Judge Frankel commented that these questions told appellant everything that he needed to know to avoid inadvertently giving a false answer. Reading the questions, notes 3 and 4 <em>supra, </em>we do not disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-11\">. The court sentenced appellant Maultasch to one year\u2019s probation and a $100 fine on each count; it sentenced appellant Reddock to one year\u2019s probation and a $1,000 fine on each count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-15\">.

If it is going to come from anybody, it is Helman. If Truen or Salmon is saying it, if the government is saying that, then it is something they might have to get from Helman. I don\u2019t think when testimony comes in like this, in this particular instance, it should not conform at least to some strictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-19\">The Court: Why should it not be confined to Helman?</p>\n<p id=\"b80-20\">Ms. Strauss: Truen also testified and Salmon did too.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-21\">The Court: Why not confine it to Helman and Truen?</p>\n<p id=\"b80-22\">Ms. Strauss: I will try to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-23\">The Court: Maybe I should not allow that if you cannot do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-24\">Mr. Segal: I will move to strike if it is not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-25\">The Court: It will be stricken if it is not done.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b81-7\">. 18 <em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, </em>providing for Government production of statements and reports of witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\">. <em>Weiler v.
