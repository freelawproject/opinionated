Henry Bramwell, United States District Judge, convicting him of five counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation of income tax returns which were false or fraudulent as to material matters in violation of Title 26, United States Code, Section 7206(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 3, 1978 Sternstein was given a suspended sentence on each count and a probation period of two years. He was also fined $500 on each count plus the cost of prosecution in the sum of $1,594.32. Probation on all counts was concurrent and the fines on all counts were consecutive.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">After Sternstein\u2019s indictment his counsel made an oral motion for the production of exculpatory material pursuant to <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). He then met with the Assistant United States Attorney who permitted him to look at the report of a Special Agent of the Internal Revenue Service concerning the appellant. On October 3, 1977 Sternstein\u2019s counsel renewed this motion in writing, seeking discovery and inspection of the detailed IRS report. His motion papers stated that \u201c[t]he report of the investigating special agents\u201d indicated \u201can exceedingly large number of tax returns\u201d were examined and taxpayers \u201cinterviewed in depth.\u201d Yet this investigation resulted \u201cin only those comparatively very few returns and taxpayers named in the Indictment.\u201d Defense counsel argued that these facts in the report supported appellant\u2019s position that any erroneous deductions entered by Stern-stein \u201cwere indeed the result of inadvertence and not [of] any intent or purpose to commit the crime alleged in the Indictment.\u201d The papers further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">The investigation report also mentions the fact that almost an equal number of returns prepared by the defendant as stated in the Indictment were found to be correct and not subject to any change at all. This was true the report states, even though no difference in charge for the service rendered was made by the defendant between those returns named in the Indictment and those returns examined and found to be absolutely correct as filed by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">Sternstein also sought production of a taxpayer\u2019s statements which indicated that certain errors on his tax returns which formed the basis for two counts in the indictment could have resulted from a misunderstanding of the information supplied by the taxpayer to Sternstein. Judge Bramwell directed the production of statements made by that taxpayer but refused to order that the report of the Special Agent be turned over to appellant. Most importantly, the trial judge did not conduct any examination of the Special Agent\u2019s report before denying the motion for production.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">On trial the Government called as witnesses the taxpayers named in the indictment who testified that Sternstein had prepared the returns in issue. Each testified that at least one itemized deduction listed as an expense had not been incurred and had not been submitted as an expense to Sternstein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The taxpayers also stated that flat fees ranging between twenty-five and fifty dollars had been paid to the defendant. In each instance, on cross-examination the witness conceded that the amount of the fee was not contingent upon a possible refund. The taxpayers denied reviewing or examining the returns containing the falsely stated deductions. Sternstein did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>take the stand but presented three witnesses whose returns he had prepared. On direct examination these witnesses testified that they had been audited and that the deductions on their returns had been found to be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The only argument of merit raised on this appeal is Sternstein\u2019s claim that he was deprived of due process of law by the district court\u2019s refusal to order that specifically requested exculpatory material (the IRS Special Agent\u2019s report) be turned over to the defense and by the prosecutor\u2019s failure to provide that material both before and during trial. We are asked either to reverse the judgment of conviction and to order a new trial or, in the alternative, to remand for a hearing to determine the materiality of the withheld report to Stern-stein\u2019s defense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">While it is recognized that there is no duty to provide defense counsel with unlimited discovery of everything known by the prosecutor, if the subject matter of such a request is material, or indeed if a substantial basis for claiming materiality exists, it is reasonable to require the prosecutor to respond either by furnishing the information or by submitting the problem to the trial judge. <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 106, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2399, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">There is no doubt but that the request made here was specific. It was based upon documents which were initially shown, albeit briefly, to appellant\u2019s trial counsel and were clearly identified in Sternstein\u2019s written motion. The Government argues as it did in the district court, that the agent\u2019s report was not relevant or material. Stern-stein\u2019s motion for inspection of the report appears to concede that it does not relate to any particular count in the indictment nor does it refer to any return named in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The critical element in a tax fraud case, however, is the mental state of the defendant. See <em>United States v. Leonard, </em>524 F.2d 1076, 1091 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 958, 96 S.Ct. 1737, 48 L.Ed.2d 202 (1976). Courts have repeatedly observed that in such cases the \u201caccused as part of his defense is entitled to wide latitude in the introduction of evidence which tends to show lack of specific intent.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>411 F.2d 1134,1137 (10th Cir. 1969); accord, <em>Black v. United States, </em>309 F.2d 331, 337 (8th Cir. 1962); see <em>Haigler v. United States, </em>172 F.2d 986, 987 (10th Cir. 1949). Cf. <em>Bullard v. United States, </em>395 F.2d 658, 660 (5th Cir. 1968); <em>Ehrlich v. United States, </em>238 F.2d 481, 484 (5th Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">In the instant case defense counsel argued that Sternstein had innocently entered the deductions in question based upon information supplied to him by the mistake or wrongful design of his taxpayer clients. In support of this contention counsel urged that Sternstein had no motive to prepare fraudulent returns since his fee was fixed and not contingent upon his client obtaining a refund. The Government replied in its summation that his motive was \u201cto have satisfied customers, customers who come back to him year after year, because they got a refund.\u201d The issue of Sternstein\u2019s motivation and intent when he entered the deductions was thus placed squarely before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Appellant claims that the IRS report would establish that of some 900 tax returns for 1972 and 1973 prepared on a flat fee basis by Sternstein an extensive investigation revealed that only nine contained false deductions. The Government counters with the familiar proposition that \u201cevidence of noncriminal conduct to negate the inference of criminal conduct is <em>generally </em>irrelevant.\u201d <em>United States v. Dobbs, </em>506 F.2d 445, 447 (5th Cir. 1975) (emphasis added). See also <em>United States v. Null, </em>415 F.2d 1178,1181 (4th Cir. 1969); <em>Herzog v. United States, </em>226 F.2d 561, 565 (9th Cir. 1955), aff\u2019d en banc, 235 F.2d 664, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 844, 77 S.Ct. 54, 1 L.Ed.2d 59 (1956). In this case, however, the Government\u2019s explanation of Sternstein\u2019s motive to falsify the returns despite his flat fee was that the bogus deductions were part of a scheme to generate new business by gaining inflated returns for his clients. Rebuttal of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>contention by demonstrating that he produced no such illegal windfall for the overwhelming majority of his clients was unquestionably crucial to Sternstein\u2019s position that the few false returns were innocently prepared by him. Indeed, the importance of such evidence to appellant\u2019s defense was underscored by the district court\u2019s admitting into evidence over the Government\u2019s objection the testimony of three clients of Sternstein whose returns had been audited and were found to be proper. Thus, if the IRS report contains the information alleged by Sternstein on appeal its relevance to his defense is clear.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The difficulty we face is that the report of the Special Agent is not in this record since it was not examined by the trial judge <em>in camera. </em>Moreover, the renewal motion of appellant was somewhat ambiguous as to the contents of the report. If the report of the Special Agent only indicates that after audit a few returns were found not to contain erroneous deductions its probative value is obviously negligible, particularly since evidence of honest returns was before the jury. On the other hand, if an extensive investigation revealed only a small fraction were fraudulent the significance of the report to Sternstein\u2019s defense could be considerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, supra, </em>the Court indicated that the firsthand appraisal of the trial judge is essential in determining the materiality of withheld evidence. 427 U.S. at 114, 96 S.Ct. 2392. <em>Cf. Palermo v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 343, 354, 79 S.Ct. 1217, 3 L.Ed.2d 1287 (1959). No such determination has been made here. Hence we remand to the district court to permit examination of the report of the Special Agent by defense counsel. The judge should determine whether the Special Agent\u2019s report reveals that a substantial number of the returns prepared by appellant which were investigated show no error. If that be so, the judge should make a finding to that effect and order a new trial in which the Special Agent\u2019s report will be admissible. If the judge finds to the contrary, upon notice, he should transmit the finding to this panel for its further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">. The indictment charged Sternstein with nine counts of section 7206(2) violations. Two counts were dismissed on the Government\u2019s motion prior to trial. Sternstein was acquitted on two other counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b585-15\">. These false deductions were for such items as charitable contributions, medical expenses, investment papers, books and magazines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\">. We reject the Government\u2019s assertion that Sternstein cannot complain of the withholding of the report because he was aware of the identity of those individuals whose tax returns he had prepared and thus should have known which returns contained accurate deductions. See <em>United States v. Corey, 566 </em>F.2d 429, 431 n.5 (2d Cir. 1977) (prosecutor has no obligation to bring to the defendant\u2019s attention matters which he already knows). Sternstein was concerned with discovering those of his clients who had been contacted and interviewed by the IRS as well as which of his clients\u2019 returns had been cleared after audit by the IRS. In short, the details and results of the IRS investigation constituted the critical information contained in the report. That information was not independently available to appellant. Nor are we satisfied that the brief perusal of the document which the prosecutor afforded appellant\u2019s attorney would have been sufficient to enable counsel to distill from the report of an extensive investigation all the particulars pertinent to Sternstein\u2019s defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
