We conclude that because the EPA failed to establish guidelines by which the adequacy of the Illinois provisions for public participation in the enforcement of the state program could be assessed, the EPA approval of the program failed to comply with the terms of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1251 <em>et seq., </em>and must be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-24\">The history and goals of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and its amendments have been chronicled in numerous judicial opinions. <em>See, e. g., American Frozen Food Inst. </em>v. <em>Train, </em>176 U.S.App.D.C. 105, 111-122, 539 F.2d 107, 113-24 (1976); <em>California v. EPA, </em>511 F.2d 963 (9th Cir. 1975). Congress\u2019 ultimate objective was \u201cto restore and maintain the chemical, physical, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters,\u201d \u00a7 101(a), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (1977), and it established a permit program, the NPDES, to achieve this goal. Under this program, any pollutant discharge into navigable waters without an EPA authorization permit is banned, and the EPA was instructed to make the pollution controls inherent in its permits increasingly stringent over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Although the administration and enforcement of the permit program initially was vested entirely in the EPA, Congress intended that much of this authority would devolve to the states. See \u00a7 101(b), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(b). The Clean Water Act stipulates that any time after the promulgation of EPA guidelines establishing the minimum elements of state permit programs, a state may submit a description of a proposed program, along with a statement from the state attorney general that state law provides adequate authority to carry out the program, for evaluation by the Administrator of the EPA. If the state program satisfies the statutory requirements of section 402(b), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(b), and the guidelines issued under section 304(i), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1314(i), the Administrator must approve the program. The state would then assume primary responsibility for the issuance of permits and for the administration and enforcement of the NPDES program within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">On July 8, 1977 Illinois submitted an application for authority to administer the NPDES program within the state. This proposal was approved by the Administrator of the EPA on October 23, 1977. On January 17, 1978 Citizens filed a petition to review this action pursuant to section 509(b)(1)(D) of the Act. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1)(D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Citizens contends that the Illinois NPDES program should not have been approved because it lacks sufficient provisions for citizen participation in the enforcement of the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">The EPA contends, on the other hand, that the Administrator has established adequate guidelines for state NPDES programs, see 40 C.F.R. Part 124, that the Illinois program satisfies not only these guidelines but also the statutory requirements of the Act concerning public participation in enforcement, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 304(i), 402(b); 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1314(i), 1342(b), and that, therefore, the Administrator\u2019s approval of the Illinois program must be upheld.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The EPA acknowledges that the Administrator has set no guidelines specifically requiring the provision of public participation in state NPDES enforcement, but argues that this is unnecessary and does not preclude approval of the Illinois program. The EPA position is that the provisions in the Act which discuss the EPA guidelines are extremely general and do not specifically require the Administrator to establish guidelines regarding public participation in state NPDES enforcement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>The EPA is correct that these provisions are extremely general and, standing alone, would not indicate a Congressional mandate with respect to citizen participation in state enforcement proceedings. These provisions, however, must be construed in the context both of the statute read as a whole, see <em>United States v. Alpers, </em>338 U.S. 680, 70 S.Ct. 352, 94 L.Ed. 457 (1950), and its legislative history. When that is done, it is clear that Congress intended that EPA guidelines would address, and state programs following those guidelines would provide for, citizen participation in state NPDES enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The argument of the EPA, focusing on the generality of sections 304(i) and 402(b), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1314(i), 1342(b), ignores another provision of the Act. In the \u201cCongressional declaration of goals and policy,\u201d at the beginning of the legislation, Congress stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">(e) Public participation in the development, revision, <em>and enforcement </em>of any regulation, plan, or program <em>established by </em>the Administrator or <em>any State </em>under this chapter shall be provided for, encouraged, and assisted by the Administrator and the States. <em>The Administrator, in cooperation with the States, shall develop and publish regulations specifying minimum guidelines for public participation in such processes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">\u00a7 101(e), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(e) (emphasis added). This section is an express Congressional directive that the Administrator of the EPA devise guidelines for and actively encourage public participation in the enforcement process of state NPDES programs. Citation to the generality of other statutory provisions outlining the Administrator\u2019s responsibility to establish guidelines for states and to assess state programs does not dispel this express mandate; instead, these general provisions are informed by the specific duty imposed by section 101(e). 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">This conclusion is corroborated by the legislative history underlying the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. The report of the House Public Works Committee explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-13\">[T]he Committee has included provision for public participation in the development, revision and enforcement of any regulation, standard, or effluent limitation established by the Administrator or any State under this Act. Not only is this specifically required in Section 101(a) but the Administration is directed to encourage this participation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">H.R.Rep.

These uncontradicted statements confirm the plain meaning of section 101(e): the Administrator of the EPA has a duty to establish state program guidelines and evaluate state programs to insure that there is public participation in the enforcement of these programs. <em>See </em>Conf.Rep. No. 1236, 92d Cong.2d Sess., 100 (1972), reprinted in I <em>Legislative History </em>at 283, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, p. 3668.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Given this mandate, the EPA\u2019s contention that the decision whether to establish guidelines regarding public participation in state NPDES programs is a matter entirely within the Administrator\u2019s unfettered discretion is unfounded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are not faced here with a situation in which an administrator, acting within the scope of his statutory authority and after considering all of the relevant factors, has made a discretionary judgment. <em>See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 414-17, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). In the instant case, the Administrator of the EPA, by failing to establish guidelines regarding public participation in state NPDES enforcement has ignored a statutory directive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And, as the Supreme Court has noted repeatedly, \u201cIn order for an agency interpretation to be granted deference, it must be consistent with the congressional purpose. <em>Espinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co., </em>414 U.S. 86 [94 S.Ct. 334, 38 L.Ed.2d 287] (1973); <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>395 U.S. 367, 381, [89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 L.Ed.2d 371] (1969).\u201d <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 237, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 1075, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974). For these reasons, we hold that the EPA Administrator\u2019s approval of the Illinois program, without his prior promulgation of guidelines regarding citizen participation in the state enforcement process, violates the terms of the Clean Water Act and must be overturned. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">The EPA argues that even if the participation guidelines are found inadequate, the Administrator\u2019s approval of the Illinois NPDES program should be upheld because the Illinois program provides for substantial citizen participation in the enforcement process. The Illinois program does permit Illinois citizens to file enforcement actions with the Illinois Pollution Control Board and to intervene, with certain conditional limitations, in state enforcement actions. Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. lllVfe, Title 8, \u00a7 1031(b); Illinois Pollution Control Board Procedural Rule 310. And these provisions may provide sufficient citizen participation in the Illinois enforcement process to satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>the federal statutory mandate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We need not resolve this question, however. The statutory structure for the establishment, review, and approval of state NPDES programs requires that guidelines \u2014 including those concerning public participation in the state enforcement process \u2014 be established prior to the ratification of a state program.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u00a7 402(b), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(b). The Administrator\u2019s failure to provide these guidelines, in violation of the Act\u2019s framework, compels reversal of his approval of the Illinois program irrespective of the terms of the program. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. Congress did not intend reviewing courts to make ad hoc determinations about the adequacy of the citizen participation components of state programs without the benefit of regulations duly promulgated by the EPA. The only way to prevent such unguided judicial judgments is to require the EPA to follow the terms of the Clean Water Act by issuing public participation regulations prior to the ratification of a state NPDES program.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the Administrator\u2019s approval of the Illinois NPDES program is invalid and we direct the Administrator to withdraw his previously granted approval of the Illinois program and to take appropriate action in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-25\">.

The EPA contends that the state program guidelines promulgated by the Administrator, 40 C.F.R. Part 124, represent a balancing of interests in which, apparently, the desire to allow states significant control over their own programs, <em>see </em>\u00a7 101(b), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(b), precluded guidelines requiring public participation in state programs. Respondents\u2019 Brief, p. 14. The EPA never explains the distinction between the constraint a <em>public participation </em>guideline would impose on state control over its program from that imposed by <em>any </em>guideline. Yet Congress clearly intended such guidelines to be an essential element of the national NPDES program. Further, given the fact that Congress\u2019 explicit directive regarding public participation guidelines is in the same section of the Act as its encouragement of state responsibility, it is unlikely that it saw a conflict between the two objectives which could justify an Administrator\u2019s failure to promulgate such guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b780-12\">. The only regulations promulgated by the Administrator requiring public participation in state NPDES programs concern participation in NPDES permit determinations. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. Part 124(D). The EPA guidelines concerning state enforcement procedures say nothing about public participation in the process. See 40 C.F.R. Part 124.73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\">. Citizens contends that the federal citizen suit provision in the Act, section 505, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365, defines the public participation in state enforcement required by section 101(e), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(e). This contention is based primarily on Citizens\u2019 argument that section 402(a)(3), 33 U.S.C. 1342(a)(3) requires that federal and state programs be as identical as possible. The language of this section, however, does not suggest that state programs are required to adopt the citizen participation components of the federal program; section 402(a)(3) requires only that the <em>federal </em>program \u201cbe subject to the same terms, conditions and requirements as apply to a state permit program.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(a)(3). Citizens, however, also points to more general language in the statute and its legislative history indicating that Congress intended state and federal programs to be as uniform as possible. <em>See </em>\u00a7 103, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(a); S.Rep.

EPA, </em>596 F.2d 720 (7th Cir., 1979), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">Pursuant to Section 402(b) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(b), a state NPDES permit program, in order to be approved by the Administrator, must contain adequate authority to satisfy nine criteria enumerated in Section 402(b)(l}-(b)(9). Detailing, supplementing and explaining these requirements are procedural, monitoring and enforcement guidelines established by EPA pursuant to Section 304(i)(2) of the Act. <em>Those guidelines, 40 C.F.R. Part 124, </em>and the elements of Section 402(b) <em>are the only </em>statutory and <em>regulatory requirements for state NPDES programs. </em>Unless the Administrator determines that a state\u2019s proposed program does not satisfy these requirements, he must approve the program. <em>Save the Bay, Inc. v.

Now, in its motion for rehearing, EPA belatedly proffers regulations issued pursuant to section 101(e) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(e), 40 C.F.R. Part 105, which it contends satisfy EPA\u2019s statutory duty to promulgate regulations promoting public participation in state enforcement actions under the Act. Similarly, the State of Illinois appears for the first time in these proceedings, which are testing the validity of its own water pollution control program, and notes the existence of the regulations at 40 C.F.R. Part 105.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>The regulations now offered by EPA and the State pay lip-service, at best, to the Congressional directive that EPA guidelines encourage public participation in state enforcement actions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (This mandate is discussed at length in our opinion in <em>Citizens for a Better Environment, supra.) </em>Despite its verbiage, section (f), in effect, requires only that a state agency answer its telephone and listen and look into the complaints of a private citizen. There is no provision for the participation of a private citizen in the enforcement process itself. This provision is no more than a legalistic articulation of a common courtesy and hardly can be cited as satisfaction of the EPA\u2019s statutory duty to issue regulations promoting public participation in state enforcement. Similarly, section (g) states only that a state agency cannot conceal from the public information requested by a private citizen when that information is already of public record because it is part of a legal proceeding. This regulation merely states the obvious; there is no explanation how it will \u201cencourage\u201d public participation in the enforcement process. Interestingly, the requirement in section (g) that the EPA comply with already existing Justice Department regulations regarding public comment prior to the approval of consent decrees is expressly applicable only to the EPA and not to state agencies. And the remaining provisions of 40 C.F.R. Part 105 do nothing to mandate citizen participation in the state enforcement process. Thus, the regulations promulgated under section 101(e) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(e), do not alter the conclusion reached in <em>Citizens for a Better Environment, supra, </em>and the motion for rehearing is denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-13\">.
