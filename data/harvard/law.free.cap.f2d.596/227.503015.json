The second count alleged that Allen embezzled goods and chattels of a value exceeding $100.00 from an interstate shipment in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 659. After a three day trial the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant questions the sufficiency of the evidence, the jury instructions, the indictment, and the propriety of the sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The evidence, briefly, was as follows. Joseph Allen was a truck driver for Coldway Express Co., a common carrier of interstate products. Codefendant, Joseph Taylor, was a dock hand for Gridley-Maxon, a fruit and vegetable wholesaler located on the south side of Chicago. In September 1976 Allen and Taylor had a discussion in which Allen asked Taylor if he knew anyone who would be interested in a truckload of meat. Taylor said that he would check on the matter. The following week Taylor saw Anthony Marino, a restauranteur from Wisconsin who shopped at Gridley-Maxon for fresh vegetables, and asked him if he would be interested in buying a shipment of meat. Marino answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The following Saturday Taylor relayed the information to Allen, who said, \u201cGood. When I get one, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d Later that month, Allen informed Taylor that he \u201chad a load of meat\u201d and that Taylor should \u201cget in touch\u201d with Marino. The following day Allen and Taylor met and proceeded together to Irene Perkins\u2019 residence. With Perkins, Allen\u2019s girlfriend, present, a call was placed to Marino, who rejected the shipment explaining he needed only \u201cboxed beef\u201d and not the lamb offered along with beef. Coldway Express Co. records show that in September a shipment of beef and lamb was destined for Washington, D.C. driven by Allen. It was not long, however, before Allen could fill Marino\u2019s order. Coldway Express Co. records show that later on September 24, 1976, the carrier assigned Allen to drive a load of beef to the Washington, D.C. area. The wholesale value of the shipment was $61,404.37.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">After the truck was loaded, Allen contacted Taylor. \u201cHe told me to come over,\u201d Taylor testified, \u201che had a straight load of beef.\u201d Prom Perkins\u2019 apartment, Allen and Taylor phoned Marino. After some negotiations between Allen and Marino, Marino agreed to pay Allen $20,000 in cash. They planned a delivery that night. After the call Allen instructed Taylor to drive his own car to Wisconsin to pick up the cash. Allen told Taylor to expect two black men to be driving the truck of beef followed by another car. Later Allen called Taylor and notified him that he would not be talking with him again but that \u201chis wife would.\u201d Near midnight the truck arrived at Marino\u2019s restaurant. Taylor did not recognize the persons driving the truck or the following car. The truck was unloaded and the payoff of $20,000 was made. Taylor returned to Chicago with the cash. Taylor then received a phone call from a woman identifying herself as \u201cJoe\u2019s wife,\u201d who instructed him to bring the money to a laundromat, located half a block from Perkins\u2019 apartment. Meeting Perkins there, Taylor retained $3,000 for himself and handed Perkins $17,-000. Taylor subsequently had a phone conversation with Marino about the beef during which he handed the phone to the defendant who attempted to satisfy Marino that the meat was not stolen. Allen and Marino never met each other personally during this transaction. Telephone company records confirm the series of calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Taylor and Marino both testified for the government. Their credibility is attacked by the defendant on the basis that they both participated in the conspiracy. The jury resolved the credibility issue against the defendant and we see no reason to disturb it. United <em>States v. Holleman, </em>575 F.2d 139 (7th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Isaacs, </em>493 F.2d 1124 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 976, 94 S.Ct. 3183, 41 L.Ed.2d 1146 (1974). Substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict; it fully deserves to be sustained. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">II. The Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">First the defendant complains about the instruction defining reasonable doubt for the jury as being confusing and misleading. The court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-11\">A reasonable doubt is what the term implies: a doubt founded on reason. It does not mean a doubt that may be purely speculative. It means simply an honest doubt that is based on reason and appeals to reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>The defendant instead tendered an instruction which explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on reason and common sense \u2014 the kind of doubt that would make a reasonable person hesitate to act. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt must, therefore, be proof of such a convincing character that a reasonable person would not hesitate to rely and act upon it in the most important of his affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">If the given instruction was confusing and misleading we likewise see little illumination in defendant\u2019s tendered instruction. The identical instruction as given has been previously found not to be error although its use was not encouraged. <em>United States v. Loman, </em>551 F.2d 164 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>433 U.S. 912, 97 S.Ct. 2982, 53 L.Ed.2d 1097 (1977). We have found no definitions of reasonable doubt which may reasonably help explain its meaning to the jury. Reasonable doubt may be better left to speak for itself. <em>United States v. Larson, </em>581 F.2d 664 (7th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>507 F.2d 433 (7th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 1004, 95 S.Ct. 1446, 43 L.Ed.2d 762 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Next defendant objects to the conspiracy instruction which was given in preference to the one tendered by him. He also objects that although the trial judge had indicated that he would caution the jury from time to time about the limitations on the use of alleged co-conspirators hearsay he failed to do so. On this latter aspect our holding in <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>582 F.2d 1128 (7th Cir. 1978), decided after the trial of the present case, obviates the necessity for interruptions by the judge to caution the jury during the trial. It is now contemplated that the trial judge outside the presence of the jury will make the preliminary determination regarding the existence of the conspiracy and defendant\u2019s participation in it in accordance with Federal Rule of Evidence 104(a). The trial judge did not make a specific determination based on a preponderance of the evidence as <em>Santiago </em>has suggested. Defendant does not assist us in identifying the particular prejudicial co-conspirator hearsay to which he now objects. However, testimony of that nature played a very minor role in this case. The existence of the conspiracy and defendant\u2019s leading part in it were adequately evidenced by the defendant\u2019s own admissions: the solicitation of Taylor to find a buyer for a load of beef, the telephone negotiations with Marino, his dispatch of Taylor to Wisconsin to collect the money and his later phone call to convince Marino that the beef was not stolen. There were in addition the phone and shipping company records and other circumstantial evidence. The absence of a specific finding by the trial judge in accordance with <em>Santiago, </em>although an implied finding may be gleaned from the record, is harmless error in the narrow circumstances of this case. It is apparent in the record that the trial judge fully understood the requirement for independent evidence. We note also the total failure of the defendant to remind the court to give the desired cautionary instructions at the appropriate times.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The conspiracy instruction given at the close of the case omitted that part of the conspiracy instruction which was customary before <em>Santiago </em>to the effect that co-conspirator statements could not be considered against Allen until the jurors were convinced by independent proof that a conspiracy existed and that defendant had participated in it. Defendant has more faith in the jury being able to somehow abide by that abnormal command than we do, but in accordance with our views expressed in <em>Santiago </em>as applied to the particular circumstance of this case we find no necessity for the full former instruction and therefore no reversible error. Where the totality of the instructions as given and the overall trial procedures were fair, along with substantial evidence of guilt, reversal is not required because of a questionable portion of an instruction. <em>United States v. Shaffner, </em>524 F.2d 1021 (7th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 920, 96 S.Ct. 1126, 47 L.Ed.2d 327 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>III. The Indictment Content</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Defendant complains that although the indictment alleged the existence of a conspiracy from \u201con or about\u201d a certain time period that one alleged overt act which occurred two days later should have been stricken, but was not. The \u201con or about\u201d language of the indictment sufficiently included the later overt act within its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">IV. The Court\u2019s Comments at Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Allen contends that comments made by the district court judge at the sentencing hearing indicated an impermissible intent on the part of the judge to penalize the defendant for the assertion of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The defendant has some basis for questioning portions of the judge\u2019s remarks as reflecting adversely upon the defendant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment privileges. However, we believe a fair overall consideration of the remarks clearly discounts any such improper sentencing motive on the part of the judge. <em>United States v. Lehman, </em>468 F.2d 93 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 967 (1972); <em>United States v. Chaidez-Castro, </em>430 F.2d 766 (7th Cir. 1970). The trial judge made it clear that for sentencing purposes he was considering only the character of the defendant and the circumstances of the crime as he properly could do. The sentence was well below the statutory maximum, was not harsh, and was not a penalty for going to trial. Thus the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Scott v. United States, </em>136 U.S.App.D.C. 377, 419 F.2d 264 (1966), is misplaced. The recent case of <em>United States v. Grayson, </em>438 U.S. 41, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978) makes it plain that the judge in sentencing may consider \u201cthe defendant\u2019s whole person or personality.\u201d \u201cThe trial court is given a broad discretion in considering the sentence to be imposed upon a convicted defendant. <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). The exercise of this broad discretion will not be disturbed on review unless there is a plain showing of abuse by the trial court. <em>United States v. Cardi, </em>519 F.2d 309 (7th Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Willard, </em>445 F.2d 814 (7th Cir. 1971).\u201d <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>582 F.2d 1128, 1137 (7th Cir. 1978). We find no abuse in the sentencing process warranting our intervention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>582 F.2d 968, 969 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>V. Defense Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">After the defendant was indicted, he filed a financial affidavit with the court in support of his request as an indigent for court-appointed counsel. Allen certified, <em>inter alia, </em>that he owned a home and a Cadillac and was employed at McLean Trucking Co.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that he began employment with McLean on March 26, 1977, and that he did not know his income but that he \u201cmay gross $1,000 per month.\u201d Subsequently the court appointed the Federal Defender Program to represent the defendant. At the sentencing hearing, however, Allen admitted that he had been earning substantially in excess of what he had previously claimed. It was in this light that the court, unsympathetic with an \u201cindigent\u201d earning over $25,000 a year, terminated the defendant\u2019s free legal services and thereafter ordered him to repay to the government the full cost of his defense during his four years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Unhappy with the repayment order, the defendant has launched a barrage of objections asserting that the condition is unauthorized by statute, violates the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Constitution, and chills the exercise of the right to counsel. We find that the order of the district court conforms with the dictates of the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(f).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Judge Grady had the benefit of Allen\u2019s earlier misleading financial affidavit, was fully apprised of the defendant\u2019s family situation before sentence was passed, and knew that his income had been substantial and greater than previously revealed. Furthermore, the judge specifically found that there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that Allen still possessed the fruits of the crime, the missing $17,000 from the sale of the beef. The record amply demonstrates that after proper inquiries the judge was convinced that this defendant could afford to pay the price of legal services which he had improperly obtained at taxpayers\u2019 expense. We find no merit to the claims of the defendant. He owes the money and should repay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-15\">. Allen\u2019s girlfriend, Irene Perkins, was named but not indicted as a co-conspirator. Joseph Taylor, an indicted co-conspirator, agreed to cooperate with the government, pleaded no contest to the conspiracy charge in the first count, which resulted in the dismissal of count two and the imposition of a sentence of two years probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-25\">. On count one the defendant was sentenced to 18 months of incarceration and on count two to four years probation to run consecutive to the sentence on count one, subject to the special provision that he repay the Federal Defender Program or the Administrative Office of the United States Courts the cost of his defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\">. The trial judge commented in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">I don\u2019t know what the defense was in this case. I don\u2019t know why the defendant went to trial. It is obvious that he could not truthfully have denied his involvement, or he would have taken the stand and denied it. He has no felony convictions with which he could have been impeached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">I am not suggesting that his failure to take the stand prejudiced him in the eyes of the jury. I assume that it did not. They were so instructed that it should not. I merely point that out to indicate that this is a man who was obviously guilty, as the jury found him to be and neither during the trial nor since the trial has he attempted to convince either the jury or this Court that he is not guilty of precisely of what the witnesses said he was guilty of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-12\">There is absolutely no indication of any remorse, in the sense of having made a mistake, because, of course, there is no admission or concession of any kind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-13\">That is a privilege that the defendant has. I don\u2019t say that he should be sorry for what he has done. That is his business, but it is also my business to take into consideration the nature of the person I am dealing with</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-15\">and the nature of his attitude toward what he has done when I impose sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-16\">So I have standing before me someone who has committed a crime. He has no defense. There is no excuse for it, no mitigating circumstances whatsoever, and no indication that he has learned anything from the experience. There is the matter of some $17,000 having been earned, if you will, by this defendant in this crime, which has never been accounted for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-17\">There is no doubt in my mind that he got the $17,000. He planned this crime, carried it out rather cleverly, with a great deal of forethought, great deal of planning, enlisted about five or six other people to help him, not only the co-defendant who testified but a girl friend, apparently three men who took care of driving the truck up to Wisconsin. He established contact with a fence who bought the meat, on the whole a rather sophisticated criminal operation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b287-18\">. We are cognizant that many of the circuits have charted their own courses concerning the sentencing boundaries in which the trial court may traverse when considering a defendant\u2019s failure to \u201crepent\u201d and \u201csing.\u201d For a discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>sion, <em>see United States v. Miller, </em>589 F.2d 1117, 1137-1139 (1st Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\">. The defendant also certified that he was married, had one dependent and \u201csometimes\u201d assisted his 14-year-old son with an unstated amount of support. He wrote that he was separated from his wife, was living with his \u201ccommon law wife,\u201d Irene Perkins, who earned $65.00 per week, and contributed to the support of Perkins and her 10-year-old daughter. Allen stated that he owned $4,000 equity in his home and that his only debts were the mortgage on the house and his car payments for the Cadillac. According to the affidavit, however, the defendant\u2019s lawful wife, not Allen, was making the mortgage payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\">. In relevant part, Section 3006A(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">Whenever the United States magistrate or the court finds that funds are available for payment from or on behalf of a person furnished representation, it may authorize or direct that such funds be paid to the appointed attorney, to the bar association or legal aid agency or community defender organization which provided the appointed attorney, to any person or organization authorized pursuant to subsection (e) to render investigative, expert, or other services, or to the court for deposit in the Treasury as a reimbursement to the appropriation, current at the time of payment, to carry out the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-21\">The district court\u2019s authority to order reimbursement also finds support in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651, which provides that a court may place a defendant on probation on \u201csuch terms and conditions as the court deems best.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
