Hulsey challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and argues that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a harsher sentence upon him than upon his codefendants who pleaded guilty. We reject these contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">According to the testimony at trial and appellant\u2019s brief, Hulsey actively participated in negotiations with undercover agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regarding a proposed cocaine sale. During several discussions that took place at Hulsey\u2019s apartment, he explained the details of the transaction to one agent. Hulsey also brought another agent to the apartment of codefendant Charles Wade and remained as Wade showed the agent samples of cocaine. Moreover, one DEA agent testified that Hulsey expected to receive \u201cfour or five grams off of the package\u201d of drugs \u201cas payment for his part in arranging the transaction.\u201d This evidence amply supports the jury\u2019s verdict that Hul-sey was guilty of conspiring to distribute cocaine. <em>See United States v. Warner, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 441 F.2d 821, 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-15\">The district judge sentenced Hulsey to seven years\u2019 imprisonment and a special parole term of three years. Because two codefendants who pleaded guilty received lighter sentences, Hulsey alleges that the court abused its discretion by penalizing him for pleading not guilty. This argument is without merit. Hulsey\u2019s sentence was within the statutory maximum and, as he concedes in his brief on appeal, in contrast to his codefendants Hulsey \u201chad an extensive arrest record with a previous drug conviction.\u201d The trial judge did not abuse his broad sentencing discretion. <em>See United States v. Gray, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 565 F.2d 881, 892-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
