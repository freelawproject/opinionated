The district court denied the petition and Nevels appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">The facts giving rise to appellant\u2019s interrelated claims may be briefly stated. Appellant\u2019s first trial resulted in a mistrial. The second trial commenced on February 4, 1974. The jury began its deliberations late in the afternoon on February 7, 1974, and following the trial court\u2019s admonishment not to discuss the case with anyone were permitted to separate for the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-18\">On February 8,1974, the county attorney requested an in camera hearing with the court regarding possible juror misconduct. Appellant\u2019s trial attorney and the Douglas County Attorney were present when the trial judge questioned a law student who spoke to a juror on the evening of February 7, 1974, at a local tavern. The law student said the juror told him he did not think the state had proven its case against the appellant. The court determined that the juror should be questioned and both counsel agreed to the court\u2019s questioning of the juror.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The juror stated he had not made up his mind at the time he was at the bar. He could not remember saying the prosecution failed to prove its case. He reaffirmed his ability to remain fair and impartial and his realization of the importance of fairness to both appellant and the state. He further stated that nothing said at the bar was carried into his deliberations that day and assured the court that no one attempted to influence his decision. He was then sent back to the jury room. Appellant\u2019s counsel did not move for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-19\">At the hearing in federal district court appellant\u2019s trial counsel testified that while it was his policy to consult appellant on many matters, he failed to request that appellant be present during the in camera hearing in the state trial judge\u2019s chambers. He testified that he did not move for a mistrial because it appeared to him the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>juror favored a not guilty verdict. If a mistrial was granted he felt certain the state would retry appellant and therefore would have advised appellant, had he informed him at all, against a motion for mistrial in hopes the jury would return a not guilty verdict or would be unable to reach a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\n<em>The Right to be Present.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The district court recognized that a defendant\u2019s right to be present at every stage of his trial is not all encompassing. <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 116, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674 (1934); <em>Cox v. United States, </em>309 F.2d 614, 616 (8th Cir. 1962). However, after an extensive analysis of <em>Jackson v. Hutto, </em>508 F.2d 890 (8th Cir. 1975) and other related precedent, the district court concluded the right to be present, whether it be grounded in the fourteenth or sixth amendments, encompassed the situation where a judge makes inquiries of jurors about matters that may affect the jurors\u2019 decision about the defendant\u2019s guilt. However, the district court dismissed the petition on the ground the error resulting from appellant\u2019s absence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The state cross-appeals the decision that the right to be present does encompass an in chambers hearing regarding possible juror misconduct. We affirm the district court and reject the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In <em>Jackson v. Hutto, supra, </em>508 F.2d at 891 \u2014 92, the state trial judge, counsel for the defendant and the prosecution each responded on several occasions to a jury\u2019s inquiries as to whether they must find the defendant guilty on seven counts of robbery or whether they might return a verdict on one count only. We held that these communications were improper and that the defendant\u2019s right to be present at all stages of the trial not only encompassed such a situation but was also constitutionally grounded. However, the record reflected no prejudice to the defendant resulting from the \u201cunusual colloquies\u201d and we affirmed the dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">We agree with the district court that appellant\u2019s right to be present at all stages of his trial included a right to be present at the in camera hearing regarding possible juror misconduct. Although a presumption of prejudice arises when constitutional error is committed the state may rebut this presumption by a showing that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). The state has shown that the juror remained impartial and that neither the occurrence at the tavern nor the in camera hearing affected his ability to remain fair and impartial. Therefore, we find that the error in excluding appellant from the questioning was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The appellant also claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">\u201cThe evaluation of a habeas corpus petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel is a two-step process in this circuit.\u201d <em>Rinehart v. Brewer, </em>561 F.2d 126, 131 (8th Cir. 1977). First, the defendant must show that his attorney failed to exercise the customary skills and diligence that a reasonably competent attorney would perform under similar circumstances. <em>Benson v. United States, </em>552 F.2d 223, 224 (8th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 851, 98 S.Ct. 164, 54 L.Ed.2d 120 (1977); <em>Pinnell v. Cauthron, </em>540 F.2d 938, 939-40 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Easter, </em>539 F.2d 663, 666 (8th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 844, 98 S.Ct. 145, 54 L.Ed.2d 109 (1977). Secondly the defendant must show he was materially prejudiced in the defense of his case by the actions or inactions of defense counsel. <em>Rinehart v. Brewer, supra, </em>561 F.2d at 131; <em>Benson v. United States, supra, </em>552 F.2d at 224; <em>Pinnell v. Cauthron, supra, </em>540 F.2d at 943; <em>Crismon v. United States, </em>510 F.2d 356, 358 (8th Cir. 1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxA\"><em>Morrow v. Parratt, </em>574 F.2d 411, 412-13 (8th Cir. 1978) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">The appellant has cited no cases, and we have found none, in which a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>court has held that actions and inactions similar to those complained of here amounted to a breach of an attorney\u2019s duty to perform competently. Nevels\u2019 attorney exercised his best trial judgment in deciding not to ask for a mistrial and should not be second guessed on this decision at this stage of the proceeding. For the reasons stated in the previous section of this opinion, we also find no material prejudice in the defense of appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-12\">. The Honorable Warren K. Urbom, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-14\">. <em>State v.

It does not appear, nor is it argued by the parties, that the judge\u2019s questioning of the jur- or was improper or unfair.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
