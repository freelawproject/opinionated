The district court found that neither the nursing home nor the patient was denied due process of law. We affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants for reasons adequately stated by the district court. <em>Caton Ridge Nursing Home, Inc. v. Califano, </em>447 F.Supp. 1222 (D.Md.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Additionally, we note that <em>Klein v. Cali-fano, </em>586 F.2d 250 (3d Cir. 1978), which was decided after the district court\u2019s decision, does not suggest a different result. In <em>Klein, </em>the Third Circuit held that nursing home residents were entitled to a hearing prior to decertification of the facility as a qualified Medicaid provider and transfer of its patients. The Third Circuit, however, specifically distinguished its holding from that of the district court in <em>Cat\u00f3n Ridge. See </em>586 F.2d at 260 n.17. The alleged violations of the nursing home in <em>Klein </em>involved deficient services rendered to the patients. Thus, the residents could be expected to contribute relevant information in the context of a pre-transfer hearing. In contrast, Cat\u00f3n Ridge was decertified because of its failure to correct structural and other defects which constituted a fire hazard. As the district court noted in its opinion, there is no reason to believe that patient input could shed any light on Cat\u00f3n Ridge\u2019s noncompliance with the life safety code. 447 F.Supp. at 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
