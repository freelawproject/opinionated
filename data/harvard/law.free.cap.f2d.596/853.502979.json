Claiborne, United States District Judge, District of Nevada, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b910-19\">HUFSTEDLER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b910-20\">The central issue on these appeals is whether U.C.C. \u00a7 2-702, allowing a seller to reclaim goods delivered on credit to a buyer who is insolvent, conflicts with \u00a7\u00a7 1, 60, 64, 67, and 70 of the Bankruptcy Act and is therefore ineffective in bankruptcy. Following <em>In re Telemart Enterprises, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1975) 524 F.2d 761, we hold that the state-created right of reclamation is not barred by the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-21\">Daylin filed a proceeding under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701 <em>et seq., </em>on February 26, 1975. On February 27, 1975, Ray-O-Vac, which had supplied Daylin with goods on credit, made a written demand pursuant to U.C.C. \u00a7 2.702(2) for the return of merchandise received by Day-lin within the preceding ten days. Daylin refused to return the merchandise. Trial was held on stipulated facts, and the parties further stipulated that the law of the states to which the goods were shipped would govern the rights and duties of the parties in this litigation. Those states are Texas, Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, New Jersey, and New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Section 2-702, as enacted by Texas, Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-5\">\u201c(2) Where the seller discovers that the buyer has received goods on credit while insolvent he may reclaim the goods upon demand made within 10 days after the receipt .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-6\">\u201c(3) The seller\u2019s right to reclaim under subsection (2) is subject to the rights of a buyer in ordinary course or other good faith purchaser or lien creditor under this Article (Section 2-403) . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">The version adopted by New York and New Jersey is the same, except that the words \u201cor lien creditor\u201d in subdivision (3) are deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">The bankruptcy judge held that \u00a7 2-702 creates a statutory lien which is invalid against the debtor in possession under \u00a7\u00a7 l(29a), 67c(l)(A), and 67c(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Act. Thereafter we held that \u00a7 2 \u2014 702 does not conflict with \u00a7 67c or \u00a7 64. <em>(In re Telemart Enterprises, Inc., supra, </em>524 F.2d 761.) Accordingly, the district court held that the version of \u00a7 2 \u2014 702 adopted by New York and New Jersey, which was identical to the California statute considered in <em>Telemart, </em>was effective in bankruptcy and that Ray-O-Vac was entitled to reclaim the goods shipped into those states.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">The district court also held that the words \u201cor lien creditor\u201d in the Texas, Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana statutes effectively subordinated the reclaiming seller\u2019s rights to those of a lien creditor. Since \u00a7 70c of the Bankruptcy Act gives the trustee the status of a hypothetical lien creditor, whether or not an actual lien creditor exists, the district court concluded that under this version of \u00a7 2-702, the trustee cuts off the reclaiming seller\u2019s rights as of the date of bankruptcy. Ray-O-Vac could not reclaim the goods shipped into Texas, Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana. Both parties appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">The question whether \u00a7 2-702 should be ineffective in bankruptcy as a statutory lien or as a disguised state priority continues to be hotly debated by the commentators,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and courts have reached differing conclusions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The question is no longer open in this Circuit. <em>Telemart </em>squarely holds that \u00a7 2-702 does not conflict with \u00a7 64 or \u00a7 67 of the Bankruptcy Act and that the version of the statute adopted in California, New York, and New Jersey is effective in bankruptcy. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision with respect to the goods shipped into New York and New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">The district court erred, however, in concluding that the words \u201cor lien creditor\u201d in the Texas version of \u00a7 2-702 operated to cut off the right of reclamation as of the date of bankruptcy. To be sure, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>court\u2019s view is a straightforward interpretation of the statutory language, and as an abstract proposition it has much to recommend it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, it appears contrary to the intent of the drafters of the Uniform Commercial Code, and the more common approach has been to look to state law to determine whether a lien creditor would prevail over a reclaiming seller. Article 2 does not specify the rights of such a lien creditor, and the substantive rules of Article 9 treat only the rights of a levying creditor against an unperfected security interest. Courts adopting this approach have looked to pre-Code state law to determine whether a reclaiming seller would prevail over a lien creditor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Neither of these approaches is open to us. <em>Telemart </em>decided that \u00a7 2-702 \u201cauthorizes the exact equivalent of the common law remedy of rescission,\u201d and therefore \u201csales described by that section result in a transfer of only voidable title.\u201d (524 F.2d at 765.) Consequently, the seller\u2019s right can only be cut off by a good faith purchaser for value. <em>(See </em>U.C.C. \u00a7 2-403(1).) The trustee does not occupy the same position as a good faith purchaser, but only that of a lien creditor. The trustee is vested only \u201cwith the title of the bankrupt as of the date of the filing of the petition . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 70a.) Since, under \u00a7 2-702, the buyer takes a voidable title from the moment of sale, a lien creditor cannot avoid the retroactive reversion of title to the reclaiming seller.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">We recognize that the effect of our holding is to treat the words \u201cor lien creditor\u201d as mere surplusage. If the reclaiming seller\u2019s right is the right to rescind the transaction and void the title taken by the insolvent buyer, then only a good faith purchaser for value can cut off the seller\u2019s right. The provision that the reclaiming seller\u2019s right is \u201csubject to the rights\u201d of a lien creditor is a nullity, for it the bankrupt took only voidable title no lien creditor can have any rights in the property as. against the reclaiming seller. The result is anomalous, and unfortunately it applies to the version of \u00a7 2-702 adopted by the majority of the states.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we are bound by the decision in <em>Telemart. </em>Accordingly, Ray-O-Vac was entitled to reclaim the goods shipped into Texas, Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">The remaining issue to be decided on these appeals is Daylin\u2019s contention that it was obligated to return only those goods remaining in its possession on March 12, 1975, the day Ray-O-Vac filed its complaint seeking reclamation in the bankruptcy court, rather than on February 27,1975, the date Ray-O-Vac made written demand on Daylin for return of the goods. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision that Ray-O-Vac is entitled to reclamation of goods not sold to bona fide purchasers before February 27, 1975. Section 2-702 does not require the filing of a formal complaint, and it would be inequitable to permit a buyer to continue to sell the goods after a demand has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-10\">.
