CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b568-18\">On February 13, 1978, William Godfrey Migely applied in Boston for a passport in the name of David Joseph Natta, a deceased infant, presenting a birth certificate and an Oregon driver\u2019s license. He was arrested when he returned and signed for the passport the following day, and was convicted of making a false statement in a passport application, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542, after a court trial on stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-19\">Prior to trial, Migely unsuccessfully moved to suppress all evidence relating to use of the name David Joseph Natta. This motion was accompanied by claims that Migely\u2019s arrest had resulted from an illegal, warrantless search of his residence or mail, or else from the illegal inspection of the cover of a letter \u2014 i. e., a \u201cmail cover\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014addressed to his home in Portland, Oregon. In connection with his motion to suppress Migely filed a motion for discovery of the occurrence of any searches made by means of mail covers or otherwise of mail sent to his home in Portland. The discovery request was granted, but the government\u2019s response, that there had been</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>\u201cno interception of mail or examination of letters placed in the mail either to or from residences owned or occupied by the defendant in connection with the investigation of the charge contained in the instant indictment,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">was ruled adequate by a federal magistrate, j Migely still insisted that an illegal mail// cover had occurred, however. He made a motion for further discovery, asking for information concerning any mail covers of mail delivered to his home in Portland, including covers instituted in connection with two West Coast passport fraud and drug violation cases involving him and one Dennis Kelly. This motion was denied at a motions hearing. During the hearing, the Assistant United States Attorney represented that no mail covers had occurred, and that this answer included \u201call of the investigation that was conducted, and whatever was done by the Government in connection with this Kelly case that has gone on on the West Coast.\u201d The prosecutor said that he had discussed the question with the agents involved, that, \u201cNo mail covers, searches were made,\u201d and that, \u201cThere were no surreptitious entries about which the Defendant has any standing to complain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Migely then asked for an evidentiary hearing, with a view toward examining the agents involved and establishing that mail covers or searches in fact had occurred. The trial court denied this request, as well as the motions for further discovery and to suppress, indicating that it felt that Migely was on a fishing expedition.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Migely appeals on the ground that, \u201cThe district court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing on his motion to suppress made pursuant to Rule 41(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d Although it is not clear that Migely\u2019s motion was in fact under Rule 41(e),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> both parties point to cases decided under that rule as setting forth a standard for determining when a defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing, and we agree that the same standard would in any event be applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Evidentiary hearings on motions under Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(e) are not granted as a matter of course; they are required only when a defendant makes a sufficient showing that a warrantless search has occurred. The defendant must allege facts, \u201csufficiently definite, specific, detailed, and non-conjectural, to enable the court to conclude that a substantial claim is presented.\u201d <em>Cohen v. United States, </em>378 F.2d 751, 761 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 897, 88 S.Ct. 217, 19 L.Ed.2d 215 (1967). The factual allegations must be such that, if proved, would require the grant of relief, <em>Grant v. United States, </em>282 F.2d 165, 170 (1960), and must be more than \u201cgeneral and conclusory or based upon suspicion and conjecture.\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>378 F.2d at 760; <em>accord, United States v. Poe, </em>462 F.2d 195, 197 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 845, 94 S.Ct. 107, 38 L.Ed.2d 83 (1973); <em>United States v. Thornton, </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. 114, 124 n. 65, 454 F.2d 957, 967 n. 65 (1971); <em>United States v. Cranson, </em>453 F.2d 123, 126-27 (4th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 909, 92 S.Ct. 1607, 31 L.Ed.2d 821 (1972); <em>cf. Lawn v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 339, 348-49, 78 S.Ct. 311, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (1958) (mere suspicions create no due process right to hearing on evidence presented to Grand Jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Migely\u2019s showing clearly falls short of meeting these standards. The allegations made in Migely\u2019s affidavits in support of his motion to discover and to suppress can be fairly summarized as follows: The FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration had been investigating Dennis Kelly for possible passport violations involving the use of birth certificates of deceased infants. They had observed that Kelly was spending considerable time \u2014 and perhaps residing \u2014 at Migely\u2019s house in Portland, Oregon, and had kept the house under surveillance. In the spring of 1975 they had conducted a warrantless search of a warehouse rented by Kelly. That December, the De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>partment of Vital Statistics in Portland sent, on request, the birth certificate of David Joseph Natta to Migely\u2019s house, which had a \u201cflip-top\u201d mail box. Within several days after the certificate was sent the government received a copy of Natta\u2019s death certificate from the Department of Vital Statistics. When Migely applied for the passport in Boston over two years later, a computer check was run and led to his arrest. The government\u2019s questioning of Migely immediately thereafter focused on the West Coast investigation of Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Migely asks us to infer from these facts that a mail search violating his fourth amendment rights must have occurred. But these facts are insufficient to create such an inference. The government could have learned that the Natta birth certificate had been sent to Migely\u2019s address in any number of conceivable legal ways, as well as through the methods hypothesized by Migely. (For example, an informer may have been involved.) Migely\u2019s theory of an unlawful search is no more than conjecture and speculation. Given the government\u2019s denial, an evidentiary hearing was not required. <em>See Cohen, </em>378 F.2d at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Migely urges that the government\u2019s denial was evasive and inadequate, and that it supported rather than precluded the need for an evidentiary hearing. He points out that the government limited its initial response to searches \u201cin connection with . the instant indictment,\u201d and its response at the motions hearing to \u201centries about which the Defendant has standing to complain.\u201d Further, he objects to the district court\u2019s reliance on the prosecutor\u2019s oral representation that the government\u2019s response encompassed the West Coast investigation as well. Drawing an analogy to the standards used by some courts when electronic surveillance is alleged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3504, Migely argues that he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing because the government did not \u201csquarely affirm or deny\u201d his charges by affidavit. <em>See United States v. Vielguth, </em>502 F.2d 1257, 1260 (9th Cir. 1974) (per curiam); <em>Korman v. United States, </em>486 F.2d 926, 930-31 (7th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Alter, </em>482 F.2d 1016, 1024-27 (9th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">We do not agree that the government\u2019s response either raised or left open the possibility that a search or a mail cover had occurred. The government\u2019s written response, although limited to the \u201cinstant indictment,\u201d was broad enough to negate the possibility that the FBI had discovered that the Natta birth certificate was sent to Migely\u2019s home through an illegal search. Nor do we find the Assistant U.S. Attorney\u2019s reference to searches \u201cabout which Migely had standing to complain\u201d objectionable. There had been a warrantless search of a warehouse rented by Kelly in the course of the West Coast investigation, and the Assistant United States Attorney stated during oral argument before this court that it was because of this event that he qualified his response. The government was adequately responsive to Migely\u2019s vague assertions that the elusive illegal search might have occurred in connection with the broader West Coast investigation; moreover, we see no reason to penalize it now because it did not respond in the form of an affidavit. Migely did not make a focused request that the government file an affidavit, nor did he maintain an objection based on the court\u2019s failure to require one. While the court could have imposed such a requirement as an exercise of its discretion, Migely\u2019s showing was not such that it abused its discretion by not doing so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABJ\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-12\">. Defendant uses the term \u201cmail cover\u201d as meaning covert examination of the outside of a piece of mail in transit. <em>See </em>39 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.-2(c)(1). Such activity is claimed to constitute a fourth amendment violation. <em>See United States v. Choate. </em>422 F.Supp. 261 (C.D.Cal. 1976), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>576 F.2d 165 (9th Cir. 1978). We need not consider to what extent, if any, this may be so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">. Neither of Migely\u2019s motions to suppress referred specifically to Rule 41(e) \u2014 as opposed to Rule 41 as a whole \u2014 or requested the return of any property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b570-6\">. Migely overstates the extent of his legal right to insist that the government should have responded here in precisely the manner required when an aggrieved party makes a claim of electronic surveillance. The government\u2019s duty to \u201caffirm or deny\u201d the occurrence of electronic surveillance arises from a specific statute directed to that type of activity. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3504. A district court may doubtless, in its sound discretion, impose a similar duty to respond where a defendant makes a sufficiently credible claim of other governmental intrusions violative of the fourth amendment. As there is no statute, however, the court has greater latitude in determining when and how to proceed and what form of response to accept. Here the government made a denial of the illegal activities alleged, and we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in deeming the response sufficient both in form and in substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
