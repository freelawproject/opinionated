Since the requested instruction was concededly contrary to the rule as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>declared in <em>Chavis v. Finnlines, Ltd., O/Y </em>(4th Cir. 1978) 576 F.2d 1072, and <em>Riddle </em>v. <em>Exxon Transp. Co. </em>(4th Cir. 1977) 563 F.2d 1103, the district court did not err in refusing the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The plaintiff has also challenged the district court\u2019s refusal to include in its jury-charge a statement of the sums received by him for medical benefits and indemnity compensation benefits under the terms of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. In the context of a suit in which the longshoreman is the sole plaintiff, it was not error to refuse to so charge the jury. <em>Cf., Riddle v. Exxon Transp. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The judgment of the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
