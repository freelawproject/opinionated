The District Court granted the motion, enjoining the appellants from continuing to use any derivation of the names \u201cPETROFINA\u201d or \u201cFINA\u201d as part of the trade name or trademark of Petrofina of California. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-20\">The complaint filed in the District Court consisted of four counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Detailed discussion of the four separate counts is needless. This is because if the appellees prevailed on any one of the counts, they would be entitled to the injunctive relief granted by the District Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-21\">We have carefully reviewed the records. That review convinces us that the District Court was correct in concluding that no genuine issue of triable fact existed as to whether appellants infringed upon the respective rights of the three plaintiffs in their PETROFINA trade name under California law. That such an illegal misappropriation occurred is apparent to us, as it was obviously apparent to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-22\">Under both California common law and statutes,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whosoever first adopts and uses a trade name, either within or without the state, is its original owner. <em>Weatherford v. Eythison, </em>90 Cal.App.2d 379, 202 P.2d 1040 (1949). It is undisputed that the appellees adopted and used the PETROFINA trade name long before the appellants\u2019 first use of the name.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Under California statutes, the first person (or corporation) either to file a fictitious name certificate or to qualify as a foreign corporation to conduct business in California, and actually use the fictitious name or corporate name, is entitled to a presumption that he (or it) has an exclusive right to use that name as well as any confusingly similar name as a trade name. Cal.Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7\u00a7 14411,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 14415,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 14416.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By virtue of their prior filings and their actual and continuous use of the PETROFI-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>NA name, the appellees were entitled to the benefit of the statutory presumption. Moreover, as our court once wrote, \u201c[t]he property right in a trade name will be recognized perhaps even more readily when, as here, it embodies the distinctive part of the owner\u2019s corporate name.\u201d <em>Stork Restaurant v. Sahati, </em>166 F.2d 348, 353 (9th Cir. 1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">As owner and user of the corporate and trade name PETROFINA, the appellees were entitled to the injunctive relief granted by the District Court against appellants\u2019 continued use of the PETROFINA name or any of its variations, even though appellants\u2019 adoption of the name may have been innocent. <em>See Golden Door, Inc. v. Odisho, </em>437 F.Supp. 956, 966-67 (N.D.Cal.1977) (having established ownership, plaintiff held entitled to injunctive relief under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 14402, even though use of name \u201cGolden Door\u201d by defendant was in geographically distinct area; California trade name statute does not require that plaintiff prove secondary meaning or actual confusion); <em>see also Schwartz v. Slenderella Systems of California, </em>43 Cal.2d 107, 271 P.2d 857, 860 (1954) (\u201cSince the decision in <em>Academy of Motion Pictures, etc. v. Benson, </em>15 Cal.2d 685, 104 P.2d 650 [1940], it is established . . . that injunctive relief against the unfair use of a trade name may be obtained in situations other than where the parties are in direct competition, [citations omitted]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Accordingly, the injunctive relief was appropriately granted by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-13\">.

The appellees originally sought both damages and injunctive relief for the misappropriation of the FINA trade name. Pursuant to leave of the District Court, appellees amended their complaint to eliminate any claims for the recovery of monetary damages. For decision, therefore, the only remaining issue was the propriety of injunctive relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b953-24\">.

American Petrofina, Inc., was organized and commenced business as a marketer of petroleum products and services on October 1, 1956. American Petrofina Company of Texas was formed in June of 1958 and adopted the trade name and tradmarks of its parent company, American Petrofina, Inc. It has operated continuously since its organization as a general oil and gas producing and distribution business. American Petrofina Exploration Company was formed in June or 1964 and has operated continually since that time under the PETROFINA trade name as a petroleum products exploration and production business.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Appellants\u2019 adoption of the PETROFINA OF CALIFORNIA name did not occur until January 17, 1967, after the appellee Ross had filed a fictitious name certificate in Los Angeles County under that name. In contrast, American Petrofina, Inc., has been qualified as a foreign corporation to conduct business in California continuously since obtaining a certificate of qualification on January 2, 1957. American Petrofina Company of Texas likewise has been qualified to conduct business in California since obtaining its certification on November 2, 1964, and American Petrofina Exploration Company has been so qualified since April 23, 1965. All of the companies have maintained local authorized agents to accept service of process since the dates of their respective qualifications to do business in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">American Petrofina Company of Texas drilled and operated oil and gas wells from December 1964 until 1968 in Ventury County, California, on oil and gas leases owned by it. Since 1973, it has operated a gas station in Yreka, California. American Petrofina Exploration Company\u2019s petroleum exploration activities in California have been even more extensive. From 1965 to date it has invested in and commenced drilling operations pursuant to various oil and gas leases in several California counties, including Los Angeles County.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">All the appellees have maintained a corporate presence in Los Angeles County by appointing an agent there for service of process; thus, each has established a principal business office for California in Los Angeles County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b954-9\">.
