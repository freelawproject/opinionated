The case also involves a pendent state defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Donald Ventetuolo and Alfred Santaniel-lo, employees of the Northeast Area Manpower Institute for the Development of Staff (NEAMIDS),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought suit against the Commissioner of Education for the State of Rhode Island, Dr. Fred Burke, and the former Director of NEAMIDS, Dr. Ru-dolfo Martinez. Plaintiffs claimed that Burke and Martinez deprived them of their liberty interest in their reputations and a property interest in continued employment with NEAMIDS without procedural or substantive due process. They also allege defamation under Rhode Island law. In a thoughtful and comprehensive but unfortunately unpublished opinion, the district court found for the defendants on all claims. Only Ventetuolo has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Martinez, whose whereabouts were unknown, was not present at the trial. Since appellant and Santaniello were the only ones who testified, there can be no dispute about the facts which require a detailed exposition. Appellant, prior to 1971, was employed as the State Director of Manpower Development Training Program by the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE). He, along with others participated in drafting the initial 1971 NEAMIDS proposal. It provided that, although the NEAMIDS\u2019 director had the responsibility of selecting, supervising, and terminating personnel, he was to be responsible to the University of Rhode Island\u2019s (URI) vice-president, and the employment of personnel was to be in accordance with all URI state and federal laws, regulations and policies. The program was administered by URI at Kingston in 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">NEAMIDS\u2019 first director was Dr. Rudolfo Martinez. He recruited appellant to work for NEAMIDS in 1971 and offered him the assistant directorship. At the time, appellant was employed by the State of Rhode Island under a union contract which provided that he could be fired only for just cause, and he expressed concern to Martinez about the apparent lack of job security he would have were he to accept the assistant directorship. Appellant testified that Martinez \u201ctold me I had nothing to worry about; that as long as he was Director that he had authority and responsibility for this program, and I would have no problem with security.\u201d He further testified that Martinez said he could continue in his job \u201cas long as funds were available.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">Appellant accepted the proffered position and signed a contract with URI, which expired on December 31, 1973.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was not offered nor did he enter into any other written contract with URI. The administration of NEAMIDS was transferred to the Rhode Island Department of Education in January, 1972, where it remained through 1973. Appellant entered into no written contract with RIDE, but received an \u201cappointment sheet\u201d to his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">Operations at NEAMIDS apparently flowed smoothly until the fall of 1971 when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>it was beset by internal factionalism apparently fomented by a power struggle between native Rhode Islanders and those from outside the state. Appellant represented the natives, while Martinez led the outlanders. Many of the staffs complaints, which centered primarily on their overburdened schedules, were brought to appellant rather than Martinez. Appellant and Martinez discussed these internal difficulties with various officials on the national and regional levels of the Area Manpower Institute for the Development of Staff (AMIDS) program outside of the Rhode Island base. Appellant wrote to Burke in July of 1972 to request a meeting to definitely establish his role, responsibilities, and authority, but no meeting was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The boiling point was reached at a national AMIDS conference in Kansas in late August, 1972, attended by appellant, San-taniello, Martinez, and other NEAMIDS employees. At a staff meeting held on the evening of August 21, the personnel freely and frankly aired their grievances to Martinez who became so upset that he left the meeting. The next morning, August 22, Martinez hand delivered letters of termination to appellant and Santaniello as they were standing in a breakfast line at the conference. Martinez orally told appellant: \u201cYou\u2019re terminated. You have to leave immediately.\u201d The letter of termination, set out fully in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> listed as reasons for the dismissal appellant\u2019s \u201cblatant insubordination,\u201d \u201copen hostility and complete refusal to accept the commands of the director\u201d and because appellant \u201cobservably defied the directives of the national concept.\u201d The letter indicated that copies of it were also sent to two administrators of the United States Office of Education in charge of the AMIDS program.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Before appellant left the conference, he tried unsuccessfully to contact Burke, and he wrote Burke on August 28 requesting a hearing, but received no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">By letter dated September 6, Martinez rescinded the termination and, instead, suspended appellant with pay for an indefinite period.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">Appellant filed suit against Martinez and Burke in the district court on November 10. He sought preliminary and permanent in-junctive relief from his suspension or termination without a procedural due process hearing. The complaint was amended on November 20, and a motion for a preliminary injunction filed on November 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">In a letter to Burke on November 27, Martinez enumerated the grounds upon which he felt that appellant\u2019s employment should be terminated. That letter indicated that copies were sent to the individuals listed in Martinez\u2019s August 22 letters of termination and, in addition, to two other national officers of AMIDS.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A copy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>letter was placed in appellant\u2019s personnel file. Burke forwarded Martinez\u2019s letter to appellant by letter dated November 29, and also offered appellant an opportunity to be heard on the charges, although stating that he did not believe appellant was entitled to a hearing because he was a nonclassified employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Appellant requested a hearing, and a trial type hearing was held before an associate commissioner of RIDE, at which appellant was represented by counsel. The associate commissioner concluded, by decision dated February 7, 1973, that only one of the charges was substantiated; that appellant had, in a heated exchange in Martinez\u2019s office, called Martinez a \u201cmouse,\u201d for which there was an immediate apology. The associate commissioner found there was no just cause for the termination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Appellant was reinstated by Commissioner Burke on February 8. Martinez was terminated as of the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">NEAMIDS severed its association with the State of Rhode Island in March of 1973 and relocated at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Appellant applied for the position of assistant director, but was turned down. Most of the other Rhode Island NEAMIDS\u2019 employees were rehired in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Appellant obtained employment with the State of Rhode Island as the Director of Education with the Rhode Island Department of Corrections about six months later. During the interim, he worked part-time as a consultant to various educational institutions in Rhode Island.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">PROPERTY INTEREST</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">We first address appellant\u2019s claim of property interest in his employment. To have a property interest that is constitutionally protected by due process, appellant must have had a legitimate claim of entitlement to continued employment arising out of Rhode Island law. A unilateral expectation is not sufficient. <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972); <em>Willens v. University of Massachusetts, </em>570 F.2d 403 (1st Cir. 1978); <em>Mack v. Cape Elizabeth School Board, </em>553 F.2d 720 (1st Cir. 1971). A property interest in the context of appellant\u2019s claim was defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-12\">We have made clear in <em>Roth, supra, </em>at 571-572, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, that \u201cproperty\u201d interests subject to procedural due process protection are not limited by a few rigid, technical forms. Rather, \u201cproperty\u201d denotes a broad range of interests that are secured by \u201cexisting rules or understandings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709. A person\u2019s interest in a benefit is a \u201cproperty\u201d interest for due process purposes if there are such rules or mutually explicit understandings that support his claim of entitlement to the benefit and that he may invoke at a hearing. <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-13\"><em>Perry v. Sinderman, </em>408 U.S. 593, 601, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2699, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-14\">A claim of entitlement may be established not only on express statutory grounds and by express contractual provisions, but also by agreements implied from the promisor\u2019s words and conduct in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the surrounding circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 92 S.Ct. 2694. A property interest has been found where, by statute, rules, or contract the employee can be fired only for cause. <em>Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974). A constitutionally protected property interest has . not been recognized where the employee serves at the will and pleasure of the public employer. <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 343-47, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976), or has no tenure; <em>Willens v. University of Mass., supra, </em>570 F.2d 403; <em>Mack v. Cape Elizabeth School Board, supra, </em>553 F.2d 720; <em>Patterson v. Ramsey, </em>552 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">By Rhode Island statute, professional and administrative personnel in RIDE serve \u201cat the ple\u00e1sure of the commissioner of education\u201d as unclassified employees. R.I.Gen. Laws \u00a7 16 \u2014 49\u20147 (1976 Supp.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant does not dispute that he served as a non-classified employee within the terms of this statute and was not employed pursuant to a written contract at the time of his dismissal. Oral promises to render personal services for an indefinite term are terminable at any time at the will of either party under settled Rhode Island law. <em>School Committee of Providence v. Board of Regents for Education, </em>112 R.I. 288, 308 A.2d 788 (1973).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">the presumption that a hiring unaccompanied by an expression of time is at will can be rebutted by evidence that the parties intended that it would be a fixed period. Such an intention can be gleaned from the course of prior dealings between the parties or from any other surrounding facts or circumstances which might shed any light on the question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">308 A.2d at 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Appellant bases his property interest claim on the pre-employment promises made by Martinez that, as long as he continued as directo]1 of the program, appellant would have \u201cno problem with security\u201d and the job would continue \u201cas long as funds were available.\u201d This promise, argues appellant, overcame the statutory presumption of employment at the will of the commissioner and gave him a property interest in continued employment at NEAMIDS sufficient to invoke the mantle of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">This contention was squarely repudiated by the district court in a series of precise and definite findings, which are binding on us unless clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). The district court concluded that \u201cDr. Martinez lacked both actual and apparent authority to promise employment for an indefinite period of time, conditioned only on the availability of federal funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">The court first noted that the commissioner\u2019s statutory authority to terminate at will would be abrogated were it to accept appellant\u2019s contention that Martinez\u2019s pre-employment promises established an entitlement. Indeed, as the court observed, R.I.Gen.Laws \u00a7 16-49-7 permits the commissioner to initially contract for up to two years with nonclassified professional employees. Appellant\u2019s contract was for less than a year and, when that contract expired of its own terms, no efforts were made by either party to renew it.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">Since appellant himself participated in the preparation of the 1971 grant proposal outlining the organization of NEAMIDS, the district court found that he knew or should have known that the director did not have the authority appellant sought to impute to him. While the 1971 grant proposal specifies that the director \u201cshall have the responsibility of . selecting, supervising and terminating of personnel,\u201d it also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>just as clearly specifies that, consistent with the initial affiliation with URI, the director is ultimately responsible to an official of URI, and that \u201c[ejmployment of personnel . will be conducted in accordance with all University, State and Federal laws, requirements and policies.\u201d It was a URI official, not Martinez, who signed appellant\u2019s initial contract, and, at all times, appellant\u2019s pay checks came from the State Department of Education. The district court concluded that these factors clearly established that, although within the immediate office of NEAMIDS the director was supreme, appellant knew or should have known that his authority was at all times subject to state law and state officials.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The district court further found that appellant\u2019s own actions indicated that he never labored under the misapprehension that Burke\u2019s authority as Commissioner of Education had been supplanted by Martinez. Indeed, appellant contacted Burke before the termination dispute arose to clarify his authority and immediately after his termination to request a hearing and after the suspension notice to again request a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The court below also found that, based on his previous employment with the state, appellant was familiar with the state\u2019s employment practices, including the absence of contracts, the significance of a nonclassified status, the commissioner\u2019s authority over department directors and his power to terminate at will. It concluded that, although NEAMIDS was a hybrid state-federal project, appellant was fully aware that the Rhode Island state employment structure was superimposed on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Finally, the district court found that Martinez\u2019s statements themselves contained no representation that the state authority would terminate appellant only for good cause. Viewing Martinez\u2019s statements in the light most favorable to appellant, the court found that Martinez committed only himself, and not the state, to retain appellant absent good cause for termination and provided that federal funds remained available. At most, Martinez was pledging his own intention not to recommend appellant\u2019s termination without good cause. Based on all the circumstances, including appellant\u2019s familiarity with state employment practices and his actual conduct, the district court concluded that appellant understood the director\u2019s assurance as nothing more than his own pledge and that, therefore, the Commissioner of Education was not bound by anything Martinez said prior to appellant becoming an employee. <em>See, e. g., Galaway v. Lawson, </em>438 F.Supp. 968, 974-75 (D.Minn.1976), <em>aff\u2019d p. c., </em>565 F.2d 542 (8th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">These findings, which were securely anchored to current case law, are clearly correct. In <em>Mack v. Cape Elizabeth School Board, supra, </em>553 F.2d at 722, we noted \u201cthe propensity of many persons to over-construe statements in their favor.\u201d To that, we add the observation that a hindsight review of statements carries a slanted focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">The district court spent considerable time discussing and rejecting appellant\u2019s claim of estoppel in his case against Martinez individually.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This, however, has not been pressed on appeal, due undoubtedly to the disappearance of Martinez.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">LIBERTY INTEREST</p>\n<p id=\"AZy\">There are two ways in which appellant\u2019s constitutional liberty interest could be implicated. First, if Martinez made \u201cany charge against him that might seriously damage his standing and association in [the] community.\u201d <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707; <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 348 \u2014 49, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Second, whether Martinez \u201cimposed on him a stigma or other disability that foreclosed his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities.\u201d <em>Roth </em>at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707. But \u201cmere proof, for example, that his record of nonretention in one job, taken alone, might make him somewhat less attractive to some other employers would hardly establish the kind of foreclosure of opportunities amounting to a deprivation of \u2018liberty\u2019.\u201d <em>Roth </em>at 574 n.13, 92 S.Ct. at 2708 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The holding of the Supreme Court in <em>Codd </em>v. <em>Velger, </em>429 U.S. 624, 628, 97 S.Ct. 882, 51 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977), is apposite here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMj-\">Since the District Court found that respondent had no Fourteenth Amendment property interest in continued employment, the adequacy or even the existence of reasons for failing to rehire him presents no federal constitutional question. Only if the employer creates and disseminates a false and defamatory impression about the employee in connection with his termination is such a hearing required. <em>Roth, supra; Bishop, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">While <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976), casts some shadow on the continued vitality of a 1983 action based on a defamation liberty interest, its holding was limited to defamation alone without any employment termination. \u201cThus it was not thought sufficient to establish a claim under \u00a7 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment that there simply be defamation by a state official; the defamation had to occur in the course of the termination of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710, 96 S.Ct. at 1165.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The question here is whether the August letter of termination, the November letter containing Martinez\u2019s charges, and their limited publication, plus the termination and then subsequent suspension with pay was sufficient to trigger the due process requirements under <em>Roth </em>and <em>Bishop.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The district court found that appellant was not foreclosed from job opportunities, either actual or apparent, and, therefore, his employment opportunity liberty interest was not infringed. This finding is clearly supportable on the record. Appellant was hired by the State of Rhode Island in a supervisory capacity about six months after NEAMIDS moved to Pennsylvania. During the interim period, he worked as an advisor for various educational institutions in Rhode Island. After appellant\u2019s ultimate vindication, the records of the charges were expunged from his personnel file and would, therefore, be unavailable to prospective employers. While observing that during appellant\u2019s period of suspension, his \u201cfew employment applications were rejected,\u201d the district court found that \u201cthe August charges of insubordination and hostility towards the Director were not tantamount to a \u2018stigma\u2019 that \u2018foreclosed\u2019 job opportunities.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Appellant claims, however, that the district court did not address his contention that the placing of Martinez\u2019s letter of November 27 containing eighteen charges against him in his file was sufficient standing alone under <em>Codd v. Velger, supra, </em>429 U.S. 624, 97 S.Ct. 882, 51 L.Ed.2d 92, to satisfy the public disclosure requirement necessary to give rise to a liberty interest. While the district court may not have mentioned <em>Codd </em>specifically, it did find, \u201cThe November charges, which included alleged violations of office policy and incompetence involved incidents so minor that plaintiffs\u2019 reputations were secure at all times and vis-a-vis all readers.\u201d We concur in this characterization. In <em>Codd, </em>the file information was that the plaintiff had put a gun to his head in an apparent attempt to commit suicide, not, as here, a series of subjective trivial complaints about job performance. <em>See </em>footnote 7, <em>supra. </em>Moreover, in <em>Codd, </em>the information was actually disclosed to a prospective employer. There is no such claim here, but, even if there had been such disclosure, the termination of Martinez on the same date that appellant was reinstated totally demolished any impact the charges might have had. The placing of the November 27 letter in appellant\u2019s file does not bring this case within the ambit of <em>Codd.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Nor were the statements in the August and November letters such as \u201cmight seriously damage [appellant\u2019s] standing and associations in his community.\u201d <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707. Anyone familiar with the situation, as were the persons to whom disclosure was made, must have known that Martinez\u2019s statements were the result of a split in the NEAMIDS\u2019 organization and a struggle for control between Martinez and appellant. The ultimate result was the reinstatement of appellant, the dismissal of Martinez, and the moving of NEAMIDS to the more hospitable climate of the City of Brotherly Love.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">These were simply not the type of charges that would adversely affect appellant\u2019s good name and reputation in the Rho-de Island educational community.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> His present position as Assistant Principal at the West Warwick, Rhode Island, Junior High School belies any stigma as a result of the NEAMIDS affair. Moreover, as the district court noted, these cases that found a liberty interest infringement due to disclosure usually involved public meetings or the news media. <em>See, </em>e. <em>g., Owen v. City of Independence, </em>560 F.2d 925, 936-37 (8th Cir. 1977), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>438 U.S. 902, 98 S.Ct. 3118, 57 L.Ed.2d 1145 (1978); <em>Staton v. Mayes, </em>552 F.2d 908, 911 n.6 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 907, 98 S.Ct. 309, 54 L.Ed.2d 195 (1977) (public meeting with representatives of press present); <em>Huntley v. Community School Board of Brooklyn, </em>543 F.2d 979, 983 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 929, 97 S.Ct. 1547, 51 L.Ed.2d 773 (1977) (public meeting); <em>David Gonzalez v. Calero, </em>440 F.Supp. 989, 996 (D.C.P.R.1977) (newspaper publicity); <em>Galaway v. Lawson, supra, </em>438 F.Supp. at 974 (newspaper publicity).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">We find no defamation liberty interest infringement here that would trigger the necessity of a due process hearing before termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">This leaves the state defamation claim which is a modified rerun of the liberty interest contention. There are two questions involved: whether the district court was correct in its determination that the publication of the alleged defamatory charges was protected under Rhode Island law by a \u201ccommon interest\u201d qualified privilege and, if it was, whether the district court\u2019s finding that Martinez\u2019s conduct was not primarily motivated by malice and, hence, did not overcome the qualified privilege was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Appellant does not quarrel with the Rho-de Island law on a \u201ccommon interest\u201d qualified privilege as stated by the district court; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>it is its application that is contested. The base case is <em>Ponticelli v. Mine Safety Appliance Co., </em>104 R.I. 549, 247 A.2d 303 (R.I. 1968). The court defined the privilege as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">Preliminarily, we examine the qualified privilege concept. It permits a person to escape liability for a false and defamatory statement made about another if the occasion for the publication is such that the publisher acting in good faith correctly or reasonably believes that he has a legal, moral or social duty to speak out, or that to speak out is necessary to protect either his own interests, or those of third persons, or certain interests of the public. The occasion, of course, must not be abused. Underlying the principle is the public policy consideration that unless such an occasion is privileged, persons would not speak, even though the interests of the community at large required that they do so, lest they be exposed to a suit for defamation for what they might say. Correlatively, of course, there must be a reciprocity of duty between the publisher and the person to whom the publication is addressed, and the circumstances should reasonably demonstrate that the recipients have an interest in receiving it corresponding to that of the publisher in making it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 305-06.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">There remains the further problem of whether defendant unreasonably exercised the privilege. Clearly, of course, an occasion otherwise conditionally privileged cannot be sustained if the defamatory statements have been induced by malice. <em>Tillinghast v. McLeon, </em>17 R.I. 208, 21 A. 345. The word \u201cmalice\u201d as we use it \u201c * * * does not mean malice in law, or the absence of legal excuse, but malice in the popular sense, the motive of personal spite or ill will. This is sometimes called express or actual malice.\u201d <em>Hayden v. Hasbrouck, </em>supra, 34 R.I. 556, at 562, 84 A. 1087, at 1089-1090.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 308. In <em>Ponticelli, </em>the court found that an employer was privileged to disclose to its employees the fact that the plaintiff was discharged for padding production figures since such disclosure acted as a deterrent to similar conduct in the future. In a subsequent case, <em>Swanson v. Speidel Corporation, </em>110 R.I. 335, 293 A.2d 307, 310 (R.I. 1972), the court stated: \u201cIt seems to us that the rationale in <em>Ponticelli </em>should apply with equal force to a situation involving prospective employers.\u201d In both <em>Ponticelli </em>and <em>Swanson, </em>the court emphasized that the question <em>of </em>malice was one of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Appellant argues that publication to the federal officials of the letters, and particularly the dissemination of a copy of the November 27 letter to William Melody, did not involve a reciprocity of duty and, therefore, there was no qualified privilege. We disagree. The officials that received copies of the letter were all directly or indirectly a part of the national AMIDS organization. Melody was the regional director of a similar program elsewhere. While he had no direct control or supervisory function as to NEAMIDS, he was part of the national organization and had a real interest in knowing what was going on in the other regions.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">We cannot say on our examination of the record that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that \u201cplaintiffs have failed to establish that malice was the primary motive for Dr. Martinez\u2019s disclosure.\u201d We can almost take judicial notice of the fact that filing letters and sending out copies is a reflex bureaucratic action.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">We therefore affirm the district court on the state defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\">.
