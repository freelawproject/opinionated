Appellee filed complaints in each of the bankruptcy proceedings for a determination that the bankrupts\u2019 debts to him were nondischargeable under section 17a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a)(2))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and for a judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ment against the bankrupts. The Referee in Bankruptcy (hereinafter \u201cReferee\u201d) awarded a nondischargeable judgment in favor of appellee against appellants Roy A. Vaughan and Thomas Amador<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the amount of $11,955.36 plus interest and attorney\u2019s fees of $1,195.54. The district court affirmed the Referee\u2019s decision. We affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">As found by the Referee, appellants Roy A. Vaughan and Thomas Amador purchased an established grocery store on or about September 30, 1972, from appellee, along with its furniture and fixtures, inventory (wholesale value of $23,209.23), good accounts receivable of $15,559.84, rolling stock, automotive equipment, goodwill, and cash of $5,000. The purchase price was $56,000, evidenced by a promissory note. Vaughan, Amador, and a third partner, George Michelle, gave appellee a security interest in the assets which they had purchased, including any inventory that might later be purchased, and also agreed to maintain the inventory at the level at the time of sale. In the event the inventory dropped below this level, appellee had a right to possession of all collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On or about April 6, 1974, pursuant to agreement of the parties, appellee repossessed those assets remaining on the premises of the grocery store. Upon repossession, appellee found a total of $89.49 cash, inventory (wholesale value) of $11,243.87, and $9,690.64 in accounts receivable of which $1,000 were bad. The value of all other collateral was $7,500. Thus, total collateral repossessed amounted to $27,524. The balance due on the promissory note was $50,166.46, and appellee had to pay utility bills for the store amounting to $728.73. Accordingly, were it not for the bankruptcy, appellee would have been entitled to a judgment in the amount of $23,371.19.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">The Referee further found that the amount of indebtedness incurred and the decrease in inventory and in accounts receivable was \u201cso excessive\u201d that the mere term \u201cnegligent mismanagement\u201d would be inappropriate to describe it and that a pri-ma facie showing had been made that appellants had willfully and maliciously decreased the secured assets, dissipating the proceeds from such assets for their own use, so that appellee was unable to repossess all of the collateral; that the prima facie showing had not been overcome by appellants; and that, of the amount owing appellee, $11,955.36<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was the direct result of the willful and malicious decrease in inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">The Referee concluded that all purchasers were partners and that if any partner willfully and maliciously converted property of appellee, such an act would constitute for all partners a nondischargeable debt under section 17a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act; that the decrease in inventory constituted a willful and malicious conversion of collateral pledged to appellee for purposes of that section; that the decrease in inventory constituted a violation of section 40A \u2014 16-18, N.M.Stat.Ann. (1953 Comp., as amended); <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>that, because appellee was unable to repossess all collateral pledged to him, the provisions of section 50A \u2014 9-505(2), N.M.Stat. Ann. (1953 Comp.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> did not apply; and that the provisions of said section are for the <em>benefit of secured parties </em>and would not be applied since to do so would permit appellants to benefit from their wrongful disposition of assets pledged to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Appellants argue that, in the absence of a finding that appellee was the owner of the property involved, the Referee erred in concluding that they had willfully or maliciously converted property of appellee. To this argument, the district court merely stated that appellee \u201chad the right of repossession.\u201d Perhaps more precisely, we would point out that appellee had a security interest in, among other assets, the inventory, the level of which appellants had agreed to maintain at $23,209.23. When the inventory was sold down to below that level, appellee\u2019s security interest in the inventory was converted to that extent. See <em>In re Vines, </em>430 F.Supp. 465 (D.C.Ala.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>560 F.2d 1022 (5th Cir. 1977). It is to be borne in mind that a bankruptcy court is essentially a court of equity, and its proceedings are inherently proceedings in equity. <em>Young v. Higbee Co., </em>324 U.S. 204, 214, 65 S.Ct. 594, 599, 89 L.Ed. 890, 898 (1945); <em>Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, </em>292 U.S. 234, 240, 54 S.Ct. 695, 697, 78 L.Ed. 1230,1232 (1934). Substantial right and justice, rather than technical form, control. <em>Jones v. Kendall, </em>34 F.2d 344, 347 (4th Cir. 1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">Appellants next assert that the Referee erred in awarding a judgment in favor of appellee notwithstanding appellee\u2019s failure to sell the collateral which secured their debt, as provided for in section 50A-9-504, N.M.Stat.Ann. (1953 Comp.).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the basis of the findings of the Referee set forth above, it is clear that the total collateral repossessed was worth roughly half the amount owing appellee, so that selling it would have been an empty gesture insofar as avoiding the amount of the judgment is concerned. Moreover, the judgment itself was based on the depletion of the inventory, and the goods sold by appellants in depleting the inventory obviously could not have been repossessed and sold. Appellants\u2019 point that, in failing to sell the repossessed collateral, appellee elected under section 50A \u2014 9-505(2), N.M.Stat.Ann. (1953 Comp.), \u201cto retain the collateral in satisfaction of the obligation\u201d ignores the fact, found by the district court, that appellants\u2019 own acts forced appellee to make that election.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To apply section 50A-9-505 under such circumstances to enable appellants to avoid the consequences of their wrong doing <em>(see </em>note 6, <em>supra) </em>would be incompatible with not only the spirit of the statute but with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>equity that must characterize bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Appellants further argue that, in the absence of a finding that the alleged conversion occurred within the scope of the partnership, the Referee erred in concluding that if any partner willfully and maliciously converted property, such conversion constituted for all partners a nondischargeable debt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a)(2). This argument is bottomed on appellants\u2019 theory that (1) it was their partner, Michelle, who had left the partnership in the later part of 1973, who was responsible for any wrongful conversion because, so they say, there is no evidence showing that either of appellants was personally responsible for any conversion; and (2) Michelle\u2019s conversion would have been to his own use and outside the scope of the partnership. The fatal flaw in this argument is the Referee\u2019s finding that most of the depletion in the inventory occurred in the three months prior to repossession by appellee during which time appellants were running the business.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellee testified that the inventory was being depleted over at least four or five months, \u201cor maybe more,\u201d and with Michelle having left on October 14, 1973, it would not be unreasonable to conclude that all of the depletion in the inventory occurred when appellants were running the business.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, appellant Vaughan testified that in December of 1973 the level of inventory fell below what was on hand at the time of the sale of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Finally, appellants argue that the Referee erred in finding that appellee had established a prima facie case of willful and malicious conversion and, additionally, in placing upon appellants the burden of establishing their innocence, citing Rule 407 of the Rules of Bankruptcy<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the Advisory Committee Note to that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Depending upon the circumstances, of course, there is no question but that a conversion can be found to have been willful and malicious. <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Kavanaugh, </em>242 U.S. 138, 37 S.Ct. 38, 61 L.Ed. 205 (1916). Here the only excuse offered for the depletion of the inventory was that appellants had to go on a cash basis in their acquisition of inventory items. However, as the district court found, this was a situation of their own making, and the evidence of a continued and accelerated wasting of assets, without appellee\u2019s authority or consent, while withholding information from appellee regarding the true condition of the business, was sufficient to permit an inference of willful and malicious conversion. Appellants presented no evidence showing that they had provided appellee with records or other information indicating that they were depleting assets covered by his security interest. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 32(c)(2). Also, as pointed out earlier in this opinion, the Referee found that the decrease in inventory and in accounts receivable was so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>excessive that the mere term \u201cnegligent mismanagement\u201d would be inappropriate to describe it. Accordingly, we hold that a prima facie case of willful and malicious conversion was established by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Appellants\u2019 point that they were placed under a burden of proving their innocence contrary to Rule 407 is not well taken. Appellee met the requirement of Rule 407 by producing evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case of willful and malicious conversion. Thereupon, the burden was on appellants to come forward with evidence showing, for example, that there was no conversion or, if there was conversion, that it was not willful and malicious. <em>Gardner v. American Century Mortgage Investors, </em>577 F.2d 928 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>In re Mascolo, </em>505 F.2d 274 (1st Cir. 1974); <em>Feldenstein v. Radio Distributing Co., </em>323 F.2d 892 (6th Cir. 1963); <em>American National Bank of Denver v. Rainguet, </em>323 F.2d 881 (10th Cir. 1963); <em>Weinstein v. Nussbaum, </em>302 F.2d 24 (2d Cir. 1962). There is nothing in the Advisory Committee Note to Rule 407 which relieves appellants from coming forward with evidence to rebut the prima facie case established by appellee. The Advisory Committee Note states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">This rule does not deal with the burden of going forward with the evidence. . . . the rule leaves to the courts the formulation of rules governing the shift of the burden of going forward with the evidence in the light of such considerations as the difficulties of proving the nonexistence of a fact and of establishing a fact as to which the evidence is likely to be more accessible to the bankrupt than to the objector.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Evidence to establish the fact that there was no conversion or, if there was conversion, that it was not willful or malicious was peculiarly accessible to appellants, who were in a position to know what happened to monies received from depletion of the inventory and to maintain records reflecting the disposition of assets subject to ap-pellee\u2019s secured interest. The conclusion of the Referee and of the district court that appellee\u2019s prima facie case was not overcome by appellants is clearly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">We are satisfied that the findings of the Referee and of the district court referred to in this opinion are not clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-11\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"acc-dedup-0\">A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, whether allowable in full or in part, except such as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-20\">(2) are . for willful and malicious conversion of the property of another;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-21\">We note that the phrase \u201cconversion of the property of another\u201d was substituted for \u201cinjuries to the person or property of another\u201d by Pub. L. 91 \u2014 467, 8-1 Stat. 992 (1970). However, it had long been considered that conversion of property constituted an injury to property. <em>Davis v. Aetna Acceptance Co., </em>293 U.S. 328, 332, 55 S.Ct. 151, 153, 79 L.Ed. 393 (1934).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\">.

He handed me the keys, and that was it.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b488-5\">. The $11,243.87 wholesale value of the inventory upon repossession represents $704.39 for meat plus grocery items of $14,052.63, valued at retail, as compiled by the Albuquerque Inventory Service, reduced (in appellee\u2019s own handwriting) by $3,513.15 to reflect a one-third markup from the wholesale value of $10,-539.48. As of January 3, 1974, total inventory of grocery items, valued at retail, as compiled by the Albuquerque Inventory Service, was $20,650.26; reducing this by $5,162 to reflect a one-third markup would yield a wholesale value of $15,488. The value of meat on hand was not shown on this inventory, but appellant Vaughan testified from work sheets in evidence that it was $2,597.79. Adding this in would yield a total inventory of $18,085.79. Thus, during the first three months of 1974 (the last three months of the partnership), inventory was depleted to the extent of over $6,800.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\">. It is noted that a copy of the federal partnership return of income (Form 1065) for 1973 reports a 12/31/73 inventory of $23,368, with a notation that the method of valuing inventory is \u201ccost.\u201d When this is compared with the $11,243.87 wholesale value of the inventory upon repossession, the difference even exceeds the nondischargeable judgment of $11,955.36.
