The district court held that \u00a7\u00a7 14r-196(a)(l) and (2), N.C.Gen.Stat. (1969), under which petitioner was convicted, violated the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and were therefore invalid. These statutes proscribe profane, vulgar, lewd and threatening communications over the telephone. As we view the record, particularly the term of his probation, we think that petitioner was convicted only under \u00a7 14-196(a)(1); and as to it we affirm on the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion of May 25,1977, and its order of February 20, 1978. <em>See Radford v. Webb, </em>446 F.Supp. 608 (W.D.N.C.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
