The injunction ordered the Employer to cease and desist from certain acts pending adjudication by the NLRB of charges that the employer had committed unfair labor practices. By its own terms, the \u00a7 10(j) injunction expired upon \u201cthe final disposition of the matters involved before the National Labor Relations Board.\u201d During the pend-ency of these appeals, the NLRB adjudicated the unfair labor practice claims. 241 N. L.R.B. No. 42 (March 15, 1979). The Board\u2019s order is reviewable either in an enforcement proceeding under \u00a7 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), or in an appeal by the Employer under \u00a7 10(f), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">It is the Court\u2019s opinion that the NLRB\u2019s final adjudication of the underlying labor dispute rendered the instant appeals from the temporary injunction moot and that the appeals, therefore, should be dismissed. Our decision today reflects no opinion as to the validity of the District Court\u2019s \u00a7 10(j) injunction, to the extent that the validity of the injunction may be relevant in any review of the NLRB\u2019s March 15, 1979, order or in any other, collateral proceeding not currently before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">Accordingly, the appeals should be, and hereby are, dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
