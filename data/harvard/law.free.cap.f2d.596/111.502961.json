MORGAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">This is an expedited appeal from an order of the district court granting a preliminary injunction which prevents Opticks, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a Texas corporation, from using the trade name \u201cPearle Vision Center\u201d in the New Orleans market area. The Vision Center,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a Louisiana partnership, claimed that Opticks\u2019 proposed use of the words \u201cvision\u201d and \u201ccenter\u201d constituted trade name infringement and unfair competition. The action was originally filed in state court and was removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. The district court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> found that the name \u201cvision center\u201d was either suggestive of the partnership\u2019s services or, if descriptive, had acquired a secondary meaning. Moreover, the court concluded that Opticks\u2019 conduct was tantamount to fraud. Opticks insists that these findings are clearly erroneous and argues that the district court erred in granting a preliminary injunction affording trade name protection to the phrase \u201cvision center.\u201d We agree and therefore reverse the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">The phrase \u201cvision center\u201d was first used in the New Orleans area in 1955 when Dr. Ellis Pailet, a New Orleans optometrist, adopted it as the name of his sole proprietorship. Subsequently, Dr. Pailet hired additional optometrists and in 1967 formed a partnership which continued, without interruption, to use \u201cThe Vision Center\u201d name. That partnership is the plaintiff in this action. The partnership has six locations in the New Orleans area, all operating under the name \u201cThe Vision Center.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-16\">Dr. Pailet first registered the trade name with the Secretary of State of Louisiana under the Louisiana Trademark Law on April 19, 1955.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That registration was renewed in March 1965 and again in February 1975. Over the years, the partnership engaged in the limited advertising permitted under the ethics of the optometric profession and, with a change in the law in 1978, began media advertising in newspapers, magazines, and on the radio.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-17\">In 1969, Opticks acquired a New York Company which had dispensed optical goods and services since 1952 under the name \u201cVision Center.\u201d Opticks then began to operate similar stores using this name and, at present, operates a national chain of retail outlets for optical services and goods under the trade names \u201cVision Center,\u201d \u201cPearle Vision Center,\u201d \u201cRogers Vision Center,\u201d and \u201cHillman-Kohan Vision Center.\u201d On July 28, 1970, Will Ross, Inc. registered the words \u201cvision center\u201d as both a service mark and a trademark on the principal register of the U. S. Patent Office. Will Ross later assigned its rights in these marks to Opticks.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>During 1977 Opticks formulated a plan to open three outlets in the New Orleans area under the name \u201cPearle Vision Center.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Opticks planned to identify its stores by a large green exterior sign showing the words \u201cPearle Vision Center\" in large white letters, with \u201cPearle\u201d being the largest word. In promoting its new stores, Opticks also planned to use its national advertising program and materials, including television and radio commercials, newspaper advertisements, and direct mail flyers. Although a percentage of Opticks\u2019 consumer-oriented advertising materials used in other parts of the country employs the words \u201cVision Center,\u201d without an identifying prefix, the advertising slated for use in New Orleans always used the words \u201cPearle Vision Center.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The partnership brought suit, and on August 25, 1978, the district court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining Opticks from using any combination of the words \u201cvision\u201d and \u201ccenter\u201d in the New Orleans area.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The granting or denying of a preliminary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the district court, and its decision will be overturned only for abuse. <em>Johnson v. Radford, </em>449 F.2d 115 (5th Cir. 1971). A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, however, and the boundaries within which the district court must exercise its discretion are clearly marked. <em>State of Texas </em>v. <em>Seatrain International, S.A., </em>518 F.2d 175 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Canal Authority v. Callaway, </em>489 F.2d 567 (5th Cir. 1974). The district court should issue the injunction only if the moving party clearly satisfies what we have recognized as the four prerequisites to such relief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These are: (1) a substantial likelihood that the movant will ultimately prevail on the merits; (2) a showing that the movant will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues; (3) proof that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) a showing that the injunction, if issued, would not be adverse to the public interest. <em>Seatrain, supra, </em>518 F.2d at 179, and cases cited therein. The remedy should not be granted unless the movant carries the burden of persuasion concerning all four of these criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">Because removal to federal court was premised entirely upon diversity of citizenship, we look to state substantive law in assessing the merits of both the trade name infringement and unfair competition claims. The fact that Opticks\u2019 Lanham Act registration may be a defense to a state trade name infringement claim affords no basis for original federal question jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Gully v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>299 U.S. 109, 57 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936); La <em>Chemise Lacoste v. Alligator Co., </em>506 F.2d 339 (3rd Cir. 1974). Although we apply Louisiana law, we note that both parties have relied on federal precedents as announcing generally accepted principles of substantive trademark law. Except where we discern a difference between local law and the general law on the subject, we will also employ relevant federal decisions. <em>See Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., </em>305 U.S. 111, 113 n. 1, 59 S.Ct. 109, 83 L.Ed. 73 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The threshold question in any trade name infringement action is whether the word or phrase was initially registerable or protect-able.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>American Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Heritage Life Ins. Co., </em>494 F.2d 3, 10 (5th Cir. 1974). To assist in making this determination, the courts have traditionally divided the universe of potential trade names into various categories of legal protectability. A trade name is generally classified as being either (1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, or (4) arbitrary or fanciful.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Miller Brewing Co. v. G. Heilman Brewing Co., </em>561 F.2d 75, 79 (7th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1025, 98 S.Ct. 751, 54 L.Ed.2d 772 (1978); <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., </em>537 F.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>American Heritage, supra, </em>494 F.2d at 11. Although these categories are meant to be mutually exclusive, they are spectrum-like and tend to merge imperceptibly from one to another. For this reason, they are difficult to define and, quite frequently, difficult to apply. <em>Miller Brewing Co. v. G. Heilman Brewing Co., supra, </em>561 F.2d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">A generic term is the name of a particular genus or class of which an individual article or service is but a member. Most courts hold that a generic term is incapable of achieving trade name protection. A descriptive term<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> identifies a characteristic or quality of an article or service and, though ordinarily not protectable, may become a valid trade name if it acquires a secondary meaning. A suggestive term suggests, rather than describes, a characteristic of the goods or services and requires an effort of the imagination by the consumer in order to be understood as de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>scriptive. <em>General Shoe Corp. </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>111 F.2d 95, 98 (4th Cir. 1940). A suggestive term requires no proof of secondary meaning in order to receive trade name protection. An arbitrary or fanciful term bears no relationship to the product or service and is also protectable without proof of secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The partnership urges, and the district court found, that \u201cThe Vision Center\u201d name is suggestive and therefore entitled to full trade name protection without proof of secondary meaning. We are convinced, however, that the trade name \u201cVision Center\u201d is descriptive<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of a clinic providing optical goods and services, and we hold that the partnership has failed to prove secondary meaning as required under Louisiana law. For these reasons, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">We begin with the proposition that \u201c[t]he concept of descriptiveness must be construed rather broadly\u201d 3 R. Callman, <em>The Law of Unfair Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies, </em>\u00a7 70.2 (3d ed. 1969). Whenever a word or phrase naturally directs attention to the qualities, characteristics, effect, or purpose of the product or service, it is descriptive and cannot be claimed as an exclusive trade name. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 71.1. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1964)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> defines the word \u201cvision\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">the act or power of seeing; visual sensation or the capacity for it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The word \u201ccenter\u201d means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJV\">a concentration of requisite facilities for an activity, pursuit, or interest along with various adjunct conveniences [e. g. shopping center, medical center, amusement center].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Used in combination, the words imply a place where there is a concentration of requisite facilities relating to the power of seeing or the capacity for it. Because the name does not require \u201cimagination, thought and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of the goods\u201d or services, it cannot be considered a suggestive term. <em>Stix Products, Inc. v. United Merchants &amp; Mfrs., Inc., </em>295 F.Supp. 479, 488 (S.D.N.Y.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">Another test used by the courts to distinguish between descriptive and suggestive marks is \u201cwhether competitors would be likely to need the terms used in the trademark in describing their products.\u201d <em>Union Carbide Corp. v. Ever-Ready, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 366, 379 (7th Cir. 1976). We agree with Opticks that the word \u201cvision\u201d is virtually indispensable to the vocabulary of the optical goods industry.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This word, along with such common nouns as eye, sight, and optics, naturally occurs to one in thinking of the goods and services provided by the parties. Similarly, the word \u201ccenter\u201d is a common term found useful by a variety of commercial enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">We are, of course, aware that common, ordinary words can be combined in a novel or unique way and thereby achieve a degree of protection denied to the words when used separately. Although examining a trade name\u2019s individual words in isolation entails the risk that the distinctiveness of the words in combination will be overlooked, we are not guilty of such an oversight here. Rather, whether the words \u201cvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>sion\u201d and \u201ccenter\u201d are examined together or separately, we are convinced that they lack the quality of inventiveness and imagi-nativeness characteristic of suggestive trade names.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Yet another barometer of the descriptiveness vel non of a particular name is the extent to which it has been used in the trade names of others offering a similar service or product. <em>Shoe Corp. of America v. Juvenile Shoe Corp., </em>266 F.2d 793, 796 (C.C.P.A.1959). As the record reveals, the name \u201cvision center\u201d has been adopted by a large number of optical stores in other parts of the nation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That the partnership is the only one to use the term in New Orleans does not preclude us from finding that its name is descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">A number of federal and state cases construing similar trade names are consistent with our decision. In <em>Car Care, Inc. v. D. H. Holmes Co., </em>160 So.2d 272 (La.App.1964), a Louisiana case, plaintiff sought to enjoin the defendant\u2019s use of the name \u201cD. H. Holmes Car Care Center\u201d as an infringement of its name, \u201cCar Care Center.\u201d The court concluded that the words \u201ccar care\u201d were descriptive of the automobile maintenance business and therefore incapable of exclusive appropriation. In <em>Surgicenters of America, Inc. v. Medical Dental Surgeries Co., </em>196 U.S.P.Q. 121 (D.Or.1976), plaintiff claimed that the defendant\u2019s use of the name \u201cMedical Dental Surgicenter\u201d infringed its federally registered mark, \u201cSurgicen-ter.\u201d The court disagreed and held that \u201cSurgicenter\u201d was a generic term which should not be given trade name protection. <em>See also In re Executone Inc., </em>191 U.S.P.Q. 57 (C.C.P.A.1976) (\u201cNerve Center\u201d); <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson </em>v. <em>Saxton Adhesive Products, Inc., </em>185 U.S.P.Q. 245 (C.C.P.A.1974) (\u201cTape Center\u201d); <em>Allens Drug Co. v. Henry B. Gilpen Co., </em>180 U.S.P.Q. 327 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (Drug Center\u201d); <em>Houston v. Berde, </em>211 Minn. 528, 2 N.W.2d 9 (1942) (\u201cFood Center\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">The partnership questions the applicability of these cases and attempts to distinguish them on the ground that, unlike here, their identifying words describe the goods or services provided by their respective establishments. In order to more precisely identify the service provided by an optical store, the partnership\u2019s name should read \u201cVision <em>Care </em>Center.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While this may be regarded as the <em>full </em>name of such an establishment, to pretend that the abbreviated name \u201cVision Center\u201d cannot substitute in its stead ignores our \u201cuniversal habit of shortening full names \u2014 from haste or laziness or just economy of words.\u201d Application of <em>Abcor Development Corp., </em>588 F.2d 811 (C.C.P.A.1978) (Rich, J., concurring). It simply does not require an effort of the imagination to decide that a \u201cvision center\u201d is a place where one can get glasses. Consequently, we find either name to be descriptive of the service provided by a business that deals in optical goods.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">The case law uniformly requires that we refuse trade name protection to a descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>tive term unless it has acquired a secondary meaning.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In order to establish secondary meaning the plaintiff \u201cmust show that the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer.\u201d <em>Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., </em>305 U.S. 111, 118, 59 S.Ct. 109, 113, 83 L.Ed. 73 (1938). The burden of proof rests at all times with the plaintiff, and \u201c[a] high degree of proof is necessary to establish secondary meaning for a descriptive term.\u201d R. Callman, <em>The Law of Unfair Competition, supra, </em>\u00a7 77.3 at 359; <em>American Heritage, supra, </em>494 F.2d at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Most courts hold that once the plaintiff establishes secondary meaning he need only show a likelihood of confusion in order to enjoin an infringing use. <em>E. g., Aloe Creme Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milsan, Inc., </em>423 F.2d 845 (5th Cir. 1970); R. Callman, <em>The Law of Unfair Competition, supra, </em>\u00a7 77.1. The Louisiana courts, however, continue to hold that the plaintiff who depends on secondary meaning for his trade name cannot obtain injunctive relief unless he proves fraud or unfair competition on the part of the defendant. <em>Home Beverage Service v. Baas, </em>210 La. 873, 28 So.2d 481, 484 (1946); <em>Straus Frank Co. v. Brown, </em>246 La. 999, 169 So.2d 77 (1964); <em>Couhig\u2019s Pestaway Co. v. Pesta-way, Inc., </em>278 So.2d 519 (La.App.1973). Under this rule, the law of unfair competition effectively swallows up the secondary meaning doctrine. Although <em>Callman </em>expressly disapproves of the Louisiana case law and considers it erroneous, we are not at liberty to do so.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The partnership, however, relies on the district court\u2019s finding that Opticks\u2019 conduct amounted to or was at least tantamount to fraud. The Louisiana courts have \u201calways been reluctant to presume fraud.\u201d <em>Straus Frank Co. v. Brown, supra, </em>169 So.2d at 80. In the <em>Straus Frank </em>case the plaintiff, operating under the trade name \u201cLake Auto Parts,\u201d sued to enjoin the defendant from using the name \u201cLake Auto Supply.\u201d The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">One other charge leveled at defendant is that he knew of plaintiff\u2019s trade name and by adopting a similar one it may be inferred his motive was fraudulent. But we are not convinced of this. To the contrary, aside from the words \u201cAuto Supply\u201d which describes his business, we feel defendant was motivated by the geographical location in the selection of the name Lake Auto Supply, situated as the business is in the town of Lake Arthur which lies on the shores of Lake Arthur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">169 So.2d at 81. Having used the \u201cvision center\u201d trade name for many years in connection with its network of similar stores and its national advertising campaign, Op-ticks has a significant investment in the name. It was predictable that Opticks would choose to use the name \u201cPearle Vision Center\u201d in New Orleans. The emphasis placed on the word \u201cPearle\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> further absolves Opticks from any charge of deception or unfair competition, and under Louisiana law the addition of this identifying prefix is legally sufficient to distinguish Opticks\u2019 business from the partnership\u2019s.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>Home Beverage Service v. Baas, supra; Couhig\u2019s Pestaway Co. v. Pestaway, Inc., </em>278 So.2d 519 (La.App.1973). We are convinced that the district court\u2019s finding of fraud was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">As the above discussion indicates, even if we were to concede that the partnership\u2019s name had acquired a secondary meaning we could not prevent the fair use of the descriptive term \u201cvision center.\u201d <em>Home Beverage Service </em>v. <em>Baas, supra. </em>We are convinced, however, that the partnership failed to shoulder the substantial evidentiary burden necessary to establish the secondary meaning of this descriptive name.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In assessing a claim of secondary meaning,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">the chief inquiry is the attitude of the consumer toward the mark; does it denote to him a, \u201csingle thing coming from a single source\u201d? Short of a survey, this is difficult of direct proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\"><em>Aloe Creme Laboratories, Inc. v. Milsan, Inc., supra, </em>423 F.2d at 849. The partnership presented no evidence involving an objective survey of the public\u2019s perception of its name. Instead, the only evidence offered to show secondary meaning was the testimony of seven of the partnership\u2019s customers that \u201cVision Center\u201d meant the partnership\u2019s business to them, testimony that the partnership had occasionally received mail addressed to other establishments that had \u201cvision\u201d in their name, and evidence that a customer of one of Opticks\u2019 stores in another city believed the partnership and Opticks were associated.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">We think this evidence falls short of establishing that in the minds of the consuming public the <em>primary </em>significance of the term \u201cvision center\u201d is \u201cnot the product but the producer.\u201d Additionally, the reeogni-</p>\n<p id=\"aa-dedup-0\">tion of the partnership\u2019s long use of the term does not require a different result since the \u201ccourts have summarily rejected claims of secondary meaning predicated solely upon the continued use of the mark for many years.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> R. Callman, <em>The Law of Unfair Competition, supra </em>\u00a7 77.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">We now address, perhaps somewhat belatedly, the partnership\u2019s assertion that Opticks\u2019 federal registration of the words \u201cvision center\u201d is prima facie evidence that the name is distinctive and not generic or descriptive. The partnership finds itself in the unusual posture of asserting the validity of Opticks\u2019 federal registration, while Opticks, instead of seeking to defend its mark, challenges its initial registerability or protectability. Assuming arguendo that the prima facie evidence provision of the Lanham Act was designed to benefit the partnership in this case, we nevertheless adhere to our conclusion that the \u201cvision center\u201d name is merely descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">Although a statutory presumption of validity is accorded to marks registered under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1057(b), 1115(a), this presumption is rebuttable and may be overcome by establishing the generic or descriptive nature of the mark. <em>Flexitized, Inc. v. National Flexitized Corp., </em>335 F.2d 774, 779 (2d Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U.S. 913, 85 S.Ct. 899,13 L.Ed.2d 799 (1965). The partnership maintains that Opticks failed to show that the name is descriptive. We disagree. Our previous discussion indicates that in this case Opticks has argued persuasively, not merely with equal force, that the partnership\u2019s name is a term descriptive of the products and services provided by an optical store. <em>Aluminum Fabricating Co. v. Season-All Window Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>259 F.2d 314, 316 (2d Cir. 1958); <em>Scientific Applications, Inc. v. Energy Conservation Corp., </em>436 F.Supp. 354, 360 (N.D.Ga.1977). The weight of these arguments is more than sufficient to rebut the prima facie presumption that the name is suggestive rather than merely descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Because the partnership has not shown a substantial likelihood that it would ultimately prevail on the merits, it is not entitled to the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction. We find it unnecessary to engage in a discussion of the other three criteria, except to note that the partnership has also not shown that the injury it will suffer by denying the injunction outweighs the damage that Opticks will suffer if the injunction is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We reverse the district court and remand with instructions that the court dissolve the preliminary injunction and issue an order requiring Opticks to place the identifying prefix \u201cPearle\u201d before the phrase \u201cVision Center\u201d on all its signs and advertisements in the New Orleans area.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-10\">.

La.R.S. 51:211 <em>et seg. </em>At present, no one else in the New Orleans market area uses the combination of words \u201cvision\u201d and \"center.\u201d On three separate occasions the partnership persuaded other optical firms planning to use these words to change their trade names to some other name. No legal action was necessary on any of these occasions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b170-6\">. Opticks was aware of the existence of \u201cThe Vision Center\u201d and, at one point, initiated negotiations to purchase the partnership. The partners considered Opticks\u2019 offer but declined to sell.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">. The district court found that Opticks had used the words \u201cVision Center\u201d on certain of its eyeglass cases and had exhibited no intention to abandon such use. The record indicates, however, that the partnership obtained the eyeglass case introduced as an exhibit from Opticks\u2019 Biloxi, Mississippi store, and the partnership offered no proof that any materials without the identifying prefix \u201cPearle\u201d would be used in New Orleans. Absent evidence to the contrary, the district court should have accepted Opticks\u2019 assertion that all of its New Orleans advertising will employ the words \u201cPearle Vision Center\u201d and that it will not use the words \u201cVision Center\u201d without the identifying prefix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b170-12\">. The partnership contends that the standard for appellate review of the granting of a preliminary injunction recognized in our opinions is inapplicable in a trade name case. We disagree. In <em>Compact Van Equipment Co. v. Leg-gett &amp; Platt, Inc., </em>566 F.2d 952 (5th Cir. 1978), a patent infringement and unfair competition case, we examined the district court\u2019s granting of a preliminary injunction in the light of these four prerequisites. A trade name infringement case does not require a different standard. <em>See, e. g., Scientific Applications, Inc. v. Energy Conservation Corp., </em>436 F.Supp. 354 (N.D.Ga. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b170-13\">. It is clear that Opticks\u2019 federal registration is not a defense in this case since, as the district court found, the partnership was a prior user of the term \u201cVision Center\u201d in the New Orleans market area. <em>See Burger King v. Hoots, </em>403 F.2d 904 (7th Cir. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b171-7\">. Louisiana law defines a trade name to be \u201ca word, name, symbol, device or any combination thereof used by a person to identify his business, vocation or occupation and distinguish it from the business, vocation, or occupation of others.\u201d La.R.S. 51:211. The mere registration of a trade name does not grant the registrant any substantive rights but confers only procedural advantages. <em>Buyers &amp; Traders Service, Inc. v. Car Maintenance Specialists, </em>290 So.2d 753 (La.App. 1974); <em>Gallo v. Safeway Brake Shops, </em>140 So.2d 912 (La.App.1962). Although the Secretary of State\u2019s decision regarding the registerability or protectability of a particular mark is persuasive, his determination is not conclusive or binding on this court. <em>Couh-ig\u2019s Pestaway Co. v. Pestaway, Inc., </em>278 So.2d 519 (La.App. 1973). The Louisiana trademark statute specifically authorizes the courts to order cancellation of a registered mark when they deem that registration to have been improvidently granted. La.R.S. 51:219.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\">. Although no Louisiana case has employed this precise classification scheme, both the district court below and the parties here utilized it in analyzing this case. For this reason, and because we do not think the Louisiana courts would question the usefulness of the categories or reject the parties\u2019 reliance on them, we adopt the classification scheme as an aid in measuring the legal protectability of the \u201cvision center\u201d name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b171-12\">. Some courts see little difference between the generic and the descriptive categories and tend to meld the two concepts into one. <em>American Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Heritage Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>494 F.2d at 11; <em>but see Aloe Creme Laboratories, Inc. v. Milsan, </em>423 F.2d 845, 849 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 U.S. 928, 90 S.Ct. 1818, 26 L.Ed.2d 90 (1970). As one commentator has noted, the distinction between descriptive and generic terms is necessarily one of degree. R. Callman, <em>The Law of Unfair Competition, supra, </em>\u00a7 70,4. The practical significance of the distinction is seen in the courts\u2019 refusal to allow proof of secondary meaning to elevate generic, as opposed to descriptive, terms to trademark status. As noted below, however, under Louisiana law a plaintiff depending on the secondary meaning of his mark must prove fraud or unfair competition before the court will enjoin the defendant\u2019s use. This unorthodox construction results in the practical elimination of the generic/descriptive dichotomy, since neither the owner of the generic mark nor the owner of the descriptive mark may rely solely on secondary meaning to achieve trade name protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b172-8\">. We are unable to agree with Opticks that the phrase \u201cvision center\u201d is a generic term. Although the phrase is descriptive of a business that deals in optical goods, we do not think that it has become a common, recognized name of such establishments. In connection with this litigation, Opticks has offered to have its federal registrations cancelled if we will find that these words are generic. While this court is neither disposed nor authorized to bargain with legal rights, we note that in reality Op-ticks has provided us with no quid pro quo in this case. Under the Lanham Act, if a registered mark becomes the \u201ccommon descriptive name\u201d of an item (i. e., becomes generic) it may be cancelled at any time. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064. Therefore, if we were to find that the phrase is generic we would not need Opticks\u2019 permission to cancel its mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b172-13\">. \u201cThe dictionary definition of the word is an appropriate and relevant indication \u2018of the ordinary significance and meaning of words\u2019 to the public.\u201d <em>American Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Heritage Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 494 F.2d at 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b172-14\">. We note that the word has been utilized in the trade name of another optical store in New Orleans, the Vision Plaza.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b173-7\">. <em>E. g., </em>Royal Vision Center, Chicago Vision Center, Vision Center and Optical Clinic of Baton Rouge, Vision Center Opticians, Professional Vision Center, Vision Center of South Boston, Vision Center at Harvard Square, Plymouth Vision Center, Konrad Vision Center, Total Vision Center, Belmont Vision Center, Livonia-Mall Vision Center, V.I.P. Vision Center, American Vision Center, United Vision Center, 20/20 Vision Center, Plain Vision Center and Harvey Rubin Vision Center.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\">. The descriptive nature of this term is, of course, beyond peradventure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\">. As evidence that its chosen trade name is distinctive and not generic or descriptive, the partnership points out that a patient in need of eye care is unlikely to say or think, \u201cI am going to my vision center.\u201d This reasoning is unacceptable. Few consumers would call a grocery store a \u201cfood center\u201d or a pharmacy a \u201cdrug center,\u201d yet these names have been held descriptive of the establishment\u2019s identity. Thus, the fact that \u201cvision center\u201d is not the only or most common name for an optical goods store is not determinative, for \u201cthere is no legal foundation that a product has only one common descriptive name.\u201d <em>Roselux Chemical Co. v. Parsons Ammonia Co., </em>299 F.2d 855 (C.C.P.A. 1962). Also, \u201cthe absence of a word or expression from dictionaries is not controlling on the question of registerability.\u201d <em>In re Cooper, </em>196 U.S.P.Q. 182 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b174-5\">. \u201cThe terms, primary and secondary, may be somewhat misleading since a secondary meaning entitled to protection must have become the primary meaning to the consumer.\u201d <em>Aloe Creme Laboratories, Inc. v. Milsan, Inc., supra, </em>423 F.2d at 848 n. 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\">. R. Callman, <em>The Law of Unfair Competition, supra, </em>\u00a7 77.1. The Louisiana courts are not unaware of the controversy surrounding the requirement that the plaintiff who relies on secondary meaning prove fraud. <em>See Straus Frank Co. v. Brown, </em>246 La. 999, 109 So.2d 77 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">. Although we hold that Opticks is free to use the words \u201cvision center\u201d in New Orleans, the corporation is obligated \u201cto identify its product lest it be mistaken for that of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., </em>305 U.S. at 120, 59 S.Ct. at 114. Opticks, therefore, must honor its pledge to place the identifying prefix \u201cPearle\u201d in front of the phrase \u201cVision Center\u201d on all its signs and advertisements in the New Orleans area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b174-12\">. The prefix is not only legally sufficient but is legally necessary in order to distinguish Op-ticks\u2019 business and prevent unfair competition. For this reason, Opticks should desist from listing its establishment in the telephone directory under the heading \u201cVision Center Pearle\u2014 See Pearle Vision Center.\u201d <em>See Home Bever</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>age Service v. Baas, </em>supra, 28 So.2d at 486, where the court, in finding no likelihood of confusion between plaintiffs Home Beverage Service name and defendant\u2019s Victory Home Beverage Service name, noted that the defendant listed its name only under the letter \u201cV\u201d in the telephone directory and not under the letter \u201cH.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b175-14\">. The partnership has used the \u201cVision Center\u201d name in New Orleans for over 20 years. During most of this period, however, it was precluded by the ethics of the profession from engaging in media advertising. Although extensive advertising would not have assured the partnership\u2019s success, this circumstance no doubt significantly affected its efforts to develop a secondary meaning for its name.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
