Sanchez argues that the district court erred in dismissing her complaint for failure to state a claim, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and in closing her ease without granting her leave to amend. Having carefully reviewed the record in this case, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">After the United States declined to intervene in her <em>qui tarn </em>action, Sanchez served an amended complaint on Lymphatx, her former employer, and its owners. The complaint asserted five claims for relief under the False Claims Act. Four of the claims depended on Sanchez\u2019s allegations of the defendants\u2019 fraudulent Medicare-billing practices under \u00a7 3729. The fifth claim, under \u00a7 3730(h), was that Sanchez had been fired in retaliation for her complaints to Lymphatx\u2019s owners about the illegality of those practices. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of these claims <em>de novo. Corsello v. Lincare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1012 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">I. <em>Fraudulent Billing Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">To state a claim premised on fraud, Sanchez needed to \u201cstate with particularity the circumstances constituting [the] fraud.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b); <em>see also United States ex rel. Clausen v. Lab. Corp. of Am., </em>290 F.3d 1301, 1308 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cRule 9(b) does apply to actions under the False Claims Act.\u201d). In her complaint, Sanchez alleged that the defendants had knowingly submitted false claims to Medicare for lymphedema treatments performed by massage therapists.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sanchez further alleged that the defendants had intentionally billed Medicare for services they did not provide and that she had gained personal knowledge of these billing practices through her employment as Lymphatx\u2019s office manager.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-10\">In addition to her general accusations of false billing, Sanchez needed to plead \u201cfacts as to time, place, and substance of the defendants\u2019 alleged fraud, specifically, the details of the defendants\u2019 allegedly fraudulent acts, when they occurred, and who engaged in them.\u201d <em>Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1310 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Despite her assertion that she had direct knowledge of the defendants\u2019 billing and patient records, however, Sanchez failed to provide any specific details regarding either the dates on or the frequency with which the defendants submitted false claims, the amounts of those claims, or the patients whose treatment served as the basis for the claims. Without these or similar details, Sanchez\u2019s complaint lacks the \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d necessary under Rule 9(b) to support her conclusory allegations of wrongdoing. <em>See Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1311-12. In other words, because she failed \u201cto allege at least some examples of actual false claims,\u201d Sanchez could not \u201clay a complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>foundation for the rest of [her] allegations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314 n. 25. The district court therefore appropriately dismissed the four claims alleging fraudulent billing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">We reject Sanchez\u2019s argument that the district court should have allowed her to amend her complaint before dismissing these claims. <em>\u201cA </em>district court is not required to grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint sua sponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by counsel, never filed a motion to amend []or requested leave to amend before the district court.\u201d <em>Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir. 2002) <em>(en banc). </em>Sanchez was represented by counsel but did not move for leave to amend, and we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant leave that was never requested. <em>Burger King Corp. v. Weaver, </em>169 F.3d 1310, 1318 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">II. <em>Retaliatory Discharge Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">With respect to Sanchez\u2019s claim for retaliatory discharge, at the time of her termination the False Claims Act provided relief to any employee discharged because of lawful acts taken \u201cin furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(h) (2006), <em>amended by </em>Pub.L. No. 111-21, \u00a7 4(d), 123 Stat. 1617, 1624-25 (2009).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sanchez argues that she engaged in conduct protected by \u00a7 3730(h) because, as alleged in her complaint, she \u201ccomplained again and again about the unlawful actions of the Defendants\u201d and \u201ctold them that they were all incurring significant criminal and civil liability.\u201d In <em>Childree v. UAP/GA AG Chem., Inc., </em>we held that \u00a7 3730(h) only protected an employee from retaliation when there was at least \u201ca distinct possibility\u201d of litigation under the False Claims Act at the time of the employee\u2019s actions. 92 F.3d 1140, 1146 (11th Cir.1996).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The question here, then, is whether Sanchez\u2019s complaints of illegal activity occurred when there was a distinct possibility that she or the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>would sue the defendants under the False Claims Act. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">The defendants compare Sanchez\u2019s \u25a0 conduct to the sort of internal reporting that some of our sister circuits have held falls outside the scope of \u00a7 3730(h). <em>See, e.g., McKenzie v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>219 F.3d 508, 516 (6th Cir.2000) (\u201c[Section \u00a7 3730(h)\u2019s] \u2018in furtherance of language requires more than merely reporting wrongdoing to supervisors.\u201d); <em>Zahodnick v. IBM Corp., </em>135 F.3d 911, 914 (4th Cir.1997) (\u201cSimply reporting his concern of a mischarging to the government to his supervisor does not suffice to establish that Zahodnick was acting \u2018in furtherance of a <em>qui tarn </em>action.\u201d). But those courts have also recognized that an employee may put her employer on notice of possible False Claims Act litigation by making internal reports that alert the employer to fraudulent or illegal conduct. <em>McKenzie, </em>219 F.3d at 516 (\u201cAlthough internal reporting may constitute protected activity, the internal reports must allege fraud on the government.\u201d); <em>Eberhardt v. Integrated Design &amp; Constr., Inc., </em>167 F.3d 861, 868 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201c[C]haracterizing the employer\u2019s conduct as illegal or fraudulent ... let[s] the employer know, regardless of whether the employee\u2019s job duties include investigating potential fraud, that litigation is a reasonable possibility.\u201d). If an employee\u2019s actions, as alleged in the complaint, are sufficient to support a reasonable conclusion that the employer could have feared being reported to the government for fraud or sued in a <em>qui tarn </em>action by the employee, then the complaint states a claim for retaliatory discharge under \u00a7 3730(h). <em>Cf. Mann v. Olsten Certified Healthcare Corp., </em>49 F.Supp.2d 1307, 1314 (M.D.Ala.1999) (using a similar standard on consideration of a motion for summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">Sanchez\u2019s allegations that she complained about the defendants\u2019 \u201cunlawful actions\u201d and warned them that they were \u201cincurring significant criminal and civil liability\u201d would have been sufficient, if proven, to support a reasonable conclusion that the defendants were aware of the possibility of litigation under the False Claims Act. Because her retaliation claim did not depend on allegations of fraud, Sanchez\u2019s complaint only needed \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that [she was] entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). We conclude that she satisfied this requirement and that the district court therefore erred in dismissing her claim for retaliatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">In light of our conclusion that Sanchez failed to state claims premised on fraudulent billing but successfully stated a claim for retaliatory discharge under \u00a7 3730(h), we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order in part, REVERSE in part, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1327-13\">. Title 31, Section 3730(b) of the U.S. Code empowers private persons (\"relators\u201d) to sue in the name of the government when it has suffered fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">. Lymphedema is swelling caused by impairments in the body's lymphatic system. One treatment for the condition involves light massage to encourage the drainage of excess fluid. Medicare will not pay for this treatment if it is provided by a massage therapist. <em>See </em>69 Fed.Reg. 66236, 66351 (Nov. 15, 2004) (\"Medicare does not, for example, [cover] therapy services performed by massage therapists ....\"); Medicare Claims Processing Manual ch. 5 p. 31 (Apr. 24, 2009) (defining manual lymphatic drainage (CPT code 97140) as a \"therapy service\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1328-12\">. The defendants dispute whether Sanchez was, in fact, an office manager, but on our <em>de novo </em>review of an order dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim, we assume the truth of all facts alleged in the complaint. <em>Corsello, </em>428 F.3d at 1012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1329-8\">.We distinguish this case from <em>United States ex rel. Walker v. R&amp;P Properties of Lake County, Inc., </em>433 F.3d 1349, 1360 (11th Cir.2005), in which we affirmed the denial of a motion to dismiss a <em>qui tam </em>plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The plaintiff in that case was a nurse practitioner who alleged a practice of fraudulent Medicare billing by her former employer. Specifically, she alleged that the defendant\u2019s office administrator had told her that the defendant billed Medicare at arguably inflated rates. Sanchez's vague allegations that she \"found [unspecified] documentation\u2019\u2019 and \"discovered\u201d or \"learned\u201d that the defendants had submitted false claims, by contrast, leaves us \u201cwondering whether [she] has offered mere conjecture or a specifically pleaded allegation on an essential element of the lawsuit,\u201d <em>Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1313. In any event, to the extent that <em>Walker </em>conflicts with the specificity requirements of <em>Clausen, </em>our prior-panel-precedent rule requires us to follow <em>Clausen. See Walker v. Mortham, </em>158 F.3d 1177, 1188-89 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1329-12\">.

No. 111-21, \u00a7 4(d), 123 Stat. 1617, 1624-25 (2009) (emphasis added). We need not consider the effect of this change on the viability of Sanchez\u2019s claim because the amendment only applies to conduct on or after May 20, 2009. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4(f), 123 Stat. at 1625.
