The district court imposed a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) based on Martinez\u2019s prior conviction for burglary under \u00a7 459 of the California Penal Code. Martinez now challenges that enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-26\">Because Martinez did not raise this issue in the district court, we review for plain error, which requires (1) error, (2) that is clear or obvious, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 272 (5th Cir.2005). If these conditions are met, we will reverse only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>In light of <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>529 F.3d 293, 297-98 (5th Cir.2008), and <em>United States v. Ortega-Gonzaga, </em>490 F.3d 393, 395-96 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 410, 169 L.Ed.2d 287 (2007), burglary under \u00a7 459 of the California Penal Code does not constitute burglary of a dwelling under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. We reject the Government\u2019s suggestion that we employ the modified categorical approach and look to the charging documents in this case to characterize Martinez\u2019s burglary offense. <em>See Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>529 F.3d at 298; <em>Ortega-Gonzaga, </em>490 F.3d at 396 n. 5. Pursuant to <em>Ortega-Gonzaga </em>and <em>Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>the enhancement in this case is clear or obvious error, although the district court did not have the benefit of those decisions at the time of sentencing. <em>See United States v. Avants, </em>278 F.3d 510, 521 n. 13 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In addition, the error affected Martinez\u2019s substantial rights. Absent the 16-level enhancement, his sentencing range would have been substantially lower than 57 to 71 months. <em>See Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>529 F.3d at 298. Finally, the sentencing disparity warrants the exercise of our discretion to correct it. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Martinez also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence imposed by the district court is VACATED and this matter is REMANDED for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
