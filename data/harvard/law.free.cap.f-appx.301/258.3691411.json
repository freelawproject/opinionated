Longus appeals the district court\u2019s judgment revoking his supervised release and imposing a sentence of twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment. Longus alleges that his sentence is plainly unreasonable. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">We will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United, States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006). The sentence first must be assessed for reasonableness, \u201cfollow[ing] generally the procedural and substantive considerations that we employ in our review of original sentences!,] ... with some necessary modifications to take into account the unique nature of supervised release revocation sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438-39; <em>see United States v. Finley, </em>531 F.3d 288, 294 (4th Cir.2008) (\u201cIn applying the \u2018plainly unreasonable\u2019 standard, we first determine, using the instructions given in <em>Gall [v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) ], whether a sentence is \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">We affirm a sentence that is not unreasonable. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439. Only if a sentence is found procedurally or substantively unreasonable will we \u201cdecide whether the sentence is <em>plainly </em>unreasonable.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Id.; see Finley, </em>531 F.3d at 294. Although the district court must consider the Chapter 7 policy statements and the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583 (2006), \u201cthe [district] court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">We have thoroughly reviewed Longus\u2019 sentence and find it to be procedurally and substantively reasonable. Based on this conclusion, \u201cit necessarily follows that\u201d Longus\u2019 sentence is not \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440; <em>see Finley, </em>531 F.3d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment revoking Longus\u2019 supervised release and imposing a twenty-four month prison term. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-11\"> \u201c[F]or purposes of determining whether an unreasonable sentence is plainly unreasonable, \u2018plain\u2019 is synonymous with 'clear' or, equivalently, 'obvious.' \" <em>Cmdup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
