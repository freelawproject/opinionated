Saenz-Rios does not challenge either the district court\u2019s calculation of his advisory guidelines sentencing range of 77 to 96 months of imprisonment or the district court\u2019s application of a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Instead, he contends that his within-guidelines sentence should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based. He also contends that his sentence is unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we consider whether the sentence imposed is procedurally sound. <em>Id. </em>at 597. We then consider whether the sentence is substantively reasonable, using an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>A sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462, SaenzRios argues that the within-guidelines sentence imposed in his case should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness because \u00a7 2L1.2(b) was not promulgated according to usual Sentencing Commission procedures and did not take into account \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d He portrays the <em>Kimbrough </em>decision as having \u201csuggested\u201d that the appellate presumption should not be applied to Guidelines that do not take account of this data and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">Our reading of <em>Kimbrough </em>does not reveal any such suggestion. The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008), which involved a similar challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2. The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-18\">Saenz-Rios also argues that the sentence imposed by the district court is greater than necessary to satisfy the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He contends that the guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his criminal history and was too severe to reflect the seriousness of his unlawful reentry offense, considering that it was not a crime of violence and that he did not pose a danger to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The record reflects that the district court considered Saenz-Rios\u2019s criminal history as well as Saenz-Rios\u2019s particular circumstances and mitigating factors. The district court noted, however, that SaenzRios had 13 convictions and had amassed 21 criminal history points due to his prior criminal convictions, which included convictions for aggravated battery and driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Saenz-Rios has failed to demonstrate that his within-guidelines sentence should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence within the advisory guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
