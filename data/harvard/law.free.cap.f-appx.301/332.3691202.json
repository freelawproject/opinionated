The district court sentenced Williams to 135 months in prison, which was at the bottom of the advisory Guideline range, followed by a five-year term of supervised release. On appeal, Williams argues that the district court erroneously concluded it was without authority to impose a certain downward departure absent a motion and that such a conclusion constituted reversible error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-26\">Williams\u2019s assertion that the district court erroneously believed that it did not have the authority to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines vests us with jurisdiction to consider this appeal. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.2005). We review a sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ing decision for \u201creasonableness\u201d by applying an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). A district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo. </em>Factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The sentencing judge decided that a minimum Guidelines sentence properly reflected the cooperation Williams provided. The judge\u2019s statement that the possibility of a departure for substantial assistance was \u201cthe government\u2019s decision\u201d was in reference to Williams\u2019s repeated, specific questioning about whether the government planned to make a Section 5K1.1 motion. Williams and his counsel did not urge the district judge to use his own discretion to give a below-Guidelines sentence. Further, Williams offered scant evidence about assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The district judge also noted that he had considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the nature and circumstances of the offense and Williams\u2019s criminal history. As in <em>Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>there was \u201cno indication in the district court\u2019s comments that it believed the Guidelines range presumptively should apply\u201d; rather, after consideration, it \u201cconcluded that the Guidelines provided an appropriate sentencing range.\u201d 517 F.3d at 766; <em>see also United States v. Washington, </em>480 F.3d 309, 320 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he district court implicitly recognized that it could deviate from the Guidelines, but based on the facts before it, decided not to do so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Because the district judge did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory and considered Williams\u2019s cooperation, there was no error. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
