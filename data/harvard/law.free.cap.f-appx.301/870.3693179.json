After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-26\">The district court imposed a 300-month sentence, within the advisory guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Mendoza argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>the district court failed to explain the reasons for his sentence, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(c)(1). When a district court imposes a sentence within the advisory guidelines range and in excess of 24 months, it must explain \u201cthe reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). To satisfy \u00a7 3553(e)(l)\u2019s requirement, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Although the district court must indicate that it considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it does not have to \u201carticulate its consideration of each individual \u00a7 3553(a) factor, particularly where ... it is obvious the court considered many of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181-82 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Here, the district court stated on the record that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and identified several of particular concern that weighed most heavily in its determination, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, Mendoza\u2019s history of drug trafficking, the seriousness of the offense and the need for avoiding sentencing disparities. The district court\u2019s statement of reasons was adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Mendoza also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We evaluate the ultimate sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness, considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that a sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>485 F.3d 1264, 1272 (11th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AiEp\">We conclude Mendoza failed to carry his burden to show that the district court abused its discretion in imposing a 300-month sentence, within the advisory guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. Mendoza was a leader in a large drug trafficking organization and was responsible for distributing hundreds of kilograms of cocaine throughout the eastern United States. Under the circumstances, we cannot say Mendoza\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-7\">. We review <em>de novo </em>whether a district court complied with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1), even if the defendant did not preserve the issue. <em>Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d at 1181.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b895-8\">. Apart from his \u00a7 3553(c)(1) argument, Mendoza does not argue that the district court made any procedural errors in imposing his sentence or challenge any of the guidelines calculations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b895-23\">. We review the reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
