He viras sentenced to 57 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Mercado appeals his conviction for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment under Fed.R.CrimP. 36, arguing that the judgment should reflect that he was convicted of \u201cbeing found in\u201d the United States and not of \u201c[ijllegal [r]e-[e]ntry,\u201d as listed in the judgment. He argues that \u201cbeing found in\u201d the United States and \u201cillegal reentry\u201d are distinct offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Rule 36 authorizes this court to correct only clerical errors, which exist when \u201c \u2018the court intended one thing but by merely clerical mistake or oversight did another.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Steen, </em>55 F.3d 1022, 1025-26 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Dura-Wood Treating Co. v. Century Forest Indus., Inc., </em>694 F.2d 112, 114 (5th Cir.1982)). In the district court\u2019s judgment, the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d description, \u201c[ijllegal [r]e-[e]n-try,\u201d so closely tracks the \u00a7 1326 title, \u201c[r]eentry of removed aliens,\u201d that it bears no indicia of the district court having made a mistake or oversight. Rather, it appears that the district court intended the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d to refer generally to the title of \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Such a method of reference to \u00a7 1326 is not uncommon. In fact, this court has often used the term \u201cillegal reentry\u201d in reference to violations of \u00a7 1326 generally. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gunera, </em>479 F.3d 373, 376 (5th Cir.2007). It appears that the district court\u2019s judgment uses the term \u201c[ijllegal [r]e-[e]ntry\u201d intentionally in reference to \u00a7 1326 generally; therefore, there is no clerical error. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
