Alan Burton (\u201cBurton\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of the City of Ormond Beach, Florida\u2019s (\u201cthe City\u201d) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law following Burton\u2019s case-in-chief at trial. Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b873-21\">From May 28, 1996 to August 1, 2005, the City employed Burton as its Director of Leisure Services to generally manage the City\u2019s recreation programs and athletic field maintenance. Burton\u2019s more specific duties included supervising the City\u2019s Recreation Manager, Recreation Supervisors, and several other employees; planning for parks and facilities; preparing the depart-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>merit\u2019s budget; addressing citizen groups\u2019 (such as the youth baseball and soccer leagues that utilized the City\u2019s recreation facilities) concerns about the ballfields; and serving as the liaison to the Recreation Advisory Board (\u201cRAB\u201d), a group of citizens appointed by the City Commission to advise the City on issues related to recreation and the athletic fields. Burton reported to the Assistant City Manager, and Burton\u2019s interaction with the City Commission was essentially limited to responding to a Commissioner\u2019s request for information.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">The City\u2019s organizational structure assigned the maintenance of the recreation and athletic facilities to both Leisure Services and another department, Public Works. Leisure Services oversaw the City\u2019s athletic fields \u201cinside the fences,\u201d but Public Works controlled the parks and maintenance \u201coutside the fences.\u201d Generally, if a citizen expressed to Burton a maintenance concern within Public Works\u2019s purview, Burton was to submit a work order to Public Works.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">In 2005, the City had undertaken review of the entire parks and recreation system. For years, Burton had internally advocated for an integrated system that unified the functions of Leisure Services and Public Works (as opposed to the \u201chybrid\u201d system in place). But he never advocated a unified system in his official capacity because his duties obligated him to \u201cadhere to the [City\u2019s] official position\u201d to retain the hybrid system. In June 2005, the City Manager requested that Burton provide him with a planning recommendation for a forty-acre park in the newly developing Ormond Crossings area. Because Burton believed that the request was improper and exceeded a parks and recreation \u201cmaster plan\u201d already prepared by outside consultants, Burton did not comply with the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">On July 24, 2005, Stan Stockhammer (\u201cStockhammer\u201d), an Ormond Beach resident and director of a baseball league, emailed Burton (and another City employee) and requested that the City do something to prevent foul baseballs from flying into overgrown underbrush near the City\u2019s \u201cNova Field 5\u201d ballfield. Stockhammer suggested the installation of netting to cure the problem. Burton responded by email on July 25 that he would be glad to include the request for netting in the next year\u2019s fiscal budget and forward the underbrush issue to Public Works for a work order. Another constituent copied on the emails, Doug Wigley (\u201cWigley\u201d), responded to Burton\u2019s email and stated that the underbrush was a maintenance issue that should be addressed. Burton responded that he would work order the task to Public Works and grounds maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Later on July 25, John \u201cRick\u201d Boehm (\u201cBoehm\u201d), a member of the RAB whom Burton copied on his email to Wigley, added his thoughts to the discussion. In an email to Burton, Stockhammer, Wigley, the City Commission, the City Manager and Assistant Manager, and numerous other citizens, Boehm referred to the prior emails between Burton and Stockhammer, criticized the City for under-funding recreation projects and neglecting its sports facilities, and specifically stated that the City\u2019s \u201cfacilities [we]ren\u2019t what they should be.\u201d Boehm directly expanded on Burton\u2019s original response to Stockhammer that no funding was available to refurbish Nova Field 5 within the next five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Concerned about Boehm\u2019s email, City Manager Isaac Turner (\u201cTurner\u201d), Assistant City Manager Ted MacLeod (\u201cMacLeod\u201d), and Burton met on July 26 to discuss maintenance of the athletic fields. At the meeting, Turner also expressed anger about Burton\u2019s failure to complete the requested recommendation on the Ormond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>Crossings park. That same day, City Commissioner Bill Partington (\u201cParting-ton\u201d) emailed Turner, suggested that Turner fire Burton, and requested Turner\u2019s permission to respond to Boehm\u2019s email, to which Turner agreed. On July 27, Partington emailed everyone who had received Boehm\u2019s email and suggested that Burton was responsible for the City\u2019s mishandling of the funding and maintenance issues that Boehm had raised. Partington also felt that Burton had the authority to address Stockhammer\u2019s concerns and failed to do so, instead giving a citizen \u201cthe run-around from staff.\u201d Burton\u2019s response to Stockhammer caused Partington to \u201close faith in the abilities of the current leadership in leisure services.\u201d Lastly, Parting-ton concluded that \u201ca strong re-organization is in order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">On July 29, Burton sent a lengthy responsive email to Partington, the other City Commissioners, Turner, Boehm, Stockhammer, and the other individuals copied on Partington\u2019s email. Burton sent the email because \u201che believed he needed to explain the Leisure Services organization and how it worked; how the City government worked; and how the City actually operated; ... and to explain how [he] was attempting to improve the system.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9). The email criticized the City\u2019s organizational structure and management and, according to Burton, covered many topics both pertaining to and outside his job function.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The email pointedly noted a \u201cqualitative managerial difference\u201d between Leisure Services and Public Works. Burton mentioned that he was passed over for several promotions, criticized City Manager Turner\u2019s performance, and raised the notion that Turner had violated the Florida Sunshine Laws. Burton added that Turner failed to support him as Leisure Services Director and this might be Burton\u2019s only chance to speak on the subject as his \u201copinion ha[d] been muzzled and intimidated by the current City Manager.\u201d Burton also stated that Turner\u2019s request of Burton to provide the Ormond Crossings recommendation eliminated public participation, betrayed other professionals, and made Burton feel dishonest. Describing Nova Field 5 as \u201cdisgraceful and unsafe and nearly unplayable,\u201d Burton advised that he had shared his concerns with the City Manager but that \u201cplanning for a safe and playable field did not make it on the funded list.\u201d Burton concluded the email by stating that the requested work on Nova Field 5 was being performed that day, and that he agreed with a structural re-organization of the entire park and recreation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">After discussing Burton\u2019s email, Turner and MacLeod placed Burton on paid administrative leave. The City terminated him on August 1, 2005, and the termination letter stated only that Burton was an \u201cat-will\u201d employee who could be terminated at any time. Alleging that he was fired for exercising his First Amendment right to freedom of speech on matters of public concern in the July 29, 2005 email, Burton sued the City under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 for retaliation. In denying the City\u2019s summary judgment motion, the district court found that Burton\u2019s speech addressed a matter of public concern but that a genuine factual issue remained as to whether Burton spoke as a \u201ccitizen\u201d or as a \u201cpublic employee\u201d in the email to Partington.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">At trial, Burton testified that the email was a \u201cpersonal email\u201d expressing his belief in a unified park system regardless of who was in charge, that he was trying to improve the system, and that he mentioned Turner\u2019s possible Sunshine Law violation because it disturbed him. Concluding that Burton failed to present sufficient evidence that he spoke as a citizen and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>as a public employee, the district court granted the City\u2019s mid-trial motion for a directed verdict, from which Burton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a \u201cmotion for judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo, </em>considering only the evidence that may properly be considered and the reasonable inferences drawn from it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Rossbach v. City of Miami, </em>371 F.3d 1354, 1356 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). \u201cWhere no legally sufficient evidentiary basis exists for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, judgment as a matter of law is proper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">\u201c[W]hen public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.\u201d <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 1960, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). Following <em>Garcetti, </em>we \u201cmodified the analysis of the first step ... for analyzing alleged government employer retaliation to determine if an employee\u2019s speech has constitutional protection by deciding at the outset (1) if the government employee spoke as an employee or citizen and (2) if the speech addressed an issue relating to the mission of the government employer or a matter of public concern.\u201d <em>Boyce v. Andrew, </em>510 F.3d 1333, 1342 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (citation and footnote omitted). Whether an employee spoke as a citizen is a question of law for the court. <em>See id. </em>at 1343 (\u201cA court must ... discern the purpose of the employee\u2019s speech.\u201d); <em>Battle v. Bd. of Regents for the St. of Ga., </em>468 F.3d 755, 760 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern is a threshold legal question); <em>Morris v. Crow, </em>117 F.3d 449, 455 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\"><em>Garcetti </em>instructs that the inquiry into whether an employee spoke as a citizen \u201cis a practical one.\u201d <em>Boyce, </em>510 F.3d at 1342 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We consider whether the public employee was acting as a government agent at the time of the speech, and whether the speech \u201cowes its existence to a public employee\u2019s professional responsibilities.\u201d <em>Garcetti, </em>547 U.S. at 421, 126 S.Ct. at 1960. Essential is whether Burton made his statements to the Commissioner in the capacity of a citizen who did not work for the government. <em>See Akins v. Fulton County, Ga., </em>278 Fed.Appx. 964, 970-71 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (discussing <em>Garcetti\u2019s </em>distinction between public employee and citizen).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Although Burton invites us to provide a framework for defining the scope of an employee\u2019s professional duties, no \u201cserious debate\u201d exists here about the genesis of Burton\u2019s email. The form and context in which Burton responded shows that he sent the email for only one reason: to defend what he perceived as Commissioner Partington\u2019s attack on Burton\u2019s job performance as Leisure Services Director. Partington\u2019s email neither required nor prohibited a response from Burton. Both shocked and hurt by Partington\u2019s criticism, and wanting to inform Partington about how he had been trying to improve the system, Burton chose to defend himself against an expression of displeasure with Burton\u2019s handling of an issue directly within his job responsibilities. The thrust of Burton\u2019s email was that Burton had been unfairly criticized for the work he had done in his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>Indeed, the first paragraph of Burton\u2019s email to Partington addresses head-on Stockhammer\u2019s inquiry about Nova Field 5 and the work order Burton issued to Public Works. Burton also discusses the work being completed on several fields \u201cas I write\u201d and his personal observation of such work \u2014 all responses to allegations of his deficient job performance. Throughout, Burton refers to himself as \u201cyour park and recreation professional\u201d and closes the email by signing \u201cH. Alan Burton, Certified Park and Recreation Professional.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Ex. 4). Burton also mentions Ormond Crossings and the \u201cprofessional opinion\u201d that was asked of him regarding this project. It is clear that Burton intended to defend his performance directly to Commissioner Partington and the people with whom Burton worked, including the RAB members.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Burton\u2019s email also systematically explains how Leisure Services operates within the City\u2019s internal structure and system of how athletic fields are maintained. He disagrees with the budgeting process, the organization of the City\u2019s departments, and his perceived unfair treatment by the City Manager. And most of these issues Burton had raised internally for many years in his official capacity. We also agree with the district court that Burton\u2019s copying of people outside City employment is unpersuasive, as they were not included on his original email chain and his response was clearly directed toward City leadership.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Lastly, it is clear that Turner\u2019s possible Sunshine Law violation was not the impetus for Burton\u2019s email. Admittedly, Burton responded to Stockhammer, Wigley, and Boehm in his capacity as Leisure Services Director, and the subjects of those emails were part of Burton\u2019s official duties. Those emails triggered Partington\u2019s attack on Burton\u2019s job performance, which Burton defended. We therefore agree with the district court that Burton failed to produce sufficient evidence that he spoke as a \u201ccitizen\u201d and not a \u201cpublic employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
