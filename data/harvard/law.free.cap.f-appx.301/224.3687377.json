For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">Bullard appeals his conviction for distribution of a heroin-cocaine mixture (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)), possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k)), and possession of a firearm by a felon (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1)). Bullard was convicted following an investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the Wilmington, North Carolina Police Department (Wilmington Police).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">On May 13, 2005, Brian King, a confidential informant (Cl) working for the ATF and the Wilmington Police, called Bullard and inquired about purchasing a gun from him. Bullard told King he would get him a gun. A few days later, King called Bullard again, this time asking to purchase heroin along with the gun. On May 17, 2005, King and Bullard arranged a meeting that occurred later that day. While sitting in a green Honda Accord, Bullard sold King a .38 caliber revolver with an obliterated serial number for $250 along with what has later determined to be .7 grams of a heroin-cocaine mixture $100. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Near the end of the transaction, a Wilmington Police detective drove by the car and recognized Bullard, who had dreadlocks, from a picture he had viewed earlier that day. On July 25, 2005, King picked Bullard out of a photo array as the person who sold him the drugs and the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">At trial, the defense rested without presenting evidence and renewed its motion for acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. The District Court granted the motion with respect to Count II of the indictment, possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)). The jury convicted Bullard of the three remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the prosecution sought two sentence enhancements. The first was a four-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense, under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). The basis for the requested enhancement was Bullard\u2019s possession and sale of a firearm while he possessed and sold the heroin-cocaine mixture to the CL The defense argued that this enhancement was not applicable because it was based on the same evidence as Count II of the indictment, which the court dismissed under Rule 29. The second was a two-level enhancement for possession of between three and seven firearms, under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A), based on Bullard\u2019s possession, two months after his sale of contraband to the Cl, of three firearms seized from a Jeep Grand Cherokee to which Bullard held the ignition key. The defense argued that the Government had presented insufficient evidence of Bullard\u2019s possession of those firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The District Court found for the Government on both enhancements. It sentenced Bullard to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count I (distribution), 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count III (obliterated serial number), and 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count IV (felony gun possession), to be served concurrently, followed by 3 years of supervised release. Bullard now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">A. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">At sentencing, the Government bears the burden of proving the facts necessary to show that enhancements are warranted by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001). We review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)). In the sentencing context, this standard is \u201ccomplex and nuanced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While \u201cintended to accommodate a range of discretion,\u201d it includes consideration of \u201cwhether the sentence was guided by the Sentencing Guidelines and by the provisions of \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Unreasonableness depends not on whether we agree with a particular sentence, <em>see United States v. Newsom, </em>428 F.3d 685, 686-87 (7th Cir.2005), but rather \u201cwhether the sentence was selected pursuant to a reasoned process in accordance with law ... and [ ] effected a fair and just result,\u201d <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 456. An error of law or fact can make a sentence unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Hummer, </em>916 F.2d 186, 192 (4th Cir.1990)). To this end, purely legal questions are reviewed <em>de novo </em>and purely factual questions for clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">We review the denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal <em>de novo. United States v. Aterre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 693 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>(4th Cir.2005). A guilty verdict will be sustained if, \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, it is supported by \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996)) (en banc). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cevidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In 2005, the United States Sentencing Guidelines provided for a four-level enhancement to the defendant\u2019s offense level if \u201cthe defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2005). To apply this enhancement, the Government must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant possessed or used a gun and that the possession or use was in connection with another felony offense. <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001). The \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement is explained as \u201cfacilitating], or halving] the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) cmt. n. 14(a) (2005); <em>see also United States v. Blount, </em>337 F.3d 404, 411 (4th Cir.2003). It does not include situations where the presence of a firearm is simply accidental or coincidental. <em>United States v. Lipford, </em>203 F.3d 259, 266 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Bullard has conceded that he possessed or used a gun when he sold it to the CL Before us is the question of whether the District Court properly determined that Bullard possessed or used that weapon \u201cin connection with\u201d his sale of the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Bullard argues that, under <em>Blount, </em>337 F.3d at 411, the gun he sold to the Cl did not \u201cfacilitate\u201d the distribution of drugs. Blount was convicted for a burglary during which he stole a revolver and ammunition. <em>Id. </em>In affirming his sentence, this Court agreed that the Government had not shown that the revolver facilitated or had a tendency to facilitate the burglary. <em>Id. </em>There was no evidence that the defendant used the stolen weapon to intimidate occupants of the home or that he prepared for the burglary by carrying a firearm, thus Blount\u2019s possession of the gun was merely \u201cspontaneous or coincidental\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lipford, </em>203 F.3d at 266).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Bullard also cites <em>Lipford, </em>explaining that the gun was not present to \u201cembolden\u201d or to \u201cprotect\u201d him. 203 F.3d at 266. In <em>Lipford, </em>the Court explained that the phrase \u201cin relation to\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), which is synonymous with \u201cin connection with,\u201d <em>see Blount, </em>337 F.3d at 411, <em>Garnett, </em>243 F.3d at 828-29, could refer to a transaction in which a drug dealer sold a gun along with drugs. 203 F.3d at 267. In order to encourage a \u201cdrug seller to take the risks inherent in selling contraband,\u201d we stated, a drug purchaser \u201ccan often \u2018sweeten the pot,\u2019 offering to purchase not only drugs, but other illegal goods as well .... [w]here that other illegal good is a firearm, [its] involvement in the drug transaction is not \u2018spontaneous\u2019 or \u2018co-incidental;\u2019 ... [it] facilitates the drug transaction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">The situation presented here is nearly identical to that in <em>Lipford. </em>In fact, Bullard\u2019s firearm appears to have played an even more important role because it constituted a larger portion of Bullard\u2019s sale. In <em>Lipford, </em>the defendant was paid $100 for one gun and more than $1390 for 34.5 grams of crack over the course of three transactions. 203 F.3d at 263-64. Here, Bullard made a single sale, the gun was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the original item that the Cl sought to purchase, and Bullard received $250 for the gun and $100 for the drugs. For these reasons, the District Court could properly find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Bullard\u2019s sale of the gun constituted \u201cuse [] or possession] of a firearm in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The Government also sought and received a two-level enhancement in offense level under United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A). This guideline provides for an enhancement if the offense involved between three and seven firearms. The \u201coffense\u201d includes \u201cthe offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">At sentencing, the Government submitted that the firearms found in the Jeep Grand Cherokee two months after Bullard\u2019s transaction with the Cl was \u201crelevant\u201d to the offenses that led to Bullard\u2019s conviction. The District Court agreed and also found that Bullard possessed those guns and that there were three firearms in the Jeep. Bullard challenges only the determination that he \u201cpossessed\u201d the guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u201cPossession\u201d can be actual or constructive. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>124 F.3d 607, 610 (4th Cir.1997). Actual possession is physical control over property, while constructive possession exists if a defendant \u201cexercised, or had the power to exercise, dominion and control over the item.\u201d <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 878 (4th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>United States v. Laughman, </em>618 F.2d 1067, 1077 (4th Cir.1980)). Constructive possession need not be exclusive and can be proven by circumstantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>The Government has never argued that Bullard had actual possession of the firearms. Thus, the issue before this Court is whether the District Court properly found that Bullard constructively possessed the firearms in the Jeep.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">We applied the \u201cdominion and control\u201d test for constructive possession in <em>United States v. Zandi, </em>769 F.2d 229, 235 (4th Cir.1985), finding that a defendant with actual possession of shipping documents had constructive possession of the contraband being shipped because the documents provided the ability to exert control over the package. We also quoted with approval <em>United States v. Martorano, </em>709 F.2d 863 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 993, 104 S.Ct. 486, 78 L.Ed.2d 682 (1983), in which the Third Circuit held that the defendant constructively possessed drugs contained in a van to which he possessed keys to its front doors and to a padlock on its rear doors. <em>Zandi, </em>769 F.2d at 234 (citing <em>Martorano, </em>709 F.2d at 866).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">We again addressed this standard in <em>United States v. Blue, </em>957 F.2d 106 (4th Cir.1992), where we held that the Government did not present sufficient evidence of \u201cdominion and control\u201d for the jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant constructively possessed a certain gun. <em>Id. </em>at 108. The Government\u2019s only evidence in this case was the testimony of a police officer who pulled over a car because its occupants were not wearing seat-belts. The officer stated that he found a loaded .38 under the seat in which the defendant, a passenger, was sitting and that, when he approached the vehicle, he had seen Blue \u201cdip\u201d his shoulder as if reaching under the seat with his right hand. <em>Id. </em>at 107. In finding this evidence insufficient, we noted that the weapon was hidden under the seat, the car did not belong to Blue, and \u201cno evidence indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>that Blue had ever been in that car before.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">A number of factual and legal differences between these cases lead us to find that <em>Blue </em>is not applicable here. First, the standard of proof applied to sentencing enhancements is a preponderance of the evidence; <em>Blue </em>was decided under the beyond a reasonable doubt standard applicable at trial. Second, at least one gun in the Jeep to which Bullard held the ignition key was in plain view, as was a magazine for an assault rifle; in <em>Blue, </em>the gun was hidden under a seat. Finally, Bullard had actual possession of the Jeep\u2019s ignition key, while Blue was merely a passenger in the car. Finally, we expressly noted that the facts in <em>Blue </em>\u201cfall outside, but just barely, the realm of the quantum of evidence necessary to support a finding of constructive possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The District Court could properly find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Bullard constructively possessed the firearms seized from the Jeep. The court applied the correct legal standards and made no clear errors in its factual findings. Relying on the cases addressing the \u201cdominion and control\u201d standard, it could properly conclude that Bullard\u2019s possession of the ignition key to the Jeep gave him \u201cdominion and control\u201d over the Jeep\u2019s contents.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Bullard argues that the sentence imposed by the District Court does not serve the purposes set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and is, in any event, greater than necessary to serve those purposes. He also argues that a sentence of 175 months for distribution of .7 grams of a heroin-cocaine mixture is so disproportionate as to be unreasonable. In support of these arguments, Bullard notes that he was more of a drug user than seller, that he had provided care for his grandfather, who was afflicted with Alzheimer\u2019s, and that he is the father of a young child for whom he has paid child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">The sentencing purposes identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) to (D) are \u201cthe four foundational purposes of sentencing ... punishment, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>United States v. Shortt, </em>485 F.3d 243, 248-49 (4th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). \u201cThe proper application of \u00a7 3553(a) [ ] requires a sentencing court to focus on the four purposes of sentencing ... and ... the seven factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249. \u201cA sentence that fails to fulfill the purposes cannot be saved, even if it is supported by consideration of the six other factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">The District Court stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Bullard\u2019s sentence. It also considered Bullard\u2019s care for his grandfather, his drug abuse problem, and his minor child. Finally, it recommended an intensive drug treatment program and vocational training on supervised release, and declined to impose a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">The Court notes that Bullard\u2019s assertion that he was sentenced to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment for selling .7 grams of heroin and cocaine is misleading. Bullard\u2019s sentence reflected a number of infractions, including constructive possession of several guns, the sale of drugs and of a firearm, and actual possession of a gun with an obliterated serial number. Bullard also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>has an extensive criminal history that illustrates his potential for recidivist behavior. Moreover, under the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 grouping principles, the guideline that applied to Bullard was tied to his gun conviction, not the drug distribution; his drug trafficking merely enhanced his sentence by four levels. For all of these reasons, Bullard\u2019s sentence was not disproportionate to his crime. The District Court appropriately considered \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and selected a sentence that serves the statute\u2019s stated purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Bullard claims the district court improperly denied his Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal because the Government did not present sufficient evidence to prove that he was the person who sold the contraband to the Cl. Bullard submits that because the Cl had not met him before the sale occurred and because neither of the law enforcement officers who identified him actually saw Bullard engage in the sale of contraband, the testimony of these witnesses is insufficient to identify Bullard as the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Bullard\u2019s argument in favor of his Rule 29 motion on the counts for which he was convicted has no merit. The Cl picked Bullard out of a photo lineup and identified him in court as the man who sold him the contraband on May 17, 2005. A Wilmington Police detective testified that he saw Bullard, whom he recognized from a photograph, in the driver\u2019s seat of the green Honda Accord as the transaction was concluding. This officer also identified Bullard in court and stated that he had seen Bullard driving the Honda two months later. We need not address the remainder of the Government\u2019s evidence, given the overwhelming sufficiency of the above. The jury had sufficient evidence from which to identify Bullard as the guilty party and to find him guilty of the charges presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\"> While actual possession of the ignition key of an automobile containing contraband is sufficient in the context of sentencing enhancements, we take no position on whether it would be sufficient to satisfy the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard applied at a criminal trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
