This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp; </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). Following the district court\u2019s order, Bonner filed a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3), in which he asserted that, upon remand, the Bureau of Prisons had erroneously rejected his renewed application for nunc pro tunc designation. However, the district court has yet to issue a final order in regard to this renewed claim. Accordingly, because a final order has not been entered, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
