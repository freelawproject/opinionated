The appellant-plaintiffs brief offers no meaningful challenge to the district court\u2019s memorandum in support of its grant of summary judgment. He has raised no genuine issue as to any material fact, and therefore the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-13\">. Appellant's brief on appeal appears only to challenge the rulings made under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>Further, he leaves unchallenged the appellee's argument that his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 claim is jurisdictionally defective. In any case, we need not parse these issues because none could disturb our disposition of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
