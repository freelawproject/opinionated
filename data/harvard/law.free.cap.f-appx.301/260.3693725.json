He was sentenced to 236 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, he argues that he was entitled to a jury determination on the issue of whether his prior felony convictions were violent felonies for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2006). He argues that enhancement of his sentence under the ACCA violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-21\">Umberger\u2019s argument is foreclosed by the precedent of both the Supreme Court and this court. <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1600, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (in construing prior convictions as violent felonies for purposes of the ACCA, the court engages in \u201cstatutory interpretation, not judicial fact finding\u201d); <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (the Constitution does not require that prior convictions be alleged in an indictment or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt in order to be the basis of a sentence enhancement); <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349 (4th Cir.2005) (accord). Accordingly, we affirm Umberger\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
