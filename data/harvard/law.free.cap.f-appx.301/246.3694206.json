Appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether Moon\u2019s sentence is reasonable, but concluding there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Moon has filed a pro se supplemental brief challenging his armed career criminal designation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">This court will affirm a sentence imposed by the district court if it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). The court reviews Moon\u2019s sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 590,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-19\">The first step in this review requires the court to ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as improperly calculating the guideline range. <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>514 F.3d 377, 387 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2525, 171 L.Ed.2d 805 (2008). The court then considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. We may presume that a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding our presumption of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-23\">In imposing the sentence, the district court considered the properly calculated advisory guideline range and the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006). Because Moon had three or more prior convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d and/or \u201cserious drug offense\u201d committed on occasions different from one another, he was an armed career criminal subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment under \u00a7 924(e) and <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.4 (2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the 180-month sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-24\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>peal. We therefore affirm Moon\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Moon, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Moon requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Moon.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-14\">. The Government elected not to file a brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-15\">. We have considered Moon\u2019s pro se challenge to the armed career criminal designation and find that his unsupported and conclusory allegations fail to establish the invalidity of his prior convictions. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>977 F.2d 105, 109 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
