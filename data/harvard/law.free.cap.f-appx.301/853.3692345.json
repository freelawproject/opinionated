Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002) (explaining that we generally will not consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal \u201cwhere the district court did not entertain the claim nor develop a factual record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-14\">Valecillo also argues that his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable. He asserts that the district court incorrectly calculated his Guidelines range and that the court did not consider the section 3553(a) factors in the light of his specific circumstances as an uneducated and impoverished first-time offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-15\">We review Valecillo\u2019s sentence for reasonableness in the light of the factors set out in section 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir.2005). And we evaluate the reasonableness of a sentence using a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-18\">Briefly stated, under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history, and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence to provide adequate deterrence, respect for the law, and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>parities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a)(l)-(7). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United, States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">In fashioning a reasonable sentence, the district court must consult and correctly calculate the recommended Guidelines range. <em>United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297 (11th Cir.2007). Here, Valecillo argues that the court erred in denying him a minor-role reduction and, thus, incorrectly calculated the Guidelines range. But a prior panel of this Court determined that the district court did not clearly err in denying Valecillo a minor-role reduction. <em>See United States v. Vallecillo, </em>170 Fed.Appx. 621 (11th Cir.2006) (unpub.). Thus, the law-of-the-case doctrine precludes us from considering this argument. Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, the parties may not relitigate, and we may not reconsider, issues that were decided in an earlier appeal of the same case. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>429 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.2005). The law-of-the-case doctrine may be overcome when substantially different evidence is produced, controlling authority has changed, or the prior decision was clearly erroneous and application of it would result in manifest injustice. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 830 (11th Cir.2007). None of these exceptions apply here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">We conclude that Valecillo\u2019s sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable. The district court correctly calculated Valecillo\u2019s advisory Guidelines range at 135 to 168 months and sentenced him to the low point of that range. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (noting that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable\u201d). In addition, Valecillo\u2019s 135-month sentence is well below the statutory maximum life sentence he could have received. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii); <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246 (comparing, as one indication of reasonableness, the actual prison term imposed against the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">And the district court referenced the facts of Valecillo\u2019s case and many of the section 3553(a) factors when explaining why a sentence of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment was appropriate, including the sentences of his codefendants, the large amount of cocaine on the boat, and the history and characteristics of Valecillo. Valecillo also stipulated that he was to be paid $20,000 for driving the go-fast boat. The district court\u2019s statement of reasons was sufficient.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (a lengthy explanation is not necessarily required when a judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>decides to follow the Guidelines in a particular case, especially where a sentencing judge has listened to the arguments of the parties, considered the supporting evidence, and was aware of the special conditions of the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Based on the factors outlined in section 3553(a) and our review of the record, we conclude that Valecillo has not carried his burden of showing that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-11\">. Now codified at 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70503(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-12\">. We previously vacated Valecillo\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing because the district court applied the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). After Valecillo was resentenced, his lawyer failed to file an appeal; and Valecillo filed a successful 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate to gain the instant out-of-time appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-20\">. Valecillo also faults his lawyer for failing to preserve for appellate review a reasonableness challenge to his sentence; but this argument is moot because, as noted below, we review Valecillo\u2019s sentence for reasonableness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b879-6\">. We note that, to the extent the district court considered Valecillo's argument for a minor-role reduction on resentencing, it seems to have violated this Court\u2019s mandate, which ordered only that Valecillo be resentenced under advisory Guidelines in the light of <em>Booker. See United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996) (explaining that the mandate rule obligates district courts to adhere to the dictates of the appellate court\u2019s opinion and not assert jurisdiction over matters that are outside the scope of the mandate).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b879-11\">. We conclude that the district court's explanation also satisfied 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1), which requires district courts to state in open court the reasons for imposing a sentence at a particular point in the Guidelines range when that range exceeds 24 months; and we reject Valecillo\u2019s argument to the contrary. <em>See United States v. Parrado, </em>911 F.2d 1567, 1572-73 (11th Cir.1990) (explaining that no specific language is required when stating the reasons for a sentence under section 3553(c)(1); instead, a district court simply must demonstrate that it was \u201cmindful\u201d of the appropriate factors when imposing sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
