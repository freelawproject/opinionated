Lynch does not dispute the procedural correctness of his sentence, but he argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the offenses in his criminal record overstate the violence of his actual conduct and the sentencing court failed to consider his abuse as a child; his history of mental problems, attempted suicide, and substance abuse. Lynch contends that his sentence is excessive because it does not address his need for psychological treatment rather than punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-22\">The sentencing court cited Lynch\u2019s recidivism, his repeated use of threats of violence, the danger posed by his commission of violent crimes while under the influence of drugs, and his failure to accept or seek help with his problems. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court sentenced Lynch at the mid-range of correctly calculated Sentencing Guidelines. The sentence is procedurally reasonable and we accord it a presumption of substantive reasonableness. <em>See Gall v.
