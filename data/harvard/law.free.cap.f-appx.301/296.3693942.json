Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court sufficiently considered the statutory factors in imposing a sentence within the statutory maximum set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2006), and the advisory sentencing guideline range of eighteen to twenty-four months. We therefore find that the sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release is not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006) (providing standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.
