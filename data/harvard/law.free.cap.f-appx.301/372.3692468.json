He argues that the district court erred when it applied a two-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), for using his vehicle as a deadly weapon in an attempt to evade arrest and a six-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c), for assaulting a police officer with his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">Hernandez-Conde asserts that his vehicle cannot be considered a dangerous weapon, because he did not use it with the intent to commit bodily injury. Similarly, he contends that he did not commit aggravated assault, because he did not act with a specific intent to injure and did not create a substantial risk of serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">According to testimony, Border Patrol Agent Adam Roy Ruiz pursued Hernandez-Conde\u2019s vehicle into an orange grove, where Hernandez-Conde came to a complete stop against a tree. When Hernandez-Conde opened the driver\u2019s side door, it appeared that he was either surrendering or preparing to escape on foot, so Ruiz parked his vehicle behind HernandezConde\u2019s, unbuckled his safety belt, and opened the door. As Ruiz was about to exit the vehicle, Hernandez-Conde quickly closed his door, backed up, and intentionally struck Ruiz\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-17\">The impact was hard enough that Ruiz felt the vehicle move backward. In addition, although Ruiz\u2019s vehicle received only minimal damage, Hernandez-Conde\u2019s suffered a smashed-in trunk and tail light. Hernandez then continued to lead officials on a chase through two communities, during which Hernandez-Conde drove recklessly, even attempting to \u201cT-bone\u201d a police cruiser and trying to swerve into Ruiz\u2019s vehicle for a second time. The chase ended only after Hernandez-Conde lost control of his vehicle and became stuck in a ditch. Ruiz believed that Hernandez-Conde deliberately used his vehicle to intimidate officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>After reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of those facts to the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo, </em>we conclude that the court did not clearly err in applying either enhancement. <em>United States v. Charon, </em>442 F.3d 881, 887 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 915, 127 S.Ct. 260, 166 L.Ed.2d 202 (2006). The intent to commit bodily injury can be inferred, and a vehicle can be a dangerous weapon when used to strike another vehicle. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>131 F.3d 1136, 1137-39 (5th Cir. 1997); <em>United States v. Perez, </em>897 F.2d 751, 753 (5th Cir.1990). We have upheld the application of an enhancement for assaulting an official even where the defendant narrowly missed striking a patrol car. <em>United States v. Gillyard, </em>261 F.3d 506, 510 (5th Cir.2001). Also, although Ruiz was not injured, Hernandez-Conde\u2019s action in unnecessarily striking the vehicle created a substantial risk of bodily harm. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Moreover, the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) generally bears sufficient indicia of reliability to be considered as evidence during a sentencing hearing. <em>United States v. Roush, </em>466 F.3d 380, 387 (5th Cir.2006). The defendant bears the burden of showing that the PSR\u2019s findings cannot be relied on because they are unreliable, inaccurate, or materially untrue. <em>United States v. Londono, </em>285 F.3d 348, 354 (5th Cir.2002). In the PSR, the probation officer found that Hernandez-Conde used his vehicle as a dangerous weapon when he \u201cstopped and assaulted the agent by intentionally striking the agent\u2019s vehicle with his vehicle.\u201d Hernandez presents no convincing evidence that the probation officer\u2019s finding was unreliable or materially untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
