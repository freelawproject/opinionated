In 1986, McKenzie was convicted by a jury in New York of criminal possession of marijuana in the fourth degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree. The Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) alleged McKenzie was removable because of his 1986 marijuana possession conviction. McKenzie filed an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), which the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) pretermitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-13\">The IJ ordered McKenzie removed based on his marijuana conviction. McKenzie petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeal\u2019s (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from the IJ\u2019s removal order. After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part McKenzie\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">A. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">Because McKenzie is a removable alien based on his controlled substance offense, we do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final removal order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C); <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272-73 (11th Cir.2002). However, we retain jurisdiction to review any substantial, colorable constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(c)(2)(C), (D), INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), (D); <em>Oguejiofor v. Att\u2019y Gen. of U.S., </em>277 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">The following issues McKenzie raises do not present a constitutional claim or a question of law, but instead challenge the BIA\u2019s discretionary decisions, and we lack jurisdiction to review them: (1) whether McKenzie would have received \u00a7 212(c) relief (had his application not been pretermitted) or \u00a7 212(h) relief (had he been allowed to apply); and (2) whether to reopen McKenzie\u2019s removal proceedings to permit McKenzie to apply for \u00a7 212(h) relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-21\">Although we lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary aspect of McKenzie\u2019s request for \u00a7 212(c) relief, we retain jurisdiction to review the legal question of whether McKenzie\u2019s 1986 marijuana possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>conviction rendered him ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">B. McKenzie\u2019s Eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">1. <em>Section 212(c) Waiver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Under \u00a7 212(c), the Attorney General has the discretion to waive an alien\u2019s inadmissible status if the alien is a lawful permanent resident who has lived continuously in the United States for seven years. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1996), INA \u00a7 212(c). Although \u00a7 212(c) originally provided for a waiver of exclusion for aliens who had gone abroad temporarily, the provision was \u201cextended to provide relief from deportation orders as well.\u201d <em>Asencio v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 614, 616 (11th Cir.1994). However, the \u00a7 212(c) waiver is available to removable lawful permanent residents only to the extent the grounds for removal are analogous to grounds for exclusion under INA \u00a7 212(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">In 1996, Congress eliminated \u00a7 212(c) relief for aliens convicted of certain disqualifying offenses, including controlled substance offenses. <em>See </em>Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 440(d), 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). Later that same year, Congress repealed \u00a7 212(c) altogether and replaced it with a new procedure called \u201ccancellation of removal.\u201d <em>See </em>Illegal Immigration Removal and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-208, Div. C Title III \u00a7 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009-597. However, the Supreme Court concluded in <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2293, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), that the provisions of AEDPA and IIRIRA eliminating \u00a7 212(c) relief could not apply retroactively to aliens who were eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time they pled guilty to a disqualifying offense. Thus, despite AEDPA and IIRIRA, aliens who pled guilty before \u00a7 212(c) was repealed may still apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief. In <em>Alexandre v. United States Attorney General, </em>we stated that, although an alien who pled guilty prior to the repeal of \u00a7 212(e) still could seek \u00a7 212(c) relief, \u201c\u00a7 212(c) relief is not available to aliens who were convicted after a trial instead of on a guilty plea.\u201d 452 F.3d 1204,1207 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">2. <em>McKenzie\u2019s \u00a7 212(c) Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">In his removal proceedings, McKenzie admitted the charges against him in the NTA and originally sought cancellation of removal. McKenzie submitted the judgment for his 1986 convictions, which showed that he was found guilty by a jury of criminal possession of marijuana in the fourth degree and of criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree and was sentenced to three years of probation. The IJ exercised her discretion and denied McKenzie\u2019s application for cancellation of removal. The BIA concluded that the IJ had not erred and dismissed McKenzie\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">McKenzie filed a motion to reopen his proceedings, arguing he should be allowed to apply for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver. The BIA granted McKenzie\u2019s motion, noting that McKenzie had been convicted after pleading guilty before AEDPA\u2019s enactment and that, although his application was untimely, he should be given \u201can opportunity to apply for relief under section 212(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">In the reopened proceedings, the government moved to pretermit McKenzie\u2019s application because his 1986 marijuana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>conviction was by a jury, not based on a guilty plea. McKenzie submitted a certificate of disposition indicating that his 1986 marijuana conviction was the result of a guilty plea. However, McKenzie admitted at the hearing that he was convicted following a jury trial. The IJ granted the government\u2019s motion to pretermit McKenzie\u2019s \u00a7 212(c) application.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">On appeal to the BIA, McKenzie conceded that the certificate of disposition was erroneous and admitted that he had been convicted by a jury. However, he argued that his jury conviction did not preclude him from \u00a7 212(c) relief for various reasons. McKenzie also filed a \u201cmotion to remand,\u201d arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that he should be allowed to pursue \u00a7 212(h) relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">The BIA dismissed McKenzie\u2019s appeal. The BIA noted that McKenzie did not deny being convicted by a jury and concluded, therefore, that McKenzie\u2019s conviction did not fall within the ambit of <em>St. Cyr </em>and rendered him ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. The BIA also denied McKenzie\u2019s motion to remand, which it construed as a motion to reopen. The BIA found that McKenzie could have, but did not, apply for \u00a7 212(h) relief when his proceedings were reopened and that McKenzie did not properly assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as to the failure to timely seek \u00a7 212(h) relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">3. <em>McKenzie\u2019s Petition for Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"AcW\">McKenzie does not dispute that his marijuana conviction is based on a jury trial and not a guilty plea. Therefore, under our <em>Alexandre </em>precedent, the IJ and the BIA did not err in concluding that McKenzie is ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">McKenzie makes several arguments as to why he nonetheless should be considered eligible, all of which lack merit. For example, Alexandre\u2019s binding effect forecloses McKenzie\u2019s argument that the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) had an impermissible retroactive effect under the Supreme Court\u2019s two-step retroactivity analysis in <em>Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., </em>511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994). In <em>Alexandre, </em>we concluded that the retroactivity rationale of <em>St. Cyr </em>did not apply to aliens who had been convicted by a jury. <em>Alexandre, </em>452 F.3d at 1207. We are bound by <em>Alexandre </em>unless it is overruled by the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc. See Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 860 n. 3 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">C. Section 212(h) Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">McKenzie argues that the IJ erred when she failed to rule on his eligibility for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver. However, McKenzie never gave the IJ a reason to rule on McKenzie\u2019s \u00a7 212(h) eligibility. The record shows that McKenzie only mentioned \u00a7 212(h) in passing during the hearing on his \u00a7 212(c) application and did not state an intent to apply for such relief at that time. McKenzie first expressed a desire to apply for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver on appeal to the BIA when he asked the BIA to reopen his proceedings to permit him to file a \u00a7 212(h) application.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the IJ did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>err in failing to rule on McKenzie\u2019s eligibility for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-11\">. McKenzie does raise two constitutional claims, but they are not substantial, non-frivolous claims, and thus we lack jurisdiction to review them, too.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b941-9\">. This statement is not dictum given that the <em>Alexandre </em>court concluded that the petitioner was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because, in<em>ter alia, </em>he had proceeded to trial and was convicted by a jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b942-7\">. Section 212(h) permits the Attorney General, in his discretion, to waive inadmissibility if the controlled substance offense is \u201ca single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana\u201d and the applicant meets other criteria. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), INA \u00a7 212(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b942-8\">. We review only the BIA's decision \"except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ's opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b942-15\">. Similarly, we reject as meritless McKenzie\u2019s claim that the BIA concluded that he was ineligible for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver. The BIA concluded only that McKenzie's proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>should not be reopened to permit him to apply for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver (because he could have applied earlier, but did not), not that he was ineligible for such a relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
