Kennedy argues that the district court erred by imposing the sentences to run consecutively for a total sentence of 188 months of imprisonment. He contends that the imposition of consecutive sentences violates the spirit of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584, the purposes of the Guidelines, and the policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. He asserts that because his counts were grouped together under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>and his 164-month sentence for count one was adequate to achieve the total punishment, his sentence for count two should have been imposed to run concurrently with the 164-month sentence, as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(c). Kennedy does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of the applicable sentencing range, nor does he argue that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Where, as here, the defendant fails to object to his sentence during sentencing, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). To establish plain error, Kennedy must show: (1) that there is an error; (2) that the error is clear or obvious; and (3) that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these factors are established, the decision to correct the forfeited error is within this court\u2019s sound discretion, which will not be exercised unless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 736,113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Kennedy has failed to demonstrate that any error was clear or obvious. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770. He has also failed to demonstrate with sufficient or reasonable probability that if not for the district court\u2019s misapplication of the Guidelines he would have received a lesser sentence. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 364-65 (5th Cir.2005). Kennedy has therefore failed to demonstrate that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734-35,113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
