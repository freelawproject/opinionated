INS, </em>975 F.2d 1157, 1160 (5th Cir.1992). Under the substantial evidence standard, this court will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe applicant has the burden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-18\">The evidence does not compel a conclusion that Fernandes suffered past persecution on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion or that it is more likely than not that he will suffer such persecution if he is returned to India. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)\u00a9; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(i); <em>Tamara-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 343, 348-50 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 304 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.1997). Further, Fernandes cannot meet the more demanding standard for withholding of removal given that he cannot satisfy the standard for asylum. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). As to relief under the CAT, Fernandes failed to challenge in his petition the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he was not eligible for relief under the CAT. Accordingly, the issue is waived. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 n. 10 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-19\">Fernandes also challenges the BIA\u2019s application of its summary affirmance procedures to his case, arguing that his appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>did not satisfy the requirements for employing that procedure enumerated in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). The IJ\u2019s decision met the criteria for summary affirmance pursuant to \u00a7 1003.1(e). The petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
