Petitioner contends that he is not subject to removal because he derives United States citizenship from his biological father. He also contends that video-telephonic removal hearings and an inaccurate INS 1-213 form violated his right to due process. Because no reversible error exists, we deny the petition. We dismiss Petitioner\u2019s due-process claims because he has not exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">In 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) served Petitioner with a notice to appear, alleging that he was removable under Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(2)(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(h), and INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(ih), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(hi). Petitioner, who DHS believed to be a citizen of Panama, had been convicted of two or more crimes of moral turpitude: sexual offense against a minor \u2014 an aggravated felony \u2014 and embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">At his removal hearing, Petitioner \u2014 incarcerated at the time \u2014 appeared <em>pro se </em>via a video-telephone and argued that he satisfied U.S. citizenship requirements under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403(b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> INA \u00a7 303(b), because (1) his father was a U.S. citizen who served in the U.S. military, and (2) his mother was a U.S. citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">The IJ found that Petitioner was born in Col\u00f3n, Panama, in 1962,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that he immigrated to the United States in 1966. He also found that Petitioner\u2019s mother was a permanent U.S. resident \u2014 not a United States citizen. In addition, the IJ discerned that Petitioner alleged only that his <em>stepfather </em>was a U.S. citizen and government employee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the IJ explained that citizenship could not be derived from a stepparent, Petitioner claimed \u2014 without offering record evidence \u2014 that his biological father, Daniel Cecenia, was also a U.S. citizen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Yet by his own admission, Petitioner never met his biological father, who never legitimized Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-14\">Because Petitioner could not show derivative citizenship, the IJ found him a native and citizen of Panama ineligible to apply for cancellation of removal because he had been convicted of two crimes of moral turpitude. Finding no relief under the Convention Against Torture, the IJ ordered Petitioner removed to Panama.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>On appeal to the BIA, Petitioner for the first time argued that his biological father worked for the U.S. Navy; he offered nothing more than his own testimony to support the claim. The BIA, finding no evidence establishing Petitioner\u2019s U.S. citizenship and declaring the record \u201cvoid of evidence regarding [Petitioner\u2019s] biological father,\u201d dismissed the appeal. Petitioner now seeks review of the BIA\u2019s final order affirming the IJ\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">We do not have jurisdiction to \u201creview any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in ... \u00a7 1227(a) (2)(A) (iii) ... or \u00a7 1227(a) (2)(A)(ii)8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). But to the extent that a removal order is based on a legal question of nationality, we review it <em>de novo. See Sebastian-Soler v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>409 F.3d 1280, 1283 (11th Cir.2005). Where, as here, a petitioner claims that he is no alien, we look to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(A): a court of appeals \u201cshall\u201d decide a nationality claim where the pleadings and affidavits present \u201cno genuine issue of material fact.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">In reviewing a claim of U.S. citizenship, we must be mindful that \u201cthe burden is on the alien applicant to show his eligibility for citizenship in every respect\u201d and that \u201cdoubts should be resolved in favor of the United States and against the claimant.\u201d <em>Berenyi v. Dist. Dir., INS, </em>385 U.S. 630, 637, 87 S.Ct. 666, 17 L.Ed.2d 656 (1967) (internal citation omitted). And \u201cspeculation does not create a <em>genuine </em>issue of fact.\u201d <em>Cordoba v. Dillard\u2019s, Inc., </em>419 F.3d 1169, 1181 (11th Cir.2005) (internal citation omitted) (reviewing entry of summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">Here, Petitioner baldy asserts derivative citizenship pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403(b), INA \u00a7 303(b). Yet he proffers no evidence (1) that his father was a U.S. citizen, or (2) that his father was employed by the U.S. government at the time of Petitioner\u2019s birth.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, Petitioner admits that he has never met his biological father. Petitioner has failed to carry the burden of proving citizenship; no genuine issue of material fact exists. We agree with the IJ and the BIA: the record establishes that Petitioner is a native and citizen of Panama. Therefore, we deny Petitioner\u2019s petition to review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">Finally, Petitioner claims that his due-process rights were violated by video-telephonic hearings and by a \u201cmisleading\u201d INS form. We lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal unless \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), including appeals to the BIA. <em>See Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2003). Because Petitioner did not raise either of his due-process claims on appeal to the BIA, we dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-7\">. Under \u00a7 1403(b), \"Any person born in the Republic of Panama on or after February 26, 1904 ... whose father or mother or both at ' the time of the birth of such person was or is a citizen of the United States employed by the Government of the United States or by the Panama Railroad Company ... is declared to be a citizen of the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b930-9\">. The IJ incorrectly stated that Col\u00f3n is part of the Panama Canal Zone; it is part of the Republic of Panama. <em>See </em>Hay-Bunau Varilla Treaty art. II, Nov. 18, 1903, U.S.-Panama, 33 Stat. 2234.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b930-15\">. Not realizing that Petitioner claimed citizenship through his stepfather, the IJ initially found that Petitioner was a U.S. citizen; the IJ corrected the misunderstanding upon further review. Thus, Petitioner's later contention that the IJ found Petitioner to be a U.S. citizen is unavailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b930-16\">. Indeed, when interviewed by an immigration agent and when writing a letter to the IJ, Petitioner\u2019s mother did not even suggest that Petitioner\u2019s biological father was a U.S. citizen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b931-8\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B) requires a court of appeals to transfer the proceeding to a district court if a genuine issue of material fact exists.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b931-9\">. Petitioner's scant evidence is distinguished from that in <em>Agosto v. INS, </em>436 U.S. 748, 98 S.Ct. 2081, 56 L.Ed.2d 677 (1978) (testimony of three witnesses, including adoptive parents, contributed to genuine issue of material fact regarding nationality). Here, even Petitioner\u2019s mother does not corroborate his story.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
