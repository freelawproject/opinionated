Tenorio has not shown that the district court erred by concluding that his claims, which arose from events that occurred prior to sentencing, attacked the validity of his conviction and sentence and therefore that the petition was properly construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990). He also has failed to demonstrate that he should be permitted to proceed with his \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), as he has not shown that his claims are based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court case which establishes that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
