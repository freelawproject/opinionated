This issue was not raised below and is hence reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Although the district court imposed a sentence that was substantially higher than the guidelines range, it properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and was not prohibited from determining that, in the instant case, the guidelines did not adequately reflect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 809-11 &amp; n. 55 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, Bravo has failed to show that the district plainly erred in sentencing him above the guideline range of imprisonment. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594, 596-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">While conceding that the argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent, <em>see United States v. Mejiar-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2954, 171 L.Ed.2d 884 (2008), Bravo asserts that the district court erred in failing to provide him with notice before imposing his above-guidelines sentence. The Supreme Court has rejected this argument. <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2202-04, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Bravo also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pinedar-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
