At the new trial in the Superior Court before <em>Sherman, </em>J., it appeared that one Moody Merrill, a director and officer of the Franklin Park Land Improvement Company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>absconded late in May or early in June of 1893, and that immediately upon his departure it was discovered that he had embezzled nearly $100,000 of the funds of that company, the result of which was that the market price of the stock immediately fell and the stock could not be sold; that the plaintiff from the time of the discovery of the defendant\u2019s alleged fraud did his best to sell his stock, but was unable to do so at more than $3 a share, at which price he sold it after bringing this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-5\">The plaintiff among other requests asked the judge to rule, \u201c That it is of no consequence so far as the defendant\u2019s liability is concerned that an outside intervening cause has been the sole or contributing cause of the decline in price to which the plaintiff\u2019s loss is due.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-6\">The- judge refused this and other rulings requested by the plaintiff, and instructed \"the jury, among other things, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-7\">\u201c If you find the fair market value of that stock was always above what it was fictitiously quoted, or equal to it, and that it was so on the 25th of March, 1893, and remained so and would have remained so, except for the embezzlement and absconding of Moody -Merrill, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-8\">\u201c If you find that Moody Merrill\u2019s going away did destroy the value of the stock, practically destroy its value, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover anything.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-9\">\u201c You may take all the evidence on this subject, the fact of what Moody Merrill did, and what effect it had upon the market value of this stock, and if that destroyed the market value, then, as I have told you, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover anything.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqM3\">The parties and the court seem to have assumed that the evidence was such as to warrant a verdict for the plaintiff under the law stated at the previous decision in this case, reported in 179 Mass. 295, if the diminution in the selling price of the stock came from common causes. The defendant\u2019s contention is that the embezzlement of an officer of a corporation, being an unlawful act of a third person, should be treated as a new and independent cause of the loss, not contemplated by the defendant, for which he is not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">To create a liability, it never is necessary that a wrongdoer should contemplate the particulars of the injury from his wrongful act, nor the precise way in which the damages will be inflicted. He need not even expect that damage will result at all, if he does that which is unlawful and which involves a risk of injury. An embezzler is criminally liable, notwithstanding that he expects to return the money appropriated after having .used it. If the defendant fraudulently induced the plaintiff to refrain from selling his stock when he was about to sell it, he did him a wrong, and a natural consequence of the wrong for which he was liable was the possibility of loss from diminution in the value of the stock, from any one of numerous causes. Most, if not all, of the causes which would be likely to affect the value of the stock, would be acts of third persons, or at least conditions for which neither the plaintiff nor the defendant would be primarily responsible. Acts of the officers, honest or dishonest, in the management of the corporation, would be among the most com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>mon causes of a change in value. The defendant, if he fraudulently induced the plaintiff to keep his stock, took' the risk of all such changes. The loss to the plaintiff from the fraud is as direct and proximate, if he was induced to hold his stock until an embezzlement was discovered, as if the value had been diminished by a fire which destroyed a large part of the property of the corporation, or by the unexpected bankruptcy of a debtor who owed the corporation a large sum. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant would be presumed to have contemplated all the particulars of the risk of diminution in value for which the defendant made himself liable by his fraudulent representations. It would be unjust to the plaintiff in such a case, and impracticable, to enter upon an inquiry as to the cause of the fall in value, if the plaintiff suffered from the fall wholly by reason of the defendant\u2019s fraud. The risk of a fall, from whatever cause, is presumed to have been contemplated by the defendant when he falsely and fraudulently induced the plaintiff to retain his stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We do not intimate that these circumstances, as well as others, may not properly be considered in determining whether the plaintiff was acting under the inducement of the fraudulent representations in continuing to hold the stock up to the time of the discovery of the embezzlement. The false representations may or may not have ceased to operate as an inducement as to the disposition of his stock before that time. Of course there can be no recovery, except for the direct results of the fraud. But if the case is so far established that the plaintiff, immediately upon the discovery of the embezzlement, was entitled to recover on the ground that he was then holding the stock in reliance upon the fraudulent statements, and if the great diminution in value came while he was so holding it, the fact that this diminution was brought about by the embezzlement of an officer leaves the plaintiff\u2019s right no less than if it had come from an ordinary loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
