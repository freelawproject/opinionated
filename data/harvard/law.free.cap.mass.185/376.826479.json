Child, late of Boston, praying that i.t might be decreed that Samuel G. Child at the time of his death had a vested interest in the trust created by article twelve of the will of James Guild, and that the sum of $7,500, being the proceeds of the sale of such interest, should be paid to the plaintiffs as executors under the will of Samuel G. Child; also that the plaintiffs might be released and discharged from the agreement and bond mentioned below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-6\">The case came on to be heard upon the bill and answer before <em>Morton, </em>J., who, at the request of the parties, reserved it for determination by the full court, such decree to be entered as equity and justice might require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-7\">The following facts appeared by the record :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-8\">James Guild by the twelfth article of his will devised and bequeathed the residue of his estate to trustees in trust (in the event which happened) to his wife for life, and then to \u201cpay over, transfer and convey \u201d the trust estate \u201c to and among such of my brother and sisters, Louisa Guild, Sarah Ann Chandler and Frederic Guild, and the children of my sister Mary D.

Child, the testator of the plaintiffs in the case at bar. Samuel G. Child died during the lifetime of the life tenant, unmarried and without issue. Franklin D. Child conveyed his interest to George F. Child. George F. Child, Mary L. E. Bush and Sophia C.

The sentence and limitation which were begun by the words \u201csuch of\u201d stand unfinished and incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">And finally it is plain that the mistake was either in the insertion of these words or in the omission of the description and limitation begun by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">The surviving children of Mary D. Child, who are the defendants here, ask us to hold that the mistake consists in omitting the rest of the sentence, and to correct the mistake by reading into this article of the will the words \u201c as survive my wife,\u201d or their equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">The leading case in this Commonwealth on supplying words in a will is <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Framingham Parish, </em>128 Mass. 370, which has been often cited and followed. J It is not the province of the court to conjecture what the intention of the testator would have been had the omission been called to Ifis attention. It is the more restricted duty of ascertaining his intention by construing the words which he has used and of supplying the words which the court finds necessary to express that intention fully. It cannot supply words to give effect to an intention which he has not expressed by the words used by him. In construing the particular words in question they are to be construed in the light of the will as a whole; see <em>Bradlee </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>137 Mass. 50, 53 ; <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Delano, </em>144 Mass. 95, 99 ; see also Lord Halsbury in <em>Inderwick </em>v. <em>Tatchell, </em>[1903] A. C. 120,122. Or, as it was well put by V. C. Page Wood in <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>3 Kay &amp; Johns. 206, 209, 210, cited and relied on by the defendants, words can be supplied only where it is plajn by necessary implication what the words to be supplied are. !</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>If we pass by the difficulty that it is no more than a conjecture whether the mistake in the case at bar consists in leaving in the words \u201c such of \u201d or in leaving out the dependent clause, and assume in favor of the defendants from the presence in the will of the words \u201c such of \u201d that the mistake consists in the omission of the dependent clause, it is a matter of conjecture what the omitted dependent clause is. It must be gathered from the gift over contained in the following sentence, the sentence with which the article ends, construed in the light of the rest of the will. This sentence makes provision for the brother or any of the sisters, or any of the children of the deceased sister Mary \u201cleaving children,\u201d in case they die either during the lifetime of the testator or during the continuance of the trust for the life tenant, and the provision made is that \u201c such children shall take the parent\u2019s share by right of representation.\u201d Judged by this sentence, the. omitted clause was to confine the provision made by it to the class consisting of the brother, the sisters, and the children of the deceased sister Mary who did not die leaving children; but there is nothing to indicate by necessary implication (to use the phrase used by Y. C. Page Wood) that the prior gift to the class above named was to such of that class as survived the duration of the trust for the life tenant, and did not include all of the class who survived the testator and who subsequently died leaving no children them surviving at the date of their several deaths. It is at least a matter of conjecture which of these two was the provision contained in the omitted clause, and for that reason no missing words can be supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Indeed if we were at liberty to indulge in conjectures of this kind, it is at least as probable that the omitted clause did include those surviving the testator and dying not leaving children at the date of their several deaths. The gift over is a gift to take effect in case the brother or any sister or any child of the deceased sister Mary should die \u201c in my lifetime, or before said trust shall terminate,\u201d and the omitted clause (following the lines of the following sentence containing the gift over) may well have been a clause which together with the words of the will gave the remainder to \u201c such of my brother and sisters and children of my deceased sister as shall have survived me and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>shall not die leaving children before the termination of the trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\">The case principally relied on by the defendants is <em>Donnell </em>v. <em>Newburyport Homoeopathic </em>Hospital, 179 Mass. 187. That is a case where there was a gift over by way of substitution, and the gift over was not commensurate with the previous gift; it was held that the gift over was to be cut down to fit the previous gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">A decree must be entered declaring that Samuel G. Child had a vested interest in the land described in the bill of complaint, and directing the $7,500, the proceeds of the sale of the interest of Samuel G. Child, to be transferred to the plaintiffs as executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
