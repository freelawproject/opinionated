Writ dated September 23, 1901.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-10\">At the trial in the Superior Court before Lawton, J., it appeared that the notice required by the statute was given to the defendant, and that the accident happened at half past one in the afternoon of August 13, 1901, while the plaintiff was working under the direction of one Murphy, who, it was agreed, was a superintendent within the meaning of the employers\u2019 liability act. 'For the purpose of setting poles the defendant used a low gear or wagon on which a derrick was placed. Attached to the derrick was a fall which was hooked to the pole to be set. The derrick was on the rear end of the wagon and the rope from the fall led through a block at the top of the derrick, thence through a snatch block fastened to the rear eiid of the wagon, and then was led forward and a pair of horses was attached to it, so that the horses could raise the pole to a sufficient height to be set in the ground. During the morning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the plaintiff had been working with a pike. After dinner, when the men started to work, the plaintiff took the pike which he had been using during the morning. Murphy, foreman of the gang, told the plaintiff to lay down the pike and get hold of the rope, which the plaintiff did. Murphy was standing on one side of the rope and told the plaintiff what to do, giving him the rope in his hand. The plaintiff testified \u201c He told me to pull down on the rope, take in the slack.\u201d The plaintiff was about two feet from the end of the wagon. He had not seen the snatch block until he was hurt. He took hold of the rope and pulled down. The plaintiff further testified \u201c Murphy hollered out to go ahead and I pulled down on the rope, and at the time he hollered to go ahead the horses gave a plunge and I was knocked against the end of the gear and another man knocked up against me. My hand was drawn into the block.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-4\">At the close of the evidence the judge refused to order a vei\u2019dict for the defendant. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,200; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-5\"><em>R. P. Borden, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-6\"><em>JE. </em>Higginson, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b101-7\">Barker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEv\">The plaintiff was stationed near a snatch block, and his duty was to help pull toward the block a rope which led from it to a telephone pole about to be raised. The power to be applied to raise the pole was that of a pair of horses which were at one end of a low wagon on which was a derrick. The snatch block was at the other end of the wagon. The plaintiff stood with his hands on the rope two feet or more from the block. When an order was given for the horses to go ahead the rope.was drawn through the block toward the wagon, thus tending to bring the hands which were grasping the rope toward the block. When the horses started the plaintiff and the man who was next him and also grasping the rope, but farther from the block than the plaintiff, held on to the rope, the man next the plaintiff was pulled against him and the plaintiff\u2019s hand was drawn into the block.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The plaintiff was forty years of age, and although he had not handled ropes before that occasion, the whole apparatus was open to view and its arrangement and operation were so plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>that he cannot be allowed to recover on the ground that he did not know that if he continued to grasp the rope after the horses started there was danger that his hand would be drawn into the block, or on the ground that it was the defendant\u2019s duty to explain to him that obvious danger and to warn him against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The plaintiff himself was negligent either in not seeing the block, or if he saw it, in not appreciating the danger, or if he appreciated it, in incurring it by continuing to grasp the rope after the giving of the order for the horses to go ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">If that order was too quickly given it nevertheless was an understood signal, and due care required that the plaintiff upon hearing it at once should let go of the rope.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
