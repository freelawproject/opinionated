Thereafter the plaintiff was allowed to amend his declaration, and did so. The defendant asked for no ruling on the amended declaration and stated in his opening to the jury that his only defence was on a question of fact. On this question the jury found for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions. <em>Held, </em>that the defence that the declaration as amended set forth no cause of action was not open to the defendant, and that his exceptions based on this ground were frivolous.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-11\">Contract, upon a guaranty in writing of a promissory note.

On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Pierce, </em>J. At the beginning of the trial,' the defendant asked the judge to rule that the declaration did not set forth any cause of action. The judge refused so to rule, and the defendant excepted. To an inquiry by the judge, in what respect the declaration was deemed insufficient, the defendant\u2019s counsel replied that it did not seem to him to set forth any cause of action, and at no time during the trial was any specific defect in the declaration called to the attention of the judge by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-13\">The plaintiff was allowed to amend his declaration, and did so.

On this question the jury found in favor of the plaintiff. In his brief the defendant contends that the declaration as amended sets forth no cause of action. We are of opinion that this defence is not open to him. The exceptions are frivolous, and are overruled, with double costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
