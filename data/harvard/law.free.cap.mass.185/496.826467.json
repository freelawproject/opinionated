Writ dated April 28, 1902.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>In the Superior Court the case was tried before Fox, J. The material facts which the jury would have been warranted in finding upon the evidence appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-3\">One George W. Miles, called as a witness by the plaintiff, testified, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, that he was an analytical and consulting chemist and made an examination of the upper part of the sling rope on May 25, 1903. He then was asked to state to the jury what he found there. To this the defendant objected on the ground that it was not competent or relevant to introduce the evidence of any chemist. The plaintiff then was recalled and testified that the rope had been kept in the pantry in his house from a day or two after the accident until a week before this trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-4\">The witness Miles then was recalled and the judge ruled that he might answer the question objected to, the defendant excepting. The witness testified, that the chemical condition of the rope would be practically the same at the time of his examination as on March 1, 1902, and, subject to an exception by the defendant, testified, \u201c that he found the rope had been wet with salt water, as it contained salt in various portions all through the rope and at its ends which came in contact with the iron ring which was rusted, which was shown up at the top by a chemical analysis; and that iron rust is well known to rot any vegetable fibre and that chemical action will do that.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then picked up a piece of rope, remarking, <em>\u201c </em>I notice this is one piece that has just dropped out from the rope. Now, will you state to the jury what the effect of iron or iron rust and salt water produces upon a manila rope such as that is ? \u201d To this the defendant objected and on the judge\u2019s ruling that the question was admissible excepted. The witness answered that any salt in the presence of moisture would cause iron to rust much more quickly than it would in fresh water, and that any iron forming oxide in the presence of fibre will rot the fibre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-5\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant requested the judge to rule that upon all the evidence the plaintiff could not recover and to order a verdict for the defendant. The judge refused to rule as requested and submitted the case to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $6,500; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The case was argued at the bar in January, 1904, before Hnowlton, C.

Upon such findings, the jury might properly come to the conclusion that the plaintiff, while in the exercise of due care, was injured by the failure of the defendant to see that due care was exercised to provide safe and proper appliances for its workmen, and, inasmuch as the risk of a failure to perform this duty was not on the plaintiff, they could properly hold the defendant answerable for the consequences. See <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>164 Mass. 42, 47; <em>Moynihan v. Hills Co. </em>146 Mass. 586 ; <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Cape Ann Anchor Works, </em>178 Mass. 485, 486; <em>Boucher </em>v. <em>Robeson Mills, </em>182 Mass. 500, 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The case differs materially from <em>Kilroy </em>v. <em>Foss, </em>161 Mass. 138, upon which as to the question of due care of the plaintiff the defendant strongly relies. In that case the plaintiff was caring for the tag rope at the end of a derrick boom used to guide the descending load to its place on the ground, and had room to keep clear of the load as it was lowered on to the ground. The load consisted of stone to be used in erecting a building, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>being unloaded from a cart by a hand derrick. It is stated in the bill of exceptions that the plaintiff testified that by means of the derrick boom and the tag rope \u201cone would be enabled to guide the stone at a distance and stand away from it while it was suspended from the derrick boom; that he knew these were the purposes for which the tag rope was used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In the case at bar it was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to place the pump on the deck of the lighter as it was hoisted over the side of the wharf and lowered on to the deck by men other than his crew. The jury were warranted in finding that neither the plaintiff nor any of his crew had anything to do with shackling on the sling, hoisting the pump or lowering it on to the deck. Their \"duty was confined to placing it as it was lowered. One of his crew, George Y. Ashland, called as a witness by the defendant, was tending the forward guy on the pump as it was lowered away to the deck, and he was told by the plaintiff not to \u201c slack it too much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The pump had to be turned so as to be fore and aft with the lighter as it came over the side of the lighter, \u201c in order to lower the pump any more,\u201d and the plaintiff was turning it when \u201c the sling broke, and he found himself underneath the pump.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The plaintiff had to put his hands on the pump. He was not tending the tag rope of a derrick boom. The wharf gang had not hitched on a guy by which the plaintiff could turn the pump. He had to take hold of the pump. There is no direct evidence that he was under the pump farther than was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The pump was coming over the side of the wharf and was being lowered on to the deck. The plaintiff was on the deck. He was necessarily lower than the pump. It does not appear that he got unnecessarily under it. \u201c He found himself underneath it \u201d after it fell. It may be that he was on the after end of the pump, and that Ashland had been keeping the forward guy taut and so had been keeping the pump from swinging forward, and that he slacked up and it swung aft over the plaintiff and fell on him. In the opinion of the majority of the court the questions of the due care of the plaintiff and the negligence of the defendant were properly left to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">No error in law was committed in the admission of the questions put to the expert Miles and of the answers thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
