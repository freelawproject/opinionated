She testified that she rang her bell, but it did not appear that the driver heard it, and there was no evidence that the driver knew of the plaintiff\u2019s presence until the accident happened or had any reason to suppose that she was trying to pass him. <em>Held, </em>that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant's servant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-9\">Tort for personal injuries alleged to have been received from being run over by a team negligently driven by a servant of the defendant: Writ dated October 10,19\u00d30.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-10\">At the trial in the Superior Court <em>Lawton, </em>J. at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-11\"><em>J.

The plaintiff, a girl of eighteen, who'was riding a bicycle and going in the same direction as the wagon, attempted to pass on the left between the wagon and the sidewalk, a distance of four or five feet. When she was opposite the middle of the wagon, it swerved or swayed towards her, and she was knocked off her bicycle and sustained the injuries complained of. She testified that she rang her bell; but it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>appear that the driver of the wagon heard it or gave any indication of having heard it, and there was no evidence that he knew of her presence until the accident happened, or had any reason to suppose that she was trying to pass him. There was therefore no evidence of his negligence, even if he turned the horses, a fact that does not clearly appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
