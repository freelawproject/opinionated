The plaintiffs requested the judge to rule and instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\u201c First. There is no evidence tending to show that the agreement was delivered by the defendant upon any condition other than that it was to be accepted within thirty days from the date thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-5\">\u201c Second. There is no evidence that the agreement was delivered to the plaintiffs with the understanding that it was not to be binding until the offer made was accepted by a certain number of the creditors of the Quincy Cycle Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-6\">\u201c Third. If the agreement was first signed by the defendant it became a valid contract as soon as signed by the plaintiffs and delivered to the attorney who was acting for the defendant in securing the signatures of the creditors of the Quincy Cycle Company, and at any time after the plaintiffs had signed the agreement, and within thirty days from the date thereof, the defendant had a right to demand from the plaintiffs an assignment of their claims against the Quincy Cycle Company upon tender to the plaintiffs of the notes set forth in the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-7\">\u201c Fourth. It is not open to the defendant to say as a matter of defence that the instrument was entered into upon the express condition that it should not be effective until the defendant should have secured the signatures of other creditors of the Quincy Cycle Company sufficient in number to control proceedings and composition in the insolvency of the Quincy Cycle Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-8\">\u201c Fifth. On all the evidence the verdict should be for the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-9\">The judge refused to make any of the rulings requested. In each case he submitted to the jury the following question: \u201c Did the defendant execute and deliver as a binding agreement the agreement declared upon ? \u201d The jury answered \u201c No.\u201d The jury found for the defendant; and the plaintiff in each case alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-10\"><em>C. H. Sprague, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-11\"><em>Z. S. Arnold </em>\u00bff* <em>W. Gr. A.

In the second case, the defendant in legal effect said to Mr. Herrick when the paper was handed to him: I intrust this paper to you, not as an offer on my part but as a paper which is to become an offer on my part when a specified number of creditors signify their intention of making me the offer stated in the body of the instrument, that is to say, of accepting my offer. Had the paper been sent by the defendant to the plaintiffs directly, enclosed in a letter written by the defendant, there would have been no opportunity for the mistake which has happened. But it was delivered to Mr. Herrick, and apparently through a misunderstanding this condition did not come to the knowledge of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We are of opinion that the judge was right in instructing the jury that such a condition in delivery could be shown by paroi.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">It is settled that a completed instrument may be shown by paroi to have been delivered on a condition which has not been performed. <em>Faunce </em>v. <em>State Assur. Co. </em>101 Mass. 279. <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>119 Mass. 383. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>17 C. B. 625. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Ingestre, </em>12 Q. B. 317. <em>Pym </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>6 El. &amp; Bl. 370. <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Littell, </em>11 C. B. (N. S.) 369. <em>Juilliard </em>v. <em>Chaffee, </em>92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>N. Y. 529, 535. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>52 N. Y. 570. <em>Sweet </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>7 R. I. 375. <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Cutts, </em>11 Maine, 440. <em>Coffman </em>v. <em>Coffman, </em>79 Va. 504. <em>Westman </em>v. <em>Krumweide, </em>30 Minn. 313. It is also settled that a defendant can show by paroi that his signature to what purports to be a perfected agreement was to take effect on its being signed by others, and that they have not signed. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>35 Miss. 457. <em>Goff </em>v. <em>Bankston, </em>35 Miss. 518. <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Loftin, </em>13 Ala. 547. In our opinion the case at bar comes within those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second contention is that the stipulation was meaningless and void because by reason of the provisions of Pub. Sts. c. 157, \u00a7\u00a7 40, 41, a unanimous election did not insure the appointment of an assignee, composition proceedings did not apply to insolvent corporations, St. 1884, c. 236, \u00a7 15, and the oath required for proof of claims would have prevented the defendant from proving claims acquired by him under this agreement. Pub. Sts. c. 157, \u00a7 29. We assume that all this is so, but it appears that at a previous meeting when the defendant made a similar statement as to the condition on which he was willing to agree to buy these claims, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney had told the defendant \u201c that such necessary proportion would be three fourths of the amount.\u201d What the words used by the defendant under these circumstances meant or might be found to mean was that the paper was not to take effect as an offer until \u201c three fourths in amount \u201d of the creditors had signified their assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs contend that Mr. Herrick did not assume to act for the plaintiffs and that he acted solely for the defendant, and that as the plaintiffs testified that they did not know of the condition <em>they </em>are not bound by it. The correctness of this conclusion is not in question here. The judge instructed the jury that Mr. Herrick was acting for the plaintiffs, and we are of opinion that he was right. Mr. Herrick had been retained by the plaintiffs, and on the suggestion being made that the defendant might buy up the claims of the creditors generally at the same interview \u201cthe defendant agreed to pay Mr. Herrick for his services in endeavoring to procure signatures of creditors, other than his two clients the plaintiff corporations.\u201d Under that arrangement, so far as the plaintiffs were concerned, he continued to act for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
