Such a case is exempted from the provisions of R. L. c. 75, \u00a7 108; and <em>semble, </em>that \u00a7 111 of the same chapter does not apply to it, but,-if it does, it provides only for fine or imprisonment and gives no remedy in equity.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-12\">Bill in equity, filed in the Supreme Judicial Court on June 18,1903, by the city of Cambridge, to restrain the defendant from carrying on the business of melting and rendering at its factory at 22 Portland Street in that city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-13\">The case came on to be heard before Morton, J., who, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>agreement of the parties, reserved it upon the bill and answer for determination by the full court, such orders and decrees to be entered as to the court should seem, just and fit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-3\">6r. <em>A.

The case comes before us on the bill and answer. From these it appears that when the bill was filed, the defendant was carrying on, and had carried on continuously since 1860, in Cambridge, without a license, the business of melting and rendering of grease and tallow, and making food for fowls from oyster and other sea shells; but that the defendant never killed horses, and never did any rendering of horses or other dead animals, and never had used or required in its business trucks or wagons for the removal of dead animals. There was a board of health in Cambridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The principal question is whether the court has original jurisdiction in the matter. The court undoubtedly has jurisdiction to restrain a nuisance, but there is nothing in this bill to show that the trade carried on by the defendant is a nuisance, or that the board of health, under the powers given it by law, has passed any general or special order applicable to the case, and the R. L. c. 75, \u00a7 141, do not apply. The court also has power, aside from its general jurisdiction, when such power is given it by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The plaintiff refers in its brief to the R. L. c. 75, \u00a7\u00a7 78, 110, but these sections confer jurisdiction upon the Superior Court, and have no reference to this court. Nor is there anything in the R. L. c. 159, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, which affects this case. Section 1 of this chapter gives to both courts \u201c original and concurrent jurisdiction in equity of all cases and matters of equity which are cognizable under the general principles of equity jurisprudence.\u201d Section 2 gives to the Supreme Judicial Court \u201c original and exclusive jurisdiction in equity of all cases and matters of equity which are cognizable under the provisions of any statute and are not within the jurisdiction conferred by the provisions of the preceding section, unless a different provision is made; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Superior Court shall have like original and exclusive, or like original and concurrent, jurisdiction only if the statute so provides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The case presented by the bill might come within the R. L. c. 75, \u00a7 108, and the jurisdiction would be in the Superior Court, under \u00a7 110, but for the provision in \u00a7 108, that \u201c the provisions of this section shall not apply to any building or premises which were occupied or used for said trades or occupations \u201d on May 8,1871.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The plaintiff further contends that the case comes within the R. L. c. 75, \u00a7 111, and that \u00a7 108 relates to places and \u00a7 111 to persons. But \u00a7 108 applies to persons as much as \u00a7 111. By its terms, \u201c Whoever occupies or uses a building for carrying on therein the business of slaughtering cattle, sheep or other animals, or for a melting or rendering establishment,\u201d etc. without first obtaining permission of certain boards named, shall pay a certain penalty. Then follows the provision already cited as to buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Section 111 is taken from the St. of 1901, c. 134, which began as follows: \u201c Any person, firm or corporation engaged or desiring to engage in the business of killing horses, or in the rendering of horses or other animals, shall . . . make application to the board of health of the city or town where the business is to be conducted, for a license to carry it on.\u201d The language of the first part of this section was changed by the joint special committee on the consolidating and arranging of the Public Statutes so as to read: \u201c A person, partnership or corporation engaged in or desiring to engage in the business of billing horses, or in the carrying on of a melting or rendering establishment \u201d etc., and in this form the Legislature enacted the law. It may well be doubted, however, whether any change in the law was contemplated either by the committee or the Legislature, or whether any change was in fact made. The rest of the section, which retains the language of the St. of 1901, shows that the section has no application to an establishment such as the defendant was carrying on, but was intended to apply to a melting and rendering establishment used in connection with dead horses or other large animals. Thus before granting a license, the board of health must be \u201c satisfied that the applicants have a suitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>building and plant in a situation approved by said board and that they have suitable trucks or wagons for the removal of dead animals.\u201d The board of health is also required to notify the board of cattle commissioners of the granting of any such license. The licensees are required to report to the board of cattle commissioners every animal received by them which is found to be infected with a contagious disease. There is also this further provision: \u201c No unlicensed person shall carry on the business of killing horses or of melting and rendering.\u201d It seems to us reasonably clear that \u201c melting and rendering \u201d refers to horses or other large animals whose bodies are received before they are dismembered, and that other kinds of melting and rendering were supposed to be covered by \u00a7 108. However this may be, the remedy provided for a violation of the section is a fine or imprisonment, and nothing is said as to any other judicial remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">As the plaintiff has not brought the case within the general equity jurisdiction of the court or within any statute giving this court jurisdiction, the order must be</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
