Gault against Robert McGrath, Samuel McGrath, and Joseph Lindsay, for the redemption of a mortgage for $4675, given by Samuel McGrath, on the 19th August 1847, to Robert McGrath, and subsequently assigned to Joseph Lindsay the other defendant, on real estate then owned by the said Samuel McGrath, afterwards sold by the sheriff on executions against him, under junior encumbrances, and purchased by the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-12\">The bill averred that the mortgage in question was not given to secure a loan of money, but as collateral security for certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>promissory notes of the mortgagee for the accommodation of the mortgagor, and that these had been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-5\">The answers admitted that the mortgage was given to secure the payment of notes loaned by the mortgagee to the mortgagor for his accommodation, <em>and the renewals of the said </em>notes, <em>from time to </em>time, <em>until they should all he paid ; </em>and averred that there were still outstanding and unpaid notes, given in renewal of the original ones, to the amount of $2962.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-6\">A replication was filed and much testimony taken, but the only question in the cause was, whether the outstanding notes, referred to in the defendants\u2019 answers, were renewals of the original notes, to secure which the mortgage was given. The nature of the evidence is fully set forth in the opinions delivered in the court below and in this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-7\">The complainant had, previously to the filing of this bill, taken various proceedings to contest the mortgage in question, both in the District Court and in the Common Pleas, all of which had resulted adversely to his position.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-8\">The court below dismissed the complainant\u2019s bill with costs, and the following opinion was delivered by Thompson, P. J.:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-9\">\u201c The plaintiff purchased certain property at sheriff\u2019s sale, with notice of the existence of a mortgage thereon, held by Robert McGrath, one of the defendants. He alleges in his bill that the said mortgage was given on the 19th day of August 1847, to secure the payment of certain promissory notes then loaned by the said Robert McGrath to Samuel McGrath; that a large part of it, if not all of said notes, has long since been paid, and that, to the extent of such payment, the debt secured by the mortgage has been discharged; and prays that an account be taken of the notes, for which said mortgage was given, and which were intended to be secured thereby, and that the amounts may be ascertained and declared. The defendants in their answers declare that the said mortgage was given to secure notes made by Robert for the accommodation of Samuel McGrath, and delivered to him at the date of the mortgage, and the renewal of the said notes, from time to time, until they should be all paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-10\">\u201c The evidence consists principally of the answers of the second defendant: these are very voluminous, but when sifted, present the single question, whether the notes therein mentioned were renewals of the original notes, to secure which the mortgage was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-11\">\u201c The notes in question are fully described in the answers, and are outstanding in the hands of different holders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-12\">\u201c It is unnecessary in determining the present application, to do more than to state the result of the evidence as it appears before us; it being admitted that, if the said notes are renewals of the original notes, the mortgage is a security to that amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-13\">\u201c The fact of the notes in question being renewals, depends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>chiefly upon the answers of Samuel and Robert McGrath; they both explicitly and positively assert that they were so. Robert McGrath declares that the existing notes were given by him to Samuel McGrath, in continuation of other notes which had been in like manner substituted in renewals for the other notes; that at the time when each new note was given, the note in place of wrhich it was given, was delivered up to him, and either destroyed or cancelled, and that no other notes were given under the security of the mortgage. He further asserts that Samuel McGrath kept the cancelled notes, and that a statement of them was entered upon his books; but that in consequence of a fire which consumed his store and its contents, the notes and books were destroyed, so that they could not be produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-6\">\u201c Samuel McGrath testifies to the same facts, and entirely corroborates the same statement by Robert.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-7\">\u201c One witness only, Mr. McCurdy, testifies to facts contradictory to the answers of the said defendants, but his uncorroborated testimony is not, according to the rule in equity, sufficient to countervail the answers. Other witnesses testify to matters which do not bear directly upon the question of the renewals of the notes, so that the question must be determined upon the answers of Robert and Samuel McGrath.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-8\">\u201c These defendants unequivocally assert, that the existing notes were given to supply the place of others, then returned and can-celled, and that they were in this manner a continuation of the notes first given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-9\">\u201c It is contended by the plaintiff, that the facts so proved, do not show that the notes were renewals. That in order to be renewals, they must precisely replace the original notes, both as to amount and time; and that the parties should be required to have paid the proceeds of each renewal into the hands of the holder of the note for which it was substituted. It appears, in the evidence, that Robert McGrath gave the notes to Samuel McGrath upon the receipt of the previous notes, without ascertaining in what manner the proceeds were applied; and that Samuel, at times, used such proceeds in his own business. This, it is contended, prevents the notes, so given, from being considered renewals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-10\">\u201c We know of no rule, however, which prevents a note from being renewed by another note having a longer time to run, or by one or more notes of less amount; nor does it seem necessary that the party who gives the new note or notes, upon the delivery to him of the old ones, should be able to show what became of such note after he had parted with it. It is enough, if it appears 'that no new note is out, but one which has been substituted for another returned and cancelled, and that the amount is strictly and in good faith within the sum covered by the existing security. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>answers referred to, which, on this point, are not overthrown by opposing testimony, we must regard as true. They clearly'affirm that the notes yet outstanding represent the portion of the original debt yet unpaid, for which the mortgage has, from its execution, been held as security. This position, the evidence produced by the plaintiff, has not shown to be untenable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-6\">\u201c The positive answers of the defendants require to be more than balanced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-7\">\u201c The evidence must preponderate in his favour, before the plaintiff can claim the action of the court in his behalf. There is in this case no peculiar equity. The plaintiff bought with a full knowledge of the existing mortgage, and although he is entitled to be relieved from any amount that has been paid upon the mortgage debt, he cannot discharge his property from the entire debt, without adequate proof.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-8\"><em>\u201c </em>This evidence he has sought from the defendants, and it has failed to establish the facts upon which the relief is claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-9\">\u201c The court cannot decree a satisfaction of the mortgage upon the payment of a less amount than the outstanding notes identified by the defendants in their answers show to be due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-10\"><em>\u201c Decree. </em>And now, May 15th 1858, this cause came on to be further heard upon the 27th day of March 1858, and the proofs and depositions having been read, and the several matters at issue debated by counsel, it was thereupon, upon consideration thereof, ordered, adjudged, and decreed, as follows: \u2014 That the injunction heretofore granted in this cause, and continued until further order, be dissolved, and the complainant\u2019s bill dismissed with costs, as against him; and it is further considered that the complainant and those claiming, or to claim, by, from, or under him as the tenants of the mortgaged premises, have no right to redeem the mortgage, except upon payment of the following amounts, which are secured thereby, viz., the sum of six hundred dollars, being the amount of a note due upon the 19th June 1851; the further sum of six hundred dollars, being the amount of a note due upon the 29th day of July, A.

This was effected by giving him his notes to the amount of $4675, in various sums, and at short dates. As it was intended to aid Samuel in his business,, it was necessary that the loan of his name should be continued; and this was to be effected by the issue of new notes, as the others fell due. The notes were given, to be used as Samuel thought proper; there being no stipulation that they should be discounted at any particular institution, or by any particular person. They formed, in fact, a part of Samuel\u2019s active capital, in his business as a tailor; and were, no doubt, used originally to pay for goods, or their proceeds were probably appropriated for such or similar purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">To secure' Robert McGrath, for the loan of his name in the shape of notes, Samuel, on the 19th November 1847, executed to him a bond for $9000, conditioned for the payment of $4675 with interest, in one year from the date thereof, accompanied by a mortgage of certain premises in the county of Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">This arrangement continued for several years, until Samuel Me Grath became embarrassed, and in November 1851, made an assignment; and all his books, notes, and papers, together with his bill-book, which contained an accurate account of all the said notes and renewals, were burned with his store, which was in Hart\u2019s Building, corner of Sixth and Chestnut streets, in the month of December in the same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Some payments were made by Robert McGrath on account of the renewed notes, and several were left outstanding in the hands of different persons, to whom he was responsible either as drawer or endorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The appellant, having purchased the mortgaged premises at sheriff\u2019s sale, under a subsequent judgment, filed his bill in the court below to redeem this mortgage, if anything was due, and to ascertain whether anything was due. The evidence on this subject is to be found in the answers of the mortgagee and mortgagor; and the allegation on the part of the appellant, the plaintiff below, is that nothing is due, because these payments were not made on notes covered by the mortgage, nor are the remaining notes secured by that instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">The construction placed upon the agreement of the parties is founded upon a strict interpretation of the word \u201crenewal.\u201d The appellant contends that, as the mortgage was to secure the original notes, which he asserts to have been at four months, and the renewals, it must be shown that the remaining notes\u2019 have been the regular successors of the original paper, continued from four months to four months, and each successive note applied to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>up its immediate predecessor; and several cases have been cited to support this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">It will be found on examination, that these cases are not applicable, and do not prove that such is the necessary rule of construction, even in renewals between debtors and creditors. \u201c Renewed,\u201d and of course \u201crenewal,\u201d \u201cis not a word of art; it has no legal or technical signification:\u201d Russell <em>v. </em>Phillips, 14 <em>Q. B. </em>900; 68 <em>Eng. C. L. </em>\u201c Renew,\u201d says Webster, is \u201c to grant a new loan on a new note for the amount of a former one;\u201d \u201c Renewal,\u201d \u201c reloan on a new note given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">This applies clearly to the relation of creditor and debtor, and may call for a strict construction, when the debtor claims the benefit of an agreement which is to delay the person to whom he is indebted. This is clearly not the meaning of the word, when applied to the present case, where this relation did not exist, and where the transaction is simply a reloan of the name. It is distinctly sworn to by both these defendants, that these notes were the renewals of the original notes; that is, as we understand it, it was a continuing loan of credit through a series of years, forming but one transaction, and of course secured by the mortgage which was given for this very object.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">We are therefore of opinion that the decree below, the reasons for which are very clearly and forcibly stated by the president judge, is right, and must be affirmed. We believe this reaches the real justice of the case, as every tribunal before which it has been heard in various forms, has arrived at the same conclusion. The appellant suffers no other injury than that of not having made a successful speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
