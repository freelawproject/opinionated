Scott against Henry Magee, John A. Warner, and Jared Sandford, to recover the value of a horse attached by Sandford, as constable, by virtue of an attachment, in favour of Warner, against R. S. Montgomery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-8\">On the trial, the plaintiff proved the sale of the horse by J. W. Scott, to himself, and the taking pf it by Sandford. The defendants then gave evidence tending to prove that Montgomery had previously sold the horse to Warner. The plaintiff \u25a0 then offered in evidence a transcript from the docket of Joseph A. Magee, Esquire, a justice of the peace, to show that an action of trover had been brought by Warner against J. W. Scott &amp; Go., for this horse, which had been prosecuted to judgment, and damages recovered. There was proof of the justice\u2019s signature to the transcript.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-9\">The defendants objected to the admission of this transcript in evidence, but the court admitted the evidence, and sealed a bill of exceptions. And a verdict and judgment having been rendered for the plaintiff for $143, the defendants removed the cause to this court, and here assigned the same for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b539-10\"><em>B.

It is the duty of courts to reclaim them, alike from innovations, and the efflux of time. Rules of evidence are the avenues to truth, and they should be followed. They are none the less to be respected because venerable from age. We think a well settled rule was lost sight of in the present ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">For certain purposes, indicated by certain Acts of Assembly, transcripts of justices of the peace, merely certified to officially, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>are evidence. Outside of these purposes, not being records upon common law definitions, they must be differently authenticated, and something more is required than the justice\u2019s certificate. If the original docket be not produced, a sworn copy can only supply its place. This is the settled rule to be found in many eases. Among them are 13 <em>S. &amp; </em>R. 57; 14 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>441; 7 <em>Watts </em>189; 4 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>191; 10 <em>Barr </em>157. There was nothing in the -case in hand to mark it as an exception to the general rule, and the learned judge erred in admitting the transcript in evidence upon the certificate alone of the justice. We must not refrain from correcting the error, because it may be, that the original, will on another trial, be produced, or the rule of authentication indicated be complied with. If this be so, then the tests required by law will have been complied with, and no room for doubt as to the accuracy of the instrument, which always rests on insufficient authentication, will remain. We cannot doubt but that the assignment of error is sustained, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
