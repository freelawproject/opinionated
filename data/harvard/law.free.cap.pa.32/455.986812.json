Parkinson, in his own right, and as executor of George Parkinson, deceased, from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, distributing the proceeds of the real estate of the testator in his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-12\">George Parkinson died in 1842, and by his will devised and bequeathed his real and personal estate to his wife, for life, with power to sell, and re-invest the proceeds for the uses and purposes of his will; and directed his executors to make the necessary conveyances for that purpose. This power was never exercised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-13\">After the decease of his wife, the testator directed his residuary estate to be divided into fourteen equal parts; and two of them he gave, devised, and bequeathed to his daughter Jane, afterwards married to William H. Kern, her heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, for ever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-14\">The will contained a power to sell, in these words: \u2014 \u201c After the death of my wife, Eleanor Parkinson, in order the more effectually to enable my executors, hereinafter named, to make a division of my estate, as above directed, I do order and direct, authorize and empower them, my said executors, and the survivor of them, to grant, bargain, sell, and dispose of, either by public or private sale or sales, all my said real estate, and such other real estate as may have [been] purchased by my said wife and executors under the authority above expressed; and by proper deed or deeds, conveyances or assurances in the law, to grant, convey, and assure the same to the purchaser or purchasers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>thereof, his, her, or their heirs and assigns for ever, freed and discharged of and from all and every use and trust whatsoever, and without any liability on the part of the purchaser or purchasers, as to the application or distribution of the purchase-moneys therefor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-6\">Mrs. Jane Kern died without issue, during the lifetime of her mother; and after the death of the widow, the executor sold the real estate under the power in the will, and having filed his account, the court below referred it to an auditor to report distribution of the proceeds in his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-7\">Before the auditor, William H. Kern claimed his deceased wife\u2019s share-, as personalty; contending that there was an equitable conversion thereof by the terms of the will. The brothers and sisters of Mrs. Kern resisted this demand, and claimed the same as real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-8\">The auditor awarded the share in controversy to William H. Kern, as personal estate; and the Orphans\u2019 Court confirmed his report, whereupon the present appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-9\"><em>Fallon </em>and Serrill, for the appellant. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY8\">To impress upon realty the character of personal estate, there must be a direction to sell, accompanied with a positive and explicit intention to change the character of the estate: Bleight <em>v. </em>The Bank, 10 <em>Barr </em>132; Costen\u2019s Appeal, 1 <em>Harris </em>292; 1 <em>Jarman on Wills </em>523, note 1; Henry <em>v. </em>McCloskey, 9 <em>Watts </em>145; Nagle\u2019s Appeal, 1 <em>Harris </em>260. Here, the power to sell depended upon whether the widow should or should not have exercised the power vested in her. The direction to sell could only operate on such real estate as remained undisposed of at the death of the widow. The power given to the widow, being discretionary, could not work a conversion until exercised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-10\">But, in every case in which an equitable conversion has been established, it will be found, that in addition to a positive direction to sell, there was a distinct gift of the proceeds, as such, which is wanting in the present case. Thus, in Allison <em>v. </em>Wilson, 13 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>330, after directing a sale, the devise is: \u201cI do order and direct that the <em>moneys </em>arising out of such sales shall be divided,\u201d &amp;c. In Morrow <em>v. </em>Brenizer, 2 <em>Rawle </em>185, after directing a sale, the bequest was: \u201c And the <em>moneys' </em>arising therefrom to be equally divided,\u201d &amp;c. In Allison <em>v. </em>Kurtz, 2 <em>Watts </em>185, the land was to be sold, \u201c and the <em>price </em>thereof equally divided,\u201d &amp;c. In Hay <em>v. </em>Mayer, 8 <em>Watts </em>203, the devise was: \u201c The <em>money </em>arising from said sale shall, after the decease of my widow, be equally divided,\u201d &amp;c. So in Willing <em>v. </em>Peters, 7 <em>Barr </em>287, the direction was to sell: \u201cAnd the proceeds thereof shall be divided among said children.\u201d In Miller <em>v. </em>Meetch, 8 <em>Barr </em>417, direction to sell, and \u201c I will the proceeds thereof to be equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>divided among all <em>my </em>children.\u201d In Gray v. Smith, 3 <em>Watts </em>289, the legacies were given \u201c out of the proceeds.\u201d In Alexander <em>v. </em>McMurry, 8 <em>Watts </em>504: \u201cAll the moneys arising from such sales I do give and devise to be equally divided,\u201d &amp;c. In Simpson v. Kelso, 8 <em>Watts </em>252, the direction was to sell, and \u201c the purchase-money to be divided,\u201d &amp;c. Craig <em>v. </em>Leslie, 3 <em>Wheat. </em>568, was also a direction to sell, and a gift of the proceeds or money. In Martindale <em>v. </em>Warner, 3 <em>Harris </em>471, the bequest was: \u201c And the <em>money </em>arising from the sale of my said plantation I give and bequeath,\u201d &amp;c. Selfridge\u2019s Appeal, 9 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>55, was a direction to sell, and the proceeds to be divided among children, &amp;c. In Silverthorn v. McKinster, 2 <em>Jones </em>72, <em>purchase-money </em>was directed to be divided. In Brown &amp; Sterrett\u2019s Appeal, 3 <em>Casey </em>62, the devise was: \u201c I direct the above property to be sold, and the <em>proceeds </em>divided among my heirs,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-6\"><em>Gruillou, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaV\">cited Allison <em>v. </em>Wilson, 13 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>332; Craig <em>v. </em>Leslie, 3 <em>Wheat. </em>563; Morrow <em>v. </em>Brenizer, 2 <em>Rawle </em>185; Allison <em>v. </em>Kurtz, 2 <em>Watts </em>187; Burr <em>v. </em>Sim, 1 <em>Wh. </em>252; Hay <em>v. </em>Mayer, 8 <em>Watts </em>212; Alexander <em>v. </em>McMurry, <em>Id. </em>504; Simpson <em>v. </em>Kelso, <em>Id. </em>252; Selfridge\u2019s Appeal, 9 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>55; Silverthorn <em>v. </em>McKinster, 2 <em>Jones </em>72; Willing v.

Kern), her heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns for ever. He gave his wife power to sell and dispose of all or any part of his real estate during her life, and his executors were to make the necessary conveyances, and the money was to be invested as she thought best, which investments were to be held in trust by his executors for the uses and purposes of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">After the death of his wife the testator, \u201c in order more effectually,\u201d as he says, \u201c to enable my executors, hereinafter named, to make a division of my estate as above directed, I do <em>order </em>and <em>direct, </em>authorize and empower them, my said executors, and the survivor of them, to grant, bargain, sell, and dispose of, either by public or private sale or sales, all my said real estate,\u201d &amp;c., and to convey the same to the purchasers, freed and discharged of and from all and every use and trust whatsoever; and without any lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>bility, on the part of the purchasers, as to the application or distribution of the purchase-money.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">By the power to sell, the estate, under our Act of Assembly, was vested in the executors, subject to the life estate of the widow: Brown &amp; Sterrett\u2019s Appeal, 3 <em>Casey </em>63. The descent was broken, and all that passed to the seven children of the testator was the respective equal shares in the proceeds of the real estate, which was thus turned into personalty. As regarded them, it was a conversion, out and out; Burr <em>v. </em>Sim, 1 <em>Wh. </em>263; and for the purposes of the will, it would be treated as if it had been personal estate at the time of the death of the testator; and Mrs. Jane Kern had the whole beneficial title in two fourteenths vested in her, subject to her mother\u2019s interest for life: Fletcher <em>v. </em>Ashburner, 1 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>534.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The court below were, therefore, right in awarding the share in controversy to Mr. Kern, and their decree is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
