The means employed in each particular instance, would have seemed to me immaterial, if the result were a transfer in trust, or a trust bottomed on a tra.nsfer; if, in short, the property ceased to be the debtor\u2019s, without vesting directly and absolutely in his creditors, and remained outstanding in the hands of a third person, who could not be compelled to render an account, or to fulfil the duties imposed upon him without a recourse to the aid of equity. In other words, had the question been still open, I should have thought that the law had said to the debtor \u2014 You may put your property in any form in which it can be seized, and applied to the payment of your debts, or you may give it to your creditors, because it will then go to pay your debts directly; but you shall not place it in a situation where it shall be neither yours nor theirs, where no execution can reach it, without submitting to those rules and restrictions which have been prescribed for the regulation of trusts of this description, and which would seem essential to prevent them from becoming a fraud upon creditors, instead of a benefit., It would necessarily follow, if this were conceded, that although a debtor might lease or hire the whole or any portion of his property, reserving a stipulated rent or compensation for its use to himself, and might even direct the payment of what was thus reserved to those to whom he was indebted, taking care to make it theirs absolutely, and avoiding the interposition of a trustee, he could not put such a reservation in the form of a trust, nor place the new interest which he had called into being, where it could not be seized by his creditors, without rendering it fraudulent as against them, and giving rise to the mischief which the statutes regulating trusts for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>the payment of debts were intended to obviate. The transfer of a rent in trust for creditors, would undoubtedly be viewed as an assignment for their benefit, and it would seem immaterial whether the reservation came first and the assignment subsequently, or whether both are the work of one and the same instant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-5\">\u201c These views are in a great measure sustained by the ease of Watson <em>v. </em>Bagaley, 2 <em>Jones </em>165, which decides, that a power of attorney to collect a debt and pay the proceeds over to a third person, to whom the donor of the power is indebted, will take effect as an assignment as soon as it is executed, and the debt collected, and will consequently be void, unless recorded within thirty days from the period of its execution; thus establishing, that although a power is not, and cannot be a grant or assignment, even when sustained by an interest, and consequently irrevocable (Hunt <em>v. </em>Rousmanier, 8 <em>Wheaton </em>174; Webb <em>v. </em>Walker, 7 <em>Gushing </em>46; Fuller <em>v. </em>Emerson, <em>Id. </em>205), a transfer from one man to another, is not the less an assignment when actually made, because a power has been employed as the means of making it. But the \u2022position thus taken was virtually abandoned in the subsequent case of Guy <em>v. </em>Mcllree, 2 <em>Gasey </em>92, and a fund resulting from the sale of the goods of a debtor, under a judgment confessed by him, in trust for his creditors, held to be insusceptible of an attachment, because the transfer to the garnishee had been effected through the means of a confession of judgment, which, it was said, was not and could not be an assignment; a reason which must be admitted to be undeniable, whatever may be thought of the conclusions deduced from it. It is indeed very plain, that a judgment cannot be in itself an assignment; the difficulty is to know in what respect a transfer through the means of a judgment and execution differs, when actually effected, from a transfer made in any other way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-6\">\u201c The decision thus made, seems to show that a transfer of property by a debtor, in trust for the payment of his debts, will not fall within the statutes which regulate assignments for the benefit of creditors, unless made in due form, and purporting <em>to be </em>an assignment, and that other modes of transfer are left open to the discretion of the parties, uncontrolled by any positive rule of law. I therefore concur with my brethren in thinking that we cannot view a hiring or letting as an assignment, consistently with the doctrine held in Guy <em>v. </em>Mcllree, because the rent is reserved in trust for the payment of the lessor\u2019s debts, and thus placed beyond the reach of an attachment by his creditors, without being directly vested in them. If it be said, that this opens a door for the evasion of the rules by which trusts for the benefit of creditors are regulated, that debtors may make long leases of their property, with a clause requiring the lessee to apply the accruing rent to the payment of debts in a prescribed order, and subject to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>conditions as the lease may impose ; I can only answer, that the objection applies with as much, if not more force, to a transfer effected through the means of a confession of judgment, followed by an execution, under which the whole of the debtor\u2019s property is turned into cash, and placed in the hands of a trustee, beyond the reach of his creditors. In construing a statute, the presumption should always be, that nothing has been left out, which is necessary to give it effect, but when the highest court has once declared judicially that such an omission exists, the gap cannot be supplied by inferior tribunals. The rule for a new trial is discharged, and judgment entered for the defendant on the point reserved.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\">To this the plaintiff excepted; and here assigned the same for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-6\"><em>Speahman </em>and <em>E. &gt;S. Miller, </em>for the plaintiff in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZR\">The instrument of the 26th March 1857, is clearly an assignment in trust for the benefit of creditors: Englebert <em>v. </em>Blanjot, 2 <em>Wh. </em>240; Watson <em>v. </em>Bagaley, 2 <em>Jones </em>167; Weed <em>v. </em>Jewett, 2 <em>Met. </em>608; Petch <em>v. </em>Tatem, 15 <em>M. &amp; W. </em>110; Calkins <em>v. </em>Lockwood, 16 <em>Conn. </em>276; 2 <em>Lead.

Because not recorded in the proper county; it ought to be recorded in this county, where the principal office is. The <em>situs </em>of a corporation, or its domicil, if it can so be called, is the locality in which its principal office is found. Otherwise, a road running through a dozen different counties, would be obliged to record its assignment, within thirty days, in each. (2.) It is void, because it contains a power of revocation: Whallon <em>v. </em>Scott, 10 <em>Watts </em>244; Riggs <em>v. </em>Murray, 2 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>565, 576; s. c. 15 <em>Johns. </em>371; Grover <em>v. </em>Wakeman, 11 <em>Wend. </em>187, 196; Sheerer <em>v. </em>Lautzerheizer, 6 <em>Watts </em>549.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-7\"><em>Gibbons </em>and <em>Lex, </em>for the defendants in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY_\">The paper is in no sense an assignment. It is an agreement within the protection of the Act 13th March 1847, <em>Brightly\u2019s Purd. </em>133, pl. 154. They also cited Chaffees <em>v. </em>Risk, 12 <em>Harris </em>432; Guy <em>v. </em>McIlree, 2 <em>Casey </em>92; Blakey\u2019s Appeal, 7 <em>Barr </em>449; Worman <em>v. </em>Wolfersberger\u2019s Executors, 7 <em>Harris </em>59; Ridgway <em>v. </em>Stewart, 4 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>383; Manufacturers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Bank of Pennsylvania, 7 <em>Id. </em>335. But even if held to be an assignment, it was properly recorded. The whole road and business operations of the company were in Northumberland county. It is true, there was an office in the city of Philadelphia, but that was merely for the meeting of the directors, who resided at different points; and they did not always meet even here. The collector and superintendent\u2019s office was in Northumberland, no freight was paid elsewhere, nor were tickets sold except in that county. As the <em>situs </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>of the road was in Northumberland county, the agreement, if necessary to be recorded at all, was properly recorded there.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b464-3\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b464-4\">Read, J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AGz\">If the court below had followed the inclination of their own judgment, they would have decided the principal point in this case correctly; but misinterpreting, as we think, the decision of this court in Guy <em>v. </em>McIlree, 2 <em>Casey </em>92, they have determined that the sixth clause in the agreement between the two railroad companies, is not an assignment in trust for the benefit of creditors. By this agreement, the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company are to run their cars and locomotives upon and work the road of the Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad Company \u2014 to receive the tolls and charges for the local and through trades \u2014 retain one-half of the earnings for themselves, and the remaining earnings (after deducting the expenses of maintaining the roadway), when received in cash, are by the said Philadelphia and- Sunbury Company assigned, transferred, appropriated, and shall be paid in manner following, viz., the said Sunbury and Erie Company shall first pay thereout unto Stephen Bittenbender seven thousand dollars with interest; next pay to Alfred R. Eisk eighteen hundred dollars with interest; and after payment thereof, pay over all other sums as they become due and payable to the Philadelphia and Sunbury Company, to Edward S. Whelen, in trust to pay, in their order the interest on three several mortgages of the said company; and, fourthly, if any surplus should remain after payment thereof, to pay the same to the said Philadelphia and Sunbury Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">We have here property, a trustee, a trust, and creditors of an insolvent company, who are to take under it; and the simple question is, whether by an ambiguous inversion of language, the real meaning of this instrument can be so covered as to defeat the operation of a most salutary law: Dufaur <em>v. </em>Professional Life Assurance Company, 4 <em>Jurist N. S. </em>841; 27 <em>L. J. Rep. Ch., </em>817. We think that the object of the framer of this clause has not been attained, and that it is a voluntary assignment, by the Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad Company, of a part of their estate, to the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, in trust for some of the creditors of the assignors.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">I am directed by a majority of the court (contrary to my own opinion) to say, that this assignment was recorded in <em>the proper </em>county, in which the assignor resided, within the meaning of the Act of Assembly. This therefore is an assignment for the benefit of all the creditors of the Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad Company, and protects those funds in the hands of its assignor from an attachment execution. The effect of this decision is, that the judgment of the court below is affirmed, although the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>for such affirmance differ from those assigned by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
