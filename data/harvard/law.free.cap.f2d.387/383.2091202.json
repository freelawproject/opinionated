S. Highway No. 301 in North Carolina, between a truck driven by and on their behalf and the truck owned and controlled by the defendants, respectively. Sustaining jurisdiction against the defendants\u2019 objection in one case, the District Court directed a verdict for them in both cases at the end of the plaintiffs\u2019 proof in chief. We affirm on jurisdiction, but reverse on the direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-23\">Assessing the testimony, we cannot conclude that reasonable jurors could not differ on the questions whether the evidence, ex facie, established the defendant driver not negligent, the plaintiffs\u2019\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>driver negligent, or both negligent. Fixing responsibility for the accident was, therefore, a resolution to be left to the jury upon the proof of all parties with apt, adjective instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The judgment now on review should be set aside, and a new trial ordered, by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
