After he obtained such an affidavit defendant again \u201crefused to honor\u201d its \u201cobligation\u201d. Plaintiff returned to the United States and sought to obtain payment from defendant or to effect a settlement, all without avail. The complaint then goes on to say that since returning to the United States plaintiff has had a recurrence of \u201cfoot involvement\u201d of the other foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Damages are sought in the amount of $25 weekly from March 7, 1965, \u201cuntil settlement\u201d, with interest, and in addition $25,000 as punitive damages \u201cfor the aggravated inconveniences and harassments created by the wilful breach of contract\u201d by the defendant. The complaint also demands the price of one first class roundtrip fare from Chicago to Paris.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Jurisdiction is dependent upon diversity of citizenship of the parties and an amount in controversy exceeding $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs. Defendant contended that neither of these conditions was met, but the district court\u2019s order does not indicate which ground it accepted, or whether it held both of them well-founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">As to the amount in controversy, the complaint was filed on November 29, 1966, and the accumulated payments of $25 weekly from March 7, 1965 until that date, if they were due, would amount to approximately $2,242. It is impossible to be certain how long the $25 weekly payments could continue under plaintiff\u2019s version of his claim. He alleges that he demands such payments \u201cuntil settlement\u201d, but what that means does not appear. Even if there were no time limit on the extent of the weekly payments, they would not reach a total in excess of $10,000, exclusive of interest, until October, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">Since this is a pro se complaint we resolve all doubtful questions in favor of the pleader. But there is nothing to indicate that plaintiff could possibly obtain a judgment beyond the approximate amount of $2,242 which had already accrued when the complaint was filed. There is no basis for acceleration of any payments falling due after the filing of the complaint so as to render them payable when the action was instituted. In such a situation the jurisdictional requirement in diversity is not met. See New York Life Insurance Co, v. Vig\u00edas, 297 U.S. 672, 56 S.Ct. 615, 80 L.Ed. 971 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">Nor can the claim of $25,000 for punitive damages be added in measuring the amount in controversy. Such a claim, \u201cfor the aggravated inconveniences and harassments created by the wilful breach of contract\u201d by the defendant, rests on a contract action and is patently frivolous and without foundation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the plaintiff\u2019s right ultimately to prevail is not the test of jurisdiction, there must be a substantial question raised,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and where it is clear to a legal certainty that the relief sought is unavailable the amount attributed to it may not be considered in computing the jurisdictional amount.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-14\">Plaintiff\u2019s remaining claim for the price of transportation between Chicago <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>and Paris is insufficient to fill the gap in the jurisdictional amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">When we consider that the illness from which plaintiff suffered in March, 1965, was an infection of a toe, it is impossible in the light of these facts, making every intendment in favor of the pleader, to arrive at any conclusion except that the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The complaint is lacking in clarity on the jurisdictional requirement of diversity of citizenship. Nowhere does the plaintiff allege the state in which he was domiciled or of which he was a citizen at the time of the filing of the complaint. Instead he alleges that he is an American citizen as a result of having been born in Chicago, Illinois, and then goes on to aver: \u201cHe uses as a legal address, to receive mail, the home of a cousin at [a specified address in] * * * Illinois; he also receives mail in New York at: Gen. Post Office, Gen. Delivery, c/o Seaman\u2019s Unit, N.Y. 1, N.Y.\u201d He alleges that defendant\u2019s home office is advertised to be in Los Angeles, California, and that it also maintains offices in Chicago and New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">There is thus nothing to show precisely the state of incorporation of the defendant, although its principal place of business is stated to be in California. Since it is possible that plaintiff may be a citizen of Illinois or even of New York, and there is nothing in his complaint which would tie him to California, it may well be that he is a citizen and domiciliary of a state other than that in which defendant was incorporated and in which it has its principal place of business. It is for this reason that we do not rest our affirmance of the district court\u2019s order on this second ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">What is before us is an essentially minor claim which taken at its best does not reveal that the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs. This jurisdictional requirement is one which must be made to appear affirmatively on the face of the complaint. The district court therefore rightly dismissed the action without prejudice as to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">The order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-7\">.
