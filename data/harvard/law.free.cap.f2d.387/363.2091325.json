The district court held an evidentiary hearing on the relator\u2019s petition and found, upon conflicting evidence, that the relator was in fact represented by competent counsel in the state court at the time he entered his plea of guilty and at the time he was sentenced. There was substantial evidence before the district court to support this finding and we cannot hold it to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-26\">The order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
