Brown, 9 Cir., 352 F.2d 1023 (1965); Armstrong v. Rushing, 9 Cir., 352 F.2d 836 (1965). We therefore reversed, ordering that appellant was \u201centitled to have process issued and served, and to be heard.\u201d (352 F.2d at 837.)</p>\n<p id=\"b964-24\">Appellant has had such relief. His matter was heard by a second judge (C.T. 149-50), and the complaint was dismissed with leave to amend. After motion by appellant to disqualify the judge so ruling against him, appellant filed an amended complaint, which was heard by a third judge, who held the proceeding \u201cwas utterly frivolous and malicious within the meaning of Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d),\u201d and hence dismissed the complaint and the cause of action.
