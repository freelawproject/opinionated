Appellant also complains that he was denied trial by jury and confrontation of witnesses, and that the indictments were invalid in several respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-28\">The District Court held an evidentiary hearing with appellant, represented by court-appointed counsel, present and testifying. The Court rendered detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, which are. abundantly supported by credible evidence and applicable legal authorities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-29\">We conclude that the appellant\u2019s pleas of guilty were freely and voluntarily entered upon advice of counsel after he was fully advised of his constitutional rights by the trial court. See Busby v. Holman, 5 Cir. 1966, 356 F.2d 75; Cooper v. Holman, 5 Cir. 1966, 356 F.2d 82. Therefore, appellant had no federally protected right to a jury trial. Moreover, the prosecuting attorney testified, and the court below found, that the appellant expressly waived his right to a jury. Certified copies of the indict-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>merits which were entered in evidence appear to be regular and valid in all essential particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The judgment of the District Court is correct, and it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"AKc\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-18\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b425-30\">.
