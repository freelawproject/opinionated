NLRB, 386 F.2d 276 (4th Cir. 1967). In that decision, this court enforced the Board\u2019s order to reinstate employee James Williams, who had been discriminatorily discharged in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3) of the Labor Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-22\">Williams has now been fired again, under circumstances which the Board also finds violated \u00a7 8(a) (3). Prior to the announcement of the court\u2019s earlier decision but subsequent to the Board\u2019s order, the Company voluntarily complied and rehired Williams when the organizational crisis had ended. One month later, on the day after h,e was seen in the company of a union organizer, Williams was dismissed, allegedly for putting an excess number of wood arcs into a bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-23\">Viewing the record as a whole, we are satisfied that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s order, and we therefore enforce it. The stated reason for Williams\u2019 discharge is clearly pretextuous as evidenced by a published company rule which makes \u201ccarelessness or neglect resulting in excessive scrap or abuse of equipment, tools or material\u201d punishable upon a first offense only by an oral reprimand. The Company\u2019s anti-union activity, found unlawful in the first <em>Visador </em>case, its knowledge of Williams\u2019 pro-union sympathies and its supervisor\u2019s observation of Williams with a known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>union official on the day before the firing strongly support the inference that Williams was discharged for anti-union, not economic, reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
