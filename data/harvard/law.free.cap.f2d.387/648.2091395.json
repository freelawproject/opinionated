The only serious question raised here was whether there was sufficient evidence before the trial court which would warrant its finding that the conduct on the part of the shipowner was such as would preclude its recovery of indemnity against a contract stevedore. The district court found there was no breach by the stevedore of its warranty of workmanlike service, and, therefore, no warranty breach as proximate cause of Maples\u2019 injury, and the court further found conduct by the shipowner sufficient to preclude its recovery of indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-19\">Having carefully considered the evidence as to the construction of the access into the hold, described by the trial court as one \u201cthat I have never seen a more dangerous access way than these exhibits in here show this one to have been,\u201d we cannot reverse as clearly erroneous the trial court\u2019s judgment that \u201cit is just exactly the sort of conduct that precludes the shipowner from recovery * *</p>\n<p id=\"b704-20\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
