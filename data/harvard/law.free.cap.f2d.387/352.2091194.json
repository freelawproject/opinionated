The Board also found that NFL violated \u00a7 8(b)(1)(A) and (2) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(b)(1)(A) and (2) by executing contracts which contain clauses providing for preferential hiring of NFL members. Although in response to the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement, \u00a7 10(e), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e), NFL filed a formal opposition, it has since neither filed a brief nor appeared through counsel on the submission. But giving such independent review to the record as our limited role permits we find not a significant legal issue presented and more than ample evidence upon which to reach the factual and legal conclusions in the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-22\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-13\">.

As a result of hearings in August, 1960, the parties entered into a stipulation consenting to disestablishment of USEA as a labor organization and requiring it to cease and desist from engaging in employer-dominated activities, maintaining agreements with employers, and restraining employees. The Board entered an order on January 12, 1961, encompassing the terms of the stipulation. This order was enforced by decree of this Court on April 10, 1961.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
