The appellant, represented by two court-appointed counsel, was convicted in 1964 of assault with intent to murder his mother by cutting her with a knife. Appellant was never tried in the companion case in which his father was the alleged victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-25\">The appellant contended in his habeas corpus petition in the district court that he had ineffective representation of counsel at his trial in the state court; that the prosecutor told the jury he was a mean man and had been run out of the county for a similar offense; and that, being indigent, he was denied the right to take a direct appeal. Appellant also complained that there were no Negroes on the petit jury, although he did not contend that Negroes were systematically excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-26\">At the hearing in the district court the appellant, represented by court-appointed counsel, testified in support of his contentions. His two former counsel testified to facts which indicated that they represented him diligently and ably; that the prosecutor had not made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>alleged remarks to the jury; and that they advised the appellant on several occasions of his right to appeal but he insisted that he did not desire to appeal, saying that \u201cIf I did this to my Mama and my Papa, I need to be locked up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">We have considered the appellant\u2019s contentions but find them to be wholly without merit. The district court resolved the credibility issues adversely to the appellant; and we find no error in its findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
