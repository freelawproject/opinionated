The District Court did not err in coming to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Further, the District Court did not err in holding that the appellant is required to exhaust the available Pennsylvania post-conviction remedy with respect to any constitutional claims which he may desire to present before he is entitled to federal habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">For the reasons stated the Order of the District Court denying the writ of habeas corpus will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
