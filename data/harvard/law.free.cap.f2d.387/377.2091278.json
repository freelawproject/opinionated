The United States introduced, over the defendant\u2019s objections, evidence of conversations between Long and a government agent obtained through the use of electronic transmitting and receiving devices. A microphone strapped to the agent transmitted the conversations to other agents. Long contends that the use of electronic eavesdropping devices is unconstitutional and that evidence resulting from such devices is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">There is no merit to Long\u2019s contention. Lopez v. United States, 1963, 373 U.S. 427, 83 S.Ct. 1381, 10 L.Ed.2d 462; On Lee v. United States, 1952, 343 U.S. 747, 72 S.Ct. 967, 96 L.Ed. 1270; Goldman v. United States, 1942, 316 U.S. 129, 62 S.Ct. 993, 86 L.Ed. 1322; Olmstead v. United States, 1928, 277 U.S. 438, 48 S.Ct. 564, 72 L.Ed. 944; and Beatty v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 377 F.2d 181. In Silverman v. United States, 1961, 365 U.S. 505, 81 S.Ct. 679, 5 L.Ed.2d 734, the Supreme Court explicitly pointed out that <em>On Lee, Goldman, </em>and <em>Olmstead </em>were still applicable except where \u201cthe eavesdropping was accomplished by means of an unauthorized physical penetration into the premises occupied by the petitioners\u201d. See also Katz v. United States, 9 Cir. 1967, 369 F.2d 130, cert. granted, 386 U.S. 954, 87 S.Ct. 1021,18 L.Ed.2d 102. No physical \u201cintrusion\u201d or \u201cpenetration\u201d was involved in this case. See Jones v. United States, 5 Cir. 1964, 339 F.2d 419. The judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-13\">. After entry but before publication of the above opinion in this ease the Supreme Court reversed Katz v. United States, holding that the \u201ctrespass\u201d doctrine enunciated in <em>Olmstead </em>and <em>Goldman </em>\u201ccan no longer be regarded as controlling.\u201d 389 U.S. 347, 353, 88 S.Ct. 507, 512, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, 583 (Dec. 18, 1967). <em>Lopez </em>and Osborn v. United States, 1967, 385 U.S. 323, 87 S.Ct. 429, 17 L.Ed.2d 394, involving tape recordings of incriminating conversation where the parties recording the conversations were agents for the government, are still viable, however. So also are <em>On Lee, </em>a case factually almost identical to the case before us, and Hester v. United States, 1924, 265 U.S. 57, 44 S.Ct. 445, 68 L.Ed. 898, similar to this case but involving no electronic device. On the basis of these decisions our judgment affirming Long\u2019s conviction must stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
