The district court filed a memorandum opinion in which it carefully analyised the administrative record in the light of appellant\u2019s contentions and concluded that the agency had complied with required procedures, that its factual determinations were supported by substantial evidence, and that its action was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. We agree, and the judgment must therefore be affirmed. Mancilla v. United States, 382 F.2d 269, 270 (9th Cir. 1967); Baum v. Zuckert, 342 F.2d 145, 147 (6th Cir. 1965); Seebach v. Cullen, 338 F.2d 663, 664 (9th Cir. 1964). Whether we would have thought the reduction in grade which the agency ordered the appropriate action in the circumstances had the judgment been ours to make is of course immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
