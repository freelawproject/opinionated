On November 18, 1963, this court denied the motion for lack of jurisdiction, citing United States v. Robinson, 361 U.S. 220, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960), and refused to treat the issue as an application for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-19\">On June 27, 1966, appellant filed a petition in the district court under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, requesting the judgment of conviction be set aside \u201cso that he would be restored to the status of one whose sentence has just been imposed and who has ten (10) days within which to institute a direct appeal.\u201d The petition was denied without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-20\">Appellant filed a timely appeal and prosecutes his appeal <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-21\">In denying the petition the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-22\">\u201cOral notice of appeal was given at the time of sentencing, but petitioner\u2019s trial counsel failed to file a written notice of appeal, as provided by Federal Criminal Procedure Rule 37(a). Petitioner alleges: \u2018Thus, when trial counsel failed to file a written notice of appeal * * * with the knowledge that petitioner could not comply with Rule 37(a) (1), he did with intent and knowledge deprive petitioner of his right to appeal by fraud.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u201cThe foregoing statement is petitioner\u2019s sole ground for relief. He does not assert that the failure to appeal resulted in the loss of a basic right, constitutional or otherwise, for which loss he is entitled to a remedy under \u00a7 2255. Petitioner has not, beyond the above conclusory statement, disclosed to this Court the nature of the error and prejudice which he proposes by appeal to correct. Consequently, there is no way in which this Court can determine the existence of prejudice or judge the substantiality of petitioner\u2019s claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The order of the district court is affirmed on the authority of McGarry v. Fogliani, 370 F.2d 42 (9th Cir. 1966); Miller v. United States, 339 F.2d 581 (9th Cir. 1964); and Wilson v. United States, 338 F.2d 54 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
