The Board of Immigration Appeals dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>missed petitioner\u2019s appeal from the Officer\u2019s decision. Petitioner has appealed to this court to set aside the order. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">The proof which was introduced by the government at petitioner\u2019s deportation hearing consists of petitioner\u2019s own testimony and several official Service documents. On the basis of this proof the Hearing Examiner concluded that petitioner was an \u201cExchange Visitor\u201d and that her period of authorized residence in this country had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Petitioner initially refused to testify at the hearing on the Fifth Amendment ground that her answers might subject her to prosecution for perjury in view of a previous statement she had been \u201cforced\u201d to give under oath. The Hearing Examiner ordered her to answer, and she complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">The Examiner correctly recognized that the Fifth Amendment privilege may be asserted in proceedings before the Service. United States ex rel. Zapp v. District Director, 2 Cir., 120 F.2d 762; Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 284, 42 S.Ct. 492, 66 L.Ed. 938, but grounded his order on his conclusion that there was no danger of self-incrimination to petitioner in this case because a forced statement could not be used as the basis for a prosecution for perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">The Service\u2019s Board of Appeals first concluded that the Examiner had correctly ordered petitioner to testify and that her testimony was properly considered in determining her deportability. The Board further decided that even if petitioner had been improperly forced to testify this illegal compulsion did not prevent the use of her testimony in a deportation proceeding since \u201cdeportation is a civil matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">The Board of Appeals was in error. The Hearing Officer\u2019s order was improper, since the circumstances surrounding the \u201cforced statement\u201d were not before him, and he could not reasonably determine that it was \u201c \u2018perfectly clear, from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that [petitioner] [was] mistaken, and that the answer [s] [could not] possibly have such tendency\u2019 to incriminate.\u201d Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 488, 71 S.Ct. 814, 819, 95 L.Ed. 1118. Furthermore, if the Board\u2019s decision that despite the violation of petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights the Service could use her testimony is upheld, the result would be not only to sanction the Hearing Officer\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, but to permit the government to gain from the violation of this right. It would be anomalous to use testimony compelled in violation of the Fifth Amendment in a deportation proceeding to deprive petitioner of liberty which she would have, unless deported. Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. at 284, 42 S.Ct. 492. We therefore conclude that the testimony given under compulsion of the Officer\u2019s ruling was not usable against the petitioner in this deportation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">This conclusion does not, however, warrant our setting aside the order which is the subject of this appeal. There were ample official documents presented by the Service to the Officer to support the findings that petitioner entered the United States from her native Republic of the Philippines as an exchange visitor on November 17, 1963, that she was authorized to remain in the United States until July 13, 1966, and that she remained in the United States after that terminal date.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">The only challenge to the documents at the hearing was that there was no proof identifying the petitioner as the Herminia Venus Valeros named in the documents. In the absence of proof by petitioner that she was not the Herminia Venus Valeros named in the documents, the documentary proof was sufficient to prove alienage. Vlisidis v. Holland, 3 Cir., 245 F.2d 812, 814; Chung Young Chew v. Boyd, 9 Cir., 309 F.2d 857, 867; Williams v. Mulcahey, 6 Cir., 250 F.2d 127,128.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">Petition to set aside the order appealed from is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
