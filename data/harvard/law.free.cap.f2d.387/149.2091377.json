See Harris v. Beto, 367 F.2d 567 (5 Cir. 1966). The case was remanded to the district court for determination of the question of voluntariness of his confession. Upon remand the district court denied relief and concluded that the confession was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">On this appeal the appellant does not insist as strenuously as heretofore that his confession was not voluntary. He claims that the confession should not have been admitted into evidence because his arrest and subsequent detention were unlawful. We have considered all of appellant\u2019s contentions and find them without merit. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
