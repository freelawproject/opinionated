Gerdes, 321 U.S. 178, 185, 64 S.Ct. 487, 491, 88 L.Ed. 659 (1944). See also Fischer v. Pauline Oil &amp; Gas Co., 309 U.S. 294, 303, 60 S.Ct. 535, 84 L.Ed. 764 (1940); Winchester v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Heiskell, 119 U.S. 450, 453, 7 S.Ct. 281, 30 L.Ed. 462 (1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">While the consent of the bankruptcy court to the trustee\u2019s intervention in the state court action was conditioned on that intervention\u2019s being without prejudice to the proceedings in the bankruptcy court, the trustee proceeded in the state court without reference to that condition. He had the power to bind himself in spite of his disregard of the condition attached to the order permitting him to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
