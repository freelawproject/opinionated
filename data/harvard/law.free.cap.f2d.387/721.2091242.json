A ten year warranty by the manufacturer, Tetco Metal Products, Inc., an Illinois corporation, against defects in material and workmanship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>came with the heater. The Langhams filled in the required information and returned the warranty card to Tetco\u2019s office in Illinois. Mr. Langham installed the heater in his home, where it functioned properly for about a year and then exploded, damaging the Langham\u2019s home and furniture. The Langhams brought suit against Tetco in the Southern District of Alabama to recover damages in the amount of $11,500. Service of process was made against Tetco by registered mail under Title 7, Section 199(1), Code of Alabama 1940 (Recomp. 1958).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tetco filed a motion to quash service of process on the ground that it did not have those minimum contacts with Alabama necessary for that state to obtain jurisdiction. The motion was denied and the case proceeded to trial on the written express warranty. The jury returned a verdict for the Langhams in the amount of $5,000. At the outset on appeal Tetco raises the question of whether the district court erred in refusing to quash service of process. Tetco also raises several other questions but we pretermit any discussion of them in view of our conclusion that the district court lacked jurisdiction and should, therefore, have granted Tetco\u2019s motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">The evidence concerning Tetco\u2019s amenability to service consists of the uncontradicted<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> affidavit of Teteo\u2019s president. The affidavit shows that Tetco is an Illinois corporation, with its principal place of business in that state. It has never qualified to do business in Alabama; owns no property in Alabama; has no bank account there; neither owns nor operates a warehouse or other place of business in that state; has no salesman or repairman or other employee in Alabama; and manufactures no product in Alabama. Tetco\u2019s only connections with Alabama consist of shipping water heaters to independent Alabama retailers in response to their unsolicited orders, and of receiving the warranty cards from Alabama purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\"> In considering the validity <em>vel non </em>of substituted service of process to effect jurisdiction over a party, each case must be decided on its own facts and under the law of the forum state. Phillips v. Hooker, 5 Cir. 1967, 375 F.2d 189, 192. We are convinced that Tetco\u2019s connections with Alabama simply do not constitute doing business under Alabama law. In Ex parte Emerson, 1960, 270 Ala. 697, 121 So.2d 914, a Texas manufacturer sold its product to Alabama drugstores which sold to the public. The manufacturer paid several salesmen to cover the entire United States. However, these salesmen were not controlled by the manufacturer and paid their own travel and operational expenses. The Supreme Court of Alabama held that \u201cthe men selling Pedolatum in Alabama were either selling a product which they had purchased or were independent contractors and therefore Dr. J. B. King was not doing business within the State of Alabama.\u201d Ex parte Emerson, supra, at 920. There is no contention in this case that Tetco sold directly to any consumer, that it employed anyone to sell its water heaters, or that the retailers were selling the heaters as Tetco\u2019s agent. Here as in Emerson the manufacturer\u2019s product was distributed in Alabama by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>an independent party over whom the manufacturer had no control.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In determining whether there is jurisdiction under the Alabama long-arm statute, the courts have emphasized several factors as being indicative of doing business in the state: 1) presence of authorized agents in the state; 2) regular and systematic solicitation of orders by these salesmen; 3) continuous flow of its products into the state. Boyd v. Warren Paint &amp; Color Co., 1950, 254 Ala. 687, 49 So.2d 559. On the other hand the absence of agents in the state and a small volume of sales in the state indicate that a company is not doing business there. Dooly v. Payne, 5 Cir. 1964, 326 F.2d 941; Ex parte Emerson, 1960, 270 Ala. 697, 121 So.2d 914. This case clearly falls into the latter category insofar as the shipping of goods to independent retailers is concerned. The fact that the Langhams filled out the warranty card and mailed it from Alabama does not change the result. While it may well be that \u201can action for breach of warranty defies categorization\u201d as either tort or contract, -Developments in the Law\u2014 State-Court Jurisdiction, 73 Harv.L.Rev. 909, 926 n. 115 (1960), we escape the dilemma here because the Langhams did not sign the warranty and presented no evidence to show that any \u201ccontract\u201d was made in Alabama. Furthermore, by the terms of the warranty any performance due under it would take place at Tetco\u2019s factory in Illinois, not in Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\"> The party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a court has the burden of establishing that jurisdiction exists, and this burden cannot be shifted to the party challenging the jurisdiction. Gaitor v. Peninsular &amp; Occidental S.S. Co., 5 Cir. 1961, 287 F.2d 252, 253. \u201cIf his allegations of jurisdictional facts are challenged by his adversary in any appropriate manner, he must support them by competent proof.\u201d McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 1936, 298 U.S. 178, 189, 56 S.Ct. 780, 785, 80 L.Ed. 1135. Teteo repeatedly challenged the jurisdiction of the district court. The Langhams presented no evidence to support the jurisdiction of the court, although they had ample opportunity to attempt to do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">On this state of the record the district court had no jurisdiction over Teteo under the Alabama long-arm statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judgment of the district court is, therefore, reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-5\">.
