It seeks enforcement of its order requiring reinstatement and back pay and the usual accompanying relief. Enforcement is denied, because there is not substantial evidence that the company had knowledge of any union activity by Hester.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-22\">Hester was hired in late April. The company knew he was a union member and then on strike against a motor carrier. Texas Industries was not organized at that time and no organizational activity was going on.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-23\">Within a week it became known among his fellow workers that Hester had experience in union matters, and some of them asked him to organize a local at the plant. He declined, indicating that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>had not completed his 90-day probationary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">On June 20 Foreman Lewis and Shipping Foreman Meyer called in Hester and reprimanded him for making late deliveries. That was all the conversation \u2014 there was no discussion of union or union \u00e1ctivities. When Hester left the conference, employee Rich asked what he had been called in for. According to Hester his answer was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">\u201cI gave him a big line of bull * *. I said they wanted \u2014 Mr. Meyer and Mr. Lewis, they wanted to know if I could help them straighten out the driver\u2019s complaints and get everything squared away to where everybody would be happy. I told him that after I got my ninety days in that I was going to the union and then write everything down on paper and hand it over to Mr. Sewell, who was president of the company, and get everything to where everybody would be happy * *. I just didn\u2019t like Mr. Rich, so I just shot him a line of bull there, as to what was said in the office. I did not figure it was any of his business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The Trial Examiner characterized Hester\u2019s version of his conversation with Rich as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">\u201cBecause he was embarrassed and disliked and distrusted Blackie, Hester replied with a cock-and-bull story that the aforementioned supervisors had called him in to ask \u2018if I could help them straighten out the driver\u2019s complaints and get everything squared away to where everybody would be happy.\u2019 He told Blackie that he had answered his superiors with the remark that after he had served his 90-day probationary period he would go \u2018to the union and then write everything down on paper and hand it over to Mr. Sewell * * * president of the company, and get everything to where everybody would be happy.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">What Hester describes as a \u201cbig line of bull,\u201d and the Trial Examiner as a \u201ccock- and-bull story\u201d, the Board in its brief refers to as \u201cHester erroneously stated.\u201d These are new. euphemisms in judicial proceedings for the making of untrue statements. No one, including Hester, contends the statements were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Shortly thereafter Hester told other employees that after his probationary period he would see Mr. Sewell (the company president) \u201cto more or less get that cement plant straightened out,\u201d and would get management to fire Meyer and he would take over Meyer\u2019s job. In similar euphemistic manner this is characterized as an \u201cerroneous report\u201d by Hester.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">Several employees told Meyer about Hester\u2019s statements made to Rich and the other drivers. Not more than four or five days after Hester began circulation of the story Meyer saw Hester, and according to Hester, said \u201cAnybody that went to Mr. Sewell, that talked union or anything would get fired for doing such as that,\u201d that \u201cyou can\u2019t say anything around here we don\u2019t know,\u201d and \u201cthe best thing for me to do was to do my job and keep my mouth shut or I would get laid off.\u201d Meyer denied that Hester\u2019s statements, as relayed to him by others, contained any mention of proposed union activity by Hester or mentioned \u201cunion\u201d in any context. He denied that in his conversation with Hester he mentioned \u201cunion.\u201d There is no support from anyone to whom Hester disseminated his fabrication that Hester\u2019s remarks included any reference to \u201cunion.\u201d There is no evidence from any employee who reported to Meyer that the reports so made included any reference to \u201cunion.\u201d Thus the tenuous thread of the pro-union content of a fabricated statement by Hester and of the anti-union content of a subsequent actual statement by Meyer, is suspended between, at one end, Hester\u2019s credited testimony of his reference to \u201cunion\u201d in the story he disseminated, and at the other end, Hester\u2019s credited testimony of what Meyer said to him. Insofar as mention of \u201cunion,\u201d the beginning and the end of the thread, and everything between are supported by testimony of no one else, and the testimony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>fabricator Hester is accepted over that of all others. However, our decision need not rest on this Alice-in-Wonderland credibility choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">For purposes of discussion, accepting the Board\u2019s conclusions on credibility, when the above events occurred there was no union activity by Hester or anyone else; in Hester\u2019s circulated story there was no reference to present union activity, nor did Hester make any \u201cunion\u201d statements in his discussion with Meyer. The Board\u2019s reasoning is that Meyer was told of Hester\u2019s false statements about mentioning \u201cunion\u201d to the company, and reacted with an anti-union statement, that this tends to prove that when at a later time Hester did engage in union activity and was fired the discharge was because of that actual activity. The trouble with this is that from late June or early July to mid-August Hester\u2019s \u201ccock-and-bull story\u201d, and the resulting conversation with Meyer, were not used as ground for discharge. And there is a total absence of evidence that when Hester changed his role to one of actual activity the company had any knowledge of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">On August 10 Hester obtained union authorization cards from a union representative. In three or four days he signed up 23 of 27 truck drivers. On August 14 he was discharged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Trial Examiner inferred that because other matters were quickly reported by drivers to supervisors, and supervisors kept a close tab on matters going on at the plant, the company did learn of Hester\u2019s union activities and did fire him because of the activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Hester\u2019s testimony is that in the conference in which he was discharged, after discussion with him of unauthorized stops, and just before he was told of his discharge, he \u201cwhipped from his pocket\u201d and displayed to the foreman a handful of signed union cards. This last-minute revelation by Hester of his union activity, assuming that it occurred, was not a motivating cause of the discharge; in fact when the conference began Hester\u2019s truck already had been dispatched to another driver and was gone. The Trial Examiner found, and we think correctly, that the decision to discharge Hester had been made before the conference began.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">The evidence in this case is too ephemeral and insubstantial to meet the required standard of substantiality from the record as a whole that Hester was discharged because of union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">Enforcement denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-24\">. National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">. While we do not go into the details of grounds for discharge it is appropriate to note that one of the asserted grounds was that Hester had abused his privilege of making stops for breaks, a practice which had been the subject of company concern before Hester circulated his fabricated story, and that there was evidence (including admissions from Hester himself) of such abuse by him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
