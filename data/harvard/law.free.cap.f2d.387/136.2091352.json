However, the petition states clearly that he in fact had counsel at his arraignment and plea. In fact, in paragraph 14 of the petition, the petitioner, indicates that his counsel changed his plea to guilty. He has therefore not alleged any violation of his constitutional rights for which habeas corpus can be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-23\">However, on review of the record on appeal, it appears to this court that the petition filed October 21, 1966, alleges facts which seem designed to challenge the voluntariness of both appellant\u2019s confession (see Lynumn v. State of Illinois, 372 U.S. 528, 83 S.Ct. 917, 9 L.Ed.2d 922 (1963); Spano v. People of State of New York, 360 U.S. 315, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265 (1959)) and his subsequent plea of guilty. (See Com. of Pennsylvania ex rel. Herman v. Claudy, 350 U.S. 116, 76 S.Ct. 223, 100 L.Ed. 126 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>These questions should be resolved at an evidentiary hearing.
