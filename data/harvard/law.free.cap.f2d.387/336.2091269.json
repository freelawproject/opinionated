The claim was denied at all administrative levels, and the appellant filed suit to obtain judicial review of the administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-22\">Rather than denying or answering the complaint the secretary moved the court, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g), to remand the case to him for further action. The district court granted this motion and thereafter the secretary reversed his previous decision and awarded the appellant all the disability benefits he claimed. Appellant was paid his past due benefits amounting to $3,743.20 and his monthly benefits were commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>After the decision on remand appellant moved the district court to enter a summary judgment affirming the decision of the secretary and to allow as part of the judgment, an attorney\u2019s fee of twenty-five percent of the past due benefits to which appellant was entitled as provided in the contingent fee contract entered into between appellant and his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The district court denied appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In its order the court stated <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">Upon remand, an award was made in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. Thus, no judgment was made by the Court, and therefore Title 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 406(b) (1) regarding attorney\u2019s fees in cases where court action results in a favorable decision for the claimant is not applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">The proper form of relief for the plaintiff\u2019s attorney is through application to the Secretary for attorney\u2019s fees. Until such remedy is sought, the Court will not rule on the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291, the United States Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction of \u201call final decisions\u201d of the district courts, except decisions of three judge district courts. It is, however, firmly established that the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not a final decision and may not be appealed.
