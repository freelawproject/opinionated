The petition from the denial of which petitioner appeals alleges that \u201cdefendant had been tricked by one of his attorneys\u201d. Petitioner\u2019s argument on appeal is addressed more particularly to alleged misleading by his attorney at trial in securing petitioner\u2019s agreement to a stipulation on the understanding that he would be granted probation. We do not take cognizance of some twelve other identifiable allegations which appear in petitioner\u2019s various communications, none of which even arguably falls within the petition under consideration or has any apparent merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-17\">The central facts bearing on petitioner\u2019s claim are the following. The government possessed the letter which was the basis of the indictment. It also had obtained a signed statement from petitioner, after having given him some but not all applicable <em>Miranda </em>warnings, in which petitioner admitted writing and depositing the letter in the mails. A motion to suppress had been filed and a memorandum of law submitted. At this point petitioner\u2019s counsel urged petitioner to sign a stipulation that he did in fact deposit the letter in the mails. The government introduced the stipulation and rested. The defense filed a motion for judgment of acquittal, which was denied. The defense rested and the case was argued to the jury, which returned a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-18\">Petitioner claims that his attorney persuaded him to sign the stipulation because a \u201cdeal\u201d had been worked out with the prosecution for probation. Petitioner\u2019s attorney stated in an affidavit, in addition to denying any such imputation, that he wished to avoid putting the government to proof of signature through a handwriting expert whose testimony he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>thought \u201cwould be particularly impressive to the jury\u201d and thus \u201ccreate the impression that the government considered the case a more serious one than they actually felt it was.\u201d He also felt that such proof would distract the jury from the \u201cbasic defense that the language of the letter as a whole did not constitute a threat.\u201d The attorney said in addition that if the petitioner signed the stipulation the government would be more disposed to recommend, and the judge to grant, probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The record also reveals that, after sentence and after indicating that he wished to withdraw his notice of appeal and request for bail, petitioner twice admitted writing the letter, expressed his regret, and stated that he had not intended to carry out the threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The district court ruled that the motion, files, and records in this case conclusively showed that petitioner was entitled to no relief; that he was validly indicted, tried, convicted, and sentenced; that he was adequately represented throughout by competent counsel; and that the evidence demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that he committed the crime charged. The court noted petitioner\u2019s post-sentence admission that he wrote the offending letter and cited its own extensive and timely explanation to petitioner that there could be no expectation of a review of sentence nor any other inducement for withdrawal of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">It seems likely that petitioner\u2019s trial attorney was pursuing sensible strategy in avoiding putting the government to its proof of petitioner\u2019s handwriting and in concentrating on the overall thrust of the letter. It seems highly unlikely that he misrepresented petitioner\u2019s prospects for probation. It may well be that petitioner was in fact guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And it is clear that the district judge showed every solicitude for petitioner, from ordering a pre-trial psychiatric examination to informing petitioner in unmistakeable terms that there was to be no bargain with him if the appeal were withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Our difficulty arises from the exacting standard which must be met before a hearing on a motion under section 2255 can be dispensed with. In the words of the statute, \u201c * * * the motion and the files and records of the case [must] conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief * * *.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 19-20, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963); Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 494, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962); Desmond v. United States, 333 F.2d 378, 381-382 (1st Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">While the affidavits of petitioner\u2019s attorneys are persuasive, they are not the record of the case; and even if they were, they could not conclusively disprove petitioner\u2019s allegations of extra-record misrepresentations. We cannot say that the stipulation merely facilitated the prosecution\u2019s task. The availability of a handwriting expert, his access to admitted samples of petitioner\u2019s handwriting, the force of his testimony under both direct and cross-examination, the possibility of defense handwriting experts, the proof of depositing in the mails \u2014 all of these are imponderables which could variously affect the prosecution\u2019s case. Nor can we say that petitioner\u2019s post-sentence admissions that he wrote the letter, even if they could be considered entirely uninfluenced by the stipulation which he was allegedly tricked into signing, had any curative effect. For petitioner admitted only the writing, not the mailing; and the latter is the gravamen of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">A hearing is therefore necessary. With reference to such matters as the appointment of counsel and the kind of hearing which should be held, we can do no better than refer to the language of Judge Woodbury in Desmond v. United States, supra, 333 F.2d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
