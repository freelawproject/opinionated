At their sentencing the trial judge commented on certain aspects of the presentence reports which concerned him. Carmine Rossetti was sentenced to four years imprisonment and James Rossetti to three years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-19\">The record discloses that the defendants\u2019 counsel was aware of the incidents in the reports to which the judge referred. The record shows further that neither on the day of sentencing nor at any time prior thereto did the defendants request that they be furnished with the presentence reports. They now contend that it is unfair and unconstitutional to impose sentences based on presentence reports, the contents of which were not disclosed to them. They also complain that the sentences imposed were excessive. Both contentions are answered contrary to the defendants\u2019 contentions by our ruling in United States v. Ginzburg (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-21\">Accordingly, the judgments of sentence will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
