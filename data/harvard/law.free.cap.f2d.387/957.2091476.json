(A total small business set-aside means that the entire award is to go to a \u201csmall business.\u201d) After the bids were opened in June and plaintiff\u2019s was determined to be low, the next low bidder, B &amp; A and Yutan Construction Company (Yutan), protested that Mid-West was not a \u201csmall business\u201d under 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.3-2(g) (1963), which requires an otherwise eligible \u201cconcern\u201d to have \u201ca place of business located in the United States <em>* * * </em>\u201d in order to qualify. The contracting officer forwarded the protest to the nearest regional office (Seattle) of the Size Standards Division, Small Business Administration (SBA). The Seattle office\u2019s decision in favor of plaintiff was affirmed in the District of Columbia on July 13 by the Acting Director of the Size Standards Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">On July 14th the contracting officer telegraphed Mid-West that its bid had been accepted. On the same day, Yutan notified the contracting officer that it was filing an appeal of the Acting Director\u2019s ruling with the Size Appeals Board of SBA. A few days later it also protested the' contract award to the Comptroller General. The contracting officer replied to Yutan on July 14 that he had awarded the contract to plaintiff because \u201cany further delay in the procurement action of IFB No. 1-64-18 [the award in issue] would be disadvantageous to the Government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">On August 28 the Size Appeals Board issued an opinion, adopted by the SBA Administrator, that plaintiff failed to qualify. The Comptroller General, agreeing with the Appeals Board, recommended that plaintiff\u2019s contract be canceled. See 44 Comp.Gen. 253 (1964) (No. B-154756). The acting contracting officer notified Mid-West by a letter of December 7th that its contract was canceled as an erroneous award. (It is important to note at once that the contract did not contain a termination-for-convenience article.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">Even before December 7th, plaintiff, dissatisfied with the decision of the Size Appeals Board, filed suit in the United States District Court for Alaska against the SBA Administrator, the Chief of the Forest Service, and the contracting officer, demanding a declaratory judgment that the Board\u2019s determination was invalid, and seeking temporary and permanent injunctions to restrain the defendants from making an award to anyone other than plaintiff. Midwest Constr. Co., Ltd. v. Foley, Civil No. J-2-64 (D. Alaska, filed Sept. 11, 1964). In March 1965 the court ordered the complaint amended to state that it was a suit to review an administrative proceeding under Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act as amended, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706 (1965-66 Supp. II), and directed plaintiff to serve upon the defendants \u201ca designation of the administrative [Appeals Board] record to be reviewed.\u201d Upon plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with that directive, the court (in June 1965) dismissed the action under F.R.Civ.P. 41(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">After the cancellation of its contract, plaintiff also sought administrative relief. Contending that the Government was in total default, it submitted a claim for damages to the contracting officer in March 1965. That officer concluded that he lacked jurisdiction to consider it. Mid-West appealed, and in January 1966 the Department of Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals, with the company\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>consent, dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">Plaintiff then filed its petition in this court, claiming that the contract was legally binding on the Government (and, therefore, its attempted disavowal was a breach) because the contracting officer had the authority to make an award no matter what the outcome of Yutan\u2019s appeal to the Size Appeals Board, and, alternatively, because Mid-West was in fact a small business at the time of the award (and, therefore, the decisions of the Board and the Comptroller General to the contrary were erroneous and invalid). Defendant has responded by moving for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">We start by putting wholly to one side plaintiff\u2019s secondary argument (that it was in fact a qualified \u201csmall business\u201d), and all the points and counterpoints that follow upon that theme. As we see the case, it makes no difference whether or not (a) plaintiff was an eligible bidder, (b) the Size Appeal Board\u2019s determination was erroneous or invalid, (c) SBA\u2019s determinations of eligibility are subject to judicial review in any forum, (d) the Alaska District Court had jurisdiction to consider plaintiff\u2019s suit there, and (e) that court\u2019s dismissal of Mid-West\u2019s action, with prejudice, is binding here on the question of the validity of the administrative determination of size. We can assume, without in any way deciding, that plaintiff was actually not qualified, that the Board\u2019s adverse holding was correct, that we cannot review the legality of that ruling, and that in any event the District Court\u2019s action conclusively rules, for this case, that Mid-West was not in fact eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">We clear the decks in this way because, for us, the case turns entirely on the question whether the contracting officer was authorized, in the circumstances, to make the award to plaintiff even though the company was not truly a \u201csmall business.\u201d That narrow issue of contracting authority is governed by the pertinent regulations, which we must sketch in some detail. There are two sets \u2014 the Small Busines Administration Regulations (SBAR) and the Federal Procurement Regulations (FPR)\u2014 which interconnect and have equal bearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">The regulations each provide that bids for set-asides received from firms not qualifying as small businesses (as defined in the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 631-647 (1964, 1965 Supp. I, 1965-66 Supp. II), and the regulations under it) are to be rejected as nonresponsive. 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 127.15-2 (1963) (SBAR); 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 1-1.706-5 (1964) (FPR). But this generality must be read together with other sections dealing specifically with the procedures for determining small business status and the effect of those determinations (or lack thereof) on federal procurement activity. The SBA regulations say, for instance, that. \u201c[i]n the absence of a written protest or other information which would cause him to question the veracity of the self-certification [by the bidder in its bid that it qualifies as a small business], the contracting officer shall acept the self-certification at face value for the particular procurement involved.\u201d 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.3-8(d) (1963). Under the FPR the officer, if there is no protest, is to accept the representation \u201cas conclusive for the purpose of a specific procurement.\u201d 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 1-1.703-1 (1964).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>According to both sets of regulations, \u201cany responsive bidder or offeror may, prior to the award, question the small business status of any apparently low bidder or offeror\u201d by filing a written protest with the responsible contracting officer, who is directed to forward it to the nearest SBA regional office. 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.3-5(a) (1963) (SBAR); 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 l-1.703-2(a) (1964) (FPR). Any protest made after an award is ignored. See 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.3-2(p) (1963) (SBAR); 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 l-1.703-2(b) (1964) (FPR). If the protest is timely, the SBA must determine the protested firm\u2019s qualifications and notify it of the decision \u201cwithin ten working days, if possible.\u201d 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.3-5(c) (1963 &amp; Supp.); 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 l-1.703-2(d) (1964) (FPR). The contracting officer \u201cshall accept as conclusive the Administration\u2019s determinations as to which enterprises are to be designated \u2018small-business concerns\u2019 * * Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 637(b) (6) (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">The 1964 version of the FPR (applicable here) does not explicitly refer to recourse to any tier above the SBA regional office;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Small Business Administration\u2019s regulations do. Under the latter an interested party may seek reconsideration of the regional director\u2019s decision by the Director of the Size Standards Division. See 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.3-4(d) (1963). The Director\u2019s decision is \u201cfinal\u201d, except that it may be appealed to the S ize Appeals Board of the SBA within five days (in the case of a \u201cpending procurement\u201d) of receipt by the appellant of the Director\u2019s determination. See 13 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 121.3-4(d) (2), 121.3-6(b) (1963). Other interested parties have five days from their receipt of the notice of appeal to present statements and supporting evidence to the Board, which, at its option, may allow oral argument. See 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.3-6(d), (e) (1963). Once the Board has made a recommendation to the Administrator and he has acted upon it, the chairman of the Board is to \u201cpromptly notify\u201d the appellant and all interested parties of the decision. 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.3-6(g) (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">Finally, the Federal Procurement, but not the SBA, Regulations contain the following paragraph, the interpretation of which we view as the key to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-11\">Procurement action shall be suspended pending SBA\u2019s determination or expiration of the 10-day period whichever is earlier, unless unusual conditions make it necessary that an award be made. If SBA\u2019s determination is not received by the contracting officer within 10 working days after SBA\u2019s receipt of the protest, the contracting officer shall ascertain when such determination can be expected. In cases where further delay in awarding the contract would be disadvantageous to the Government, it shall be presumed that the questioned bidder or offeror is a small business concern. [41 C.F.R. \u00a7 1-1.703-2(e) (1964).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Defendant\u2019s broadest assertion (on this facet of the litigation) is that, since both regulations (FPR and SBAR) require contracting officers to reject, as nonresponsive, bids from unqualified bidders and since the Small Business Act directs those officers to accept, as conclusive, the SBA\u2019s size determinations, the contracting officer had no authority to award the contract to Mid-West because, by the conclusive finding of the SBA Size Appeals Board and the Administrator, the company was not a qualified small business. To avoid this, defendant argues, Mid-West would have to show that the contracting officer\u2019s determination of its status was conclusive, an impossible task since, as defendant correctly maintains, the FPR and SBAR give the contracting officer no decision-making role in size determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">But that does not end the matter, for plaintiff can prevail if the contracting officer had power to make an award regardless of whether Mid-West was in fact a \u201csmall business\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant errs in citing Prestex Inc. v. United States, 320 F.2d 367, 162 Ct.Cl. 620 (1963), as holding that a contracting officer never has such authority. <em>Prestex </em>does stand for the proposition that a contracting officer is usually not empowered to accept a bid that very substantially deviates from the invitation. \u201cA substantial deviation is defined as one which affects either the price, quantity, or quality of the article offered * * * \u201d and which is \u201cat such variance with the advertised proposals as to nullify them.\u201d 320 F.2d at 372,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 162 Ct.Cl. at 626-627.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-16\">Nothing in <em>Prestex, </em>however, precludes the possibility that a contracting officer may be granted the authority to make an award to an otherwise unqualified bidder in certain situations. In Otis Steel Prods. Corp. v. United States, 316 F.2d 937, 940, 161 Ct.Cl. 694, 699-700 (1963), we held that the SBA and Armed Services Procurement Regulations on awarding small business set-asides in the absence of a protest<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> contemplated a binding award to the bidder \u201cwhether it was one [a small business] in fact or not.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cf. Coastal Cargo Co. v. United States, 351 F.2d 1004, 173 Ct.Cl. 259 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-17\">The Government appears to concede that this much is implicit in the regulation, similar to that in <em>Otis, </em>providing for a conclusive assumption of small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>business status in the absence of a protest, as well as the provision calling upon the contracting officer and the SBA to ignore a protest filed after an award. In each instance the award is binding on the Government even though the bidder, in fact, may not be a small business. Cf. 9 C.C.F. \u00a7 72601 (1964) (No. B-153780); 41 Comp.Gen. 252 (1961) (No. B-146438). The crux of the argument, therefore, is not that a contracting officer can never award a contract to an unqualified, or nonresponsive, bidder but that the exceptional authority, granted in the no-protest and the late-protest situations, does not exist when the SBA, pursuant to the procedures outlined in its regulations, determines after the award that a bidder is not a small business.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">We find a comparable exception in 1.1-703 \u2014 2(e) of the Federal Procurement Regulations \u2014 quoted above. The critical sentences are: \u201cIf SBA\u2019s determination is not received by the contracting officer within 10 working days after SBA\u2019s receipt of the protest, the contracting officer shall ascertain when such determination can be expected. In cases where further delay in awarding the contract would be disadvantageous to the Government, it shall be presumed that the questioned bidder or offeror is a small business concern.\u201d As we understand this section, the contracting officer is expressly granted authority to accept a bid, even though the SBA might subsequently determine the bidder to be unqualified, if the delay in awaiting the ultimate SBA determination would be disadvantageous to the Government. In other words, if the SBA has had a 10-day period in which to rule on eligibility but has not yet acted finally, and if a speedy procurement is found necessary, the contracting officer may make a binding and valid award without waiting for the final SBA determination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">Defendant denies this reading primarily on the ground that the phrase, \u201cit shall be <em>presumed </em>that the questioned bidder or offeror is a small business concern\u201d (emphasis added), merely means that the contracting officer may accept a rebuttable presumption that the bidder qualifies, a presumption which will be overcome by any subsequent SBA determination to the contrary. \u201cPresumed\u201d is, of course, a Joseph\u2019s-coat word, with a \u201crebuttable inference\u201d as one of its several tones \u2014 but another common usage is a \u201cconclusive presumption\u201d in which a particular fact, status, or quality cannot be refuted or, more accurately, its actual existence is thereafter held to be irrelevant. In this context \u201cpresumed\u201d is the same as \u201cdeemed\u201d; both words mean that one thing is to be taken as the equivalent of another, regardless of a possible discordance in fact. This latter interpretation makes greater sense here. Especially where delay would be disadvantageous to the Government, there would be little point in allowing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>contracting officer to make an inchoate award which would necessarily be subject to disavowal should the SBA thereafter decide against the contractor\u2019s eligibility. The \u201cpresumption\u201d would then have a minimal or zero effect. It certainly would not, and would not be supposed to, influence the SBA\u2019s later ruling. The \u201csuccessful\u201d awardee would hardly wish to commence preparation for performance knowing that its \u201ccontract\u201d was in just as much jeopardy as was its bid before the award. We cannot see that the Government would gain anything substantial from the making of the award in these circumstances. On the other hand, it is clear that, if the award can be made finally without waiting for the SBA, preparatory and actual work toward performance can start at once and delay will be materially reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">The defendant\u2019s rejoinder is that this interpretation would turn a reconsideration by the Size Standards Division Director, or an appeal to the Size Appeals Board, into an academic pursuit. It is true that further SBA proceedings, once the contracting officer makes an award pursuant to authority granted by this provision of the regulations, would have no effect on that particular contract. But the size determination can influence further contracts with the concern whose status is questioned. The value of having a final size determination on the books is apparent; a firm\u2019s business may be such that it often bids for Government projects. The later (1965) version of the Federal Procurement Regulations, quoted in note 4 supra, expressly provides for this use in case an appeal is untimely: \u201cIf an award was made prior to the time the contracting officer receives notice of the appeal, the contract shall be presumed to be. valid and any determination rendered shall be considered in future procurements.\u201d 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 l-703-2(d) (.1967). This 1965 provision is significant, too, because it shows that the drafters of this closely related portion of the FPR used \u201cpresumed\u201d in the sense of \u201cdeemed\u201d \u2014 a \u201cconclusive\u201d, not a \u201crebuttable\u201d, \u201cpresumption\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">We recognize, of course, that this reading of paragraph 1.703-2 (e) creates some strain with the major policy of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 631(a) (1964), in that an award of a small business set-aside to an unqualified concern will deprive an eligible small businessman of a Government contract. But those who administer the Act have plainly decided that the Congressional policy favoring small business was not expected to be enforced to the exclusion of all other interests. Witness the regulations accepting self-certification where no protest, a late protest, or a late appeal is filed, and the portion of paragraph (e) allowing an award \u2014 where \u201cunusual conditions make it necessary that an award be made\u201d \u2014 within the initial 10-day span allotted to SBA. Congress must be taken to have anticipated that general procurement interests would be given their place. In this instance, the serious risk of after-award cancellations resulting from the Government\u2019s interpretation of the regulation not only would be detrimental to contractors, see John Reiner &amp; Co. v. United States, supra, 325 F.2d at 440, 163 Ct.Cl. at 386-387, but would work to the disadvantage of the Government\u2019s procurement activities. Contracting officers must sometimes act with great dispatch in order to protect the public, as well as the specifically Government, concern. Cf. 9 C.C.F. \u00a7 72697 (1964) (No. B-154428). We believe that paragraph (e), like the regulation in Otis Steel Prods. Corp. v. United States, supra, 316 F.2d 937, 161 Ct.Cl. 694, is an explicit and permissible recognition by the executive of a situation in which the need for speed and certainty outbalances the single-minded enforcement of the policy of the Small Business Act to the limits of its own logic.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>Even so, the defendant says that plaintiff\u2019s case does not fall within paragraph (e). On July 14, 1964, the same day on which he made the award, the contracting officer wrote to Yutan that \u201cany further delay in procurement action on * * * [the invitation for bids] would be disadvantageous to the Government. Accordingly, award was made this date to Mid-West Construction, Ltd.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This written declaration tracks the wording of paragraph (e) and expressly makes the only determination required of the contracting officer by that provision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is some question whether the award was made prior to receipt of Yutan\u2019s appeal, but we think that, even on summary judgment, the record is clear enough to say definitively that the award came first.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In any event, paragraph (e) does not limit the contracting officer\u2019s power to instances in which the award is made before an appeal is noted; the restriction is that he normally wait ten days from the first submission to SBA, and here he waited that long.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">Although first agreeing (in its opening brief) to assume for the purposes of its summary judgment motion that the award action was taken pursuant to paragraph (e), the Government later submitted an affidavit (dated January 30, 1967) by the contracting officer showing, it is claimed, that he did not intend to exercise any authority under paragraph (e) and never made the requisite determination that delay would be harmful.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>We by-pass the point of whether such a <em>post litem motam </em>declaration has any place in a litigation of this kind, because we believe that the affidavit does not require us to reject or disagree with the defendant\u2019s initial concession <em>arguendo. </em>So long as the contracting officer makes the determination required by paragraph (e), it is irrelevant whether he personally knew of the existence of that provision or thought he was acting under it or realized that his finding would result in a binding award despite SBA\u2019s subsequent adverse determination. If the proper finding of injury is made, the regulation applies of its own force. The important thing is the action he took, not whether he cited the section or realized it was on the books. On July 14, 1964, this contracting officer \u2014 as his letter to Yutan expressly says \u2014 decided that \u201cany further delay in procurement action on * * * [the invitation for bids] would be disadvantageous to the Government,\u201d and \u201caccordingly\u201d (i. e., for that reason) he had made an award to Mid-West. If he had been fully aware of paragraph (e) and intended to act under it, he would not have done more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">The affidavit, it must be noted, does not attempt to disavow this specific finding of disadvantage; on the contrary it says that \u201cdelay in the procurement was a factor which was present.\u201d What the affidavit says is that (i) the contracting officer thought that the SBA had finally determined that plaintiff was qualified, and (ii) he did not make any determination \u201cthat Mid-West should obtain the contract whether or not it was a qualified small business.\u201d Even if we were to accept these statements at face value,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> they would have no effect. Under paragraph (e), where the contracting officer decides that \u201cany further delay in procurement action * * * would be disadvantageous to the Government\u201d and therefore makes the award, it does not make any difference that he failed to recognize at that time that the protestant could take further steps. Regardless of the state of SBA consideration (once the initial 10-day period had passed), the paragraph gives the procurement officer power to act promptly if further delay would be injurious\u2014 and that is precisely what he found here. Similarly, it is unimportant that he did not decide that plaintiff should obtain the contract whether or not it was qualified. That was not a determination paragraph (e) called upon him to make. The regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>lation made that decision for itself, once the contracting officer decided that greater delay would be disadvantageous. It was only necessary for him to appraise the impact of further postponement of the award, nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">The question remains whether we should now delve into the contracting officer\u2019s finding that delay would be harmful. In Coastal Cargo Co. v. United States, 351 F.2d 1004, 1007 173 Ct.Cl. 259, 263 (1965), we assumed \u201cthat, under appropriate circumstances, a court could overturn the decision of the contracting officer that an award must be made without delay.\u201d But the defendant does not ask that we send that issue to trial and on the present record there is no reason to reverse this contracting officer\u2019s determination. His affidavit says that \u201coperating personnel desired a road to be constructed\u201d and \u201cdelay in the procurement was a factor which was present.\u201d Moreover, Alaska\u2019s short construction season was drawing to a close. The fact that after the cancellation of plaintiff\u2019s contract it was decided not to build the road is obviously irrelevant to the circumstances existing on July 14, 1964; and the fact that the notice to proceed was not expected to issue until September 1st would not detract from the contractor\u2019s need for time to prepare from July 14th to September 1st. Under the standard of John Reiner &amp; Co. v. United States, supra, 325 F.2d at 440, 163 Ct.Cl. at 386-387, the contracting officer\u2019s factual determination must be accepted as reasonable.

In <em>Prestex, </em>the contracting officer, in accepting the plaintiff\u2019s bid, did not exercise any discretion to decide, on the basis of the known facts, that there was no such substantial deviation. Because of the cryptic nature of the bidder\u2019s exception, the officer did not realize that the bid was quite unresponsive (or could be said to be so) and therefore he failed to see that there was any problem at all. See 320 F.2d at 369-370, 371, 162 Ct.Cl. at 623, 625. Moreover, the plaintiff\u2019s gross departure was unmistakably plain once the facts were revealed.

Any notion that the <em>Otis </em>rule is limited to cases in which the bidder rather than the Government is trying to avoid the contract is dispelled by the court\u2019s statement that, \u201c[i]n the absence of fraud [or bad faith, or the like], defendant was equally bound on the contract with plaintiff.\u201d 316 F.2d at 940, 161 Ct.Cl. at 699.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">.

There is nothing in the paragraph which confines this authority to the period prior to a determination by the SBA regional office (or other low-level determination), and it would be extraordinary to limit it in that fashion since injurious delay can more readily be found the longer the SBA takes to make its ultimate determination. It is significant that the Federal Procurement Regulations on protests as to small business status treat the SBA as a unit and do not distinguish between the layers of authority within that agency. Paragraph (d) of \u00a7 1-1.-703-2 (immediately preceding the paragraph (e) in question) declares flatly that <em>\u201cSBA </em>[not merely the regional office or the Size Standards Division] will, within 10 working days, if possible, after receipt of a protest, investigate and determine the small business status of the protested bidder or offeror and notify the contracting officer, the protestant, and the protested bidder or offeror of its decision\u201d (emphasis added). Similarly, when paragraph (e) refers to \u201cSBA\u2019s determination\u201d it means SBA as a whole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">. The policy of the Act is not wholly neglected since a prompt negative determination by the SBA would foreclose an award to the bidder. In comparison, the late-protest and no-protest situations, in which the bidder\u2019s self-certification is accepted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>envision only industry policing.

Paragraph (e) does not make it mandatory for the contracting officer to ascertain when SBA\u2019s determination can be expected, in the sense that his finding of disadvantage would be automatically invalidated by a failure to try to discover when the final SBA determination would be forthcoming. The sentence in paragraph (e) referring to such an inquiry merely directs the officer\u2019s attention to the main factor bearing on the probable length of the delay. If in fact there will be substantial delay which will be injurious, a finding to that effect is valid even though no attempt is made to ascertain accurately the length of the delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">. The letter to Yutan (note 12 supra) seems to indicate that the award was made before receipt of the appeal on July 14th. In addition, the award notice bears a time-stamp of 10:00 a.m. as the time of sending, and Yutan\u2019s telegram of appeal carries stamps of 2:19 p.m. (copy to the contracting officer) and 5:45 p.m. (copy to the SBA) as the times of receipt. An affidavit by the contracting officer now says that \u201cthe stamps do not <em>necessarily </em>convey an accurate portrayal of the time when I received knowledge of the events portrayed\u201d and that \u201cit was not <em>unusual </em>for me to obtain preliminary notification by telephone before a confirming telegram or letter was dispatched\u201d (emphasis added), but he never says, even tentatively, that in this instance the award was made after he knew of the appeal or after the appeal was taken. The specific proof supplied by the letter of July 14th and by the time-stamps is not weakened enough, so as to call for a trial, by the mere general allegations that the stamps do not \u201cnecessarily\u201d show the accurate times and that it was not \u201cunusual\u201d to receive telephone word in advance of the written document. The defendant does not ask for a trial of the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">.

I do recall that immediately after being informed by S.B.A. of Mid-West small business status, I met with representatives of the Division of Engineering for the purpose of deciding on which proposal to accept. After the decision was made to accept Mid-West\u2019s Proposal 2-C, I met with the Regional Budget Officer to obtain documented assurance sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>funds were available and reserved for Proposal 2-0.

I can definitely recall, however, that I transmitted the award notice expressly upon my belief that it had been finally determined by S.B.A. that Mid-West Construction, Ltd. was a small business qualified to receive the award. That is, while delay in the procurement was a factor which was present (in that operating personnel desired a road to be constructed) I can definitely affirm that the award notice was transmitted only upon my belief that S.B.A. had ruled, finally, that Mid-West Construction, Ltd. was a qualified small business. I did not transmit the award notice upon any determination that Mid-West should obtain the contract whether or not it was a qualified small business, and, to my knowledge, no such determination exists.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">. If the contracting officer was correct in January 1967 in saying that on July 14, 1964, he felt that SBA consideration was already ended, it is very hard to see how he could have signed a letter on that same day, July 14, 1964, expressly acknowledging Yutan\u2019s \u201ctelegram of this date announcing your intention to appeal the Small Business Administration determination that Mid-West Construction Company, Ltd., has small business status * * *,\u2019\u2019 and yet not have notified Mid-West that the award made a few hours before was made on the erroneous assumption that a final SBA decision had been rendered.

Cl. 228, 236 (1960), in which the court rejected the Government\u2019s contentions of plaintiff\u2019s inadequate performance, in part, because \u201cthey are * * * inconsistent * * * with the contemporaneous formal communications over the signature of the contracting officer * * * \u201d that the work was acceptable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
