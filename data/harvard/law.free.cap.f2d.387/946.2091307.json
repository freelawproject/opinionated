See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c); Kelly v. United States Steel Corporation, 284 F.2d 850 (3rd Cir. 1960). Also, appellant has not sustained her burden of proving that the corporate veil of the appellee parent corporation should be pierced to permit her to show that its business and that of its subsidiaries was a unitary enterprise with a principal place of business in Delaware.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Coryell v. Phipps, 128 F.2d 702, 704 (5th Cir. 1942), aff\u2019d. on other grounds, 317 U.S. 406, 63 S.Ct. 291, 87 L.Ed. 363 (1943); Zubik v. Zubik and Drambel, 384 F.2d 267, at pp. 270 &amp; 273 (3rd Cir., opinion of 9/29/67).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-16\">Appellant\u2019s contention that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c) applies only as a limitation on the power of a corporation to remove an action from a state court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>the federal court is rejected. See Canton v. Angelina Casualty Company, 279 F.2d 553, 554 (5th Cir. 1960); 1 Moore, Federal Practice, \u00a7 0.77 [1.2], p. 717.6, n. 10 (2nd Ed. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">. As stated in Kaufman v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, 245 F.2d 918, 920 (3rd Cir. 1957), \u201cthe party asserting it has the burden of proving all the jurisdictional prerequisites,\u201d even though both parties have stipulated to the existence of the necessary jurisdictional facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">. A careful examination of the record requires the denial of appellant\u2019s contention that the discovery rulings in the order of September 26, 1966, prevented her from securing information which might have justified a piercing of the corporate veil. Although defendant had several subsidiaries in September 1964, when this suit was instituted, the record shows that only one subsidiary did business in Delaware, whereas defendant furnished administrative services (just as logically a part of its business as a holding company) for several of its subsidiaries, including the Delaware subsidiary, in New Jersey. Cases dealing with the principal place of business of a subsidiary which does business with its parent have looked to the specific business done by each corporation in determining the principal place of business of each corporation. See Epstein v. Gil-ford Industries, Inc., 218 F.Supp. 286 (S.D.N.Y.1963); Inland Rubber Corporation v. Triple A Tire Service, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 490 (S.D.N.Y.1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
