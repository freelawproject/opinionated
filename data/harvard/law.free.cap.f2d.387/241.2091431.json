Overholser, 369 U.S. 705, 82 S.Ct. 1063, 8 L.Ed.2d 211 (1962). Two additional independent grounds for relief were urged: (1) that because his attorney acquiesced in the introduction of the insanity defense against his wishes, he was deprived of a fair trial; and (2) that in any event D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301 (d) is unconstitutional. The District Court denied relief on all grounds. In this appeal, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>consider the latter two grounds since we think the District Court erred in concluding that Lynch v. Overholser does not apply because petitioner \u201cacquiesced in the assertion of the insanity defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The pertinent facts are not seriously disputed. Petitioner, aged eighteen, was stopped at approximately 1:45 a. m. on Fourteenth and Harvard Street, N. W., by a police officer who had seen him carry a small but heavy suitcase. According to Rouse, he opened the suitcase only on the officer\u2019s order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The case was found to contain a fully loaded .45 caliber automatic pistol and several hundred rounds of ammunition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The officer took Rouse into custody and seized the case and its contents. After consultation with his court-appointed attorney, a motion to suppress was filed on the ground that the search was incident to an unlawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The motion to suppress was never heard. Instead, shortly after it was filed, new counsel retained by petitioner\u2019s mother moved for a pretrial mental examination under D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An affidavit of petitioner\u2019s mother stated her belief that her son was mentally ill and that he could be benefited by treatment. The undisputed testimony at the habeas hearing shows that counsel retained by Rouse\u2019s mother did not confer with appellant prior to filing this motion; that petitioner did not even know new counsel\u2019s identity when he saw him at the hearing on the motion for the pretrial mental examination; and that he thought he was still being represented by assigned counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">The court ordered the requested examination at D. C. General Hospital, which subsequently reported that Rouse was \u201cable to understand the charges against him, and capable of assisting counsel in his own defense.\u201d But the report further stated that he was suffering from a passive-aggressive personality disorder and that the crime was the product of this mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">According to petitioner\u2019s undisputed testimony, he did not confer with his new attorney until just a few moments before the trial commenced. At trial, the Government presented the testimony of the arresting officer and of the examining psychiatrist from D. C. General Hospital. The officer did not say and was not asked about the circumstances under which the suitcase was opened. The examining physician testified on direct and cross-examination that Rouse was mentally ill, dangerous, and treatable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He reiterated the hospital\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>written conclusion that the crime was a product of Rouse\u2019s mental illness. These conclusions were not challenged by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Petitioner and his mother testified for. the defense. She stated on direct examination that her son had been a disciplinary problem to the family for some time, that he had several charges pending against him in Virginia, and that he had purchased the gun he was carrying with a bad check. She also testified that in her opinion the psychiatrist was correct and that her\u2019 son needed treatment. When the defendant took the stand, his own counsel elicited his admission that he had purchased the gun with a bad check. Then counsel asked Rouse, \u201cWhat was it you wanted to tell his Honor * * * in connection with this proceeding?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">A. I had just one thing to say, Mr. Laughlin. I believe the doctor did say I was able to aid in my own defense and I have not had a chance to talk to Mr. Laughlin, consult him since he\u2019s been my attorney. I had Mr. Ochipinti, who was doing a fairly good job with me; at least, discussing what he was going to do. <em>I have not talked, with Mr. Laughlin or my mother about this case. I have no idea what they were going to do in court or anything else, and I think I would have the right to defend myself and, as it was, so far I haven\u2019t been able to say a word up until now.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">Q. <em>Mr. Defendant, do you feel the situation would have been different here had you talked with me, sir? Would it have changed anything here had you talked with me?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">A. <em>Well, I think, in the first place, I had a motion in for illegal search and seizure which I wasn\u2019t given a chance to present to the Court. I don\u2019t know what happened to my other attorney, Mr. Ochipinti. Either my mother or you did something </em>\u2014 one <em>of you; I don\u2019t know which one of you. </em>But, anyway, as I was picked up, they did not have a warrant for me, search or arrest, which they did, and the gun was in a suitcase, a closed suitcase. The police picked me up. They told me to open the suitcase. This policeman \u2014 I had not been doing anything suspicious, anything that would cause him to arrest me. <em>And, therefore, I believe this constitutes illegal search and seizure and, also, would require a suppression of the evidence since the evidence obtained was by the manner of an illegal search.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIL\">Counsel proceeded to elicit from Rouse his agreement that he was mentally ill and in need of treatment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rouse said: \u201cI think I need treatment, but I also think that because of the charges I have pending out in Virginia * * * that I would like to get \u2014 clear this matter up here now and go over there and face those charges growing out of this.\u201d Counsel continued to lead his client: \u201cBut it is your testimony \u2014 in other words, you feel sure that your mother is correct, isn\u2019t she, that you need treatment and that you might be cured of this mental ailment?\u201d Rouse responded: \u201cTo some extent her testimony is correct, yes. But what I feel \u2014 actually, this may be psychological. * * * I don\u2019t know. But I feel that I\u2019ve been lured into this thing because I haven\u2019t had a chance to say a word.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">At this point, counsel stated for the record his explanation regarding why he waived the motion to suppress made by petitioner\u2019s prior assigned counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-14\">I want to say that I took it upon myself to waive any hearing on the motion to suppress because of the circumstances in this case, because our belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u2014the belief of the mother and my belief and * * * [the U. S. Attorney\u2019s] belief \u2014 -is that this man needs treatment. * * * The District Attorney was willing that that be argued but I saw no purpose in it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The defense thereupon rested,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> waived final argument, and urged the court to find Rouse not guilty by reason of insanity, and to commit him accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The record plainly reveals that the lawyer retained by the petitioner\u2019s mother invoked the insanity defense at her direction against the express wishes of petitioner; that petitioner made a substantial effort to divorce himself from the decisions which his mother and the lawyer she retained made in his behalf; and that petitioner\u2019s desire for treatment neither negated nor contradicted his wish to defend against the criminal charge or his belief that he had been \u201clured into\u201d an insanity plea.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Mandatory commitment under D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301(d) is permissible only if a <em>\u201cdefendant </em>acquitted on the ground of insanity * * * <em>has affirmatively relied on a defense of insanity.\u201d </em>Lynch v. Overholser, 369 U.S. 705, 710, 82 S.Ct. 1063, 1067, 8 L.Ed.2d 211 (1962) (emphasis supplied). The Supreme Court \u201cheld that Congress did not intend to allow automatic commitment * * * <em>when the defense </em>* * * <em>is thrust upon a defendant who objects.\u201d </em>Cameron v. Mullen, \u2014 U.S.App.D.C. \u2014, 387 F.2d 193, decided March 2, 1967 (emphasis supplied). We think the District Court\u2019s determination that petitioner himself sought the introduction of the insanity defense at this trial was clearly erroneous. And, in light of petitioner\u2019s apparent disabilities, including, for example his lack of financial means and learning in the law, and the likelihood that he has been suffering from some mental illness, we also reject the court\u2019s finding that petitioner evidenced his acquiescence in the insanity defense by waiting almost four years to attack the validity of his mandatory commitment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-24\">It follows that the trial court had no authority to commit the petitioner following his acquittal by reason of insanity. See Cameron v. Mullen, <em>supra. </em>The Government is free, of course, to seek his commitment now under the 1964 Hospitalization of the Mentally Ill Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-25\">We reverse the judgment below and remand with instructions to grant the writ, conditioned upon giving the Government a reasonable opportunity to institute civil commitment proceedings if it wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-26\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\">.

If any person tried upon an indictment or information for an offense, or tried in the juvenile court of the District of Columbia for an offense, is acquitted solely on the ground that he was insane at the time of its commission, the court shall order such person to be confined in a hospital for the mentally ill. D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301 (d) (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">We note that appellant has remained at Saint Elizabeths for almost five years, even though the maximum sentence for carrying a weapon without a license is only one year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b298-23\">. Rouse brought an earlier habeas corpus action seeking release on the grounds that he was receiving no treatment for his mental condition at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, and that he had recovered his sanity. The District Court denied relief and on appeal we remanded the case for further proceedings. See Rouse v. Cameron, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 366, 373 F.2d 451 (1967). Relief was again denied, and Rouse\u2019s appeal from that denial, No. 20,881, was heard with the present appeal. Our disposition of this appeal renders moot the issues raised in No. 20,-881.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">. See petitioner\u2019s affidavit filed with his pretrial motion to suppress the seized evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b299-9\">. Also found in the suitcase were two electric drills, six bits, one hack saw, two blades, a twenty-five foot extension cord, and a pair of leather gloves.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">According to the psychiatrist who testified at petitioner\u2019s trial, Rouse carried the weapon because he felt he needed protection. However, when petitioner was asked at trial why he carried the gun, he refused to answer. There is no evidence that Rouse ever used the weapon or the tools in the commission of a crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b299-11\">.

Consideration of a person\u2019s likely danger to the community is appropriate in civil commitment proceedings. See, <em>e.ff., </em>D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 21-544, 21-545 (Supp. V, 1966). But such a consideration is plainly irrelevant in a criminal trial. There, the issues are whether the accused committed the acts charged and, if so, whether the acts were the product of a mental disease or defect. Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>is treatability an appropriate consideration at a criminal trial. Its relevance may even be doubtful in a civil commitment determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b300-10\">. Counsel also asked: \u201cAnd * * * you indicated last week that you didn\u2019t want to go to jail; you wanted to go to either D.O. General Hospital or St. Elizabeths Hospital.\u201d Rouse answered: , \u201cThat\u2019s quite true.\u201d Since all the testimony shows that Rouse had not conferred with this attorney, we assume that the attorney received this information from Rouse\u2019s mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\">. In resting his case, counsel stated: \u201cWe have nothing else, your Honor, and, in my judgment, I don\u2019t believe it requires any argument. It is plain, your Honor, under all the reported cases that this man does need treatment and we do have an excellent institution at St. Elizabeths Hospital, and I believe that since he is young in years, he can overcome this, and I think it would be a serious danger to inflict him on the community.\u201d Perhaps because counsel abandoned any defense on the merits and because he seemed so anxious to have his client committed as mentally ill and dangerous, the trial judge became confused as to the nature of the proceeding before him. He asked: \u201cAnd the purpose of this \u2014 this is a trial?\u201d Thus, it clearly appears that counsel succeeded in converting the criminal trial into a commitment proceeding without any of the safeguards of civil commitment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b301-27\">. We note that, according to the affidavit of petitioner\u2019s original court-appointed attorney filed in the habeas corpus hearing below, petitioner never suggested the possibility of raising the insanity defense in their discussion regarding the ease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b301-28\">. Rouse testified at the habeas corpus hearing that he first became aware of the legal significance of what had occurred at his trial when he read a newspaper account of this court\u2019s decision in Cameron v. Mullen, <em>supra. </em>He also stated that he told counsel who represented him in prior habeas corpus actions about the manner in which he had been committed, and that they told him he had \u201cno legal grounds\u201d for habeas corpus and that the commitment \u201cwas over and done with.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b301-29\">. D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 21-501 \u2014 21-591 (Supp. V, 1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>DANAHER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AoX\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">I wish to emphasize my view, once again,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that this case should not have occasioned our concern in the first place. I had earlier set forth as an Appendix<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the opinion delivered by Judge Holtzoff after he heard testimony by the Government\u2019s psychiatrist concerning the extensive treatment afforded to Rouse, and the evidence offered by Dr. Marland, the expert called by the appellant. Dr. Marland testified that Rouse had had \u201cseveral attorneys\u201d who had requested his expert services. He believed Rouse should not be regarded as mentally ill, indeed he said, if Rouse, after release, should duplicate his earlier conduct, the place for him is jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The trial judge then continued the case for some two weeks to permit an examination to be made by Dr. Bunge, a member of the Mental Health Commission. The latter testified that Rouse had been suffering from a mental disorder when he was arrested in September, 1962, but by November, 1965, he was no longer mentally ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The treatment at St. Elizabeths had been such, and recovery had so far progressed, that Dr. Bunge felt further hospitalization would \u201cstifle his future development.\u201d He found that Rouse did not come within the diagnosis of the Government\u2019s expert, indeed he would no longer be a menace if released.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">So it was that Judge Holtzoff\u2019s November, 1965 opinion <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reflected the sheer common sense of a judge who had carefully explored the claims of Rouse and his attorney that the evidence showed Rouse should be released. The trial judge noted the progress Rouse had made under St. Elizabeths care, then urged him to resume cooperation with the staff, and gave assurance that if the staff authorities failed thereafter to recommend a conditional release, the judge himself would entertain a renewed request.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-18\">We should have affirmed, right then and there. But had we done so, we would not have had an opportunity in No. 19863 to order a remand for a hearing and findings \u201cconcerning treatment\u201d and its adequacy respecting a patient as to whom there had been three different diagnoses by three different experts. Although there has been no suggestion from any member of this court that a mental patient, committed after a criminal proceeding, is not entitled to treatment, a majority purported to find a basis for its action in the \u201cDistrict of Columbia Hospitalization of the Mentally III Act,\u201d 78 Stat. 944, as amended. I pointed out in my <em>dissent</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the fallacy of that predicate, especially since the Act in so many words says that the term \u201cmentally ill person\u201d shall <em>not </em>\u201cinclude a person committed to a private or public hospital in the District of Columbia by order of the court in a criminal proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-19\">In the hearing after remand many of St. Elizabeths leading experts testified as did others. Again, Rouse failed to make out a case, notwithstanding which he brought his appeal in our No. 20881. My colleagues now moot that appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the Dutch took Holland in the first opinion, <em>swpra </em>note 1, the leak in the dike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>finally in No. 20881 submerged the erstwhile victors, for they cannot surmount the record there made after remand.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Realization of the likely development of that circumstance, no doubt, is not unrelated to the institution of another <em>habeas </em>petition filed April 11,1967. Begun after three previous <em>habeas </em>actions, nearly five years after the original Rouse arrest, we find <em>for the first time </em>a claim that Rouse\u2019s mother and his privately retained counsel had \u201crailroaded\u201d him into St. Elizabeths. After a hearing, judgment having gone against him, Rouse now has presented the instant appeal in our No. 20962. Seizing upon this as a vehicle, a majority again reverses, and this court has come full cycle!</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Thus I wish to dissociate myself from what has been happening here. I reiterate previously expressed views that Congress should create an entity to deal with all problems<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> arising with respect to those alleged to be mentally ill when charged with the commission of a criminal offense. In particular, I reassert the firm conviction that those seeking exculpation from criminal responsibility for their offenses on the ground of lack of mental capacity should be required affirmately to assert and establish that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">BURGER and TAMM, Circuit Judges, concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\">.
