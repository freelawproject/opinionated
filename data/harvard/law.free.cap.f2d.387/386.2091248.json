The allegations are sufficient to require such a hearing. Townsend v. Sain (1963), 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770; Waley v. Johnston (1942), 316 U.S. 101, 62 S.Ct. 964, 86 L.Ed. 1302; Carpenter v. Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1967, 372 F.2d 940; Broxson v. Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1967, 372 F.2d 944; Murphy v. Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1967, 372 F.2d 942. The decision of the district court which denied this petition for a writ of habeas corpus without holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>an evidentiary hearing is hereby reversed and the cause is remanded for a hearing on the issue of whether appellant\u2019s plea of guilty was understandingly and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
