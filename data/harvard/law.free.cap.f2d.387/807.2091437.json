The defendant filed a pre-trial motion for a bill of particulars pursuant to Rule 7 (f) Fed.R.Ckim.P. After the Government filed an answer in opposition to the granting of the motion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court denied the motion, stating only, \u201cDefendant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars is denied.\u201d The sole question in this appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\"> In order for this court to properly review whether a district court has abused its discretion in denying a motion for a bill of particulars, we must be apprized of some of the factors governing the court\u2019s disposition of the motion. Cf. Will v. United States, 389 U.S. 90, 88 S.Ct. 269, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967). The record in this case, however, gives no indication of the basis for the district court\u2019s action. Both the orderly administration of criminal justice and due observance of the rights of an accused require that the district court articulate in terms that appear in the record the reason for exercising his discretion in denying a request for a bill of particulars. See e. g., United States v. Rosenfeld, 264 F.Supp. 760 (N.D. Ill. 1967). Such action by the district court is imperative if we are to perform our function on review in an informed manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Despite the silence of the record with respect to the reasons underlying the court\u2019s disposition of the defendant\u2019s motion, an examination of the record does not disclose reversible error in the district court\u2019s action. On several occasions, we have enunciated the kind of showing a defendant must make to successfully attack the denial of a motion for a bill of particulars. In United States v. Micele, 327 F.2d 222, 226 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 952, 84 S.Ct. 1628, 12 L.Ed.2d 496 (1964), we found no error in the denial of a motion for a bill of particulars, stating that by means of the indictment the defendant was \u201csufficiently \u2018apprised of the nature of the offense charged\u2019 * * * and there was * * * \u2018no danger of a violation of the principles of double jeopardy.\u2019 \u201d In United States v. White, 370 F.2d 559, 560 (7th Cir. 1966), we reached the same conclusion as we did in <em>Micele, </em>stating that there was no showing either that the defendant was \u201csurprised by evidence he was unprepared to meet or that he was unable to prepare a proper defense because of the insufficiency of the charge.\u201d The defendant in this case has likewise failed to demonstrate that he has suffered any prejudice by reason of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Of course, every denial of a defendant\u2019s request for a bill of particulars may in some measure make the preparation of his defense more onerous. But a demonstration of this generalized kind of prejudice is insufficient to override the broad discretionary power vested in a district court with respect to such requests. If only a generalized showing of prejudice were sufficient, perhaps the defendant would always be entitled to a bill of particulars. Although the law of discovery in criminal eases has recently been liberalized, that development has yet to materialize.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-12\">. In its answer, the Government responded to two of the seventeen requests for particulars.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
