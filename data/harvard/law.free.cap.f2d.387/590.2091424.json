They brought the instant action under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2671 et seq., alleging in their complaint that the decedent\u2019s death resulted from his negligent treatment at an Army hospital. The District Court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action, with prejudice, on its view that it was precluded by Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">On this appeal the plaintiffs contend that <em>Feres </em>no longer has vitality in the light of subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. We rejected the identical contention in Sheppard v. United States, 369 F.2d 272 (3 Cir. 1966), cert. den. 386 U.S. 982, 87 S.Ct. 1286, 18 L.Ed.2d 230 (1967), in affirming the District Court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of an action brought by the administrators of the estates of three United States Marines who had been killed in the crash of a United States Air Force plane while they were on active duty. In doing so we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-11\">\u201cThe flat statement is made on behalf of appellants in their brief that \u2018 * * subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court destroyed the validity of that case [Feres v. United States, supra]\u2019. Nothing could be further from the true fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">It is pertinent to note that two of the three suits decided in <em>Feres </em>charged malpractice on the part of military doctors in military hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">It may also be noted that we recently gave effect to the <em>Feres </em>doctrine in Bailey v. DeQuevedo, 375 F.2d 72 (3 Cir. 1967), cert. den. 389 U.S. 923, 88 S.Ct. 247, 19 L.Ed.2d 274. We there held that under that doctrine \u201can enlisted man in the armed services of the United States cannot maintain an action against an Army medical surgeon for negligence in an operation performed at an Army hospital in line of duty\u201d. 375 F.2d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">The Order of the District Court dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action with prejudice will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
