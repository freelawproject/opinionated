Appellants made a prima facie case for recovery against the ship and her owners by introducing clean bills of lading and the stipulation that the cargo, when discharged, was damaged by suspended rust particles. Respondents defended on the ground that they had used due diligence in assuring the seaworthiness of the vessel prior to loading, and that the damage had been caused by Hurricane Carla, a peril of the sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-22\">The District Court, in its opinion reported at 257 F.Supp. 91, accepted the view of Respondents and adjudged them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>not liable. Only the findings of fact are challenged on this appeal. We find ample support in the evidence for the thorough summary of the Court below; Appellants\u2019 challenge falls far short of demonstrating clear error. McAllister v. United States, 348 U.S. 19, 20, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20 (1954); C. J. Dick Towing Co. v. The Leo, 202 F.2d 850 (5th Cir. 1953). The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"App\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
