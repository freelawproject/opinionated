The action sought to determine whether General Accident was obligated to defend Harper and pay damages claimed by the injured parties in any actions instituted against him as a result of the collision in which he was driving one of the cars. General Accident became involved in this insurance coverage dispute by issuing an automobile liability insurance policy to Paul Stuffel. The policy was known as a \u201cfamily policy,\u201d covered three automobiles, and was issued for one year effective November 17, 1961. One of the automobiles covered by the policy was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>1951 Mercury titled in the name of Paul, but equitably owned by his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">On February 15, 1962, after he reached the age of twenty-one, Joseph sold the Mercury and purchased a 1957 Pontiac in his own name. On the day of the purchase, his mother, Opal, telephoned William Marshall, General Accident\u2019s agent. She told him that Joseph had purchased the Pontiac, and she requested coverage for that car. Marshall told her that the Pontiac could be covered under the family policy so long as Joseph remained a resident of the Stuffel household. Later, General Accident issued an endorsement to Paul\u2019s policy, eliminating the Mercury and adding the Pontiac. In addition, certain premiums paid for coverage on the Mercury were transferred to provide like coverage for the Pontiac.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">On June 22, 1962 Harper, while driving the Pontiac with Joseph Stuffel\u2019s permission, was in the accident which resulted in the assertion of damage claims against him by the injured parties. Although Maryland Casualty had issued a policy covering Harper\u2019s liability while operating Joseph's Pontiac, that company claimed that General Accident owed primary coverage to Harper, thereby precipitating this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The district court heard the case on stipulated facts, holding that General Accident was obligated to defend Harper and to pay any judgment rendered against him to the maximum extent of the coverage in Paul Stuffel\u2019s policy. General Accident asserts error by reason of a finding and a conclusion of law based thereon which determined that Harper was covered on General Accident\u2019s policy issued to Paul Stuffel at the time he was driving Joseph\u2019s Pontiac.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">We believe Marshall\u2019s statement conditioning coverage of Joseph\u2019s Pontiac under his father\u2019s policy on Joseph remaining a member of the Stuffel household, considered together with the terms and definitions of General Accident\u2019s policy, resolves the disputed issue of coverage with respect to Harper. Since Harper was not a named insured under General Accident\u2019s policy, his coverage under that policy depends upon whether the Pontiac was an \u201cowned\u201d or a \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobile as those terms are defined in the policy. If the Pontiac came within the former definition, a proposition vigorously contested by General Accident, Harper would be covered under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">A \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobile is defined in the policy as one \u201cnot owned by or furnished for the regular use of either the named insured or any relative, * * By reason of this definition, Joseph\u2019s Pontiac was not a \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobile since Joseph owned the Pontiac and he was a relative of the named insured, his father.' Moreover, \u201crelative\u201d is defined in the policy to mean \u201ca relative of the named insured who is a <em>resident of the same </em>household.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">If Joseph did not reside in his father\u2019s household, an argument for the coverage of his Pontiac as a \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobile could be made. Under those circumstances, he would not come within the definition of \u201crelative\u201d and consequently the definition of \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobile would literally apply to him. However, Marshall\u2019s statement requiring Joseph to remain a member of his father\u2019s household to obtain coverage, thereby guaranteeing that the car could not comply with the definition of \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobile, forecloses General Accident\u2019s argument that it waived the term \u201crelative\u201d in the definition of \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-14\">On the other hand, Marshall\u2019s statement to Mrs. Stuffel conditioning coverage on Joseph remaining in the household is consistent with the view, urged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>by Maryland Casualty, that Joseph\u2019s Pontiac was covered under his father\u2019s family policy as an \u201cowned\u201d automobile (just as his Mercury had been), thereby affording coverage to Harper as a person insured under the policy. We arrive at this conclusion for several interdependent reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">First, when Mrs. Stuffel called Marshall, he told her that the car could be put on the family policy. She said that she told him her husband \u201cthought a separate policy would have to be written but Mr. Marshall said <em>it didn\u2019t make any difference that the car was in Joe\u2019s name </em>since he was a member of our household.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Second, General Accident\u2019s endorsement, adding the Pontiac to the family policy, recites that the premiums for bodily injury, property damage, and medical payments, paid initially by Paul on his son\u2019s Mercury, were to be transferred to provide like coverage on the Pontiac. Moreover, the endorsement states that it is to become part of the family policy issued to Paul. Both statements are consistent with the view that Marshall was treating the Pontiac like the Mercury, as an \u201cowned\u201d automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Third, the definitions and terms of Paul\u2019s policy, considered with Marshall\u2019s statement requiring that Joseph remain a member of the household, leads to the conclusion that Joseph was an insured \u201cwith respect to the owned automobile\u201d as those words are used in the policy. If the Pontiac was an \u201cowned\u201d automobile, Joseph would be a person insured due to the fact that he was a \u201cresident of the same household\u201d as his father, the named insured. Thus Marshall\u2019s requirement concerning Joseph\u2019s residence is consistent with finding that Joseph was a person insured \u201cwith respect to the owned automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The only inconsistency within the terms of the policy in finding Joseph to be a \u201cperson insured\u201d \u201cwith respect to the owned automobile\u201d is that the definition of \u201cowned automobile\u201d requires that the automobile be owned by the \u201cnamed insured.\u201d But Marshall was aware of the fact that Joseph and not Paul owned the Pontiac. For the reasons just stated, we believe that Marshall\u2019s knowledge of the true ownership of the Pontiac together with his requirement conditioning coverage of that car on Joseph\u2019s residence, indicate that Marshall, as agent of General Accident, was consciously overlooking that part of the definition of \u201cowned automobile\u201d which required that the automobile be owned by the named insured.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Under the broad coverage endorsement of his father\u2019s policy, Joseph, as an insured \u201cwith respect to the owned automobile,\u201d could afford the alleged tortfeasor Harper with coverage. The endorsement amends the definition of \u201cpersons insured\u201d \u201cwith respect to the owned automobile\u201d to include \u201cany other person using such automobile, provided the actual use thereof is with the permission of * * * <em>an adult member of his household.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus Joseph\u2019s permission to Harper to operate the Pontiac resulted in Harper being covered under General Accident\u2019s policy as a \u201cperson insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">We conclude that the findings and conclusions of the district court were not erroneous. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">PERTINENT PROVISIONS OF THE GENERAL ACCIDENT POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">PERSONS INSURED</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">The following are insureds under Part I:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-17\">(a) With respect to the owned automobile,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-18\">(1) the named insured and any resident of the same household,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-19\">(2) any other person using such automobile, provided the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>use thereof is with the permission of the named insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-4\">(b) With respect to a non-owned automobile,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-5\">(1) the named insured,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\">(2) any relative, but only with respect to a private passenger automobile or trailer, provided the actual use thereof is with the permission of the owner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP8\">DEFINITIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Under Part I:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-9\">\u201cnamed insured\u201d means the individual named in Item 2 of the declarations and also includes his spouse, if a resident of the same household; \u201cinsured\u201d means a person or organization described under \u201cPersons Insured\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-10\">\u201crelative\u201d means a relative of the named insured who is a resident of the same household;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-11\">\u201cowned automobile\u201d means a private passenger, farm or utility automobile or trailer owned by the named insured, and includes a temporary substitute automobile;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-12\">\u201ctemporary substitute automobile\u201d means any automobile or trailer, not owned by the named insured, while temporarily used as a substitute for the owned automobile or trailer when withdrawn from normal use because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-13\">\u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d means an automobile or trailer not owned by or furnished for the regular use of either the named insured or any relative, other than a temporary substitute automobile;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-14\">******</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-15\">ENDORSEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b848-16\">BROAD COVERAGE ENDORSEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b848-17\">In consideration of the premium at which this policy is written, the following changes in the printed insuring agreements, exclusions and conditions are hereby made.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-18\">PART I \u2014 LIABILITY</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-19\">******</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-20\">PERSONS INSURED</p>\n<p id=\"b848-21\">Paragraph (a) Section 2 is changed to read:</p>\n<p id=\"b848-23\">(a) any other person using such automobile, provided the actual use thereof is with the permission of the named insured or an adult member of his household;</p>\n<p id=\"b848-24\">Paragraph (b) is changed to read:</p>\n<p id=\"b848-25\">(b) with respect to a non-owned automobile ;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-26\">(1) the named insured,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-27\">(2) any relative, but only with respect to a private passenger automobile or trailer, provided the actual use therepf is with the permission of the owner or an adult member of his household;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiF\">******</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\">.
