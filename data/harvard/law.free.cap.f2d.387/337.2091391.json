Ch. 402. After a period of confinement in the Federal Correctional Institute at Petersburg, Virginia, he was transferred on January 10, 1967 to the Springfield College Guidance Center in New York City. The Guidance Center is a pre-release center where inmates are allowed to leave the building provided they have permission of their guidance counsellor. However, all inmates are required to return before the 10 o\u2019clock evening curfew. On February 2, 1967 Frankenberry left the Center and failed to return.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-19\">At trial, appellant\u2019s counsel attempted to show that another inmate had threatened Frankenberry more than six days prior to the date of his departure. The evidence was excluded despite counsel\u2019s contention that it was relevant to the question of appellant\u2019s intent. But the offer of proof did not contain any evidence that Frankenberry intended to return to the Center or that he was under duress or in immediate danger of physical harm at the time that he fled, six days after the last incident in the offer of proof. We find that the trial judge properly excluded the evidence as irrelevant. A possible reason for the appellant\u2019s desire to flee can hardly be evidence that the appellant lacked the intent to- flee.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-20\">Secondly, appellant claims that the prosecutor\u2019s summation was improper because it referred to defendant\u2019s bad character, although the defendant\u2019s character was not in issue. The prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-21\">\u201cThe only thing as jurors that could becloud your deliberations in this mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>ter is any possible sympathy you may find for the defendant by his mere appearance. Whether or not he is as clean-cut as he looks is not for you to decide. That is a matter for the judge at a later time when he has a chance to take in all of the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s background.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">* * *<em>\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">At this point appellant\u2019s counsel interrupted with an objection, which the judge sustained and, after denying counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial, he immediately instructed the jury that \u201c * * * the matter of punishment is solely the burden of the Court. That is not your concern. Just disregard the latter statement, please.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In view of the judge\u2019s prompt action and instruction, and since the jury already knew from the facts of the case that defendant had escaped while serving a sentence for transportation of a stolen automobile in interstate commerce, we do not think that reference to the court\u2019s consideration of circumstances in the defendant\u2019s background was prejudicial error. United States v. Murphy, 374 F.2d 651 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 836, 88 S.Ct. 47, 19 L.Ed.2d 98 (1967); United States v. Caruso, 358 F.2d 184, 186 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 862, 87 S.Ct. 116, 17 L.Ed.2d 88 (1966); United States v. DeAlesandro, 361 F.2d 694, 697 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 842, 87 S.Ct. 94, 17 L.Ed.2d 74 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that illegally seized evidence was introduced at trial. Two weeks after his escape, Frankenberry was arrested in Monterey, California, on an unrelated charge. At the time of the arrest a perfunctory search was made. Then he was taken to a police station less than a mile away and within half an hour a more thorough search was made when appellant was being booked. During the search Frankenberry\u2019s diary was found. Entries from the diary were read to the jury over appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\"> The diary was properly seized in a search incident to the arrest. It is entirely proper and indeed good police practice to make a more careful and thorough search of a person who has been arrested once he is brought to the police station. There are obvious reasons why it is often advisable to conduct a more thorough search at a police station rather than on a public thoroughfare or in a public place and why such a search can be more safely and better conducted in surroundings which are completely under police control. Charles v. United States, 278 F.2d 386, 389 n. 2 (9 Cir. 1960). Accord, Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, 239, 80 S.Ct. 683, 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960). The evidence obtained as a result of a second search at the police station following a valid arrest is admissible. Abel v. United States, supra; Rodgers v. United States, 362 F.2d 358 (8 Cir. 1966); Charles v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-16\">. \u201cThe willful failure of a prisoner to remain within the extended limits of his confinement, or to return within the time prescribed to an institution or facility designated by the Attorney General, shall be deemed an escape from the custody of the Attorney General punishable as provided in chapter <em>So </em>of this title.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4082(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
