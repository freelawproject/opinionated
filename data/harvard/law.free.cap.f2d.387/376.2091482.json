To that opinion we append the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">After the remedial action taken by the district judge, we are satisfied that the record does not disclose, under the rules laid down in United States v. Blue, 384 U.S. 251, 86 S.Ct. 1416, 16 L.Ed.2d 510 (1966), and Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374, rehearing denied 386 U.S. 940, 951, 87 S.Ct. 970, 17 L.Ed.2d 880 (1967), such substantial prejudice to the defendant\u2019s Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment rights that it is appropriate to quash the prosecution and discharge the defendant as a matter of constitutional right. But that is not necessarily the end of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">The government sent for and interviewed defendant\u2019s accountant, itself a proper procedure, and made legitimate inquiry concerning his knowledge of defendant\u2019s tax returns for the prosecution years. But the government did more. Whether at its instance, or by the voluntary act of the accountant, the government availed itself of the accountant\u2019s entire file, <em>including the accountant\u2019s communications with counsel and work papers concerning the preparation of a defense. </em>The government gave notice to defendant\u2019s counsel of what was done, but only after it was done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-15\">In argument, the government expressly disclaimed wrongful intent in what it did, and candidly admitted an extreme, even stupid, error of judgment. The government\u2019s deficiencies in the proper conduct of this prosecution were not erased by notice to counsel of what was done, after it was done. Nevertheless, we are persuaded that in this case wrongful intent was absent. Except for such absence and the lack of substantial prejudice, we would dismiss the prosecution and discharge the defendant under our supervisory power over the district courts of this circuit.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
