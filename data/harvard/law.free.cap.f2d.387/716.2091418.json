Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-16\">We are equally convinced that the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys acted in good faith, upon written authorization from their clients, and that the taxation of the court costs against the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys was erroneous. To assess the costs against the attorneys without notice and a hearing was, of course, wrong. We do not, however, base our ruling on that procedural ground. Nor do we rule on whether the court had <em>power, </em>either inherent or under the statute, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1927, to require the attorneys personally to pay the court costs. We simply hold that the facts and circumstances do not present such an extreme case as would permit the court to tax the costs against the attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-18\">That part of the judgment which taxes costs is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. The costs of appeal are taxed against the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-19\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
