The order arises out of a complaint filed by Garland McVey charging that he had been discharged because of his union activities, in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3) and d).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">The employer insists that the evidence belies the Board\u2019s finding, essential to an 8(a) (3) violation, that the Company knew of McVey\u2019s union activity. It presented no countervailing evidence at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">The testimony indicates that McVey, an employee with an excellent record extending over eight years, was abruptly discharged only a few hours after he had engaged in a heated discussion with an ex-foreman over the benefits of unionization. The Company was aware of the union activity in the plant and had vigorously opposed it. McVey received no warning and while the reason offered was his \u201cbad attitude,\u201d Company officials were evasive and contradictory when pressed for a more acceptable explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">We are convinced that the undisputed facts constitute a sufficient basis for the Board\u2019s finding. Its order will be</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">Enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
