Upon appeal the conviction was affirmed by this court (9 Cir., 345 F.2d 930).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In 1965, the appellant filed, a motion in the district court pursuant to Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, seeking to set aside the sentence imposed by the trial court. This is an appeal from the denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The appellant urges that the Commissioner erred in refusing his request for appointment of counsel at the preliminary hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but he does not direct us to any prejudice suffered by reason of such refusal. Absent a showing of prejudice, denial of counsel at a preliminary hearing is not grounds for reversal of a trial court conviction. Johnson v. United States, 361 F.2d 447 (CA 9), cert. den. 385 U.S. 976, 87 S.Ct. 516, 17 L.Ed. 2d 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">There was ample evidence to convict appellant of \u201cplacing life in jeopardy\u201d within the meaning of subsection (d) of \u00a7 2113. See Wagner v. United States, 264 F.2d 524 (CA 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The appellant\u2019s charge that the trial judge was prejudiced against him because he requested a trial is absurd. He was sentenced to 25 years as provided in \u00a7 2113(d), but the sentence was imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a) (2) allowing appellant to be considered for parole release at any time without serving the minimum of one-third of his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-11\">. At the time of the preliminary hearing, the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 552 (1964) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A, which provides counsel for indigents at such hearings, had not yet become law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-27\">. We were informed when the briefs were filed that appellant, who placed \u201clife in jeopardy\u201d during the robbery, has already been paroled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
