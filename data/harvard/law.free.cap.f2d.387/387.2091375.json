There was no direct appeal, but the appellant exhausted his State post-conviction remedies as is required by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">Following a full evidentiary hearing, the United States District Court granted habeas corpus relief on the authority of Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1963). This Court reversed because <em>Escobedo </em>is not retrospective in effect, Johnson v. State of New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966), but remanded for adjudication of the issue of voluntariness of the alleged confession under pr<em>e-Escobedo </em>standards. Wainwright v. Padgett, 5 Cir., 1966, 363 F.2d 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">In obedience to our mandate, the District Court held another evidentiary hearing at which the appellant and other witnesses testified. The habeas corpus was then denied for the reason that the District Court found appellant\u2019s signed statement of July 15, 1959, to have been voluntarily made. A review of this voluminous record convinces us that the judgment should be affirmed, Smith v. Heard, 5 Cir., 1963, 315 F.2d 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
