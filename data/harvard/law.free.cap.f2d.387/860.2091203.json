Subsequently, however, the dismissal was vacated \u201cwith respect to the jurisdictional [ground] * * * <em>only,\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the question of prosecutorial authority was certified to this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, while there was more than one ground for granting the dismissal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> vacation of the dismissal was as to one ground only. As a consequence, the dismissal is still in effect on independent grounds and has operated to terminate the charges against these appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-20\">The Constitution limits the exercise of federal judicial power to cases and controversies.
