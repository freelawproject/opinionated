At every stage he failed to exhaust, or even avail himself of, administrative remedies. This precludes judicial review of the validity of his classification. See Falbo v. United States, 320 U.S. 549, 64 S.Ct. 346, 88 L.Ed. 305 (1944); Bjorson v. United States, 272 F.2d 244 (9th Cir. 1959); United States v. Rumsa, 212 F.2d 927 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 838, 75 S.Ct. 36, 99 L.Ed. 661 (1954); McGahee v. United States, 163 F.2d 875 (5th Cir. 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">Parenthetically we note that information he furnished the Board, the content of which he claims required the Board to grant him an untimely appeal or to reopen his case though he did not request reopening, itself reveals that He was not entitled to the classification which he says the Board should have given him upon appeal or reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-15\">There is no merit to the charge that Board procedure violated substantive due process because after it received the information furnished by appellant the Board did not convene in official and formal hearing and allow him to appear in person. There was nothing for the Board to meet about, no hearing was sought, and no request made for a personal appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-16\">After notice to report for induction was issued appellant wrote the Board and for the first time claimed to be a conscientious objector. That claim is not urged on this appeal, so we do not comment on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-18\">. 50 U.S.C.A.App. \u00a7 462.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
