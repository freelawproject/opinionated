United States, No. 325-62; and Connecticut Tire Company, Inc. v. United States, No. 326-62, Ct.Cl., 386 F.2d 1008, decided this day. In those cases, the plaintiffs were importers of tire carcasses who, in turn, sold the items imported to firms engaged in the actual recapping process. The only factual distinction between those cases and this case is that the plaintiff in the instant case is itself a recapper of tire carcasses and that it actually did recap those tire carcasses which it imported.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>ion in <em>Select </em>and <em>Connecticut, </em>holding the imported tire carcasses not to be \u201ctires\u201d taxable under Section 4071(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S. C. \u00a7 4071(a)), applies equally to the facts herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In <em>Select </em>and <em>Connecticut </em>the Government bottomed its position on Sections 4071 and 4072 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. In the instant case, the Government\u2019s starting point was Section 4218(a) (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Briefly, that Section places a tax upon the manufacturer, producer, or importer of a tire who \u201cuses it\u201d and provides for equating such \u201cuse\u201d with a sale under Section 4071. Apparently the Government by this rationale hopes not to disturb the holding in Skinner v. United States, 8 F.Supp. 999 (S.D.Ohio, 1934), that a retreader is not a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d, as to domestic carcasses, but to avoid any application of the case to foreign carcasses. At this time we need not decide whether Gordy \u201cused\u201d the imported tire carcasses when it re-caped them, so as to subject them to tax. It is enough to state that the item that is \u201cused\u201d must be a \u201ctire.\u201d And, under the principles set forth in <em>Select </em>and <em>Connecticut, </em>the tire carcasses imported and retreaded by Gordy were not \u201ctires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-q\">For the reasons enunciated herein, judgment is entered for the plaintiff. The amount of recovery will be determined pursuant to Rule 47(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">COLLINS, Judge, took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-11\">. It is appropriate to state at this point that the transcript of the testimony and the exhibits in <em>Select </em>and <em>Connecticut </em>were the subject of a stipulation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>parties here. That stipulation was that the testimony and exhibits may be considered as evidence in this case in order to obviate the necessity for a trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b719-9\">.
