The process involves applying pressure through a stencil screen placed over the material to be printed shortly before a doctor roller applies printing dye through the image areas of the screen. According to appellant, the purpose of the pressure application is to deaerate the textile material, thereby improving the penetration of the dye. Appellant\u2019s apparatus employs a second roller\u2014 termed a \u201cpressure roller\u201d and placed just in front of the doctor roller \u2014 to apply the pressure, as reflected in claim 8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-24\">8. Device for the printing of textiles of great thickness such as carpets comprising a screen stencil to be placed on the material to be treated, a color doctor movable above said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>screen stencil for the application of a dye to said material and a pressure roller to deaerate the material to be treated moving jointly with and parallel to said doctor thus rolling before said doctor and said dye on said screen stencil, whereby the treated material is deaerated along its entire breadth prior to applying the dye.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">The examiner noted that both Courtney and Zimmer disclose apparatus for screen printing of textiles which employs two rollers for appying ink through the stencil. He thought it apparent that the front or leading roller of the double roller arrangement of either reference \u201cwould inherently act as a pressure roller to deaerate a portion of the material to be treated\u201d while the back or trailing roller acts as a doctor roller to apply the dye. The examiner also observed that Zimmer, like appellant, initially places the dye between the two rollers and that Courtney, in disclosing spraying dye \u201con the leading side and/or trailing side\u201d of the rollers, rendered initial placement of the dye between the rollers obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">The board agreed, adding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-7\">Obviously, in both patents it is contemplated that the rollers must be subjected to considerable pressure which would inherently compress the fabric material being printed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\"> Appellant has presented no argument which convinces us of error in the reasoning of the examiner and board. While it is true, as appellant contends, that neither reference expressly discloses that the textile material is \u201cdeaerated\u201d prior to the application of the dye by the doctor roller, Courtney does clearly disclose that his rollers are adjustable to roll over the stencil screen \"with a downward pressure according to the depth of penetration [of the dye] required.\u201d We have considered appellant\u2019s arguments, unsupported by evidence, as to the alleged operation of the apparatus disclosed by those references in practice. In our view, however, the examiner and board have read nothing into the disclosure and operation of the references which one of ordinary skill in the art would not understand to be implicitly there. The fact that both references are foreign patents is immaterial in that regard.

Error was properly assigned as to each in appellant\u2019s assignment of reasons for appeal, although appellant\u2019s brief is primarily directed to the initial two rejections. Under these circumstances it is my belief that the majority should have explicitly set forth the ground or grounds of rejection on which it relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-15\">A review of these rejections demonstrates the desirability of specifying the precise basis of the majority opinion for several reasons: (1) such a statement assures a careful analysis of the claims and prior art according to the applicable statutory ground of rejection thus enunciated, (2) it governs any further proceedings in the appeal, and (3) it governs further proceedings in the Patent Office should appellant decide to exercise his right to file continuation or continuation-in-part applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-16\">In his final rejection, the examiner considered claims 5 and 6 as \u201cunpatentable over each of Zimmer or Courtney.\u201d The statutory ground or grounds of rejection were not set forth, nor was language used from which the statutory basis for this rejection could be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-17\">In his Answer, however, the statement of that rejection is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-18\">Claims 7 and 8 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102 as unpatentable over Zimmer. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>Claims 7 and 8 are further rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as unpatentable over Courtney. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">The board was less clear. It first stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-5\">* * * we find no reversible error in the Examiner\u2019s holding that the subject matter of the claims on appeal is made obvious to one ordinarily skilled in the art by the prior art.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A23\">Since the \u201cprior art\u201d to which the board refers is unstated, the only reasonable interpretation is that the board affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 based upon the Courtney reference. In any event, no other reference was cited by the examiner in support of an \u201cobviousness\u201d rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">The board also agreed with the examiner that claims 7 and 8 are \u201cunpatentable over Zimmer under 35 U.S.C. 102 * * Thus, at this point, both of the grounds of rejection explicitly stated by the examiner were affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AbX\">However, the board continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-9\">* * * In any event, it is obvious that the rollers of Fig. 8 of Zimmer could be machine driven in the manner shown in Fig. 5 of Courtney. Likewise, the ink could be applied only between the rollers of Fig. 5 of Courtney, as taught by Zimmer, instead of being applied by means of a felt pad. Obviously, in both patents it is contemplated that the rollers must be subjected to considerable pressure which would inherently compress the fabric material being printed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">The invention, as claimed in claim 7, is directed to a process, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABo\">7. Process for the printing of textiles of great thickness such as carpets comprising disposing a screen stencil on the material to be printed, then compressing said material upon said stencil to deaerate a portion thereof immediately preceding the application of the dye and then applying the dye on said deaerated portion of the material to be treated by means of a color doctor through said screen stencil.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApRl\">Appellant explains that the tendency of the long-haired or thick webs of materials to inhibit the penetration of the dye is overcome by compressing the material to be dyed along a strip in parallel with the color doctor. Appellant attributes the improved results allegedly achieved by his invention to \u201cdeaeration,\u201d and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-13\">Thus, the material is quasi deaerated before application of the dye so that complete penetration of the color spread by a doctor is guaranteed down to the bottom of the material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-14\">Both of the appealed claims require compression to the point of \u201cdeaeration.\u201d Appellant here argues that the question involved is whether the references alone or in combination disclose the provision of a deaerated zone immediately before the printing roller.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-15\">In my view, the rejection of claims 7 and 8 over Zimmer under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 cannot be sustained. Zimmer does not contain sufficient disclosure to \u201canticipate\u201d the invention as claimed, particularly with respect to the compression effecting \u201cdeaeration\u201d of the material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-16\">However, it seems clear that the differences between the appealed claims and the Courtney patent are such that, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, the claimed invention, considered as a whole, would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time it was made. I would, therefore, affirm the decision of the board solely on this ground.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
