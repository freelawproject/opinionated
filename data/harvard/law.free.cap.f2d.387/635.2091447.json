Two separate suits were filed in the state court and were removed to the United States District Court where they were consolidated and jointly tried. The litigation arose out of a collision between the automobile in which the appellant\u2019s sons were riding and a truck owned and operated by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-20\">The appellant specifies a number of errors in the conduct of the trial, but they may be summarized as raising essentially the following questions: (1) the jury verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence; (2) the court erred in its rulings on the admissibility of evidence; (3) the cases should not have been consolidated for trial; and (4) the court erred in its instructions to the jury with respect to proximate cause, negligence generally, and comparative and contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-22\">While appellant urges all of the specifications of error, her chief argument seems to center around the contention that the jury was confused because the cases were tried together and the court\u2019s instructions did not adequately inform the jury as to the two separate standards of care and conduct which applied to the driver and the passenger in the automobile. It is claimed that if the court\u2019s instructions had properly and adequately delineated distinctions between the case of the driver of the automobile, the older son, and that of the guest or passenger, the younger son, the verdict would likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>have been favorable to appellant, at least in the case of the younger son.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">With the contentions of the appellant clearly in mind we have examined the court\u2019s instructions carefully and critically. We disagree with appellant and find the charge to be adequate and sufficient. We have also given careful consideration to the other contentions of appellant and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
