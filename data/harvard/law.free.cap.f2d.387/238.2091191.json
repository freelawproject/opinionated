At the hearing on the motion, a psychiatrist testified that appellant was suffering from a \u201csevere personality problem,\u201d and at times in the past had been \u201cmentally ill.\u201d The doctor testified further that appellant had an \u201cexplosive temper\u201d and \u201cbrittle\u201d behavior controls. The doctor had \u201csome questions\u201d on whether appellant would be dangerous if released, but felt that appellant was definitely amenable to treatment and that his chances for recovery would be much greater if he were released. The district court judge concluded that appellant \u201cmight not likely be present when this matter were called * * * and, also, if he were released, he would present a great danger to the public.\u201d The order denying the motion recited that \u201cdefendant has a prior criminal record for violence and a prior history of mental illness,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>that \u201cdefendant is * * * alleged to have stabbed the decedent to death with a knife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"> We think the failure to consider the possibility of a disposition other than a) release on conventional bail conditions or b) confinement in jail, constitutes a fundamental defect in the proceedings below. Though charged with a capital offense, appellant was entitled to be released on such conditions as were reasonably calculated to assure that he would not flee or pose a danger to the community, unless the district court judge had \u201creason to believe that no one or more conditions of release\u201d would provide such assurance. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148 (Supp.1966). The court\u2019s determination that appellant was likely to flee and/or pose a danger to the community was largely based on appellant\u2019s history of mental illness. But the record reveals no consideration of conditions of release directed to that problem. Without consideration of alternatives to conventional bail conditions, the district court judge could have no reason for believing that there were <em>\u201cno </em>[satisfactory] conditions of release.\u201d Logic, humanity and law require such consideration in this case, in an effort to avoid frustration of appellant\u2019s chances for recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We therefore remand for reconsideration of appellant\u2019s motion for release, after a supplemental hearing to determine whether facilities exist for accommodating the needs of appellant and the community. The court may require both counsel to present information on a wide range of alternatives, including, but not limited to: confinement in a hospital or other institution capable of providing both treatment and supervision; confinement in such an institution with provision for daytime release in a supervised work program; or release into the community with provision for outpatient care and custodial supervision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">TAMM, Circuit Judge, dissents from the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-14\">. In 1960, appellant was acquitted by reason of insanity on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, carrying a dangerous weapon, and assault on a police officer. In 1963 he escaped from Saint Elizabeths Hospital and committed a robbery, for which he was convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b296-20\">. Compare Lake v.
