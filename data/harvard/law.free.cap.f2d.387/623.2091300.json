He brought suit against the railroad which in turn asserted a claim for indemnity against Wm. Spencer &amp; Son Corporation, plaintiff\u2019s employer. The jury returned a special verdict, finding that the railroad was negligent, that its barge was unseaworthy, that plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence, that the negligence of Wm. Spencer &amp; Son Corporation did not contribute to the accident, and that plaintiff had suffered damages of $75,000. Judgment was entered awarding plaintiff this amount and dismissing the third party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The railroad\u2019s motion to set aside the-verdict as excessive and against the weight of evidence was denied. After a hearing, the railroad\u2019s petition to limit its liability under 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 183 to the value of the barge and the freight then pending was also denied. From the judgment and from the foregoing rulings the Lehigh Valley Railroad appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">There was evidence from which the jury could have concluded that there had been a large \u201cchip\u201d in the barge planking for at least two months prior to the accident, that one wheel of the hi-lo truck used in loading the barge slipped into the \u201cchip\u201d causing some of the bales it was carrying to fall off, and that two such bales struck plaintiff in the leg, injuring him severely.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">The denial of a motion to set aside a verdict as against the weight of evidence is not appealable. Mahoney v. New York Central Railroad, 234 F.2d 923 (2d Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">The verdict for plaintiff was large, but it was not so excessive that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand. See Dagnello v. Long Island Rail Road Co., 289 F.2d 797, 806 (2d Cir. 1961). The testimony showed that plaintiff was out of work for over a year, that he will continue to have pain and swelling in the injured leg, and that a traumatic arthritis resulting from the injury will probably become progressively worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">Spencer had no duty to inspect the barge before work was begun. Orlando v. Prudential Steamship Corp., 313 F.2d 822 (2d Cir. 1963). The trial court\u2019s refusal to charge the jury with respect to the duty which Spencer owed plaintiff did not constitute error since a stevedore\u2019s breach of duty to its employee does not give rise to a right of indemnity in favor of a shipowner sued by that employee. Halcyon Lines v. Haenn Ship Ceiling &amp; Refitting Corp., 342 U.S. 282, 72 S.Ct. 277, 96 L.Ed. 318 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">The district court properly denied appellant\u2019s petition for limitation of liability. Under 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 183(a) limitation is available only where the liability is incurred \u201cwithout the privity or knowledge\u201d of the owner. The evidence showed that appellant\u2019s General Marine Inspector inspected the barge at least once every three weeks. Adequate inspection would have disclosed the hole in the planking. Negligent failure to discover constitutes privity and knowledge within the meaning of the statute. See The Republic, 61 F. 109 (2d Cir. 1894); Avera v. Florida Towing Corp., 322 F.2d 155, 166 (5th Cir. 1963). See also Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Brasileiro, 159 F.2d 661 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 331 U.S. 836, 67 S.Ct. 1519, 91 L.Ed. 1849 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b680-16\">WATERMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AB7k\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b680-17\">I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
