Jamison not in pursuance of a required written order, in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4742(a) of the United States Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">After Ward\u2019s conviction, but before the pronouncement of sentence, pursuant to the provisions of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7237 (c) (2), the trial court was advised that the conviction was Ward\u2019s third offense, which Ward affirmed in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Ward was sentenced to twelve years on each count, to be served concurrently, pursuant to Title 26, U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7237 (a) and (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-15\">On appeal, we affirmed Ward\u2019s judgment of conviction. United States v. Ward, 7 Cir., 360 F.2d 909 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-16\">Ward was represented by privately employed counsel at all stages of the proceeding through his prior appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-17\">Ward filed a <em>pro se </em>motion in the district court, properly considered by that court as one seeking to vacate the judgment of conviction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. This motion was denied by the district court, without a hearing, on the grounds that the motion, files and records conclusively showed that petitioner was entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-18\">We granted Ward\u2019s petition for leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>and ordered counsel appointed to represent him on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-19\">Prior to appointed counsel\u2019s appearance, Ward filed a brief <em>pro se </em>charging inadequate representation by his counsel at the original trial and that he was denied the right to compulsory process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>when certain witnesses were not subpoened by his counsel. We have considered these claims and find they are without merit, a view shared by Ward\u2019s court-appointed counsel in oral argument herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Ward\u2019s able appellate counsel filed an additional brief, raising a ground for reversible error not heretofore presented to the district court nor raised by Ward <em>pro se. </em>Because this issue embraces a somewhat new and novel approach to an Eighth Amendment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> question and suggests a substantial question of law, we have determined to consider it here without further reference to the district court. The Government has responded to the issue on brief and in oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The issue is precisely stated by appellant: \u201cDoes 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7237 [the sentencing statute] impose a cruel and inhuman punishment upon marihuana offenders in view of current knowledge regarding marihuana?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">The summary of appellant\u2019s argument reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-8\">\u201cThe statute under which Defendant was sentenced, namely, 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 7237(a) and (b), is unconstitutional insofar as it equates opium and marihuana offenses which, in view of current knowledge regarding marihuana, is an unreasonable classification. Said statute, therefore, imposes a cruel and inhuman punishment upon marihuana offenders as opposed to opium offenders. Such a punishment was imposed upon Defendant in violation of his rights as guaranteed by the 8th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and his sentence is, therefore, invalid and should be set aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-9\">\u201cIf the statute under which Defendant was sentenced is unconstitutional, then the Indictment did not charge criminal offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">Appellant points out that the substantive section of the statute charged to have been violated, \u00a7\u00a7 4744(a) (1) and 4742(a), are to be found in Subpart A of Part II of Subchapter A of Chapter 39 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended. That Chapter 39 imposes regulatory taxes on certain items and Subchapter A distinguishes between and is entitled \u201cNarcotic Drugs and Marihuana.\u201d That Part I of Subchapter A deals with \u201cNarcotic Drugs\u201d such as opium, isonepecaine, coca leaves, and opiate, the raw materials from which heroin and cocaine are derived. That Part II of Subchapter A deals solely with marihuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">On the other hand, appellant observes that the statute imposing penalties for violations of Parts I and II of Sub-chapter A of Chapter 39 does not preserve the distinction between \u201cnarcotic drugs\u201d and \u201cmarihuana,\u201d but, rather imposes mandatory <em>minimum </em>sentences for violations regardless of whether they involve opium or marihuana. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7237(a) and (b), supra. That under subsection (a) of \u00a7 7237, a person who unlawfully possesses either opium or marihuana faces a mandatory <em>minimum </em>sentence of two years, five years or ten years, dependent upon whether it is his first, second or subsequent offense, to which additional fines may be imposed. That under subsection (b) of \u00a7 7237, a person who sells or transfers either opium or marihuana without the required written \u201corder\u201d faces a mandatory <em>minimum </em>sentence of five or ten years dependent upon whether it is his first, second or subsequent offense, to which additional fines may be imposed. That subsection (d) of \u00a7 7237 prohibits suspension of sentence or granting probation if it is a second or subsequent offense punishable under subsection (a), but if punishable under subsection (b) the prohibition of suspension or proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>tion is applicable to first offenders as well as second or subsequent offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Treating the constitutional issues generally, in Sperling v. Willingham, 7 Cir., 353 F.2d 6 (1965), cert, denied, 384 U.S. 962, 86 S.Ct. 1591, 16 L.Ed.2d 675 (1966), we summarily held: \u201cWe find no merit in petitioner\u2019s further contention that \u00a7 7237(d) is unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection of the laws, or other civil rights, or cruel and unusual punishment to persons convicted under that statute as contrasted with persons convicted of other offenses who may be eligible for parole. Stewart v. United States, 8 Cir., 1964, 325 F.2d 745, 746 [cert. denied, 377 U.S. 937, 84 S.Ct. 1344, 12 L.Ed.2d 301 (1964)], and cases there cited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">In Stewart v. United States, supra, Chief Judge Johnsen, writing for the eighth circuit, considered the Eighth Amendment question with reference to the prohibition of parole in \u00a7 7237(d). Referring to the legislative history of the Act, he concluded that \u201cno question of cruel and unusual punishment is involved from the closing of a narcotic sentence to parole privilege,\u201d citing with approval Gallego v. United States, 9 Cir., 276 F.2d 914 (1960); Lathem v. United States, 5 Cir., 259 F.2d 393 (1958). See, also, Black v. United States, 9 Cir., 269 F.2d 38 (1959), cert. denied, 361 U. S. 938, 80 S.Ct. 379, 4 L.Ed.2d 357 (1960); and Hagan v. United States, 5 Cir., 256 F.2d 34, cert. denied, 358 U.S. 850, 79 S.Ct. 77, 3 L.Ed.2d 84 (1958). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">However, in the instant case, appellant argues at length, citing Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, at 494, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), that courts may properly consider current knowledge and opinion in determining the constitutionality of a particular statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Starting from this premise, appellant then turns to \u201cThe Challenge Of Crime In A Free Society,\u201d a report by the President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, a document published by the United States Government Printing Office, February, 1967. Chapter 8 of this report is entitled \u201cNarcotics and Drug Abuse,\u201d pp. 211-237. This chapter presents a brief summary of various narcotics and related drugs and problems concerning regulation, enforcement, abuse and crime penalties, treatment and civil commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">A statement concerning marihuana, in relevant part, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-10\">\u201cMarihuana has no established and certainly no indispensable medical use. Its effects are rather complicated, combining both stimulation and depression. Much of its effect depends on the personality of the user. The drug may induce exaltation, joyousness and hilarity, and disconnected ideas; or it may induce quietude or reveries. In the inexperienced taker it may induce panic. Or, one state may follow the other. Confused perceptions of space and time and hallucinations in sharp color may occur; the person\u2019s complex intellectual and motor functions may be impaired. These effects may follow within minutes of the time the drug is taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-11\">The influence usually wears off within a few hours but may last much longer in the case of a toxic dose. The immediate physiological effects may include nausea and vomiting, but there are no lasting physical effects, and fatalities have not been noted. Tolerance is very slight if it develops at all. Physical dependence does not develop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-12\">\u201cThere is no reliable estimate of the prevalence of marihuana use. To the limited extent that police activity is an accurate measure, use appears to be increasing. Bulk seizures of marihuana by Federal enforcement authorities totaled 5,641 kilograms in 1965 as against 1,871 kilograms in 1960. Bureau of Narcotics arrests for marihuana offenses about doubled over the same period of time. So did the number of arrests by California authorities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>\u201cMarihuana use apparently cuts across a larger segment of the general population than does opiate use, but again adequate studies are lacking. An impressionistic view, based on scattered reports, is that use is both frequent and increasing in depressed urban areas, academic and artistic communities, and among young professional persons. There are many reports of widespread use on campuses, but estimates that 20 percent or more of certain college populations have used the drug cannot be verified or refuted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-5\">\u201cMarihuana is much cheaper than heroin * * Id. at 213.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Under this subsection the Commission recommends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-7\">\u201cResearch should be undertaken devoted to early action on the further development of a sound and effective framework of regulatory and criminal laws with respect to dangerous drugs. In addition, research and educational programs concerning the effects of such drugs should be undertaken.\u201d Id. at 216.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">The commission pays particular attention to the lack of flexibility in penalties provided for narcotics and marihuana offenses, with special comment \u201con marihuana, because of questions that have been raised concerning the appropriateness of the substantive law applicable to this drug.\u201d Id. at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">This comment refers to the effects produced by the use of marihuana, contrasting it with the use of opiates, and finding little in common between them. It speaks of the relationship of marihuana as a cause of crime and violence, recognizing that here the \u201cdifferences of opinion are absolute and the claims are beyond reconciliation.\u201d It sets out the conflicting views, without attempting its own reconciliation. It mentions the use of marihuana as a prelude to addicting drugs. In this connection, the following observation of the Commission appears relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-11\">\u201cThe charge that marihuana \u2018leads\u2019 to the use of addicting drugs needs to be critically examined * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-12\">\u201cThe amount of literature on marihuana is massive. It runs to several thousand articles in medical journals and other publications. Many of these are in foreign languages and reflect the experience of other countries with the use of the drug and with other substances derived from the hemp plant. The relevance of this material to our own problem has never been determined. Indeed, with the possible exception of the 1944 LaGuardia report, no careful and detailed analysis of the American experience seems to have been attempted. Basic research has been almost nonexistent, probably because the principal active ingredient in marihuana has only recently been isolated and synthesized. Yet the Commission believes that enough information exists to warrant careful study of our present marihuana laws and the propositions on which they are based.\u201d Id. at 225.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">The Commission\u2019s recommendation and additional comment then follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-14\">\u201cThe National Institute of Mental Health, should devise and execute a plan of research, to be carried on both on an intramural and extramural basis, covering all aspects of marihuana use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-15\">\u201cThe research should identify existing gaps in our knowledge of marihuana. A systematic review of the literature will be necessary. The plan should provide for an intensive examination of the important medical and social aspects of marihuana use. It should provide for surveys of the extent of marihuana use and of the nature of such use, <em>i. e., </em>occasional, periodic, or habitual. It should provide for studies of the pharmacology of marihuana and of its immediate and long-term effects. It might also provide for animal studies. The relation of marihuana use to aggressive behavior and crime should certainly be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>subject of study. So should the relation between marihuana and the use of other drugs. The Commission of course does not wish to imply that the need for research is confined to marihuana. Much remains to be learned, for example, about the potential uses and dangers of hallucinogenic drugs.\u201d Id. at 225.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Implementing Chapter 8 of its report, the Commission again republished it as a separate document entitled \u201cTask Force Report: Narcotics and Drug Abuse,\u201d with annotations and consultants\u2019 papers. United States Government Printing Office, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">We have not attempted a comprehensive statement of all aspects of the Commission\u2019s reports. We have merely reported enough to warrant the conclusions we have drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">A careful reading of the two documents prepared and published by the Commission compels the conclusion that no definitive resolution of the problem concerning the effects of the use of marihuana has been scientifically established and such determination must await considerable research in depth. The Commission\u2019s several recommendations support this generalization. To the same effect, the related problem of suggested statutory change will doubtless have to be considered in light of the results of such research.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">In any event, the progress of scientific research in the whole area of narcotics and drug abuse, during the eleven years since the first enactment of the relevant statute, \u00a7 7237, under review, has not resulted in the establishment of scientific knowledge to the extent that would enable us to nullify \u00a7 7237(a) and (b), supra, on constitutional grounds, even if we deemed it appropriate to do so. In this context, we distinguish Brown v. Board of Education, supra, relied on by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">In passing, we note that our attention has been called to a variety of magazine articles, and other publications, bearing generally on the evils associated with the use of marihuana. We have read them, and many more. Certainly, we do not possess even the elementary scientific knowledge to hazard a guess on what future results of basic medical research may establish. And to philosophize on the social aspects of the problem would be a venture into fields not within the province of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">Any normal observer would have to remain in a state of prolonged slumber to escape the impact of the public interest in the use of marihuana as sharpened by the never ending reporting of current events by the whole range of the communications media. This is all to the good. It should serve to focus attention on the need for definitive basic research. The end result will be a problem requiring the careful attention of the legislative branch of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">As one perceptive observer has written: \u201cAnd it is for the legislature to draw the lines of what is to be permitted as an open area of choice and what is to be prohibited as a social evil. So long as the legislature outlaws the possession of marijuana, the use of the drug, even in moderation, is fraught with the gravest personal risks.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">Mr. William F. McNagny, a distinguished member of the Fort Wayne, Indiana bar, served without compensation as court-appointed counsel in this appeal. We commend him highly for his dedicated intelligent service in the performance of this professional responsibility. He served with great credit to himself and to the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-14\">The order of the district court denying appellant\u2019s motion for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-7\">. \u201c\u00a7 4744.
