The record sustains the Board\u2019s finding that its approved procedure in such circumstances was not followed in that the company representatives conducting the poll gave no assurances that there would be no reprisals against the employees regardless of their answers to company interrogators concerning union affiliation and membership. See Blue Flash Express, 109 N.L.R.B. 591. We agree that under these circumstances the poll created an \u201caroma of coercion\u201d condemned by the Act. Joy Silk Mills v. N. L. R. B\u201e 87 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 185 F.2d 732, 740 (1950), cert. denied, 341 U.S. 914, 71 S.Ct. 734, 95 L.Ed. 1350 (1951). Therefore, the Board\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
