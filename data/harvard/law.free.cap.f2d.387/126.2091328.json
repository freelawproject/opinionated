The evidence adduced supports the District Court\u2019s fact-finding that the asserted \u201cexisting use\u201d of the land did not create a \u201cvested interest\u201d therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We further are of the opinion that the District Court did not err in its conclusion of law that the mooted zoning ordinance is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The Order of the District Court will be affirmed for the reasons so well-stated in Chief Judge Gourley\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
