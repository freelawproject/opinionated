The case was tried before a jury and a verdict of guilty was returned. In their briefs and oral argument before this Court the appellants raise two contentions: (1) the argument of the prosecutor was highly inflammatory and improper, and (2) appellants were denied the effective assistance of trial counsel. After an examination of the record and the pertinent authorities we have concluded that there is no merit in these contentions. Root v. Cunningham, 344 F.2d 1 (4 Cir. 1965); Thompson v. United States, 272 F.2d 919 (5 Cir. 1960); Thomas v. Cassidy, 249 F.2d 91 (4 Cir. 1957); United States ex rel. Darcy v. Handy, 203 F.2d 407 (3 Cir. 1953); United States ex rel. Hamby v. Ragen, 178 F.2d 379 (7 Cir. 1949); United States ex rel. Weber v. Ragen, 176 F.2d 579 (7 Cir. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-25\">Supplemental briefs filed after oral argument call our attention to parts of the record which reflect statements by counsel and certain evidentiary facts revealed during the trial. We find nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>in these supplemental briefs which causes us to change our conclusion that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
