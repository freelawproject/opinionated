The appellant had been convicted in a Florida state court of the crime of rape. His petition was based on his contention that his plea of guilty to the offense was involuntary in that it was induced by threats and beatings by the arresting officers. The district court heard the testimony of the appellant and of the officers in question. The court found that the plea was voluntarily made. This Court has examined the record and is satisfied that no error was committed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
