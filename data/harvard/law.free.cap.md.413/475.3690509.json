Although it determined that Workman was eligible for the appointment of counsel at public expense, the Circuit Court was persuaded that dismissal of the charges against Workman was required constitutionally because, according to the court, it had no other alternatives through which it could secure counsel for Workman\u2014the local OPD denied representation to Workman; the county government avowed a financial inability to compensate court-appointed attorneys; the local bar was unwilling to represent criminal defendants on a pro bono basis; and the prosecutor refused to seek a writ of mandamus to require the local OPD to supply counsel. Finding the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to dismiss the charges against Workman to be an inappropriate judicial response to the situation confronting it, the Court of Special Appeals reversed. Because we shall hold that, once it determined that the local OPD denied improperly representation to Workman, the Circuit Court possessed the authority to appoint the local OPD as counsel for Workman, we agree with the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, albeit on different grounds, that the Circuit Court erred by ordering dismissal of the underlying criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Workman was arrested and charged in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Cecil County, with possession of marijuana, driving under the influence, and other vehicle-related offenses. Upon Workman\u2019s prayer for a jury trial, the case was transferred to the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">During a status conference and scheduling hearing held on 18 December 2006, Workman informed the Circuit Court that she was not represented by counsel and that she was unable to afford privately-retained counsel. She advised the court that relatively recently she applied for representation by the local OPD in a separate case, Case No. K-03-129, but that she was informed, by letter dated 13 January 2006, that the local OPD determined that she failed to meet the requirements for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>services because her income<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> exceeded 110% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the limit to qualify for representation by the OPD according to COMAR 14.06.03.05A<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and D(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Workman acknowledged that she had not reapplied for representation in the present case, but maintained that her financial circumstances remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Upon Workman\u2019s request for counsel, the Circuit Court proceeded to conduct an indigency hearing, during which it made an independent inquiry into Workman\u2019s financial situation to determine whether Workman qualified for appointed counsel. Prior to examining the specific details of Workman\u2019s ability to compensate private counsel, the trial court described its perception of the local OPD\u2019s indigency evaluation process and its relation to the statutory provisions governing such determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">Okay. Well, here\u2019s what the Court notes: First of all, the prior head of the Public Defender\u2019s Office has already told us they know they do not follow the law. The law requires them to follow a certain case that came out.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] Let me find it here. I don\u2019t have the name of the case but Article 27A, Section 7,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] talks about the case. It says exactly what the public defender has to do and so does Section 7. They have to go down a certain list of criteria about what the average <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>attorney would charge in the area, or a competent attorney, and the Court finds that $2,000 [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] for what you\u2019re charged with would certainly be the low end of reasonable, and then they have to figure out exactly what it would cost you to be represented by a private attorney, plus to perform all other functions, including investigating and getting expert witnesses, functions a private attorney would do. What they have done, though, they have gone ahead and gotten a regulation passed that is contrary to that law, and the Court is\u2014it\u2019s required to follow that law. And like I said, the former head of the PD\u2019s Office said they\u2014though they are supposed to follow it, they don\u2019t follow it and they aren\u2019t going to follow it, at least while she was there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Following its explanation, and obviously treating the local OPD\u2019s denial of representation to Workman in the contemporary trailing case, K-03-129, as conclusive of how it would respond to Workman in the present case, the court turned to examine Workman\u2019s financial condition and her ability to compensate private counsel, utilizing the factors to be considered in determining indigency contained in Maryland Code, Article 27A, \u00a7 7;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> COMAR 14.06.03.05A; and Baldwin;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>rather than applying the maximum net annual income rule contained in COMAR 14.06.03.05A and D(2), the standard used by the local OPD. During the indigency colloquy conducted by the court, Workman testified that: (1) her entire income consisted of $1036 per month in Social Security total disability benefits as the result of her recurring depression and bipolar disorder; (2) she possessed no savings or other assets and lived on a month-to-month basis; (3) her expenses consisted of $250 per month for rent and water, $20 per month for trash pickup, $100-$150 per month for electricity, $110 per month for heat, $250 per month for food, and $40 per month for homeowners\u2019 fees; and, (4) she had cut off her phone service and did not own a vehicle, relying instead on transportation provided by neighbors or a mental health counseling service. Based on the $2,000 fee quotation for representation Workman received from the private attorney with whom she consulted, and Workman\u2019s dearth of disposable income, which apparently amounted at most to somewhere between $216 and $266 per month, the Circuit Court determined that Workman clearly could not afford a private attorney and, therefore, was entitled to representation at public expense as an indigent defendant in a qualifying criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Upon concluding that Workman qualified as indigent and was entitled to representation, the trial court described the lack of options it believed confronted it regarding the appointment of counsel on Workman\u2019s behalf, and its conclusion that, absent the State filing for a writ of mandamus to compel the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>local OPD to represent Workman, the criminal case should be dismissed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">The Court also notes for the record that the Bar Association has indicated that it is not going to\u2014none of its members is going to supply any service free. They are absolutely not going to do it, unless it\u2019s through something like Maryland Volunteer Lawyers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">The Court also notes for the record that\u2014and I\u2019ve put all of this on the record: The Court notes for the record that any attorney who does take this type of case free is required to do every single thing that Article 27A, Section 7, states in there about what the public defender is expected to do. That means investigate, pay for all expert witnesses. And a private attorney faces disciplinary proceedings if the private attorney takes a case like this and does not pay for all of those things out of his or her own pocket. And again, the Bar Association has indicated they are not going to do any of this for free.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">We have gone to the County Commissioners, and I\u2019m citing a letter dated March 19, 2003. They indicate, and they confirmed this subsequently, that the Board of County Commissioners has absolutely no funds available for paying\u2014they call it public defender fees. They are not covered by the State of Maryland. What they mean is those fees for attorneys that are not\u2014again, not covered by the public defender. And again, they reiterated this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">I will note that according to my conversations with Chief Judge Bell and our research\u2014we researched 42 states. Judge Bell has gone way beyond that. He\u2019s had somebody research all the states in the US. Maryland is the only state in the United States that does not permit a judge as a final solution to appoint counsel or appoint a public defender for a person charged with a criminal offense. All other states permit that. I think they may be working something through the Legislature to try to fix that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">Under these circumstances the Court finds that $2,000 is the minimum reasonable amount for defense of this case. And based on that, what the Court is going to do is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Court is going to dismiss the charges against you because there is no attorney that can take the case and you\u2019re also totally disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">This is really an affront to people with disabilities. You\u2019re totally disabled and you do not have the income to cover this or even close to covering it. So the Court is going to dismiss the case unless the State within 30 days files a writ of madamus (sic) against the Public Defender\u2019s Office, which in the past they have indicated they will consider doing, requiring the public defender to follow the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">It\u2019s under <em>State versus Baldwin. </em>That required them to actually pass Article 27A, and the Court is required to follow that. And again, for the record, what the State PD\u2019s office has done is to get a regulation passed that allows them\u2014seemingly allows them in total contradiction of <em>Baldwin, </em>to take 110 percent of the federal poverty limit regardless of the charges that are against you, regardless of what it would cost you to hire an attorney, with no consideration of any of those things. And then in the middle of their regulation they say, well, something to the effect that the head public defender can review this under <em>Baldwin, </em>if necessary, but obviously they have not in your case at all. So again, what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m going to order this to be dismissed within 30 days unless the State during that period of time files a writ of madamus (sic) to require the public defender to do what it\u2019s supposed to do, and if the public defender does not do that, this is dismissed within 30 days. Okay. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Following the Circuit Court\u2019s indigency hearing, the local OPD indeed refused to appoint counsel for Workman and the State did not file a mandamus action to compel the local OPD to appoint counsel on Workman\u2019s behalf. Accordingly, because of its perception that there was \u201cno attorney that [could] take the case,\u201d the Circuit Court dismissed, with prejudice, the charges against Workman.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The State challenged the dismissal of the charges in an appeal noted to the Court of Special Appeals. Adopting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>State\u2019s position, the intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion, vacated the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment. Citing and relying on <em>Thompson v. State, </em>284 Md. 113, 394 A.2d 1190 (1978), the Court of Special Appeal agreed with the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion that it did not have the authority to compel the local OPD to represent a defendant after the local OPD denies eligibility. Our appellate brethren were of a different mind, however, with regard to the option, namely, dismissal with prejudice of the charges, that the trial court chose in order to remedy what the court perceived to be an inappropriate and erroneous decision by the local OPD to deny representation. According to the intermediate appellate court, dismissal of the criminal charges against Workman in response to the local OPD\u2019s erroneous eligibility determination constituted an inappropriate exercise of \u201cjudicial circumvention.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">Because the circuit court had no authority to order the State\u2019s Attorney to file a petition for a writ of mandamus compelling the OPD to represent [Workman], the court also lacked authority to dismiss the case based on the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s failure to file such a petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">* # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">While the court below did have an interest in protecting [Workman\u2019s] right to counsel, it could have served that interest by, itself, appointing counsel to represent [Workman]. Dismissal, with prejudice, of the charges against [Workman], in this instance, was an \u2018unnecessary assertion of power\u2019 and thus not \u2018necessary to the performance of the judicial function.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">We granted Workman\u2019s timely-filed petition for writ of certiorari,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 407 Md. 276, 964 A.2d 675 (2009), to consider the following question, as framed by Workman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Whether the trial court properly exercised its inherent authority to dismiss criminal charges against Ms. Workman where it was necessary to protect her constitutional right, to counsel and to a speedy trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In <em>Office of Public Defender v. State, </em>413 Md. 411, 993 A.2d 55, 2010 WL 1507944 (2010) <em>(\u201cOPD\u201d), </em>we considered the question of a trial court\u2019s authority to appoint an attorney from the local OPD to represent a defendant to whom the local OPD has denied representation improperly. We held that, where the trial court determines that the local OPD denied representation erroneously, due to the local OPD\u2019s failure to consider the statutorily-mandated indigency factors contained in Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, and COMAR 14.06.03.05A, to a defendant in a criminal case whom the court find qualifies as indigent according to those factors, the trial court possesses the authority, pursuant to its role as \u201cultimate protector\u201d of the defendant\u2019s Constitutional right to counsel and the provisions of Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to appoint an attorney from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>local OPD to represent the indigent individual, unless an actual and unwaived or unwaivable conflict of interest would result thereby. <em>OPD, </em>413 Md. at 434, 993 A.2d at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The facts in <em>OPD </em>are strikingly similar to those in the present case. In <em>OPD, </em>Jason Flynn Stinnett (\u201cStinnett\u201d), the defendant in the underlying criminal case, was charged with multiple burglary counts and related offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 415, 993 A.2d at 57. Having determined that his \u201cincome exceed[ed] the allowable limit\u201d of 110% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, which, under COMAR 14.06.03.05A and D(2) represents the income ceiling beyond which the local OPD may deny representation to applicants, the local OPD declined Stinnett\u2019s request to have counsel provided to represent him. <em>Id. </em>at 415-17, 993 A.2d at 57-59. Upon Stinnett\u2019s renewed request for counsel made to the trial court, the trial court conducted an independent inquiry to determine Stinnett\u2019s indigency. <em>Id. </em>at 417-20, 993 A.2d at 58-60. It found Stinnett to be indigent, and, therefore, eligible for appointed counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 420, 993 A.2d at 61. Consequently, notwithstanding that the local OPD had declined previously to provide representation to Stinnett, the court issued an order appointing John K. Northrop (\u201cNorthrop\u201d), the Deputy District Public Defender for Cecil County, or, in the alternative, another attorney from the local OPD or its list of panel attorneys, as Stinnett\u2019s counsel. <em>Id. </em>At the subsequent hearing in Stinnett\u2019s case, Northrop did not appear on Stinnett\u2019s behalf, whereupon the court held Northrop in contempt of court and fined him $10.00. <em>Id. </em>at 421, 993 A.2d at 61. Northrop appealed the contempt judgment issued against him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">At the outset of our decision, we found that the local OPD\u2019s denial of representation to Stinnett was improper. <em>Id. </em>at 424-28, 993 A.2d at 63-66. We noted that, rather than apply the statutorily-mandated criteria for determining indigency provided by Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, the local OPD, in denying representation, relied solely on certain language contained in COMAR 14.06.03.05A and D(2) which purports to permit the local OPD to measure an applicant\u2019s eligibility based on the applicant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>maximum net income level and asset ceiling. <em>Id. </em>at 424, 993 A.2d at 63. By evaluating Stinnett\u2019s application solely under the maximum annual net income and asset ceiling standard of COMAR 14.06.03.05A and D(2), while ignoring wholly the statutorily-mandated indigency factors contained in \u00a7 7(a) and COMAR 14.06.03.05A, the local OPD applied the incorrect standard for determining indigency of applicants and erred, both legally and factually, in concluding that Stinnett did not qualify for representation by its attorneys.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 426, 993 A.2d at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Turning to the question of the Circuit Court\u2019s authority to appoint the local OPD to represent an indigent criminal defendant, upon finding that the local OPD denied representation improperly, we noted that, although Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, provides that the initial determination of indigency is to be made by the local OPD based upon the statutory indigency factors, the local OPD\u2019s determination of indigency is not final. <em>Id. </em>at 432, 993 A.2d at 67. We observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">\u201c[i]n obvious recognition of the fact that the whole system has Constitutional underpinnings and that the courts must, of necessity, be the ultimate protector of those underpinnings,\u201d [] the General Assembly provided in Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), a clear oversight and corrective role for the courts in the indigency determination and appointed-counsel process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 432, 993 A.2d at 68 (internal citation omitted). Regarding the language of Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">Of utmost importance to the present case, Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), contains no language indicating a legislative intent to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>hibit the appointment of an attorney from the local OPD by a trial court to represent an individual that the court determines qualifies as indigent, except where an actual and unwaived or unwaivable conflict of interest would arise.\u201d Despite the OPD\u2019s argument to the contrary, the proposition that a court may not appoint the local OPD against its wishes finds its legal toehold solely in the crevice of the unpersuasive dicta of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Baldwin. </em>In order to conclude, as the OPD urges, that Art. 27A, 6(f), prohibits the court, in exercising its responsibility to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant, from appointing an attorney from the local OPD, after the local OPD has refused to provide representation, we would have to add the phrase \u201cother than the local OPD\u201d to the language of Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), which states that the court may \u201cappoint an attorney to represent an indigent defendant.\u201d Such a judicial insertion into clear legislative language violates sound canons of statutory interpretation and should be avoided. <em>See Lonaconing Trap Club, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t, </em>410 Md. 326, 339, 978 A.2d 702, 709 (2009) (stating that we neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute). Although it is clear that the court may not appoint the local OPD where the local OPD is prevented from representing an indigent defendant due to an actual and unwaived or unwaivable conflict of interest,\u201d the language of Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), contains no language prohibiting a court from appointing the local OPD where it determines that the local OPD found improperly that a defendant did not qualify for representation based on the local OPD\u2019s failure to consider the appropriate eligibility criteria, consideration of which is mandated by Art. 27A, \u00a7 7. To the extent <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Baldwin </em>relied on the statutory scheme in support of the conclusion that the court may not appoint the local OPD to represent an indigent defendant where the local OPD declined representation of that individual erroneously, such reliance was wholly misplaced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 432-34, 993 A.2d at 67-69 (footnotes omitted). As such, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">in accordance with the provisions of Art. 27A, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7, and the holdings of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Baldwin, </em>where the local OPD declines representation to a defendant erroneously, because of the local OPD\u2019s failure to consider properly the statutorily-mandated criteria for determining indigency, and where a court finds, upon subsequent mandatory independent review, that the individual qualifies for representation, the court, in carrying out its role as \u201cultimate protector\u201d of the Constitutional right to counsel, may appoint an attorney from the local OPD to represent the indigent individual unless an actual and unwaived or unwaivable conflict of interest would result thereby.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 434, 993 A.2d at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Our holding in <em>OPD </em>resolves the key issue before us in the present case. During Workman\u2019s indigency hearing, the Circuit Court expressed clearly its belief that it was without authority to appoint directly an attorney from the local OPD to represent Workman, and that its only alternative to dismissal, with prejudice, of the charges was to attempt to leverage the State into seeking, within 30 days, a writ of mandamus compelling the local OPD to serve as counsel for Workman. As noted <em>supra, </em>under our decision in <em>OPD, </em>the Circuit Court was mistaken in its fundamental premise (a misunderstanding fostered by the now disfavored dicta in <em>Thompson </em>and Baldwin). Upon finding that the local OPD denied representation improperly to Workman, and determining that Workman, in fact, was indigent under the statutory indigency factors, the Circuit Court possessed, under Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), the authority to appoint an attorney from the local OPD to represent Workman on the charges brought against her. Moreover, upon finding that Workman was unable to afford counsel and that the local OPD had denied representation, the Circuit Court had an affirmative duty to protect Workman\u2019s Constitutional right to counsel by appointing an attorney to serve on Workman\u2019s behalf. <em>See Thompson, </em>284 Md. at 129, 394 A.2d at 1198 (noting that \u201cthere is the clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>duty imposed on the court, in order to decide whether it should appoint counsel, upon the Public Defender declining to do so, to make its own independent determination whether a defendant is indigent and otherwise eligible to have counsel provided\u201d); <em>Baldwin, </em>51 Md.App. at 552-53, 444 A.2d at 1067-68. Rather than engage in judicial circumvention by requiring the State to seek a mandamus order against the local OPD and threaten dismissal of the criminal charges upon its failure to do so, the Circuit Court should have appointed directly an attorney from the local OPD as Workman\u2019s counsel, in the same manner in which the court chose to proceed in <em>OPD. </em>As such, the Circuit Court\u2019s entry of dismissal, with prejudice, of the charges against Workman constituted an inappropriate judicial response to the situation with which it was confronted and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Concurring Opinion by BELL, C.J., which BATTAGLIA and GREENE, JJ., join.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-5\">. The record does not contain official documents from the local OPD regarding its specific calculation of Workman\u2019s income for the purpose of determining her eligibility for legal representation.

Distilled to its essence, I continue to believe that this Court previously, and correctly, resolved this issue in <em>Thompson v.

To reach its preferred result, as my dissent demonstrates, the majority disregards this and other precedent, identified in my dissent, <em>See OPD, </em>413 Md. at 444-73, 993 A.2d at 75-93, flaunts separation of powers and rides rough-shod over the applicable statutory text and scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Judges BATTAGLIA and GREENE join in the views herein expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
