MAA leases BWI\u2019s retail business concession spaces in its passenger terminals to Respondent, BAA Maryland, Inc. (\u201cBAA\u201d), which, in turn, sublets individual spaces to a variety of individual retail vendors and food service providers. In 2004 and 2005, Petitioner, RRC Northeast, LLC (\u201cRRC\u201d), signed sublease agreements with BAA to operate at BWI several stores specializing in the sale of Maryland/D.C.-themed gifts and souvenirs. According to RRC, the sublease agreements, by incorporating certain other pre-subleasing documents, restricted to four the number of other vendors\u2019 competing stores selling similar merchandise to RRC\u2019s stores that BAA could sublet at BWI. During 2004, BAA began subletting several retail spaces at BWI to Hudson Group (\u201cHudson\u201d), which sold Maryland/D.C.-themed gifts and souvenirs in competition with RRC. Eventually, the number of Hudson stores at BWI competing directly with RRC significantly exceeded four. Due to the increased competition, RRC ceased operating at BWI in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">RRC filed a five-count complaint (the \u201cOriginal Complaint\u201d) against BAA and MAA in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, alleging, among other things, that BAA\u2019s subleases to Hudson, and the resultant increased competition, caused economic damage to RRC and the ultimate demise of its operations at BWI. After the Circuit Court granted BAA\u2019s and MAA\u2019s motions to dismiss RRC\u2019s complaint, with leave to amend, RRC filed an Amended Complaint (the \u201cAmended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Complaint\u201d) against BAA only. The Amended Complaint asserted three counts: (1) breach of contract and implied covenant to refrain from destructive competition; (2) breach of contract; and, (3) tortious interference with economic relations. The Circuit Court granted BAA\u2019s motion to dismiss RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint, but this time with prejudice. In response, RRC filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment and for reconsideration, which included a request for leave to file a second amended complaint. The Circuit Court denied RRC\u2019s motion. On direct appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint, holding that (1) RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint failed to state any claims upon which relief could be granted, and (2) the Circuit Court did not err by denying RRC leave to amend further the Amended Complaint. For reasons we shall explain, we affirm the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Considering a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, a court must assume the truth of, and view in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, all well-pleaded facts and allegations contained in the complaint, as well as all inferences that may reasonably be drawn from them, and order dismissal only if the allegations and permissible inferences, if true, would not afford relief to the plaintiff, <em>ie., </em>the allegations do not state a cause of action for which relief may be granted. <em>Lloyd v.

Pursuant to a contract with MAA, RRC opened its first souvenir and gift retail store, called \u201cCelebrate Maryland,\u201d at BWI in 1995. Over the next decade, RRC opened six additional retail stores at BWI, including stores that sold items for children and regional merchandise relating to Maryland and the Washington, D.C. region.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In 2003, MAA changed its model for concessions development and operation at BWI. Under the new model, MAA would no longer contract directly with individual retail and concessions tenants. Instead, MAA would lease all concession spaces at BWI to a single operator, which, in turn, would sublease individual retail spaces to individual tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">As part of its new concessions model, in June 2003, MAA issued a Request for Proposals (the \u201cRFP\u201d) to obtain a contractor to lease, develop and manage the food, service, and merchandise concessions at BWI. The RFP set forth a proposed concessions plan that included RRC\u2019s souvenir and gift store locations, as well as space for, among other things, four additional, competing souvenir and gift stores designated un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>der the category of \u201cNews/Gifts.\u201d RRC was operating stores at BWI when MAA issued the RFP, and RRC was represented at the pre-bid meeting for the RFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">BAA submitted a development proposal, entitled the \u201cLessee\u2019s Proposal,\u201d in response to the RFP, and MAA selected BAA as the new concessions operator at BWI. In March 2004, MAA and BAA executed a Master Lease (the \u201cMaster Lease\u201d) and concessions contract. The Master Lease specifically incorporated the terms of the RFP and proposed concessions plan, as well as BAA\u2019s \u201cLessee\u2019s Proposal\u201d prepared in response to the RFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">After BAA entered into the Master Lease with MAA, BAA and RRC began negotiations regarding sublease agreements for RRC\u2019s existing and future locations at BWI. According to RRC, during these negotiations, RRC relied on the terms of the RFP, including the proposed concessions plan, which contemplated only four additional stores that would compete with RRC in the market for souvenir and gift sales. In addition, RRC alleged that the representation that RRC\u2019s competition would be limited to four additional souvenir and gift stores was a material condition upon which all subsequent agreements between RRC and BAA were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In April 2004, BAA and RRC entered into a temporary sublease (the \u201ctemporary sublease\u201d), which permitted RRC to continue operating a total of seven existing stores at BWI. The temporary sublease incorporated by reference the terms of the Master Lease between MAA and BAA, which, in turn, incorporated the RFP and the proposed concessions plan. In addition, the temporary sublease provided that RRC\u2019s rent would be based on a percentage of its gross revenues from sales at BWI, and limited RRC to using its locations only for \u201cretail concession of gift items focused on the Baltimore region and for no other purpose.\u201d The temporary sublease lasted through 2007 and was repeatedly extended by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">BAA and RRC entered into a new and separate sublease agreement in August 2005 (the \u201c2005 sublease\u201d) regarding RRC\u2019s anticipated new stores at BWI. The 2005 sublease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>provided RRC with eight future locations at which to operate concession facilities. In addition, the 2005 sublease required RRC to pay BAA a minimum rent and a percentage rent of specific dollar amounts of gross receipts and dictated the specific operations of RRC\u2019s stores at BWI, all of which related generally to the sale of souvenirs and gifts. The 2005 sublease contained an express \u201cGood Faith and Fair Dealing\u201d clause, which required BAA and RRC \u201cto perform their obligations under [the] Sublease, and to exercise their rights and remedies under [the] Sublease, in good faith, and consistent with customary standards of commercial reasonableness and fair dealing.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In 2004, BAA began subleasing numerous locations at BWI to Hudson, for the operation of news and gift locations in the same terminals at BWI as stores operated by RRC. By 2007, BAA had permitted Hudson to establish 18 locations at BWI, where it sold gifts and souvenirs in direct competition with RRC. As noted by RRC in its Amended Complaint, that number greatly exceeded the four \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d locations contemplated by the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan. According to RRC, after Hudson opened its competing stores, RRC saw an immediate and severe decline in its sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In response to the additional competition from Hudson, RRC requested changes in the terms of its subleases with BAA so that it could remain competitive and improve its sales revenue. According to RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint, BAA refused to make any changes or to take any action to halt Hudson\u2019s sales of r\u00e9gionally-themed souvenirs and gifts. In November 2006, RRC complained to BAA about the number of Hudson stores that were selling regionally-themed gifts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>souvenirs and about RRC\u2019s loss of sales. RRC alleged that representatives of BAA responded to RRC\u2019s concerns by stating that RRC was \u201cafraid\u201d of competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Also in November 2006, in an effort to respond to the competition from Hudson, RRC proposed the sale of a portion of its business to a large national airport concessionaire, HMS Host, Inc. (\u201cHost\u201d). Pursuant to the 2005 sublease, BAA\u2019s consent was required before the proposed sale could be consummated. According to RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint, BAA \u201cwillfully and intentionally and unreasonably\u201d refused to consent to the sale. As noted <em>supra, </em>RRC eventually closed all of its stores at BWI in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">On 27 March 2007, RRC filed suit in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, alleging that BAA breached its sublease contracts with RRC and tortiously interfered with RRC\u2019s contractual relations. Count I of the Original Complaint alleged that BAA breached the 2005 sublease\u2019s and temporary sublease\u2019s express and implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing by allowing Hudson and Hudson-related stores at BWI to sell regionally-themed souvenirs and gifts and other competing merchandise at BWI to an extent exceeding the specifications of the RFP\u2019s proposed concession plan, actions which RRC characterized as destructive competition. Count II alleged that BAA breached the temporary sublease<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by authorizing a number of \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d retail locations that far exceeded the four additional locations contemplated by the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Count III alleged that BAA tortiously interfered with RRC\u2019s contractual relations \u25a0with Host by refusing unreasonably to consent to the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>posed sale <em>of </em>a portion of RRC\u2019s operations to Host.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> RRC did not attach the RFP, Master Lease, or sublease agreements to its Original Complaint because, according to RRC, its counsel did not believe the voluminous agreements<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> were either useful or necessary at the initial pleading stage of the litigation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">On 18 May 2007, BAA moved to dismiss the entirety of RRC\u2019s Original Complaint, contending that RRC failed to state any viable claims. As to Counts I and II, BAA argued that RRC failed to identify actual contract terms that BAA breached. Moreover, as to Count II specifically, BAA argued that RRC was alleging breach of the Master Lease, an agreement to which RRC was not a party. RRC opposed BAA\u2019s motion to dismiss. Following a hearing on 24 September 2007, the Circuit Court granted BAA\u2019s motion, but gave RRC leave to amend the Original Complaint within 80 days, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALJ\">All right, obviously the contractual relationship between the parties is complex and, perhaps, the more complex it is, the more one needs to allege to make clear the complaint. But, ultimately, although there is going to be a whole lot of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>dispute about what these things mean I find it with respect to the first two counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">The breach of contract counts, that there is a viable cause of action there but that there needs to be a more explicit recitation of what particular contractual terms are allegedly being breached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">I think that that may include information that preceded the entry of the contract, if it is possible, ambiguity in the contract, and there may be a lot of the material for the RFP and the master lease that ultimately finds its way into the allegations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">But, I am really left with a bit of a blank on which particular paragraph of the sublease or what portion of the contractual relationship has been breached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">As I think I suggested by some of my questions to [RRC\u2019s counsel], I think there has to be more than [\u201c]my client based upon a series of experiences with the landlord, made certain assumptions as a result of which she assumed certain things were going to happen or certain things were not going to happen. [\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">So, I am going to grant the motion to dismiss counts one and two with leave to amend. I will discuss with you momentarily how much time might be appropriate to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">With respect to count three, which is the tortious interference count, there has to be some existing contractual relationship in order for someone to tortiously interfere in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-11\">I really do not see that even as I try to read the complaint in the light most favorable to the pleader. The most we have is a proposal and I am not sure that is sufficient to constitute a tortious interference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-12\">Assuming all the other elements, of course, assuming that there was an interference at all with a contractual relationship. Whether or not there is a potential cause of action for interference with a prospective contractual relationship or economic advantage. I leave that to [RRC\u2019s counsel] and his client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>But, with respect to count three, I am going to grant the motion to dismiss and again, I will permit an amendment if there is something simply that has not been pled that might possibly be pled. So, I am not going to dismiss it at this point with prejudice, but I will permit an amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Despite dismissing RRC\u2019s Original Complaint, with leave to amend, the judge who did so instructed the parties to \u201cgo forward with discovery\u201d and stated that \u201cit would be naive for anybody to assume that this case is going to be terminated with prejudice on all counts.\u201d In addition, the court added that \u201cthere is going to be something left for a trier [of] fact to deal with at some point,\u201d and that it \u201cencourage[d][BAA], unless [BAA] really see[s] something extraordinarily fatal[,] to devote [its] energies to something other than a motion to dismiss\u201d any amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">On 24 October 2007, RRC filed an Amended Complaint, which essentially reasserted the facts as alleged in the Original Complaint and restated Counts I and II against BAA, in nearly identical form.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Count III of the Amended Complaint asserted a claim of tortious interference with economic (rather than contractual) relations, but otherwise essentially restated Count III of the Original Complaint. As noted by the Court of Special Appeals, the most significant changes from the Original Complaint were the new factual allegation by RRC that the 2004 temporary sublease incorporated the RFP by virtue of incorporating the Master Lease between BAA and MAA, and the addition to Count I of the specific contractual language of the 2005 sublease\u2019s \u201cGood Faith and Fair Dealing\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>clause. Again, RRC did not attach the RFP, Master Lease, or sublease agreements to the Amended Complaint.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In response, on 21 November 2007, BAA moved to dismiss RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint, with prejudice and without leave to amend, on essentially the same grounds as it had moved to dismiss RRC\u2019s Original Complaint. Specifically, BAA contended that RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted, and that Counts I and II, in particular, were unchanged essentially from the Original Complaint and should be dismissed for RRC\u2019s failure to identify the contract terms allegedly violated by BAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">On 28 January 2008, a different judge of the Circuit Court than the one who dismissed the Original Complaint issued a written opinion and order dismissing, with prejudice, RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint. The discussion section of the court\u2019s opinion provided a thorough explanation of its reasons for dismissal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">Initially, this court notes, because Plaintiff again has failed to incorporate or even quote at length[ ]any provisions either of the sublease, the master lease or the RFP, that this court is unable to consider, interpret and apply the specific terms of the alleged lease. Instead, the Plaintiff has quoted only the good faith and fair dealing paragraph and has alleged in a conclusory manner than \u201con information and belief\u2019 the June, 2003 RFP provided for exclusivity as to retail sales of particular goods at particular locations within the airport as it then existed.\u201d At oral argument, Plaintiffs counsel argued that no more specifics were needed because Maryland law should impute a contractual duty against unfair competition when a lease contains a percentage of sales term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">This court does not agree with Plaintiffs arguments as to the contract terms for three reasons: First, Plaintiffs have not even alleged their current sublease incorporated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>terms of the master lease and the June, 2003 RFP. Second, even if this incorporation explicitly was alleged, this court cannot consider, apply and interpret the contract terms without having the exact words of the documents. The presence or absence of key phrases such as \u201cexclusivity,\u201d \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d or other qualifications might be dispositive of the issue. The court cannot speculate in such a matter as to what actual contract terms might include. The burden of proof is on the Plaintiff to present them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">Third, cases which Plaintiff has cited as the basis for the court implying exclusivity from either the percentage sales term or the \u201cgood faith dealing\u201d terms of the contract do not support its position. In <em>Eastern Shore v. J.D. Associates, </em>213 F.3d 175 at 185 (2000), the court held that \u201cunder Maryland [law], the intention of the parties as expressed in a lease providing for rent [to be] calculated as part of sales, combined with circumstances surrounding the lease\u2019s formation, may give rise to [an] implied covenant to refrain from competition that is destructive to the mutual benefit of the contracting parties.\u201d But, in that case, the court noted that it must be able to consider the terms \u201cas expressed in the lease____\u201d Plaintiff has prevented the court from considering these terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">Similarly, in the other cases cited by Plaintiff, the terms of the lease were required for the court\u2019s consideration. See <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Blumberg, </em>234 Md. 521, at 536, 200 A.2d 166 (1964). Also see <em>Automatic Laundry Service, Inc. v. Demas, </em>216 Md. 544, 141 A.2d 497 (1958) in which [the] court was willing to imply [an] obligation against competition because the contract was produced and shown to include a requirement for a specific number of laundry machines \u201cto render adequate services to the premises\u2014 that is, to all of the tenants of the trailer park.\u201d To the contrary, in the present case there is no allegation that Plaintiffs lease required it to provide services sufficient to satisfy the needs of every customer of the BWI airport (or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>any particular quantity or proportion of them) and, thus, no allegation sufficient to suggest it was an exclusive contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">For all these reasons, the court will grant the Motion to Dismiss the contract counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">As to count 3, the Motion to Dismiss and Plaintiffs Opposition have triangulated on one particular element of the four (4) components of [ jintensional [sic] interference with economic relations\u2014whether the Defendant \u201cacted improperly or wrongfully\u201d using improper means. See <em>Macklin v. Robert Logan Associates, </em>334 Md. 287, at 301, 639 A.2d 112 (1994). In <em>Macklin, </em>the Court of Appeals stated \u201cconduct that is quite subtle, nevertheless, can be improper or wrongful. It is clear that, to be improper or wrongful, conduct need not be as overt as ... threatening to breach an existing contract [or] threatening to notify unions that an employer was a non-union shop.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">In the amended complaint, Plaintiff does not specify how the \u201crefusal to authorize [Plaintiffs] sale of a portion of its business\u201d was improper. The suggestion that a BAA employee made comments to a[n] RRC employee that \u201cRRC was afraid of competition [and this comment was] intended to intimidate RRC and its management\u201d is insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">For all these reasons, the court will grant the Motion to Dismiss in its entirety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">On 1 February 2008, RRC filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment of dismissal and for reconsideration, seeking to have the Circuit Court clarify that its dismissal of the Amended Complaint was without prejudice and with leave to amend further. In the motion, RRC alleged, for the first time, that the 2005 sublease incorporated the Master Lease and, therefore, the RFP and proposed concessions plan. In addition, RRC attached to the motion several documents, including copies of the Master Lease, the RFP, and both sublease agreements. On 5 March 2008, the Circuit Court denied summarily RRC\u2019s motion, and RRC noted timely an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal, with prejudice, of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint. In its opinion, the Court of Special Appeals held that the Circuit Court did not err in dismissing Count I, RRC\u2019s claim for breach of the implied covenant against destructive competition, because, at the time it signed the sublease agreements, \u201cRRC had reason to expect greater competition in the sale of souvenirs and gifts than that contemplated by the RFP.\u201d In addition, the appellate court found that the Circuit Court did not err in dismissing Count II, the express breach of contract claim, because RRC failed to allege the existence of a contractual obligation on the part of BAA to limit the number of competing stores to the four contemplated by the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan.

Count II\u2014Breach of Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">RRC contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of Count II of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint, the charge premised upon BAA\u2019s alleged breach of the temporary sublease, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Specifically, the Court of Special Appeals held that, \u201c[e]ven when read in a light most favorable to RRC, the complaint does not allege that BAA ever promised RRC\u2014either orally or in any lease document\u2014 that, as the developer charged with improving BWI\u2019s concourse facilities, it would restrict the number of potentially competing gift stores to four.\u201d In addition, the intermediate appellate court noted that neither the alleged incorporation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan into the Master Lease or the temporary sublease, or the alleged fact that RRC \u201cbased its negotiations and proposal to BAA in reliance on the RFP concessions plan,\u201d could \u201ctransform MAA\u2019s preliminary proposals for development into an enforceable promise by BAA to RRC to restrict competition.\u201d We agree with the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals in this regard, and find that the Circuit Court did not err in dismissing Count II of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Count II of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint asserts that BAA breached the terms of the temporary sublease when it allowed Hudson to operate more than the four competing \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d stores contemplated by the RFP and proposed concessions plan. Specifically, Count II, entitled \u201cBreach of Contract,\u201d of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">43. Plaintiff adopts and incorporates the foregoing allegations of fact contained in paragraphs 1 through 42 as if stated herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">44. Defendant BAA entered into an agreement with MAA in which in Article I, the \u201cLessee\u2019s Proposal\u201d and the RFP issued by MAA were incorporated in and part of its contract. In its RFP, the MAA identified four locations for possible news/gifts sale locations at BWI. According to the terms of the master lease, the RFP and the subleases between BAA and RRC were incorporated into the master lease. According to the terms of paragraph 33 of the temporary sublease, the terms of the master lease are incorporated by reference. BAA was bound to a configuration of concession sales locations for news/gifts of four locations. RRC reasonably relied on the RFP and the representations concerning news/gift locations contained in the RFP when it entered into the temporary sublease and 2005 sublease agreement with BAA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">45. BAA breached this agreement by allowing Hudson and Hudson-related entities to operate more than the 4 competing stores contemplated by the RFP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>46. As a result of the material breach of the temporary sublease agreement by the Defendant BAA, the Plaintiff was unable to perform all of its obligations under the sublease agreement and suffered damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">As noted by the Court of Special Appeals, critical to the viability of Count II are the following factual assertions contained in the Amended Complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">13. The RFP issued by MAA included a proposed concession plan. In addition to existing RRC\u2019s stores, the concession plan, as revised in September 2004, included new spaces for the following concepts: Gourmet Coffee/Newstands-2 locations; Newstands-2 locations; News/Gifts-4 locations; News/Sundries-8 locations; Books/News/Coffee-2 locations. On information and belief, BAA responded to the RFP from MAA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">14. On or about March 10, 2004, and based in part on BAA\u2019s response to the RFP, MAA entered into a master lease and concession contract with BAA authorizing BAA to be its agent and to serve as developer of certain areas of BWI and to provide food, retail and service facilities to serve the needs of BWI patrons and employees. On information and belief, the master lease and concession contract between MAA and BAA incorporated the June 2003 RFP and proposed concession plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">16. RRC entered negotiations with BAA. RRC based its negotiations and proposal to BAA in reliance on the RFP concession plan, which contemplated only four competing gift stores.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">22. Pursuant to paragraph 33 of the temporary sublease, the terms of the Master Lease between MAA and BAA are incorporated by reference into the temporary sublease and both BAA and RRC are bound by all sublease obligations in the Master Lease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>RRC notes correctly that, in order to state a claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff need only allege the existence of a contractual obligation owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, and a material breach of that obligation by the defendant. <em>Taylor v. NationsBank, N.A., </em>365 Md. 166, 175, 776 A.2d 645, 651 (2001) (\u201cTo prevail in an action for breach of contract, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed the plaintiff a contractual obligation and that the defendant breached that obligation.\u201d). The allegations contained in Count II of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint, however, fail to satisfy this threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Although Count II states in conclusory fashion that \u201cBAA was bound to a configuration of concession sales locations for news/gifts of four locations,\u201d nowhere in the Amended Complaint does RRC allege an explicit or implicit promise by BAA to be so bound. Rather, the Amended Complaint alleges merely that the RFP, which contained a \u201cproposed\u201d concessions plan that \u201ccontemplated\u201d four additional \u201cpossible\u201d locations for future \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d stores, was incorporated into the temporary sublease, that RRC based its negotiations in reliance upon the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan, and that, by allowing Hudson to open more than four new \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d stores, BAA violated the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan. RRC makes no allegation, beyond the conclusory statement noted <em>supra, </em>that BAA ever obligated itself in any manner to a defined limit of four additional \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d locations. In fact, that the 2005 sublease permitted RRC to open <em>eight </em>additional \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d stores demonstrates clearly that the RFP did not serve to bind BAA to permit only four additional \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d stores. In addition, RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint states that the Master Lease incorporated BAA\u2019s \u201cLessee\u2019s Proposal,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>BAA\u2019s response to MAA\u2019s RFP and proposed concessions plan, suggesting further that BAA never bound itself to the proposed concessions plan contained in the RFP. As such, in Count II of the Amended Complaint, RRC failed to meet its duty under <em>Continental Masonry </em>to plead with certainty and definiteness a contract term, allegedly breached by BAA, that limited to four the number of additional \u201cNews/ Gifts\u201d locations that BAA could permit. <em>Continental Mason</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>ry, </em>279 Md. at 481, 369 A.2d at 569 (noting that \u201cskeletal factual allegations accompanied by nothing more than mere conclusions and general averments of a breach of a contractual duty do not suffice to establish [the plaintiffs] somewhat unique and sophisticated claim\u201d). Thus, the Court of Special Appeals did not err when it affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of Count II for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">ii. Breach of Implied Covenant Against Destructive Competition</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">RRC contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of Count I of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. RRC submits that two cases, namely, <em>Automatic Laundry Service, Inc. v. Demas, </em>216 Md. 544, 141 A.2d 497 (1958), and <em>Eastern Shore Markets, Inc. v. J.D. Associates Limited Partnership, </em>213 F.3d 175 (4th Cir.2000) (applying Maryland law), when read together, establish that: (1) the duty of good faith and fair dealing, which binds every party to a contract and which was stated explicitly in the 2005 sublease, implies a covenant against destructive competition where (a) a tenant is bound by a percentage lease and (b) the parties contract to limit competition with that tenant (in the contract or another document) by creating exclusivity or a particularly limited level of competition; and, (2) when a plaintiff alleges an implied covenant imposing a duty to refrain from destructive competition and a subsequent breach of that duty, a court may not dismiss the complaint. Thus, RRC posits that, because it alleged a breach by BAA of its duty to refrain from destructive competition (citing the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan contemplating four additional \u201cNews/ Gifts\u201d locations and the number of Hudson stores permitted by BAA well in excess of four), the Circuit Court should not have dismissed Count I of the Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Upon examination of <em>Automatic Laundry </em>and <em>Eastern Shore Markets, </em>the Court of Special Appeals held that \u201can implied covenant against destructive competition cannot be inferred from a shopping center lease where the tenant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>reason to expect expanding competition at the time of execution of the lease.\u201d In the intermediate appellate court\u2019s opinion, because the Amended Complaint\u2019s allegations \u201creveal[] that, at the time RRC executed the 2005 sublease, [RRC] had reason to expect unlimited competition in the sale of regionally themed gifts and souvenirs\u201d beyond the level of competition contemplated by the RFP and proposed concessions plan, the Circuit Court dismissed correctly Count I of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint. In addition, the court opined that \u201cRRC\u2019s allegations that the 2005 sublease contained a covenant of good faith, provided for RRC to pay a percentage of gross receipts as rent, and restricted some of RRC\u2019s new stores to selling only regionally themed gifts and souvenirs\u201d provided an insufficient basis for the court to infer from the provisions of the 2005 sublease or temporary sublease an implied covenant against destructive competition in the business of selling regionally-themed gifts and souvenirs. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s determination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Count I of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint charges BAA with breaching its implied obligations under the 2005 sublease and temporary sublease<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to refrain from engaging in destructive competition by allowing Hudson to sell regionally-themed gifts and souvenirs in more locations than the four stores contemplated by the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Count I, entitled \u201cBreach of Contract and Implied Breach of Contract,\u201d of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint alleges the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">39. Plaintiff adopts and incorporates the foregoing allegations of fact in paragraphs 1 through 38 as if stated herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">40. Defendant BAA has an express obligation under Article 12.17 of the 2005 sublease agreement as well as an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the sublease agreement and temporary sublease to perform its obligations in good faith. Article 12.17 of the Sublease states: \u201cBAAM [BAA] and Subtenant agree to perform their obligations under this Sublease and to exercise their rights and remedies under this Sublease, in good faith and consistent with customary standards of commercial reasonableness and fair dealing.\u201d By authorizing additional vendors to sell souvenirs and gifts based on themes of Baltimore, Washington and the State of Maryland at BWI more than those delineated in the concession plan of the RFP, BAA acted in bad faith and breached the sublease agreement and its implied covenant of good faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">41. Defendant BAA breached its express obligation of good faith under the sublease agreement and its implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing by: (1) allowing Hudson and Hudson-related stores at BWI to sell regionally-themed souvenirs and gifts and other competing merchandise at BWI to an extent beyond the specifications in the state-issued RFP; (2) increasing the number of Hudson and Hudson-related stores at BWI; and (3) permitting Hudson and Hudson-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>related stores selling regionally-themed souvenirs and other competing merchandise at BWI to devote expanded shelf space to those items. Defendant BAA\u2019s actions were in bad faith and its conduct was not commercially reasonable under the circumstances. BAA did not believe in good faith that the sale of regionally-themed souvenir and gift sales by Hudson and Hudson-related stores would be harmless to Plaintiff and knew that the competing sales would constitute destructive competition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">42. As a result of the material breach of the sublease by the Defendant, the Plaintiff was unable to perform all of its obligations under the sublease agreement and suffered damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In support of its contention that the allegations contained in the Amended Complaint state sufficiently a claim for breach of the implied covenant against destructive competition, RRC directs our attention to the following factual allegations in the Amended Complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">13. The RFP issued by MAA included a proposed concession plan. In addition to existing RRC\u2019s stores, the concession plan, as revised in September 2004, included new spaces for the following concepts: Gourmet Coffee/Newstands-2 locations; Newstands-2 locations; News/Gifts-4 locations; News/Sundries-8 locations; Books/News/Coffee-2 locations.

RRC entered negotiations with BAA. RRC based its negotiations and proposal to BAA in reliance on the RFP concession plan, which contemplated only four competing gift stores.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-4\">17. The RFP concession plan was a material condition on which all subsequent agreements between RRC and BAA were based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">22. Pursuant to paragraph 33 of the temporary sublease, the terms of the Master Lease between MAA and BAA are incorporated by reference into the temporary sublease and both BAA and RRC are bound by all sublease obligations in the Master Lease.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">25. Pursuant to Article 2.1.1 of the 2005 sublease agreement, RRC was provided eight future locations at BWI to operate concession facilities. The specific operations for those locations were delineated in exhibit D to the sublease and specified patriotic themed souvenirs, collectibles and gifts for the Best of Washington store; regionally-themed Maryland, Baltimore and Washington souvenirs, collectibles and gifts for the Celebrate Maryland stores; children\u2019s toys, gifts and collectibles for the Just Plane Kids store; and products about women, their careers, their experiences and their relationships for the Women Rock store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">26. Pursuant to the sublease agreement, both RRC and BAA have an express obligation of good faith and fair dealing. Article 12.17 of the 2005 sublease provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">\n<em>Good Faith and Fair Dealing</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-9\">BAAM and Subtenant agree to perform their obligations under this Sublease, and to exercise their rights and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>remedies under this Sublease, in good faith, and consistent with customary standards of commercial reasonableness and fair dealing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">27. Pursuant to the sublease agreement of 2005, RRC was obligated to pay to BAA a minimum rent and a percentage rent of specific dollar amounts of gross receipts which is defined as all monies of any kind payable to RRC or derived by RRC from the operation of its BWI stores.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">29. On information and belief, in or about 2004, MAA and BAA approved agreements permitting a vendor called Hudson Group (\u201cHudson\u201d), a New Jersey-based firm with extensive operations nationwide, to operate multiple news and gifts concessions in areas at BWI in the same terminals as stores operated by RRC. Hudson is neither a [Disadvantage Business Enterprise] nor a[] [Minority Business Enterprise]. In a sharp departure from the original business expectations of RRC based on its reliance on the concession plan, BAA permitted Hudson and entities related to Hudson to sell regionally-themed souvenirs related to Baltimore, Washington and the State of Maryland in more stores at BWI than was anticipated by RRC pursuant to the concession plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">31. By 2007, eighteen locations of Hudson and Hudson related stores were selling regionally themed gifts and souvenirs at BWI, far in excess of the four news/gifts locations in the retail concession plan of the RFP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">In <em>Automatic Laundry, </em>we recognized that a court may imply, under appropriate circumstances and based on certain contractual language, and enforce a covenant to refrain from engaging in destructive competition. 216 Md. at 549-551, 141 A.2d at 500-01. There, the plaintiff and defendants entered into a lease, under which the plaintiff obtained the right to install, maintain, and operate a sufficient number of washing machines to service the occupants of defendants\u2019 trailer park. <em>Id. </em>at 547, 141 A.2d at 499. In exchange for the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>install its machines at the park, the plaintiff agreed to pay the defendants 25 percent of the gross receipts from each machine. <em>Id. </em>While the lease was in effect, one of the defendants installed his own washing machines at the trailer park, in direct competition with the plaintiffs machines, resulting in a dramatic decline in the plaintiffs gross receipts. <em>Id. </em>at 548, 141 A.2d at 499. The plaintiff brought suit, but its complaint was dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 546,141 A.2d at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">On appeal, we reversed, concluding that the defendant had a \u201cduty of loyalty to refrain from destructive competition,\u201d which included \u201can obligation not to render valueless his contract with Automatic by permitting the destructive competition here shown to have been created by the introduction of the competing machines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549-51, 141 A.2d at 500-01. In support of that holding, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">It is quite plain that there is no express grant of an exclusive right, and any such right would, therefore, have to arise, if at all, by inference. Though we are somewhat inclined to the view that such an inference should be drawn, we do not find it necessary to decide the question, for we think that the duty of loyalty to refrain from destructive competition is sufficiently established and was clearly violated....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">In the first place, the agreement is one to share profits on the basis of gross receipts, and in the next place Automatic is obligated to install enough machines to render adequate service to the premises. The evidence shows that the Trailer Park had a capacity of some twenty-four families. The Dem\u00e1s contend that the laundry facilities at the Trailer Park also served members of the Aberdeen community not residing at the Park. The figures as to earnings after [the plaintiffs] or [the defendant\u2019s] competing machines were installed show that there was no need for a second group of machines to fulfill Automatic\u2019s obligation, and that the profit to Automatic under its agreement with [the defendant] was almost wiped out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\"><em>Corbin on Contracts, </em>Vol. 3, \u00a7 568, pp. 200-201, states with regard to the doctrine of implication: \u201cIn any commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>cial agreement in which the compensation promised by one to the other is a percentage of profits or receipts, or is a royalty on goods sold, manufactured or mined, there will nearly always be found an implied promise of diligent and careful performance in good faith and of forbearance to make performance impossible by going out of business or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 549-50, 141 A.2d at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In <em>Eastern Shore Markets, </em>the federal Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, applying Maryland law and noting specifically this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Automatic Laundry, </em>recognized similarly the potential for a claim based on an alleged breach of the implied covenant to refrain from engaging in destructive competition. 213 F.3d at 183-85. In that case, the parties entered into a lease under which the plaintiff leased space for use as a grocery store in the defendant\u2019s strip mall. <em>Id. </em>at 178. The terms of the lease: (1) obligated the plaintiff to pay the defendant a base rent, plus a \u201cpercentage rent\u201d of 1.25% of the store\u2019s annual gross sales in excess of $10 million; (2) although not giving explicitly the plaintiff an exclusive right to be the only grocery store in the shopping center, incorporated a site plan that was \u201capproved by the parties\u201d and which outlined and labeled the remaining space in the mall as future department and retail stores; (3) restricted the plaintiff to operating only a \u201csupermarket primarily for sale of food\u201d; and, (4) required the plaintiff to include in its gross sales, and therefore its percentage rent computation, the revenues from any other grocery stores it established within a three-mile radius of the mall. <em>Id. </em>While the lease was in effect, the defendant leased one of the remaining spaces, listed in the site plan as a \u201cfuture department store,\u201d to a developer who constructed a competing grocery store. <em>Id. </em>at 179. Thereafter, the plaintiffs monthly sales were reduced significantly. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">In response, the plaintiff filed suit against the defendant in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, alleging that the defendant engaged in destructive competition. <em>Id. </em>Upon the defendant\u2019s motion, the plaintiffs action was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>missed for failure to state a viable claim. <em>Id. </em>at 180. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the dismissal, stating that, \u201cunder Maryland law, the intentions of parties as expressed in the lease providing for rent calculated in part as a percentage of sales, combined with the circumstances surrounding the lease\u2019s formation, may give rise to an implied covenant to refrain from competition that is destructive to the mutual benefit of the contracting parties.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 185. The court took special note of the \u201ccircumstances surrounding the lease\u2019s formation,\u201d including a \u201cshopping-center site plan, which was made part of the lease, and its inclusion of [the plaintiffs] store as the only grocery store in the shopping center,\u201d which was attached to the plaintiffs complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 184-85. In addition, in reaching its conclusion that the plaintiffs complaint should not have been dismissed, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">Eastern Shore alleges in its complaint that J.D. Associates willfully undermined its profitability and threatened its viability. It asserts that certain features of its lease agreement contemplate a particular tenant mix and an important role for its store as the only grocery store within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>shopping center. Viewing the complaint in the light most favorable to Eastern Shore, as we are required to do on review of a 12(b)(6) motion, we cannot conclude that Maryland courts would categorically refuse to recognize an implied covenant to refrain from destructive competition in the lease between Eastern Shore and J.D. Associates. We recognize that further proceedings below may reveal facts and defenses counseling against the implication of such a covenant. But without the benefit at this stage of the right to evaluate facts, we conclude that this claim should not have been dismissed under the rigid standards that control the disposition of 12(b)(6) motions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Another case from this Court, <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Blumberg, </em>234 Md. 521, 200 A.2d 166 (1964), is useful to consider in determining the viability of Count I of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint. As noted by the Court of Special Appeals in its opinion in the present case, although <em>Food Fair </em>is not precisely a destructive competition case, it is nevertheless instructive. In <em>Food Fair, </em>the plaintiffs leased to the defendants a store building, in which the defendants operated a supermarket, and adjacent parking areas. <em>Id. </em>at 526, 200 A.2d at 169. Under the terms of one of the leases between the parties, the defendants owed to the plaintiffs yearly rent of $1,200, plus 1% of the gross sales in excess of $2,320,000, up to $2,700,000. <em>Id. </em>at 533, 200 A.2d at 173. The defendants proceeded to open two additional stores in the area which, according to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, violated the lease\u2019s implied covenant on the part of the defendants to refrain from diverting sales from the leased premises. <em>Id. </em>at 533-35, 200 A.2d at 173-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Upon the defendants\u2019 motion, the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. We affirmed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">We are dealing here only with an alleged <em>implied </em>covenant. There was, of course, no legal obstacle to prevent an express covenant being placed in the lease, so as to provide for [the plaintiffs\u2019] contentions here. After considering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>nature of [the defendants\u2019] business and the terms of the leases and after construing them in the light of the circumstances surrounding the parties at the time the leases were made, we are unable to conclude the parties impliedly covenanted that the [defendants] would not expand their business in the area of [the plaintiffs\u2019] store.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 535, 200 A.2d at 174 (emphasis in original). In support of our conclusion, we noted that: (1) there was no allegation of a wilful intent on the part of the defendants to divert sales from the plaintiffs\u2019 store, nor was there an abandonment of the business; (2) nothing in the record showed a lack of good faith or fair dealing by the defendants; and, (3) the leases involved were lengthy, and entered into only after prolonged negotiations, with provisions covering many contingencies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Taken together, <em>Automatic Laundry, Eastern Shore Markets, </em>and <em>Food Fair, </em>establish that an implied covenant to refrain from destructive competition may be inferred from a percentage lease, based on the duty of good faith and fair dealing, where the intentions of the parties, as indicated by the terms of the lease and the circumstances surrounding the formation of the lease, suggest that such an inference is appropriate, namely, by limiting competition to a particular level with, or granting exclusivity to, the plaintiff, either in the contract or an incorporated pre-lease document. In <em>Automatic Laundry, </em>the terms of the lease stated that the plaintiff was to install machines sufficient to meet the demands of the trailer park, a clear indication that the contract implied the plaintiffs right to expect exclusivity. Similarly, in <em>Eastern Shore Markets, </em>the development plan incorporated into the lease indicated clearly that the defendants had no plans to permit the development of an additional grocery store in the shopping center that would compete with the plaintiffs store. As such, in those cases, the courts correctly inferred from the parties\u2019 inherent duties of good faith and fair dealing the existence of an implied covenant to refrain from destructive competition. On the other hand, in <em>Food Fair, </em>the complex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>and sophisticated lease contained no suggestion that the parties intended for the defendants to be restrained from opening additional stores in the area that might divert sales revenue from the store leased from the plaintiffs. Therefore, the Court noted appropriately that no implied covenant to restrict additional competition should be inferred from the terms of the parties\u2019 lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">With the appropriate standard now illuminated for determining whether an implied covenant to refrain from destructive competition should be inferred from a percentage lease, we examine whether the terms of the sublease agreements, as alleged in RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint, and the circumstances surrounding their creation, plead a triable issue of whether the parties intended for competition to be limited to some definable amount and, therefore, the Circuit Court should have permitted RRC to proceed with Count I based on BAA\u2019s alleged breach of the implied covenant to refrain from destructive competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Despite RRC\u2019s protestations to the contrary, the Amended Complaint does not allege sufficiently that RRC and BAA contracted to limit competition, such that the Circuit Court or other trier-of-fact could have inferred reasonably an implied covenant to refrain from destructive competition. In essence, RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint asserts that the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan contemplated the addition of four \u201cNews/ Gifts\u201d locations in competition with RRC\u2019s stores, that the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan was incorporated generally into RRC\u2019s subleases, and that RRC based in part its negotiations with BAA in reliance on the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan. In conclusory fashion, the Amended Complaint states additionally that \u201cBAA was bound to a configuration of concession sales locations for news/gifts of four locations.\u201d RRC\u2019s allegations, however, fail to suggest that the parties intended for competition to be limited to the four \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d locations contemplated by the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan, such that the Circuit Court could infer the existence of an implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>covenant on the part of BAA to refrain from destructive competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">As noted by the Court of Special Appeals in its unreported opinion in this case, the Amended Complaint did not allege that the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan established an \u201cimmutable plan for the future development and leasing of retail space at BWI.\u201d Although RRC need not have alleged that the RFP was \u201cimmutable,\u201d its allegations fail to establish that the RFP was anything more than a development plan proposed by MAA in its effort to elicit proposals from potential contractors. In fact, RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint states that the 2005 sublease authorized RRC to open up <em>eight </em>new gift stores, a clear indication that the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan was not a firm limit upon, or a promise by, BAA to permit only four additional \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d stores in sum, and that, in fact, RRC had reason to expect greater competition in the sale of souvenirs and gifts than that contemplated by the RFP. In addition, the Amended Complaint states that the \u201cLessee\u2019s Proposal\u201d was incorporated into the Master Lease along with the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan, providing further indication that the RFP\u2019s proposed concession plan did not amount to a limit on competition to which BAA had agreed. As such, because RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to infer that RRC and BAA, when they entered into the sublease agreements, intended for RRC\u2019s competition to be limited contractually to four additional stores, the Circuit Court correctly determined that Count I of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint did not state a claim for breach of an implied covenant against destructive competition. As with Count II, RRC\u2019s allegations that it relied on the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan during its sublease negotiations or that the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan was a material condition upon which the subsequent sublease agreements were based do not transform a mere development proposal, which did not establish clearly a limit upon the number of additional \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d stores at BWI, into a promise by BAA to limit competition from which a court or fact-finder could infer an implied covenant on BAA\u2019s part to refrain from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>destructive competition.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">iii. Denial of Motion for Leave to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"Axb\">In its motion to alter or amend the judgment of dismissal or for reconsideration, RRC requested that the Circuit Court \u201cclarify\u201d that the dismissal was without prejudice and with leave to amend the complaint a second time. The court denied the motion, thereby stating explicitly that it did not grant RRC leave to amend the Amended Complaint. RRC contends that the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of its motion to amend further the Amended Complaint was erroneous, and asserts that it should have been permitted leave to amend its Amended Complaint to attach the RFP, subleases, and Master Lease, and to restate its claims.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>In general, the denial of a motion to alter or amend a judgment or for reconsideration is reviewed by appellate courts for abuse of discretion. <em>Wilson-X v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>403 Md. 667, 674-75, 944 A.2d 509, 514 (2008). Nevertheless, under Maryland Rule 2-341(c), amendments to pleadings are allowed \u201cwhen justice so permits.\u201d Md. Rule 2-341(c) (2008).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although it is well-established that leave to amend complaints should be granted freely to serve the ends of justice and that it is the rare situation in which a court should not grant leave to amend, <em>see Hall v. Barlow Corp., </em>255 Md. 28, 40\u201441, 255 A.2d 873, 879 (1969), an amendment should not be allowed if it would result in prejudice to the opposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>party or undue delay, such as where amendment would be futile because the claim is flawed irreparably. <em>See Robertson v. Davis, </em>271 Md. 708, 710, 319 A.2d 816, 818 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In dismissing Counts I and II of RRC\u2019s Original Complaint, the Circuit Court, in essence, directed RRC to identify specific contract terms in the 2005 sublease and/or the temporary sublease from which the court could infer, respectively, an implied covenant on BAA\u2019s part to refrain from engaging in destructive competition or an express contractual obligation by BAA to limit the number of competing \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d stores to four. In its Amended Complaint, RRC failed to address the Circuit Court\u2019s concerns, merely adding a new factual allegation that the temporary sublease incorporated the RFP and quoting the specific language of the 2005 sublease\u2019s express good faith and fair dealing clause. As noted by the Circuit Court, the Amended Complaint failed to identify specific contract terms that imposed upon BAA an obligation to restrict the number of competing \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d stores to four. Although RRC\u2019s motion to alter or amend attached the RFP, Master Lease, and sublease documents, it nevertheless failed to direct the Circuit Court\u2019s attention to any terms in those documents that, if pled, would have improved the twice-dismissed breach of contract claims by answering the key question, namely, what enforceable sublease term required BAA to limit the number of competing \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d stores to four.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Noting RRC\u2019s continued inability to proffer facts that would improve its complaint in accordance with the Circuit Court\u2019s instructions, the Court of Special Appeals found that there was \u201cno reason to believe\u201d that RRC could allege any new facts to support a claim for breach, of an implied covenant on the part of BAA against destructive competition or of any contractual obligation to limit competition owed by BAA to RRC, even if it had been able to amend further its Amended Complaint to include the text of the RFP, the Master Lease, and the sublease agreements. We agree with the intermediate appellate court\u2019s conclusion in this regard. Because RRC failed to identify, in its Original Complaint, Amended Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>plaint, or motion to alter or amend or for reconsideration, any specific contractual terms obligating BAA to limit the number of competing \u201cNews/Gifts\u201d stores to four, we hold that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying RRC leave to amend Counts I and II, because any such further amendment would have been futile and would have resulted in undue delay.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Throughout its Original Complaint, Amended Complaint, and motion to alter or amend or for reconsideration, RRC was unable to present to the Circuit Court sufficient facts from which the court could infer either an express contractual obligation by BAA to limit the number of competing \u201cNews/ Gifts\u201d stores to four or an implied duty obligating BAA to refrain from engaging in destructive competition by permitting Hudson to operate stores in excess of the number contemplated by the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan. As such, the Court of Special Appeals did not err in affirming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>judgment of the Circuit Court dismissing Counts I and II of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint. Furthermore, we conclude that the intermediate appellate court found correctly that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit RRC to amend further its Amended Complaint on the grounds that further amendment would be futile and result in undue delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-8\">. In accordance with the applicable standard of review, the \"facts,\u201d as recounted herein, are drawn directly from RRC's Amended Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\">. In its Amended Complaint, RRC did not allege specifically that the 2005 sublease incorporated the terms of the Master Lease between BAA and MAA or that the terms of the RFP were incorporated into the 2005 sublease, as it had with regard to the temporary sublease. It made those allegations, however, in its motion to alter or amend the judgment and for reconsideration, and, according to its brief, would have incorporated such allegations into a second amended complaint were it allowed to file one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\">. As noted by the Court of Special Appeals, Count II of RRC\u2019s Original Complaint charged BAA with breaching \"this agreement,\u2019\u2019 without specifying which agreement. RRC's Amended Complaint, however, made plain that Count II was based on a breach of the temporary sublease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\">. In the Original Complaint, RRC did not allege, in any fashion, that the temporary sublease incorporated the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan or the Master Lease between BAA and MAA. That allegation first appeared in RRC's Amended Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\">. The Original Complaint also contained additional claims against BAA, as well as a claim against MAA. Count IV charged both BAA and MAA with unfair competition by leasing stores to Hudson, and was essentially a restatement of Count I. Count V charged BAA with breach of contract and illegal discrimination by permitting Hudson, a company that was not a disadvantaged business entity like RRC, to sell competing products on terms different from those offered to RRC, in violation of federal regulations and BAA's obligations under the Master Lease. Following MAA\u2019s motion to dismiss RRC's claim against it in Count IV based on RRC\u2019s failure to comply with the Maryland Tort Claims Act, RRC withdrew, voluntarily and without prejudice, its claim against MAA in Count IV.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\">. RRC describes the Master Lease as \"telephone-book-sized.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">. RRC also contends that, when it filed its Original Complaint, it did not have the final, executed copy of the Master Lease between BAA and MAA because the Master Lease was confidential. According to RRC, it requested a copy of the Master Lease from BAA, but BAA had not responded yet to RRC\u2019s request when RRC filed its Amended Complaint. RRC asserts that BAA produced the executed Master Lease on 22 January 2008, the same day the Circuit Court dismissed RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\">. In addition, the Circuit Court dismissed, with prejudice, Count IV, finding that \u201cthis complaint has not stated a cause of action for unfair competition against the BAA or the MAA,\u201d and noted that the allegations contained in Count V \"would be premature without there having been first administrative proceedings that are required,\" granting dismissal with leave to amend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b674-8\">. Because RRC did not reassert Counts IV and V against BAA in its Amended Complaint, they are not relevant to the issues presently before the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b675-9\">. According to RRC, at this point, BAA still had not yet provided to RRC a copy of the executed Master Lease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\">. In its brief, BAA contends that a claim for destructive competition should no longer be recognized in Maryland. It argues that \"the theory is contrary to all notions of contemporary commercial leasing which is premised on lessors and lessees being bound by the terms of their complex, fully integrated contracts that specifically articulate the rights and obligations of commercial\u201d parties. Nevertheless, the cases establishing such a claim have not been overruled, which will not happen today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\">. It is unclear from the language of Count I of RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint whether RRC contends that that count pertains to BAA\u2019s alleged duties under the 2005 sublease or the temporary sublease. For purposes of this opinion, we shall assume that Count I alleges breaches of both sublease agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\">. Although Count I is described in RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint as an action for breach of the 2005 sublease\u2019s covenant of good faith and fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>dcaling, RRC\u2019s Amended Complaint and its brief before this Court make clear that the theory of liability underlying Count I of the Amended Complaint is that the good faith and fair dealing clause of the 2005 sublease, and BAA's implied duty of good faith and fair dealing that binds any party to a contract, implied a covenant on the part of BAA to refrain from engaging in destructive competition, which, according to RRC, BAA breached by permitting Hudson to open additional \u201cNews/ Gifts\u201d locations well in excess of the four contemplated by the RFP\u2019s proposed concessions plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b687-10\">. As noted <em>supra, </em>RRC's Amended Complaint failed to allege that the RFP was incorporated into the 2005 sublease. RRC first made that contention to the Circuit Court in its motion to alter or amend or for reconsideration that followed dismissal of its Amended Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b691-6\">. In its explanation, the federal appellate court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the combination of the terms of the lease and the shopping center site plan demonstrated that the parties understood that the plaintiff would be the only grocery store in the shopping center and that, therefore, an implied covenant of exclusivity arose. Specifically, the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">To the extent that Eastern Shore alleges a breach of an implied covenant of exclusivity, we agree with the district court that such an allegation fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. A covenant of exclusivity is a valuable benefit for which parties to agreements traditionally bargain and on which they generally either reach or deliberately decide not to reach agreement. Therefore, when parties do not include such a clause in their agreement, we are not free to insert one by implication____We have found no published opinion in which a court has held that, in Maryland, a restrictive covenant of exclusivity arises out of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 184. Rather, the court found that an enforceable promise to refrain from destructive competition arose because the shopping center site plan, which apparently limited competition, was incorporated into the lease. <em>Id. </em>at 185.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b696-6\">. Throughout its brief, RRC accuses repeatedly the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals of requiring erroneously it to attach to the Amended Complaint the actual contractual documents that it contends were breached by BAA. Such accusations are unfounded. The Court of Special Appeals explained specifically that RRC\u2019s failure to attach its sublease agreements to the Amended Complaint was not a basis for affirming the Circuit Court's dismissal. Rather, failure to quote from or attach the express contract terms was only one of the reasons the Circuit Court gave for dismissal. The intermediate appellate court based its decision on the fact that RRC failed, explicitly or implicitly, to allege sufficiently the contract terms that it contends demonstrate that BAA promised to limit competition to four additional \"News/Gifts\u201d locations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b696-7\">. In the Court of Special Appeals, RRC contended specifically that the Circuit Court erred in denying it leave to amend its Amended Complaint to revise Count III, the tortious interference with economic relations claim, to allege facts showing that BAA\u2019s conduct was wrongful or unlawful. RRC makes no such contentions to this Court regarding Count Ill's failure to allege sufficiently wrongful or unlawful conduct by BAA. As such, we shall not consider whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to deny RRC leave to amend Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">As it had in the Court of Special Appeals, RRC contends here, in the final paragraph of its Reply Brief, that, \"[i]n its motion to alter or amend the judgment, RRC also demonstrated that if given leave to amend, it would be able to state a claim for breach of contract based on BAA's treatment of RRC in contravention of BAA's contractual duties toward disadvantaged business entities.\u201d In support of its position, RRC notes that BAA agreed expressly in the Master Lease with MAA that it would make \"good faith efforts\u201d not to discriminate against any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>disadvantaged business entities, such as RRC, and that this provision was incorporated expressly into BAA\u2019s subleases with RRC. RRC, however, fails to demonstrate that BAA owed any such contractual duty to RRC, rather than to MAA. In addition, as noted by the Court of Special Appeals, at no point in RRC\u2019s motion to alter or amend did RRC request leave to amend the Amended Complaint to add such a proposed count premised upon discrimination. Rather, RRC\u2019s discussion of BAA\u2019s obligations toward disadvantaged business entities related solely to Count I and its allegations of BAA's \"bad faith.\u201d Finally, it appears that RRC\u2019s contentions in this regard, in essence, seek leave to amend the Amended Complaint to restate Count V of the Original Complaint, which was not included in the Amended Complaint, and, therefore, was abandoned apparently by RRC. As such, we conclude that the Court of Special Appeals did not err in finding that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied RRC leave to amend the Amended Complaint to include an additional or amended count premised upon alleged violations of BAA's duty to RRC to refrain from discriminating against disadvantaged business entities, such as RRC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b697-6\">. Maryland Rule 2-341, entitled \"Amendment of pleadings,\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">(c) Scope.

In any event, as noted by the intermediate appellate court, the 2005 sublease attached to RRC's motion to alter or amend or for reconsideration contains a contract term that would appear to defeat the breach of contract counts by absolving BAA of liability for economic damages caused by RRC's competitors at BWI, thereby also making any further amendment to Counts I and II futile apparently. Specifically, Section 12.29.1 of the 2005 sublease states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">\n<em>BAAM\u2019s Liability; Subtenant\u2019s Risk; Waiver of Claims</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAu\">12.29.1 Except as (and to the extent that) the same may be caused directly by BAAM's gross negligence or willful misconduct, BAAM and its Representatives shall not be liable for, and Subtenant hereby releases and relieves BAAM and its Representatives from all liability for any Losses or Claims in connection with any and all loss of life, personal injury, damage to or loss of property, or loss of interruption of business loss of use occurring to Subtenant or any Subtenant Party or any other Person claiming by, through or under any of them, in or about or arising out of the Premises from ...
