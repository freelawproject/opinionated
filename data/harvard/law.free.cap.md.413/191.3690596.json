If the answer to this question is \u201cno,\u201d the Motor Vehicle Administration, Appellant (the Administration),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was incorrect in imposing a \u201cdisqualification\u201d on the commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) held by Leonard Jaigobin, Appellee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, however, we hold that the answer to this question is \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">On December 27, 2007, Appellee was charged with driving while under the influence \u201cper se,\u201d in violation of \u00a7 21-902(a)(2) of the Transportation Article. On September 16, 2008, the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Montgomery County, found him guilty of that offense. After Appellee was found guilty, he accepted \u201cprobation before judgment,\u201d a disposition authorized by CP \u00a7 6-220. A defendant who accepts PBJ is required to sign his or her name at the bottom of a Probation Order, immediately underneath the \u201cCONSENT\u201d portion of the order that concludes with the following acknowledgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">If I fail to abide by the above conditions, the Court could enter judgment against me and proceed with a disposition as if I had not been placed under probation. I have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>notified and I understand that by consenting to and receiving a stay of judgment under Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 6-220, I waive my right to appeal from a judgment of guilty by the Court in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The record includes Appellee\u2019s written acknowledgment of- and consent to-the terms of the Probation Order entered by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">On October 14, 2008, the Administration mailed to Appellee a \u201cNOTICE OF COMMERCIAL DRIVER\u2019S LICENSE DISQUALIFICATION\u201d that included the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG-\">Your commercial driver\u2019s license/privilege will be disqualified in Maryland for 1 years [sic] on 10-29-2008. This disqualification is mandatory pursuant to Maryland Transportation Article T6-812\u2019 and Federal Regulation 49 CFR 383.51 as a result of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">DATE STATE VIOLATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">12/27/07 MD Drive/attempt to drive while under the influence of alcohol Per Se (mv)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">You may request a hearing to show cause why your commercial driver\u2019s license/privilege should not be disqualified by completing page two (2) of this notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Appellee requested a hearing, which was conducted by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) of the Office of Administrative Hearings, who rejected Appellee\u2019s argument that a PBJ disposition is not a \u201cconviction\u201d under the applicable state and federal laws. Appellee then filed a petition for judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision upholding the Administration\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">At the conclusion of a judicial review hearing, the Circuit Court \u201cORDERED, that the action of the Motor Vehicle Administration be REVERSED,\u201d on the ground that TA \u00a7 16-803 is (in the words of the Circuit Court) \u201cinconsistent within itself, because ... a probation before judgment is a vacated adjudication of guilt, not a final unvacated adjudication of guilt.\u201d Thereafter, the Administration filed a petition for <em>unit of certiorari </em>with this Court, and we granted that petition. 410 Md. 559, 979 A.2d 707 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Appellee argues that the case at bar became moot on October 29, 2009. The record shows, however, that the one year period of disqualification was suspended by the Circuit Court on June 11, 2009. Because we are affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision upholding Appellee\u2019s disqualification, (1) Appellee\u2019s one year period of disqualification does not include the period of time between June 11, 2009 and the date of this Court\u2019s judgment, and (2) there are \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d of a CDL disqualification. For these reasons, this appeal is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Moreover, when a moot case presents a question that involves a matter of public concern, and that will continue to arise until resolved by an appellate court, this Court has declined to dismiss on the ground of mootness. <em>See e.g., In re Julianna B., </em>407 Md. 657, 665-66, 967 A.2d 776, 780-81 (2009); <em>Suter v.

We shall therefore address the merits of the Administration\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">As there are no disputes of fact in the case at bar, our review is \u201climited to determining ... if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994). Although it has been stated that \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts,\u201d <em>Marzullo v.

Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 126, 756 A.2d 987, 990 (2000); <em>Harris v. State, </em>353 Md. 596, 606, 728 A.2d 180, 184 (1999); <em>Lewis v.

State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347, 1350 (1995). \u201cWhere the statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a definite and simple meaning, courts do not normally look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent.\u201d <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 417, 722 A.2d at 895 <em>(citing Marriott Employees, </em>346 Md. at 444-45, 697 A.2d at 458); <em>Kaczorowski v.

Nor may a court under those circumstances add or delete language so as to \u201creflect an intent not evidenced in that language,\u201d <em>Condon v.

A State that fails to comply with this federal mandate risks losing federal highway funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The term \u201cconviction\u201d is defined as follows in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 383.5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">Conviction means an unvacated adjudication of guilt, or a determination that a person has violated or failed to comply with the law in a court of original jurisdiction or by an authorized administrative tribunal, an unvacated forfeiture of bail or collateral deposited to secure the person\u2019s appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>anee in court, a plea of guilty or nolo contendere accepted by the court, the payment of a fine or court cost, or violation of a condition of release without bail, regardless of whether or not the penalty is rebated, suspended, or probated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The Maryland Commercial Driver\u2019s License Act also includes a definition of \u201cconviction.\u201d Since October 1, 2005,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> TA \u00a7 16-803(d) has provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\u201cConviction\u201d means a final unvacated adjudication of guilt, or a determination that an individual has violated or failed to comply with the law in a court of original jurisdiction or by an authorized administrative tribunal, an unvacated forfeiture of bail or collateral deposited to secure the person\u2019s appearance in court, a plea of guilty or nolo contendere accepted by the court, the payment of a fine or court cost, a probation before judgment finding, or violation of a condition of release without bail, regardless of whether or not the penalty is rebated, suspended, or probated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A60\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Maryland\u2019s PBJ statute, CP \u00a7 6-220, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">(b) <em>In </em>general.\u2014(1) When a defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere or is found guilty of a crime, a court may stay the entering of judgment, defer further proceedings, and place the defendant on probation subject to reasonable conditions if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">(ii) the defendant gives written consent after determination of guilt or acceptance of a nolo contendere plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">(e) <em>Waiver of right to </em>appeal.\u2014(1) By consenting to and receiving a stay of entering of the judgment as provided by subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the defendant waives the right to appeal at any time from the judgment of guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>* \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">(g) <em>Effect of fulfillment of conditions of </em>probation.\u2014(1) On fulfillment of the conditions of probation, the court shall discharge the defendant from probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">(2) The discharge is a final disposition of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">(3) Discharge of a defendant under this section shall be without judgment of conviction and is not a conviction for the purpose of any disqualification or disability imposed by law because of conviction of a crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Appellee argues that (in the words of his brief), \u201cthere is no unvacated adjudication of guilt here. [The District Court\u2019s] disposition was to strike his finding of guilt before the entry of judgment.\u201d (Emphasis in brief). There is no merit in this argument, which ignores the important distinction between (1) a finding that the defendant is guilty of a crime, and (2) the decision to \u201cstay\u201d the entry of a judgment of conviction. While an adjudication of guilt is vacated when (1) the trial court grants the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, (2) an appellate court vacates the judgment of conviction and remands for further proceedings in the trial court, and/or (3) an appellate court reverses the judgment of conviction and prohibits a retrial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it is clear that Appellee\u2019s adjudication of guilt has never been <em>vacated. </em>Appellee received PBJ only after he (1) was found guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol, and (2) waived his right to appeal that finding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Moreover, the record shows that, in addition to granting PBJ to Appellee, the District Court imposed a fine of $1,000 ($650 of which was \u201csuspended\u201d). In <em>Comm\u2019r of Motor Vehicles v. Lee, </em>254 Md. 279, 255 A.2d 44 (1969), this Court made it \u201cclear ... that the imposition of a fine or pecuniary penalty payable to the State may only be done by the [trial court] if there is a \u2018conviction\u2019 which necessarily requires a finding of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286, 255 A.2d at 47. We therefore hold that TA \u00a7 16-812(a)(l)(i), requires that the Administration \u201cdisqualify\u201d Appellee \u201cfrom driving a commercial motor vehicle for a period of 1 year\u201d because-as the term \u201cconviction\u201d is defined in the applicable state and federal law-Appellee has been \u201cconvicted\u201d of a violation of TA \u00a7 21-902.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS THAT THE CIRCUIT COURT ENTER A JUDGMENT AFFIRMING THE ACTION OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE ADMINISTRATION; COSTS IN THIS COURT, AND IN THE CIRCUIT COURT, TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-13\">.
