Dallas was convicted of possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute that controlled dangerous substance and related offenses. During trial, Petitioner sought a ruling concerning whether the court would permit the State, under Maryland Rule 5-609,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to impeach him with two felony drug convictions if he testified. The court decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>that any ruling concerning the admissibility of such evidence must await Petitioner\u2019s direct testimony, if any. Petitioner elected not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Petitioner contends that the court\u2019s deferral of its ruling on the admissibility of the impeachment evidence impermissibly chilled his right to make a free election to testify or remain silent. This, Petitioner claims, was an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion, entitling him to a new trial. For the reasons that follow, we hold that, under the circumstances of this case, the court did not abuse its discretion in deferring its ruling until after Petitioner testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The genesis of this case was a traffic stop of a car in which Petitioner was riding. During a search of Petitioner at the scene of the stop, the police found a clear plastic bag containing marijuana and crack cocaine. When the police advised Petitioner that he was under arrest, he said: \u201cPm a three-time loser and I\u2019m facing 25 years. Can\u2019t you say you just found the stuff on the ground?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>The State later charged Petitioner in the Circuit Court for Harford County with possession of marijuana, possession of cocaine, and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Petitioner filed a pre-trial motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude the State from presenting evidence of the portion of the above-mentioned statement in which he said, \u201cI\u2019m a three-time loser and I\u2019m facing 25 years.\u201d The trial court granted the motion and precluded the State from using in its case-in-chief any evidence of Petitioner\u2019s \u201cprior bad acts or convictions or admissions that relate directly to the crime[s] charged.\u201d The court reserved its ruling on whether the State would be permitted to use Petitioner\u2019s statement and prior convictions to impeach his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Petitioner made clear during his opening statement his theory of defense against the felony charge. Petitioner, through counsel, conceded that he possessed both marijuana and cocaine at the time in question but denied that he possessed the cocaine with the intent to distribute it. Following the State\u2019s case, defense counsel sought a ruling that the State be prohibited from impeaching Petitioner with his prior convictions of distribution and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute that substance. The court concluded that the evidence of those convictions was relevant to Petitioner\u2019s credibility and ruled the evidence admissible for impeachment purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner elected not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Following a short recess, but before the jury returned to the courtroom, the court rescinded its ruling. The court explained its reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">Counsel, I was thinking after I left the courtroom, that I may have been precipitous in my ruling to permit impeachable offenses. The reason being is that there is a balancing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>test that has to be made, and I made perhaps an assumption that I should not have made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">In making that decision, I have to consider the impeachable balance of the prior crime, the impeachable value of the prior crime. The relevance of the conviction, the witness\u2019 subsequent history, the importance of the witness\u2019 credibility to the case, and the risk of unfair prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">We really didn\u2019t get into a couple of those elements, No. 1; and No. 2, I made the assumption as to the importance of the witness\u2019 credibility, something that I really can\u2019t make at this juncture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">He hadn\u2019t said anything. I was assuming\u2014I really don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to say, and therefore, I should not have indicated. I should not have ruled that the risk of unfair prejudice did not outweigh the probative value. I\u2019m going to reverse my ruling. My ruling was precipitous. I think the proper procedure in this case is only to make a ruling after your client testifies and before there\u2019s any cross-examination to make the decision and to apply the balance of [sic] test in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">So I\u2019m reversing my ruling. I make no finding at this point as to whether or not the probative value of the prior convictions outweighs any unfair prejudice to your client. I think you need to, upon that basis, re-qualify your client at this juncture, [defense counsel], and my prior ruling is no indication of what it may be. I need to hear what he has to say.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The court instructed defense counsel to re-qualify his client. During that colloquy, Petitioner asked: \u201cSo he [the prosecutor] can use\u2014it all depends on what I say?\u201d The court responded: \u201cDepends on what you say, and depends on whether or not how important your credibility is going to be. I don\u2019t know until you say it. That\u2019s my problem. I\u2019m going to have to consider what you say and then make a decision. I think that\u2019s the proper proeedure[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">After further discussion, the State suggested that the defense be permitted to proffer Petitioner\u2019s testimony. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>court rejected the State\u2019s suggestion, stating that the court \u201cneed[ed] to hear the actual testimony\u201d before ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">The judge then asked Petitioner if he wished to testify. He responded that he did not. The court asked Petitioner if he was sure of that decision, \u201cknowing the fact that there is a possibility that I might rule to your favor and not permit impeachable offenses?\u201d and \u201cknowing the fact that I have already said that I do recognize there\u2019s a high risk of unfair prejudice?\u201d Petitioner again stated that he did not wish to testify. Defense counsel did not object to any aspect of the court\u2019s decision to defer its ruling on the admissibility of the State\u2019s proposed impeachment evidence, nor did counsel argue that the court\u2019s deferral of its ruling on the admissibility of impeachment evidence chilled Petitioner\u2019s right to make a free election. The defense rested without putting on any evidence. The jury convicted Petitioner of all three charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\n<em>The Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Petitioner raised a single issue on appeal to the Court of Special Appeals: \u201cDid the trial court err in refusing to rule on the admissibility of prior convictions under Md. Rule 5-609 until after Appellant completed his direct testimony before the jury?\u201d The State countered that Petitioner, by opting not to testify, did not preserve his challenge to the court\u2019s decision to await his direct testimony before ruling on the admissibility of the State\u2019s proposed impeachment evidence. The State further argued that, even if Petitioner\u2019s claim was preserved for review, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deferring its ruling until after Petitioner testified on direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions, holding in an unreported opinion that Petitioner failed to preserve the claim for review because he decided not to testify. The court therefore did not address whether the trial court abused its discretion in deferring its ruling on the admissibility of the evidence of Petitioner\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to answer the following question: \u201cDid the trial court err in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>refusing to rule on the admissibility of prior convictions under Md. Rule 5-609 until after [Petitioner] completed his direct review testimony before the jury?\u201d <em>Dallas v. State, </em>407 Md. 529, 967 A.2d 182 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Before discussing the merits of the question on which we granted review, we must address the parties\u2019 dispute concerning whether Petitioner\u2019s decision not to testily forecloses his challenge to the trial court\u2019s deferral of its Rule 5-609(a) ruling. The State relies, as it did in the Court of Special Appeals, on <em>Luce v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 38, 105 S.Ct. 460, 83 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984), and <em>Jordan v. State, </em>323 Md. 151, 158-59, 591 A.2d 875, 878-79 (1991), which applied the <em>Luce </em>rationale in a related context. Petitioner counters that the rationale of <em>Luce </em>and <em>Jordan </em>does not apply to the claim he has raised in this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To resolve the parties\u2019 disagreement we must undertake a somewhat detailed examination of those and other cases on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In <em>Luce, </em>the defendant Luce, who faced charges of conspiracy and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, sought by way of a pre-trial motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude the government from impeaching him with evidence of his prior conviction for possession of a controlled substance. The District Court denied the motion, ruling that, although evidence of the prior conviction constituted permissible impeachment evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a), \u201cthe nature and scope of [Luce\u2019s] trial testimony could affect the court\u2019s specific evidentiary rulings.\u201d 469 U.S. at 40, 105 S.Ct. at 462, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>83 L.Ed.2d at 446. The District Court added that it \u201cwas prepared to hold that the prior conviction would be excluded if [Luce] limited his testimony to explaining his attempt to flee from the arresting officers. However, if [Luce] took the stand and denied any prior involvement with drugs, he could then be impeached by the [prior] conviction.\u201d <em>Id., </em>105 S.Ct. at 462, 83 L.Ed.2d at 446-47. Luce opted not to testify, and the jury returned guilty verdicts. <em>Id., </em>105 S.Ct. at 462, 83 L.Ed.2d at 446-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. That court \u201crefused to consider [Luce\u2019s] contention that the District Court abused its discretion in denying the motion <em>in limine </em>without making an explicit finding that the probative value of the prior conviction outweighed its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>Id., </em>105 S.Ct. at 462, 83 L.Ed.2d at 447. The Court of Appeals held that, \u201cwhen the defendant does not testify, the court will not review the District Court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>105 S.Ct. at 462, 83 L.Ed.2d at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The Supreme Court affirmed. The Court identified several reasons why Luce\u2019s decision not to testify made it impossible to have meaningful appellate review of the trial court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling. First,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">a reviewing court is handicapped in any effort to rule on subtle evidentiary questions outside a factual context. This is particularly true under Rule 609(a)(1), which directs the court to weigh the probative value of a prior conviction against the prejudicial effect to the defendant. To perform this balancing, the court must know the precise nature of the defendant\u2019s testimony, which is unknowable when, as here, the defendant does not testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 41, 105 S.Ct. at 463, 83 L.Ed.2d at 447. \u201cRequiring a defendant to make a proffer of testimony is no answer; his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>trial testimony could, for any number of reasons, differ from the proffer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41 n. 5, 105 S.Ct. at 463 n. 5, 83 L.Ed.2d at 447 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Second, \u201c[a]ny possible harm flowing from a district court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling permitting impeachment by a prior conviction is wholly speculative. The ruling is subject to change when the case unfolds, particularly if the actual testimony differs from what was contained in the defendant\u2019s proffer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41, 105 S.Ct. at 463, 83 L.Ed.2d at 447. Further, a trial court possesses the discretion to alter its <em>in limine </em>ruling after hearing the testimony, even if \u201cnothing unexpected happens at trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>105 S.Ct. at 463, 83 L.Ed.2d at 448. Moreover, without the defendant\u2019s testimony, \u201cit would be a matter of conjecture whether the District Court would have allowed the Government to attack petitioner\u2019s credibility at trial by means of the prior conviction[,]\u201d and whether \u201cthe Government would have sought to impeach with the prior conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 105 S.Ct. at 463, 83 L.Ed.2d at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Third, a defendant\u2019s decision whether to testify is essentially a matter of trial strategy, which \u201cseldom turns on the resolution of one factor.\u201d <em>Id., </em>105 S.Ct. at 463, 83 L.Ed.2d at 448 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). A reviewing court, therefore, cannot properly assume that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion <em>in limine </em>motivated the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Fourth, \u201c[e]ven if these difficulties could be surmounted, the reviewing court would still face the question of harmless error.\u201d <em>Id., </em>105 S.Ct. at 463, 83 L.Ed.2d at 448. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">Were <em>in limine </em>rulings under Rule 609(a) reviewable on appeal, almost any error would result in the windfall of automatic reversal; the appellate court could not logically term \u201charmless\u201d an error that presumptively kept the defendant from testifying. Requiring that a defendant testify in order to preserve Rule 609(a) claims will enable the reviewing court to determine the impact any erroneous impeachment may have had in light of the record as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>whole; it will also tend to discourage making such motions solely to \u201cplant\u201d reversible error in the event of conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOD\"><em>Id., </em>105 S.Ct. at 463-64, 83 L.Ed.2d at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">For all of those reasons, the <em>Luce </em>Court held \u201cthat to raise and preserve for review the claim of improper impeachment with a prior conviction, a defendant must testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43, 105 S.Ct. at 464, 83 L.Ed.2d at 448. In doing so, the Court rejected Luce\u2019s reliance on two earlier decisions, <em>New Jersey v. Portash, </em>440 U.S. 450, 99 S.Ct. 1292, 59 L.Ed.2d 501 (1979), and <em>Brooks v. Tennessee, </em>406 U.S. 605, 92 S.Ct. 1891, 32 L.Ed.2d 358 (1972), for the proposition that electing not to testify did not preclude Luce from challenging the District Court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling. The Court explained that, in <em>Brooks </em>and <em>Portash, </em>the Court had \u201creviewed <em>Fifth Amendment </em>challenges to state-court rulings that operated to dissuade defendants from testifying. We did not hold that a federal court\u2019s preliminary ruling on a question not reaching constitutional dimensions\u2014such as a decision under Rule 609(a)\u2014is reviewable on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Luce, </em>469 U.S. at 42-43, 105 S.Ct. at 464, 83 L.Ed.2d at 448 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We adopted the non-preservation rationale of <em>Luce </em>in <em>Jordan, </em>323 Md. at 158-59, 591 A.2d at 878. In that case, the trial court ruled before trial that Jordan\u2019s statement to the police, though voluntary, was obtained without a proper waiver of the <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>right to counsel. The trial court further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ruled that the statement could not be used in the State\u2019s casein-chief but, \u201cwhen and if Jordan took the stand [at trial], his statement could only be used for the purpose of impeachment.\u201d 323 Md. at 154, 591 A.2d at 876. The court denied defense counsel\u2019s request to reconsider the voluntariness ruling. Thereafter, Jordan elected not to testify and was convicted on charges of murder and related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">On appeal Jordan challenged, among other things, the court\u2019s ruling that the statement was voluntary. The Court of Special Appeals, relying in part on <em>Luce, </em>held that Jordan did not preserve the issue for appellate review because he chose not to testify. <em>See Jordan v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 225, 231, 571 A.2d 238, 241 (1990), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>323 Md. 151, 591 A.2d 875 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">We affirmed that aspect of the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Jordan, </em>323 Md. 151, 591 A.2d 875. Like the intermediate appellate court, we were guided by the rationale underpinning the holding of <em>Luce. </em>We stated: \u201cAlthough <em>Luce </em>involved the issue of impeachment by prior conviction rather than a ruling grounded on the constitutional right not to be impeached with an involuntary confession, we are persuaded that its reasoning is applicable in the instant case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, 591 A.2d at 878. Accordingly, we held that the challenge to the court\u2019s decision to admit Jordan\u2019s confession for impeachment purposes was not preserved for appellate review because Jordan did not testify. <em>Id. </em>at 158-59, 591 A.2d at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Petitioner acknowledges the continued viability of <em>Jordan </em>and its reliance on <em>Luce. </em>He nevertheless argues that those cases are inapplicable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>^ He points out that, unlike the petitioners in <em>Luce </em>and <em>Jordan, </em>he does not challenge an <em>in limine </em>ruling; rather, he challenges the court\u2019s decision not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>make such a ruling before he elected whether to testify. In that regard, Petitioner argues, his case closely resembles <em>Williams v. State, </em>110 Md.App. 1, 675 A.2d 1037 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In <em>Williams, </em>the Court of Special Appeals was asked to decide if \u201cthe circuit court\u2019s failure to rule on the admissibility of appellant\u2019s prior convictions for purposes of impeachment before he made an election whether to testify coerced his decision not to testify.\u201d 110 Md.App. at 14, 675 A.2d at 1044. The <em>Williams </em>court recognized that, \u201cif a defendant elects to remain silent even in reliance on the trial judge\u2019s ruling or failure to rule on a motion <em>in limine, </em>the ruling ordinarily will not be preserved for review absent an error of constitutional dimension.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 675 A.2d at 1053. The Court further recognized \u201can exception to the general rule\u201d when the claim on appeal \u201cpresent[s] a pure question of law without a need for a factual predicate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 675 A.2d at 1054 (citing <em>Passamichali v. State, </em>81 Md.App. 731, 739-41, 569 A.2d 733, 737-38, <em>cert. denied, </em>319 Md. 484, 573 A.2d 808 (1990)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Notwithstanding Williams\u2019s election to remain silent, the Court of Special Appeals reached the merits of his claim that he had been coerced into waiving his right to testify. The court did so on the ground that the claim was \u201cone of constitutional dimension.\u201d 110 Md.App. at 35, 675 A.2d at 1055. The intermediate appellate court held that, because the trial court incorrectly advised Williams \u201cwith respect to the applicable law and employed an erroneous procedure [under Rule 4-252],\u201d his decision to stand silent was \u201c \u2018not knowingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>and intelligently made.\u2019 \u201d 110 Md.App. at 35, 37, 675 A.2d at 1055 (quoting <em>Morales v. State, </em>325 Md. 330, 339, 600 A.2d 851, 855 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Petitioner relies on <em>Williams </em>to argue that his case likewise presents a question of constitutional dimension in that the trial court\u2019s deferral of its ruling on the impeachment evidence until after he testified impermissibly burdened his right to make a free election to testify or remain silent. He points out, too, the <em>Luce </em>Court\u2019s distinction between that case, which involved \u201ca federal court\u2019s preliminary ruling on a question not reaching constitutional dimensions,\u201d and other cases in which the Court had \u201creviewed <em>Fifth Amendment </em>challenges to state-court rulings that operated to dissuade defendants from testifying.\u201d 469 U.S. at 42, 105 S.Ct. at 464, 83 L.Ed.2d at 448 (emphasis in original). We agree with Petitioner that his decision to remain silent does not foreclose appellate review of his claim. We do so, however, for reasons other than those upon which Petitioner relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">That a criminal defendant has a fundamental constitutional right to testify in his or her own defense is a concept \u201cdeeply entrenched in our modern system of jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Jordan, </em>323 Md. at 155, 591 A.2d at 876 (citing <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 49-50, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 2708, 97 L.Ed.2d 37, 44-45 (1987)). The right stems from three constitutional sources: the Fourteenth Amendment due process guarantee of a fair trial, which necessarily entitles a defendant \u201can opportunity to be heard in his defense\u201d; the Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process, which necessarily includes a defendant\u2019s right to testify on his or her own behalf; and the Fifth Amendment guaranty against compelled self-incrimination, which is \u201cfulfilled only when an accused is guaranteed the right to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will.\u201d <em>Rock, </em>483 U.S. at 51-53, 107 S.Ct. at 2709-10, 97 L.Ed.2d at 46 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The right to testify, however, \u201cis not without limitation\u201d; rather, the right \u201cmay, in appropriate cases, bow to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u201d <em>Rock, </em>483 U.S. at 55, 107 S.Ct. at 2711, 97 L.Ed.2d at 49 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). For example, a defendant is not entitled to testify without subjecting himself to cross-examination and impeachment. <em>See Portuondo v. Agard, </em>529 U.S. 61, 70, 120 S.Ct. 1119, 1126, 146 L.Ed.2d 47, 57 (2000). With regard to rulings on motions <em>in limine </em>on proposed impeachment evidence in particular, \u201cthe weight of authority has recognized that such a ruling may be taken under advisement without burdening a defendant\u2019s federal constitutional rights.\u201d Wayne R. Lafave Et Al., Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 24.5(d) (3d ed. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, for example, has said that trial courts have no inherent \u201cduty to aid the defendant in formulating his trial strategy regarding the risks of impeachment should he decide to take the stand.\u201d <em>United States v. Witschner, </em>624 F.2d 840, 844 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 994, 101 S.Ct. 532, 66 L.Ed.2d 291 (1980). More recently, that court observed that a trial court\u2019s refusal to rule on a motion <em>in limine </em>concerning the admissibility of prior crime conviction impeachment evidence\u2014\u201ceven if that refusal inhibits a defendant from testifying on his own behalf\u2019\u2014is a matter of trial tactics, not \u201can issue of constitutional significance.\u201d <em>United States v. Masters, </em>840 F.2d 587, 590 (8th Cir.1988). <em>Accord United States v. Hickey, </em>596 F.2d 1082, 1087 (1st Cir.1979) (noting that, even though the postponed ruling would have forced the defendant \u201cto take the stand at his peril,\u201d the trial court acted within its discretion to delay its ruling until after the defendant testified); <em>People v. Washington, </em>211 Cal.App.3d 207, 259 Cal.Rptr. 307, 310 (1989) (recognizing the benefits of requiring trial courts to rule on the admissibility of prior convictions before the defendant testifies, but declining to impose such a requirement because the timing of such rulings is best left to the trial courts); <em>Hansen v. State, </em>592 So.2d 114, 130-31 (Miss.1991) (rejecting the appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s refusal to rule preliminarily impermissibly chilled his constitutional right to testify in his own defense, because the \u201cconcern is one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>strategy\u201d and, in such instances, the court follows a \u201cdiscretionary approach\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">We agree with the above authorities that a trial court\u2019s decision to await a defendant\u2019s testimony before deciding whether to allow proposed prior conviction impeachment evidence does not impermissibly chill the defendant\u2019s right to testify. Therefore, a decision to defer ruling does not present a question of constitutional dimension. Indeed, \u201cit is not thought inconsistent with the enlightened administration of criminal justice to require the defendant to weigh such pros and cons in deciding whether to testify.\u201d <em>McGautha v. California, </em>402 U.S. 183, 215, 91 S.Ct. 1454, 1471, 28 L.Ed.2d 711, 731 (1971). That view finds further support in the Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>Luce </em>that \u201ca reviewing court cannot assume that [an] adverse ruling motivated a defendant\u2019s decision not to testify,\u201d because an accused\u2019s decision whether to testify is essentially a matter of trial strategy, which \u201cseldom turns on the resolution of one factor.\u201d 469 U.S. at 42, 105 S.Ct. at 463, 83 L.Ed.2d at 448. Further, although the defendant in <em>Luce </em>presented a somewhat different question than is presented here\u2014the correctness of a ruling on the admissibility of impeachment evidence rather than the deferral of such a ruling until after the defendant testified\u2014the Supreme Court expressly rejected the contention that the question implicated the constitutional right of the defendant to make a free election whether to testify or remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Although we reject Petitioner\u2019s contention that his claim is one of constitutional dimension, we agree with him that his claim involves concerns sufficiently different from the claims in <em>Luce </em>and <em>Jordan. </em>This case does not involve a challenge to a trial court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling on evidence, which, absent the defendant\u2019s testimony, is not amenable to meaningful appellate review. Instead, this case involves a challenge to the trial court\u2019s refusal to issue such a ruling before Petitioner elected whether to testify or stand silent. Petitioner\u2019s contention is amenable to appellate review, notwithstanding his decision not to testify. We turn, then, to the merits of that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The federal and state courts that have considered contentions like the one Petitioner presents treat such contentions as implicating the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>See Hickey, </em>596 F.2d at 1087; <em>Hansen, </em>592 So.2d at 131; <em>Washington, </em>259 Cal.Rptr. at 310. We agree with those courts that such decisions are discretionary and therefore subject to review for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Review for abuse of discretion is appropriate given what the trial court must decide when asked to rule upon the admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment purposes. Maryland Rule 5-609(a), much like Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a), requires the trial court, once it determines that a prior conviction meets the Rule 5-609(a) and (b) eligibility requirements, to balance the probative value of prior conviction evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. For this reason, the trial court may deem it necessary in a given case to defer ruling on the admission (or exclusion) of prior crimes impeachment evidence until after the court hears the defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">That said, trial courts should rule on motions <em>in limine </em>as early as practicable, which often is before the defendant elects whether to testify or remain silent. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>608 F.2d 1175, 1186 (9th Cir.1979) (\u201cremind[ing]\u201d trial courts \u201cthat advance planning helps both parties and the court\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1034, 100 S.Ct. 706, 62 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980); <em>United States v. Oakes, </em>565 F.2d 170, 171 (1st Cir.1977) (stating that a trial court \u201cshould, when feasible, make reasonable efforts to accommodate a defendant by ruling in advance on the admissibility of a criminal record so that he can make an informed decision whether or not to testify\u201d); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>666 So.2d 499, 502 (Miss.1995) (stating that early rulings on motions <em>in limine </em>are preferred \u201cunless delay is absolutely necessary to a fair presentation of the issue\u201d); <em>see also State v. Cole, </em>142 N.H. 519, 703 A.2d 658, 660 (N.H.1997) (noting that, \u201calthough not absolutely required, trial courts should rule on the admissibility of prior convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>as impeachment evidence as early as practicable\u201d); <em>State v. McClure, </em>298 Or. 336, 692 P.2d 579, 583 (1984) (commenting that \u201cit is not realistic or necessary for a defendant to have to wait until he is on the stand to find out whether he will be impeached with prior crime evidence,\u201d and noting that, although there may be circumstances in which the court may have reason to defer the ruling, \u201cthis should be a rare occurrence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Many are the times when a trial court can and, therefore, should decide a motion <em>in limine </em>involving a Rule 5-609 issue before the defendant makes the election. For example, when it is clear that a prior conviction is ineligible for impeachment under Rule 5-609, the court need not hear the defendant\u2019s testimony to know how to rule on a motion to exclude that proposed impeachment evidence. Similarly, the trial court certainly can recognize when the risk of unfair prejudice of the proposed impeachment evidence far outweighs its probative value, no matter how the defendant might testify.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, the court may be satisfied that it has a sufficient basis upon which to make an <em>in limine </em>ruling without hearing the defendant\u2019s direct testimony if the court has learned, through other means, how the defendant is likely to testify. For example, a court may hear admissions that the defense makes during the defense\u2019s opening statement, or the court may accept a proffer of the defendant\u2019s direct testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In any of these circumstances, fairness to the defendant augurs in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion before the defendant elects whether to testify or remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">It remains for us to decide whether, as Petitioner argues, the trial court abused its discretion in deferring its ruling on his motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to prohibit the State from impeaching him with evidence of his prior felony drug convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">During the lengthy discussion on the subject, the trial court explained that, in light of the similarity between the pending charges and the prior convictions, it was necessary to await Petitioner\u2019s testimony before deciding whether the probative value of the proposed impeachment evidence outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to Petitioner. To be sure, the court was aware that the defense to the felony charge was to concede the possession of the cocaine and marijuana the police found on Petitioner but deny that the cocaine was for distribution. Yet, the court could not be certain what Petitioner\u2019s testimony would be until the court heard it. <em>See Luce, </em>469 U.S. at 41, 105 S.Ct. at 463, 83 L.Ed.2d at 447. For that reason, although the court surely could have accepted a proffer of Petitioner\u2019s testimony, <em>see supra </em>n. 11, the court was not required to do so. <em>See Luce, </em>469 U.S. at 41 n. 5, 105 S.Ct. at 463 n. 5, 83 L.Ed.2d at 447 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">We presume that the trial court, not unreasonably, envisioned that, had Petitioner taken the stand, he might not have confined his testimony (consistent with counsel\u2019s opening statement) to a denial of an intent to distribute the drugs found in his possession; he might instead have testified that he had never before distributed illegal drugs. Had Petitioner\u2019s testimony been consistent with defense counsel\u2019s opening statement, then the trial court might have decided that evidence of the prior convictions carried a risk of unfair prejudice to Petitioner. Had Petitioner testified more expansively, then the court might have decided that the State should be permitted to impeach him with the prior convictions. Given the plausibility of either scenario, the court was not required to rule on the motion without first hearing Petitioner\u2019s direct testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>We therefore hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by deferring its ruling on the admissibility of the proposed impeachment evidence until after Petitioner testified. We are all the more unwilling to find an abuse of discretion because Petitioner did not complain at the time that the court\u2019s delay chilled his right to make an election. Had Petitioner done so, the trial court might well have opted to provide an <em>in limine </em>ruling before Petitioner made his election.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, albeit on a ground other than that relied upon by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

First, the right to testify, \u201c \u2018essential to due process of law in a fair adversary process,\u2019 \u201d <em>Rock, </em>483 U.S. at 51, 107 S.Ct. at 2709, 97 L.Ed.2d at 46 <em>quoting Faretta v.

Second, the right is present \u201cin the Compulsory Process Clause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Sixth Amendment, which grants a defendant the right to call \u2018witnesses in his favor,\u2019 a right that is guaranteed in the criminal courts of the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 107 S.Ct. at 2709, 97 L.Ed.2d at 46, <em>quoting Washington v.

Second, if the conviction meets the first requirement, \u201cthe proponent must establish that the conviction is less than fifteen years old.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 712, 668 A.2d at 12; <em>see </em>Md. Rule 5-609(b). Third, and finally, the trial court must determine whether \u201cthe probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or the objecting party.\u201d Md. Rule 5-609(a). Problems tend to arise, as it has here, with the balancing test. <em>See Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 713, 668 A.2d at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The petitioner in this case, Isaac E. Dallas, was charged with possession of marijuana, possession of cocaine, and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He had two prior convictions, <em>ie., </em>possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine, with which the State was prepared to impeach him and to which, apparently, he had referred when he was arrested for the present charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>To be sure, the use of prior convictions to impeach a witness, including the defendant, is well-settled in our jurisprudence. Nevertheless, this Court has recognized, and consistently underscored, the dangers associated with such use of prior convictions. <em>Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 714, 668 A.2d at 13 (footnote omitted) (noting that both \u201cimpeachment of a witness by prior conviction\u201d and recognition of \u201cthe danger in admitting such evidence\u201d \u201chas long been a part of Maryland law\u201d). That use is particularly perilous, we have said, when the prior convictions, although not \u201cper <em>se </em>inadmissible,\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 714, 668 A.2d at 13, are for the same or similar charges to those for which the defendant is on trial. This Court in <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 703, 436 A.2d 906, 907-08 (1981), expressed just that concern:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">\u201cThe danger in admitting prior convictions as evidence to impeach the defendant stems from the risk of prejudice. The jury may improperly infer that the defendant has a history of criminal activity and therefore is not entitled to a favorable verdict. Such evidence may detract from careful attention to the facts, despite instructions from the Court, influencing the jury to conclude that if the defendant is wrongfully found guilty no real harm is done. Where the crime for which the defendant is on trial is identical or similar to the crime for which he has been previously convicted the danger is greater, as the jury may conclude that because he did it before he most likely has done it <em>again. </em>The net effect of such evidence is often to discourage the defendant from taking the stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Dissenting in <em>Jackson, </em>I made the same point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">\u201cThe appellate courts of this State have long recognized, and been sensitive to, the risk of prejudice that the admission, for impeachment purposes, of prior convictions against a defendant presents. <em>See e.g. Ricketts v.

That danger is that a jury likely may infer from a prior conviction that the defendant is guilty of the crime for which he or she is presently on trial. <em>Ricketts, </em>291 Md. at 703-04, 436 A.2d at 907-08; <em>Bane, </em>73 Md.App. at 142-43, 533 A.2d at 313; <em>Burrell, </em>42 Md.App. at 136, 399 A.2d at 1357. The risk of prejudice is increased significantly, our courts recognize, when the prior conviction is similar, or identical, to the crime on trial. <em>See [State v.] Woodland, </em>337 Md. [519,] [ ] 526-27, 654 A.2d [1314,] [ ] 1317-18 [1995]; <em>State v. Giddens, </em>335 Md. 205, 221, 642 A.2d 870, 878 (1994) (quoting <em>Prout v.

And, logically, it follows that the impact potentially is even greater when there are more than one such prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">One of the dangers inherent in the use of the same or similar prior convictions to impeach, and the one relevant to this case, is its \u201cpotential to discourage defendants from testifying in their own behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714, 668 A.2d at 13 (footnote omitted). It was that potential that prompted the <em>Ricketts </em>Court to address the role of the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">\u201cThus, the role of the trial judge takes on added importance. It becomes his function to admit only those prior convictions which will assist the jury in assessing the credibility of the defendant. The trial judge must weigh the probative value of the convictions against the prejudice to the defendant in asserting his defense. Obviously, not all prior convictions will survive this balancing process. The problem arises when the trial judge seeks to determine which crimes do prevail and are, therefore, admissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">291 Md. at 703-04, 436 A.2d at 908. That also accounts for the promulgation of Md. Rule 5-609, which was enacted to \u201cprevent a jury from convicting a defendant based on his past criminal record, or because the jury thinks the defendant is a bad person.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 715, 668 A.2d at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">In this case, although trial court earlier had prohibited, on the basis of its prejudicial impact, the State from introducing the statement, made by the petitioner when apprehended, in which the petitioner acknowledged the subject prior convictions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court refused, pending the petitioner\u2019s testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ny, to rule on the petitioner\u2019s motion asking the court not to permit the State to use his prior distribution convictions for impeachment. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: ... there is a balancing test that has to be made____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201cI have to consider the impeachable balance of the prior crime, the impeachable value of the prior crime.

Faced with the uncertainty with respect to whether his prior distribution convictions could be used to impeach his testimony, the petitioner elected once again not to testify.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>The petitioner\u2019s argument is that the trial judge\u2019s \u201crefusal to exercise discretion, his arbitrary rejection of a proffer, and his insistence that [petitioner] must testify before the trial judge would make the ruling\u201d prevented the petitioner from making an informed election to testify. Conceding that a trial court has discretionary powers, <em>Kelly v. State, </em>392 Md. 511, 530-31, 898 A.2d 419, 430 (2006), he submits that its discretion does not trump a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The majority rejects the petitioner\u2019s arguments. Conceding that like all defendants\u2019, the petitioner\u2019s, right to testify is \u201c \u2018deeply entrenched.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dallas v. State, </em>413 Md. at 582, 993 A.2d at 662 (quoting <em>Jordan, </em>323 Md. at 155, 591 A.2d at 876), it nevertheless denies that the right was encroached upon or impeded by the trial court\u2019s refusal to rule. Although acknowledging that the trial court had sufficient evidence on which to rule, the majority defers to the trial court\u2019s assessment that, \u201cin light of the similarity between the pending charges and the prior convictions, it was necessary to await Petitioner\u2019s testimony before deciding whether the probative value of the proposed impeachment evidence outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to Petitioner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 587, 993 A.2d at 665, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Accepting, as an appropriate exercise of discretion, the delaying of the ruling until the petitioner testified because the trial court \u201ccould not be certain what Petitioner\u2019s testimony would be until the court heard it,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 587, 993 A.2d at 665, it concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\u201cWe presume that the trial court, not unreasonably, envisioned that, had Petitioner taken the stand, he might not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>have confined his testimony (consistent with counsel\u2019s opening statement) to a denial of an intent to distribute the drugs found in his possession; he might instead have testified that he had never before distributed illegal drugs. Had Petitioner\u2019s testimony been consistent with defense counsel\u2019s opening statement, then the trial court might have decided that evidence of the prior convictions carried a risk of unfair prejudice to Petitioner. Had Petitioner testified more expansively, then the court might have decided that the State should be permitted to impeach him with the prior convictions. Given the plausibility of either scenario, the court was not required to rule on the motion without first hearing Petitioner\u2019s direct testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 587, 993 A.2d at 665-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The majority is wrong. In this case, the trial court did not exercise discretion. It is the trial court\u2019s belief that \u201cthe proper procedure ... is only to make a ruling after your client testifies and before there\u2019s any cross-examination to make the decision and to apply the balance of test in this case.\u201d If there were any doubt that the trial court believed that actual testimony by the defendant was required before the balance could be struck, it was dissipated completely when the court rejected, emphatically, the State\u2019s suggestion that a proffer be taken from the petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">\u201c[THE STATE:] Your Honor, I just have a suggestion ... the defense might want to proffer what he would say to the Court. Then I could give you the specific dates, and then you can make your ruling. That way the defendant knows ahead of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I understand that, but a proffer is not testimony. It\u2019s going to depend on what he has to say as to whether or not\u2014you know, his credibility is going to be an issue with respect to those particular crimes, and I can\u2019t tell. You can proffer all day long, but it\u2019s not the actual testimony. I need to hear the testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">If needing to hear the testimony itself is what is required, there simply can never be a pre-testimonial ruling that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>inform the decision to testify or remain silent. There would be no opportunity, thus no ability, for the petitioner to make an informed decision; he could only learn whether his prior convictions could be used to impeach his testimony if he testified. Such a hard and fast rule is productive of a choice that is the antithesis of the knowing and intelligent decision-making our right to testify jurisprudence contemplates.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The majority, to be sure, encourages the trial judges to accept proffers and to make rulings on the admissibility of impeachment evidence in advance of the defendant\u2019s being called. <em>Dallas v. State, </em>413 Md. at 586, 993 A.2d at 664-65. With these observations, I agree. It also recognizes the desirability of making such ruling and even suggests that there are occasions when such rulings are required. <em>Id. </em>at 586-87, 993 A.2d at 664-65. With this recognition and suggestion, I also agree. Indeed, I am of the opinion that this is a case in which an advance ruling not only is desirable, but is, in fact, required. No amount of encouragement and recognition changes the essential factual situation in this case, however, that the trial court did not act in accordance with the encouragement nor the preferred procedure enunciated by the majority. What\u2019s more, what it did and said belies any conceivable notion that it believed that it could have. If I read the majority opinion correctly, it holds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case and does not prohibit its so acting in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The majority, despite its encouragement of different, more flexible behavior, in point of fact, has endorsed and validated what the trial court did in this case. Thus, it permits the deferral of rulings on the admissibility of proposed impeachment evidence in all cases; a trial court can always conceive that there may be a change in testimony from that suggested by the pleading and/or opening statements and proffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">This holding by the majority is surprising amidst its concession that Maryland and other sister courts have held that trial judges \u201cshould rule on motions <em>in limine.\u201d </em>I agree with the majority that \u201cmany are the times when a trial court can and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>therefore should decide a motion <em>in limine </em>... before the defendant makes the election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586, 993 A.2d at 665. Indeed, I believe this case presents such an occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">It is clear that the trial court had enough information at its disposal to conduct the balancing test and make an informed ruling. It had the opening statement of the petitioner, the express statements of the State that it intended to use the prior convictions to impeach the petitioner, the knowledge that the prior convictions were similar to, if not the same, as the charges the petitioner was currently facing, and the completed testimony of one of the officers. Whatever additional information the trial court needed could have been obtained from a proffer. Additionally, the trial court initially acknowledged, and I would agree, that in this ease the fact that the prior convictions mirrored the current drug-related charges made the introduction of such evidence before a jury highly prejudicial. \u201cThis was an uncomplicated drug case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">A proffer is not intended to take the place of testimony. It does, however, provide the court with information with regard to the evidence the parties intend to produce on an issue. It is a tool. A trial court, aware of the proffer and concerned that the actual testimony might vary from the proffer, could, as the majority notes, \u201cbe accompanied by an express caution to the defendant that, if the defendant\u2019s direct testimony departs from the proffer in a way that changes the probative/prejudice balance scrutiny required by Rule 5-609(a), then a final ruling on the admissibility of the impeachment evidence might well be different.\u201d <em>Dallas v. State, </em>413 Md. at 586, n. 11, 993 A.2d at 665, n. 11; <em>see also Luce v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 38, 41-42, 105 S.Ct. 460, 463, 83 L.Ed.2d 443, 447-48 (1984) (\u201cThe ruling is subject to change when the case unfolds, particularly if the actual testimony differs from what was contained in the defendant\u2019s proffer. Indeed even if nothing unexpected happens at trial, the district judge is free, in the exercise of sound judicial discretion, to alter a previous in <em>limine </em>ruling.\u201d). Indeed, this is initially what the trial court stated it would do with regard to the \u201cI\u2019m a three-time loser\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>statement. After stating how prejudicial the admission of such evidence would be, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: If [the petitioner] takes the stand, I mean, that\u2019s another issue because that\u2019s another consideration, but as to the motion in limine as to his statement, at this juncture I\u2019m going to actually grant the motion in limine based on this set of facts, and, Mr. Macdonell, you have to understand, I\u2019m going to grant it without hearing any evidence based on the proffers made here today with respect to this statement that he made, and I\u2019m doing that anticipating that he is not going to take the stand. Now, if he takes the stand, I\u2019m going to have to look at it in another light.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The court should have done the same with regard to the prior convictions. The trial court had options available that, without cause or explanation, it simply refused to utilize. Instead, it prematurely decided to postpone its ruling. This was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Additionally, Rule 5-609 was adopted \u201cto discriminate between the informative use of past convictions to test credibility, and the pretextual use of past convictions where the convictions are not probative of credibility but instead merely create a negative impression of the defendant.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 716, 668 A.2d at 13. In accordance with the Rule\u2019s purpose, the <em>Jackson </em>Court identified five factors to assist in the trial court\u2019s execution of the balancing test. It is important to note that what the petitioner testifies, the \u201cactual testimony,\u201d is not one of them. Rather, they are: (1) the impeachment value of the prior crime; (2) the time that has elapsed since the conviction and the witness\u2019s history subsequent to the conviction; (3) the similarity between the prior crime and the conduct at issue in the instant case; (4) the importance of the witness\u2019s testimony; and (5) the centrality of the witness\u2019s credibility. <em>Id., </em>340 Md. at 717, 668 A.2d at 14 (citing <em>United States v. Mahone, </em>537 F.2d 922, 929 (7th Cir.1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>The trial court expressed that it was unable to conduct the balancing test because it could not yet assess the \u201cimportance of the witness\u2019 credibility.\u201d To be sure, the court\u2019s focus was on one of the relevant factors. The problem is, it did not properly construe or apply that factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The \u201cimportance of the witness\u2019 credibility\u201d is not dependant upon what the petitioner actually says when he or she testifies. Instead, what it implicates is how the petitioner\u2019s taking the stand will affect the balancing scale. The trial court, therefore, was not at a disadvantage without the petitioner\u2019s actual testimony. It could assess, from its vantage point as the presider at the trial, quite apart from what the defendant might say on the stand, the significance of the petitioner\u2019s taking the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">On the issue of credibility, this Court recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201c \u2018Where credibility is the central issue, the probative value of the impeachment is great, and thus weighs heavily against the danger of <em>unfair </em>prejudice.\u2019 <em>Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 721, 668 A.2d at 16. In the context of the present record, evidence of Lagarde\u2019s 2002 felony conviction could have been highly probative. The State\u2019s case hinged almost entirely on the jury believing Phillips\u2019s testimony, which Lagarde partially corroborated. While not certain, it is at least conceivable, based on what was adduced at trial, that the jury could have been unsure of Phillips\u2019s account, making the corroboration provided by Lagarde an important component to the State\u2019s successful prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\"><em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 701-02, 967 A.2d 790, 801-02 (2009).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court further articulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">\u201cThe State\u2019s case required the members of the jury to decide whether they believed Phillips\u2019s narrative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>events____ Therefore, Lagarde\u2019s testimony was important to the State, and the impeachment value of her conviction certainly would have been probative under the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 703, 967 A.2d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The prejudice generated by prior convictions that are the same or similar to the charges the petitioner is facing is great and, therefore, so, too, is the risk of unfair prejudice when they are used to impeach a defendant\u2019s credibility. In fact, this Court, in <em>King, </em>made clear that the risk of unfair prejudice is heightened when the defendant\u2019s own testimony is at issue. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201cIf the relevant witness is the defendant, the risk of unfair prejudice to her or him is high1 because \u2018the jury may improperly infer that [she or he] has a history of criminal activity and therefore is not entitled to a favorable verdict.\u2019 <em>Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 715, 668 A.2d at 13 (quoting <em>Ricketts, </em>291 Md. at 703, 436 A.2d at 908). Stated otherwise, the jury may feel that \u2018if the defendant is wrongfully found guilty[,] no real harm is done.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ricketts, </em>291 Md. at 703, 436 A.2d at 908); <em>see also [State </em>v.] <em>Westpoint, </em>404 Md. [455,] [ ] 479, 947 A.2d [519,] [ ] 534 (2008) (quoting same). For a defendant wishing to tell her or his story to the jury, this translates to a very real prejudice: the defendant may be forced to choose between testifying in her or his own defense with the risk of being convicted by the jury\u2019s misuse of impeachment evidence as propensity evidence, on one hand, and not testifying and foregoing a defense, on the other. <em>See Westpoint, </em>404 Md. at 479, 947 A.2d at 534; <em>Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 715, 668 A.2d at 13.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 704, 967 A.2d at 803. That is the situation existed here. The risk of that \u201cvery real prejudice,\u201d <em>id., </em>was patent. The magnitude of the risk was not dependent on the substance of the petitioner\u2019s testimony; it neither expanded nor contracted depending on what the petitioner said or did not say. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that it needed to hear the petitioner\u2019s testimony before it could determine the balance, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>does not follow.

Maryland Rule 5-609. Impeachment by evidence of conviction of crime.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">\"(a) Generally. For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if elicited from the witness or established by public record during examination of the witness, but only if (1) the crime was an infamous crime or other crime relevant to the witness's credibility and (2) the court determines that the probative value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>admitting this evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or the objecting party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">\u201c(b) Time limit. Evidence of a conviction is not admissible under this Rule if a period of more than 15 years has elapsed since the date of the conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">\u201c(c) Other limitations. Evidence of a conviction otherwise admissible under section (a) of this Rule shall be excluded if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">\"(1) the conviction has been reversed or vacated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">\u201c(2) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avz\">\"(3) an appeal or application for leave to appeal from the judgment of conviction is pending, or the time for noting an appeal or filing an application for leave to appeal has not expired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\">\u201c(d) Effect of plea of nolo contendere.

In addition to the issue, presented by the petitioner concerning the admissibility of prior convictions for the same or similar crime to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>being tried, for impeachment, the State challenged whether that issue was properly preserved for appellate review. I agree with the majority that it was.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b618-9\">. The Harford County police officers who arrested the defendant reported that, when the contraband was recovered from his person, he said: \"I\u2019m a three-time loser and I\u2019m facing 25 years. Can't you say you just found the stuff on the ground?\u201d Ruling on the petitioner\u2019s oral motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude, or in the alternative to redact the Statement and a motion to suppress the petitioner\u2019s prior convictions, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">\"I\u2019m not going to permit any evidence of any prior bad acts or convictions or admissions that relate directly to the crime being charged. I believe, based on my experience, that the prejudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>effect of that type of evidence is so vastly prejudicial that it will not outweigh any probative value that it has, and that is particularly evidenced in this case where the drugs were found on the person of the particular individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">Upon inquiry by the State, the trial court made clear, however, that \u201c[i]f [the petitioner] takes the stand ... that\u2019s another issue because that\u2019s another consideration.... Now, if he takes the stand, I'm going to have to look at it in another light.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b619-12\">. Initially, the trial court, convinced by the State\u2019s argument, ruled that the State could use the petitioner's prior distribution convictions to impeach the petitioner's testimony, should the petitioner testify. The State had argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">\"Your Honor, there is no case out there that says it\u2019s essentially a preclusion that the Court preclude it from allowing impeachables for the same offense.... The Court stands between the balancing process to evaluate it, but there is no prohibition and the Courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>allowed it. The Courts also have commented that there is a number of factors to consider, such as, whether the defendant testifies as the only witness for the defense, the centrality of his credibility to that testimony, and the presentation of the defense\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\"In this case, presuming, ... that the defendant is the only witness to testify for the defense ... his credibility for defense case is very central to the issue of what the jury should believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\"In that case, the Courts are even more in favor of recognizing the use of a prior drug charge impeachable when he\u2019s on trial for a drug case.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b620-10\">. The petitioner elected not to testify notwithstanding the court's reminder, \u201cI have already said that I do recognize there\u2019s a high risk of unfair prejudice,\u201d and advice that \"there is a possibility that I might rule to your favor and not permit impeachable offenses.\u201d Perhaps he remembered that the trial court\u2019s initial ruling also came after that recognition by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">The majority suggests that the \"Petitioner did not complain at the time that the court\u2019s delay chilled his right to make an election.\u201d <em>Dallas v.

Indeed, when one reads the court's ruling on the <em>in limine </em>motion which resulted in the exclusion of the statement, it appeared that the convictions, too, had been excluded. That is why, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the close of the State's case, the petitioner began his inquiry, \"Of course, as indicated you would not let the State use the two distributions; is that right?\u201d When the court said it had not so ruled, the petitioner then asked that the court do so. For what purpose other than to inform the decision to testify would that motion have been made? When the motion was denied, why should he have to state the obvious, that the ruling affected his decision, and hope that the court would, on that basis, change its mind. In any event, the decision not to testify was made immediately after the failure of the court to rule, as indicated above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b626-10\">. In <em>King v.
