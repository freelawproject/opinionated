(\u201cthe City\u201d), in which 120 West Fayette alleges that the City illegally entered into a Land Disposition Agreement (\u201cLDA\u201d) to sell to Lexington Square Partners, LLC property in Baltimore\u2019s westside known as the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d When we first considered this case in <em>120 West Fayette Street, LLLP v. Baltimore, </em>407 Md. 253, 964 A.2d 662 (2009), we held that 120 West Fayette had standing to challenge the LDA and that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City had erred in treating the City\u2019s motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 258, 964 A.2d at 664-65. This case\u2019s current incarnation arises in response to the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in the City\u2019s favor on 120 West Fayette\u2019s original complaint and that court\u2019s grant of the City\u2019s motion to dismiss Count Two of 120 West Fayette\u2019s amended complaint. For the foregoing reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">\u201cIn 1999, the Baltimore City Council enacted an urban renewal plan<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the westside of downtown Baltimore. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>renewal plan, known as the \u2018Market Center Urban Renewal Plan,\u2019 [\u201cthe Renewal Plan\u201d] has been advertised as Baltimore\u2019s largest urban renewal plan since the plan to revitalize the city\u2019s Inner Harbor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258-59, 964 A.2d at 665. At issue in this case is an area within the westside redevelopment area known as the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d \u201cThe \u2018Superblock\u2019 encompasses five blocks and is bound by Fayette Street, Howard Street, Lexington Street, Clay Street, and Park Avenue.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 259, 964 A.2d at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u201cTo implement [the Renewal Plan], the Baltimore Board of Estimates (\u201cBOE\u201d) delegated \u2018ministerial and administrative\u2019 functions to a nonprofit corporation known as the Baltimore Development Corporation, Inc. (\u201cBDC\u201d).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258-59, 964 A.2d at 665. The BDC is a not-for-profit corporation created, among other reasons, \u201c[t]o develop and implement long-range development strategies for commercial, industrial, office, residential, and other development in the City of Baltimore[.]\u201d <em>Baltimore Dev. Corp. v. Carmel Realty Assocs., </em>395 Md. 299, 309, 910 A.2d 406, 411 (2006) (quoting Amended Articles of Incorporation of the City of Baltimore Development Corporation, ART. FOURTH, October 4,1991). The BDC is governed by a board of directors comprising \u201cnot less than seven (7), nor more than fifteen (15) directors,\u201d including the Commissioner of the City\u2019s Department of Housing and Community Development and the Director of the City\u2019s Department of Finance. <em>Id. </em>at 325 n. 17, 910 A.2d at 421-22 n. 17 (quoting SECTION 1 of the BDC\u2019s bylaws as amended on November 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>1997). Those directors not named in the bylaws, including the chairman of the board, are nominated by the Mayor of the City and elected by the corporation\u2019s members. <em>Id., </em>910 A.2d at 421 n. 17. The Mayor also has the authority to remove directors and fill vacancies on the board until the expiration of the absent director\u2019s term. <em>Id., </em>910 A.2d at 422 n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">In <em>Carmel Realty, </em>we recognized that the Mayor, by virtue of the above-mentioned authority, effectively controls the BDC\u2019s board of directors. <em>Id. </em>at 326, 910 A.2d at 422. In this case, the BDC\u2019s relevant responsibility was to orchestrate the development and revitalization of the City-owned properties subject to the Renewal Plan, including the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d To that end, \u201c[t]he City asserts that it instructed the BDC to \u2018work with developers and interested groups regarding the development of the westside, prepare and issue requests for development proposals, arrange and attend meetings between developers and business owners, and coordinate financial assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>120 West Fayette St., </em>407 Md. at 259, 964 A.2d at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">On October 27, 2003, the BDC issued a Request for Proposals (\u201cRFP\u201d) soliciting proposals from experienced real estate developers to develop the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d The RFP provided that the BDC, on behalf of the City, was \u201cseeking developers who [were] willing and able to develop [the \u201cSuperblock\u201d] ... in accordance with revitalization objectives and goals as stated [in the RFP], as well as the rules and regulations for standards and controls established by the Mayor and City Council ... and implemented by the BDC.\u201d In addition to other rules and regulations, the City\u2019s efforts to redevelop the \u201cSuper-block\u201d are subject to a Memorandum of Agreement (\u201cMOA\u201d) between the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City, and the Maryland Historical Trust (\u201cMHT\u201d). Among other things, the MOA provides that in all City-issued RFPs \u201cthe City will use reasonable efforts\u201d to preserve certain City-owned or acquired historic properties within the relevant development area.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Accordingly, the RFP provided, in part, that the proposed \u201c[development should conform to the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) executed between the City and the Maryland Historical] Trust ... and The West Side Strategic Plan.\u201d The RFP also provided that the selected developers would receive an Exclusive Negotiating Privilege (\u201cENP\u201d), which guaranteed them the exclusive privilege of negotiating a Land Disposition Agreement (\u201cLDA\u201d) with the City.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the ENP\u2019s term, the privileged developers would be granted an opportunity to enter the property and conduct any activities necessary to satisfy the City\u2019s requirements within the ENP. After the expiration of the term, the City could extend the time period if negotiations were \u201cproceeding satisfactorily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In response to the RFP, the BDC received proposals from four competitive development teams and responded to each of those development teams with written questions. Additionally, each development team presented its proposal to BDC staff and members of the WestSide Renaissance and the MHT.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among the prospective development teams was Next Genera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>tion Chera, LLC (\u201cNext Generation\u201d), with which the Mayor, members of the BDC, and members of the WestSide Renaissance met prior to awarding an ENP, on June 24, 2005, to Lexington Square Partners, LLC (\u201cLexington Square\u201d), an affiliate of Next Generation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ENP lists the signatories as the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, on whose behalf the president of the BDC signed; Lexington Square, represented by its managing member\u2019s signature; and the City\u2019s Chief Solicitor, who signed on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The ENP provided for a one-year negotiations period with an option to extend for six months, required Lexington Square to \u201ccomply in all material respects\u201d with the MOA, and specified that the ultimate disposition of the property would be governed by the terms of an LDA subject to the approval of the BOE. The ENP did not guarantee that the BOE would approve an LDA with Lexington Square. After the one-year term expired, Lexington Square exercised the six-month extension. After that term expired, in a letter dated December 14, 2006, the BDC recommended to the BOE that the City enter into an LDA with Lexington Square. At a public meeting on January 10, 2007, the BOE approved and authorized the execution of the LDA with Lexington Square. In November 2007, the BOE approved an amendment of the LDA to reflect changes in the property being transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Under the LDA, Lexington Square will receive upon closing a fee simple interest in all property conveyed pursuant to the agreement. Closing on the property is contingent on several conditions, including the City\u2019s acquisition of any unowned property to be conveyed under the agreement, the \u201cresolution of any legal and administrative challenges,\u201d the MHT\u2019s approval of the project plan, and sufficient evidence that Lexington Square has financing for the project. In the event that the closing does not occur by December 31, 2010, the LDA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>provides that as long as the developer has not defaulted on the agreement, it will terminate automatically without liability or obligation to either party. Similarly, if the parties are unable to agree on a final project plan, the developer may terminate the agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the event that Lexington Square defaults on the terms of the LDA, it provides that the City will have a right of re-entry. The LDA also provides that Lexington Square will be reimbursed for its costs plus ten percent interest upon the City\u2019s default.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\n<em>The Lawsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">On February 27, 2007, 120 West Fayette filed, as a taxpayer and landowner, a declaratory judgment action against the City to challenge the validity of the Lexington Square LDA. 120 West Fayette argued that \u201cthe City, and its agent, the BDC, unlawfully violated and manipulated the RFP process, in violation of the City\u2019s Charter and laws, to award the LDA to a favored developer.\u201d <em>120 West Fayette St., </em>407 Md. at 260, 964 A.2d at 665. Accordingly, 120 West Fayette sought a declaratory judgment finding that the LDA awarded to Lexington Square was illegal and <em>ultra vires. </em>On April 30, 2007, the City filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and on January 18, 2008, the Circuit Court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting the City\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis that 120 West Fayette did not have standing to bring the suit and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">1) There is no expenditure of public funds in connection with the development of the Superblock, 2) the Defendant City acted according to the City\u2019s Code in authorizing the BDC to act on its behalf, 3) the Superblock is not a public work subject to the competitive bidding process outlined in the City\u2019s Charter, and 4) the Defendant City did not engage in any illegal or <em>ultra vires </em>acts in the LDA or ENP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>120 West Fayette St., </em>407 Md. at 260, 964 A.2d at 666 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">120 West Fayette timely appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, but this Court issued a writ of certiorari on its own motion before the intermediate appellate court considered the case. <em>120 West Fayette v. Baltimore, </em>405 Md. 290, 950 A.2d 828 (2008). As previously mentioned, we held in <em>120 West Fayette Street </em>that the Circuit Court had erred in granting the City\u2019s motion to dismiss because it relied on factual and documentary matters outside of the pleadings in reaching its conclusion and effectively converted the City\u2019s motion into a motion for summary judgment without allowing 120 West Fayette the requisite opportunity to engage in discovery. 407 Md. at 262-65, 964 A.2d at 666-68. We also held that 120 West Fayette had alleged sufficient facts to establish taxpayer standing, as well as property owner standing. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 273, 964 A.2d at 671, 673. Therefore, we reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case to that court for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 274, 964 A.2d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Upon remand to the Circuit Court, the City filed a motion for summary judgment on April 13, 2009. On April 29, 2009, 120 West Fayette filed an opposition to the City\u2019s motion and on June 17, 2009, filed an amended complaint effectively alleging in Count Two that the proposed plans for the \u201cSuper-block\u201d had not been approved by the MHT and violated certain provisions of the Renewal Plan as well as the MOA. Therefore, 120 West Fayette sought declaratory relief declaring the applicability to the \u201cSuperblock\u201d of the MOA and the Renewal Plan development standards. On July 1, 2009, the City filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment as to Count Two\u201d and a request for a hearing. On July 8, 2009, 120 West Fayette filed an interim response to the City\u2019s motion and on July 21, 2009, filed an opposition to the motion. Because the City\u2019s second motion \u201cwas not yet ripe for judicial review,\u201d the Circuit Court held no hearing on the motion and issued an order and memorandum opinion on both motions on August 14, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The Circuit Court considered 120 West Fayette\u2019s contention that the City\u2019s disposition of the \u201cSuperblock\u201d was subject to the competitive bidding requirements of the Baltimore City Charter (\u201cthe Charter\u201d). The court found that \u201cthe statutory language in the Baltimore City Code, Baltimore City Charter, and Maryland Constitution clearly grants plenary authority to the City to dispose of the property for development or redevelopment without any mention of the requirement for competitive bidding.\u201d Accordingly, the court determined that the City was not required to use competitive bidding for development or redevelopment initiatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The court then addressed whether the \u201cSuperblock\u201d LDA was a public work project subject to competitive bidding requirements under Article IV, \u00a7 11 of the Charter. The court determined that the LDA was not a public work because it contemplated development on the developer\u2019s private land for the developer\u2019s private use.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the court rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>120 West Fayette\u2019s suggestion that the RFP initiated a competitive bidding process subject to the Article VI, \u00a7 11 procurement laws. Noting that the City would not own or operate the property developed under the RFP and would have minimal ongoing control over any development, the court found that the City had not intended the RFP to initiate a competitive bidding process and, therefore, that the City was not bound by the \u00a7 11 procurement laws when considering proposals to develop the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Additionally, the court considered whether the City had impermissibly delegated urban renewal powers to the BDC and found that, under Baltimore City Code, Article 13, \u00a7 2-7, the City Department of Housing and Community Development (\u201cDHCD\u201d) has the authority to contract with the BDC for urban renewal consulting services.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>determined that the BDC\u2019s recommendation of a developer to the BOE was an advisory act properly vested in the BDC and that the ultimate decision-making authority had remained with the BOE. Accordingly, the court found that the City was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the original complaint. As to Count Two of 120 West Fayette\u2019s amended complaint, the Circuit Court found that the facts as alleged did not present a controversy ripe for judicial consideration because the City has not yet adopted plans for the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">On September 10, 2009, 120 West Fayette timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and on September 11, 2009, filed with this Court a petition for writ of certiorari, seeking to bypass review by the Court of Special Appeals. On September 15, 2009, the City filed an answer and cross-petition for writ of certiorari. On September 16, 2009, 120 West Fayette filed an \u201cEmergency Motion for Expedited Review,\u201d seeking expedited consideration of its petition and the City\u2019s cross-petition. On September 28, 2009, we granted 120 West Fayette\u2019s motion and certiorari on both petitions, <em>120 West Fayette St., LLLP v. Baltimore, </em>410 Md. 701, 980 A.2d 482 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The petition and cross-petition presented five questions for our consideration.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To answer these questions, however, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>need only address (1) whether the Circuit Court properly found that the LDA was not subject to competitive bidding requirements, (2) whether the Circuit Court properly determined that the City\u2019s delegation of authority to the BDC was lawful and therefore that the LDA was not an <em>ultra vires </em>act, and (3) whether the Circuit Court correctly concluded that it could not issue a declaratory judgment that the proposed plans for the \u201cSuperblock\u201d are subject to the MOA and the Renewal Plan development standards because the controversy was not ripe for judicial consideration. For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Before considering the questions of law, we must \u201cmake the threshold determination as to whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists, and only where such dispute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>absent will we proceed to review determinations of law.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v. Baltimore County, </em>382 Md. 102, 110, 854 A.2d 1191, 1196 (2004) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). A trial court may grant summary judgment \u201cwhen there is no genuine dispute of material fact and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>120 West Fayette St., </em>407 Md. at 264, 964 A.2d at 668. Whether a trial court properly applied this standard is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Rhoads v. Sommer, </em>401 Md. 131, 148, 931 A.2d 508, 517-18 (2007). To determine whether any genuine dispute of material fact precludes the grant of summary judgment, we review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, construing against the moving party any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts. <em>Id., </em>931 A.2d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">120 West Fayette argues that the Circuit Court erred by construing disputed facts in favor of the City. We agree, however, with the Circuit Court\u2019s determination that no dispute of material fact exists. 120 West Fayette and the City agree that the BDC issued an RFP on October 27, 2003, that the City received four viable proposals in response to the RFP, and that the proposals were presented to the BDC staff, the WestSide Renaissance, and the MHT. Moreover, the parties agree that, although the initial RFP did not include the former Greyhound Terminal, the ultimate LDA included the terminal as part of the property to be conveyed. Notably, 120 West Fayette argues that the Circuit Court erred by accepting the City\u2019s assertion that the ultimate authority to approve the LDA was vested in the BOE. Yet, the record demonstrates that the BDC recommended that the BOE award the LDA to Lexington Square, and the BOE approved the LDA on January 10, 2007, at a public meeting. None of the facts in the record indicates that an entity other than the BOE had final approval of the LDA or that the BOE could not have refused to approve the LDA. The City does not contest 120 West Fayette\u2019s version of the facts, but rather the legal effect of them. Accordingly, we shall now address whether the City was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">First, we consider whether all City urban renewal projects are subject to the competitive bidding requirements established in Article VI, \u00a7 11, regardless of whether those projects constitute public works. 120 West Fayette contends that, contrary to the Circuit Court\u2019s finding, urban renewal projects are not exempt from the Charter\u2019s competitive bidding requirements because the Charter does not explicitly exempt such projects from the requirements and applying the requirements is consistent with the statutory scheme. The City counters that none of the Charter or Code provisions relating to the disposition of land for development or redevelopment requires competitive bidding and that the Circuit Court correctly found that the LDA was not subject to competitive bidding requirements. In support, the City points to Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Charter, which establishes the City\u2019s authority to engage in land development and redevelopment through property sales, and Article 13, \u00a7 2\u20147(f)(1), which allows the DHCD, on behalf of the City, to dispose of property for redevelopment \u201cat public or private sale.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, the City contends that the only caveats on the City\u2019s authority to dispose of the property are that the prices and terms of the sale be \u201cappropriate to the uses prescribed for such land or property by the applicable Renewal Plan,\u201d and that the BOE approves the contract. Art. 13, \u00a7 2\u20147(f)(2), (f)(3). The City \u00bfIso points out that Article VI, \u00a7 11 is entitled \u201cBoard of Estimates-procurement\u201d and therefore is intended to apply to City purchases of goods and services and the construction of City buildings, not the sale of land for redevelopment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>We construe local ordinances and charters under the same canons of statutory construction as we apply to statutes. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>382 Md. at 113, 854 A.2d at 1198. \u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005) (citing <em>Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 688, 861 A.2d 727, 730 (2004)). In ascertaining legislative intent, \u201cwe assign the words their ordinary and natural meaning\u201d and avoid adding or deleting words to impose a meaning inconsistent with the plain language of the ordinance or charter. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>382 Md. at 113-14, 854 A.2d at 1198. Moreover, \u201ca court must read the language of the charter or ordinance in context and in relation to all of its provisions[.]\u201d <em>Howard Research Dev. Corp. v. Concerned Citizens for the Columbia Concept, </em>297 Md. 357, 364, 466 A.2d 31, 34 (1983). Therefore, when two provisions \u201crelate to the same subject matter, and are not inconsistent with each other, they should be construed together and harmonized where consistent with their general object and scope.\u201d <em>Md-Nat'l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Anderson, </em>395 Md. 172, 183, 909 A.2d 694, 700 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Likewise, \u201cwhen two statutes appear to apply to the same situation, this Court will attempt to give effect to both statutes to the extent that they are reconcilable.\u201d <em>Id., </em>909 A.2d at 700 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Whether Article II, \u00a7 15 and Article 13, \u00a7 2-7 must be construed <em>in pari materia </em>with Article VI, \u00a7 11 turns on whether these sections relate to the same subject matter or apply to the same situation and are not inconsistent with one another.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See id., </em>909 A.2d at 700. Article II, \u00a7 15 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Article 13, \u00a7 2-7 address the City\u2019s authority to acquire property and to sell or dispose of property. Article VI, \u00a7 11(a) provides that the BOE \u201cshall be responsible for awarding all contracts and supervising all purchasing by the City as provided in this section and elsewhere in the Charter.\u201d Because the acquisition or sale of property typically involves a contract of some sort, in this sense, these provisions relate to the same subject matter. Our efforts to reconcile Article VI, \u00a7 11 with the other provisions, however, must not result in an illogical or unreasonable interpretation. When construing a statute, \u201cwe seek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">When contracting for public works,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Article VI, \u00a7 11(b) requires the City to obtain bids through a competitive bidding process, and \u00a7 11(g)(1) of that same article mandates that the BOE accept the lowest bid submitted in response to the City\u2019s request for bids.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We have recognized that, gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ally, the purpose of competitive bidding is \u201cto prevent favoritism and collusion and thereby procure public improvements at the lowest cost to the taxpayers.\u201d <em>Bd. of Ed. v.

The language of Article VI, \u00a7 11(g)(1) that requires the BOE to accept the lowest bid or reject all bids confirms that the competitive bidding procedures established therein serve the same purpose. Section 11(g) applies to \u201call bids made to the City in response to the formal advertising procedures contained in [\u00a7 11].\u201d Applying \u00a7 11(g) to the sale of City property, however, would require the City to accept the lowest bid for the property. This is entirely inconsistent with one of a seller\u2019s main objectives\u2014to obtain the highest value for the property.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, because applying Article VI, \u00a7 11 to property sales contracts would reach an illogical and unreasonable result, we conclude that the Circuit Court correctly determined that dispositions of City property, pursuant to Article II, \u00a7 15 and Article 13, \u00a7 2-7, are not subject to the competitive bidding requirements of Article VI, \u00a7 11.

Moreover, 120 West Fayette argues that the LDA is a public work contract because it requires expenditure of City funds to obtain any unowned property subject to the LDA, to relocate any remaining business within the \u201cSuper-block,\u201d and to reimburse Lexington Square for the actual cost of any environmental remediation, demolition, and streetscape improvements completed after the purchase of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In response, the City argues that the LDA is not a public work contract. The City asserts that a public work contract is one in which the City is \u201cspending public funds to acquire goods or services for the City to use\u201d and, in this case, the City is receiving money from Lexington Square for the sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d (Emphasis in original). Additionally, because the Charter does not expressly define public work, the City suggests that we refer to the definition of public work in the State\u2019s Prevailing Wage Law. As to whether the LDA is paid for by public money, the City asserts that it is not paying for the construction or development of the \u201cSuperblock\u201d and that the acquisition of the properties comprising the \u201cSuper-block\u201d involves expenditures entirely separate from the LDA with Lexington Square.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Maryland case law and legislative history shed no light on the meaning of public work as it appears in Art.

When a developer\u2019s primary motivation to construct a project is private economic benefit, that project is not for public use even if it confers upon the public secondary, incidental benefits such as economic development, neighborhood revitalization, employment opportunities, or additional affordable housing. <em>See Daniels, </em>594 S.W.2d at 241 (citing reduced unemployment and economic improvement as indirect public benefits); <em>L.

Whether a project is for public use also depends on whether the completed project will be government owned or operated and accessible to the general public. <em>See Lake Cyrus Dev.

Moreover, by transferring public property to a private entity, which may limit the general public\u2019s access to the property, the LDA ensures that any projects completed pursuant to the LDA are not for the general public use. <em>Cf. Cattaraugus Cmty. Action, </em>560 N.Y.S.2d at 551 (holding that a privately developed and owned home that limited access to only homeless young mothers was not a public work project). The construction contemplated by the LDA, private residential and commercial properties, neither publicly owned nor open to the general public and only indirectly benefitting the public, is not a project for public use. <em>See R.I. Bldg., </em>700 A.2d at 615 (\u201cBy no stretch of the imagination can the [processing] plant be considered a public building; it is not open to the general public and no governmental functions are conducted on its premises.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">To determine whether a project is funded wholly or in part by the government, the most obvious consideration is whether any government funding associated with the project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>directly pays project costs. <em>See Lake Cyrus Dev. Co., </em>959 So.2d at 650 (considering whether the city paid for part of the construction of a waterworks project); <em>Hafner, </em>335 Ill.Dec. 455, 918 N.E.2d at 1274 (rejecting the argument that city payment of thirty percent of a developer\u2019s interest payment on private loans to finance a redevelopment project was tantamount to funding the project); <em>Carson-Tahoe Hosp., </em>128 P.3d at 1067-68 (holding that a hospital was not publicly funded because hospital public revenue bond financing did not \u201cobligate county funds\u201d and no public body was party to the construction contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">On its face, the LDA does not obligate the City to fund construction within the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d Schedule D of the LDA provides that \u201c[t]he purchase price payable by [Lexington Square] will be $21,613,100 less the cost of demolishing and remodeling the Property.\u201d Moreover, the LDA provides that Lexington Square owed a $100,000 deposit upon signing the LDA and an additional payment upon closing that would bring Lexington Square\u2019s total payments to ten percent of the purchase price. Lexington Square will pay the remaining balance, up to 50 percent, of the purchase price over time as construction is completed. After construction is complete, Lexington Square must pay the remaining fifty percent of the purchase price, plus 6 percent interest, at intervals set by the LDA. Although the City is permitting Lexington Square to pay the purchase price over time, the LDA\u2019s terms make clear that the City is not directly funding construction. At no point will the City advance construction costs or any other development costs to Lexington Square, and, as noted, Lexington Square must pay interest on the fifty percent of the purchase price paid in installments after construction is completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Nevertheless, 120 West Fayette contends that the City\u2019s acquisition of any unowned property subject to the LDA and payment for relocation of any remaining business within the \u201cSuperblock\u201d constitute project funding. In <em>Demory Bros., </em>we addressed whether the cost of land acquisition for a school construction project constituted construction costs as contemplated by the Prevailing Wage Law. 273 Md. at 329-330, 329 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>A.2d at 679. We held that \u201c[cjonstruction costs, in the accepted sense, are the costs of the improvements or structures located on a site, and ... acquisition is not to be considered a cost of construction of public works[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330-31, 329 A.2d at 679 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Although the Prevailing Wage Law and the Charter\u2019s competitive bidding requirements serve different purposes,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the <em>Demory Bros, </em>distinction between property acquisition costs and construction costs is instructive in this case. We are not persuaded that the purpose of the competitive bidding requirements, to eliminate the risk of collusion and government overspending, is served by including the costs of property acquisition within the scope of the cost of a public work project when the development site is selected and acquired apart from any contracts to develop the site. Under these circumstances, in which the property is acquired from sources other than the developer, through contracts separate from the development contract, adding the cost of the property acquisition to the cost of the development defies common sense. Once the transaction through which the property is acquired is complete, labeling the property acquisition costs as public work costs, and thereby subjecting the entire project to competitive bidding requirements, would not serve the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Additionally, 120 West Fayette argues that the purchase price offsets for the cost of environmental remediation and streetscaping improvements constitute City funding for the development of the \u201cSuperbloek .\u201d The LDA provides that the purchase price for the \u201cSuperblock\u201d will be reduced by the amount of the actual cost incurred by Lexington Square for environmental remediation and the demolition of existing improvements, the cost of which is currently estimated to be $8,000,000. The LDA also provides that the City will offset the purchase price by the cost of any streetscape improvements Lexington Square performs. Contrary to 120 West Fayette\u2019s assertions, providing financial incentives to private developers to encourage economic development and investment in areas in need of revitalization does not necessarily constitute publicly funding the development. <em>See Vulcan Affordable Housing, </em>545 N.Y.S.2d at 954 (recognizing that \u201cimaginative financial schemes, including giving tax exemptions to a project, [does] not transform an essentially private venture into a public one\u201d); <em>Erie County Indus. Dev., </em>465 N.Y.S.2d at 306 (holding that a project is not publicly financed when \u201c[t]he public involvement concerns only the creation of the economic conditions and incentives which will encourage and foster this type of private development\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">As a practical matter, reducing the total purchase price of the property comprising the \u201cSuperblock\u201d does not obligate the City to pay Lexington Square anything; instead, Lexington Square will merely pay the City an amount less than the $21, 613,100 purchase price set forth in the LDA. Moreover, though the City is conveying the property for a lower price in exchange for Lexington Square\u2019s performance of the necessary remediation, demolition, and streetscaping, the City is not funding that work, and, in the event that the costs of remediation and demolition exceed $10,000,000, the LDA provides that Lexington Square is responsible for the excess costs. Environmental remediation is a complicated and often expensive process, the specter of which serves as a disincentive for developers considering potential development sites. See Brian C. Walsh, <em>Statute, Seeding the Brownfields: A </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>Proposed Statute Limiting Environmental Liability for Prospective Purchasers, </em>34 Harv. J. on Legis. 191, 199 (1997) (describing the challenges of environmental remediation as involving \u201cuncertain cleanup standards, long delays, expenses and uncertainty in recovering costs from [potentially responsible parties], and a lack of finality\u201d). By offsetting part of the cost of remediation up to the cap, the City avoids directly paying the diffieult-to-estimate cost of remediation, limits the City\u2019s potential liability, and offers an incentive to developers. The portion of the offset that compensates Lexington Square\u2019s demolition costs similarly benefits the City while serving as an incentive to the developer. Redeveloping previously developed property may cost more than developing an open lot because the existing structures and improvements do not meet the developer\u2019s needs. The offset for demolition costs reflects the impact the cost of demolition has on the property value to the developer. Yet, the City is not contracting for the demolition and does not fund the work. As for the streetscaping, it too will be completed and paid for by Lexington Square, not the City. The corresponding purchase price reduction reflects the time, effort, and expense the developer will incur to transform the existing streetscape to accommodate the new development. Accordingly, we agree with the City that these offsets are not costs borne by the City, but rather are incentives for a developer to purchase the property \u201cas is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Complex financial schemes such as this one, coupled with government oversight of a development project, arguably create ambiguity as to whether a project is publicly or privately contracted. Nonetheless, we cannot conclude that the financial incentives offered to Lexington Square convert a privately funded project into a public one. \u201c[Wjhere ... a public agency merely sells land to a private entity to develop for its own private purpose ... the agency has not \u2018contracted for\u2019 the construction, even if the agency retains some control over the type or style of the development to ensure that the development is compatible with the agency\u2019s objectives.\u201d <em>Portland Dev.

Even though under the LDA the City retains the right to review and approve the final construction and design plans for the \u201cSuperblock,\u201d the City is not funding the project. Lexington Square is funding the design and planning of the \u201cSuperblock\u201d redevelopment, and Lexington Square, not the City, will own the finished product. <em>See Daniels, </em>594 S.W.2d at 240 (concluding that an industrial facility was not publicly funded because financing from the city would be repaid and a private corporation would ultimately own the property); <em>Nat\u2019l R.R.

Moreover, unlike typical publicly funded public works projects, the \u201cSuperblock\u201d development\u2019s final product, whether residential or commercial, will be privately operated and maintained. <em>Elliott, </em>571 N.W.2d at 870-71 (considering whether the project in question would be privately operated and maintained).

The delegation was unlawful, according to 120 West Fayette, because the BDC is not a qualified entity to exercise authority under Article II, \u00a7 15, which allows the City to seek assistance in carrying out its renewal powers from any \u201csuitable board, commission, department, bureau or other agency.\u201d 120 West Fayette contends, more specifically, that because the BDC does not qualify to exercise renewal authority under Article II, \u00a7 15, the BDC had no authority to consider the proposals submitted in response to the RFP outside of public meetings, to encourage the prospective developers to include additional partners in the project, to sign the ENP, to amend the site to include the former Greyhound terminal, or to make a recommendation to the BOE. Alternatively, 120 West Fayette argues that, even if the City could properly delegate some authority to the BDC, the BDC exercised non-delegable discretionary authority when it amended the property to be developed under the RFP and determined which developer would be granted the ENP. 120 West Fayette also argues that the comprehensive manner in which the BDC considered the proposals and winnowed down the eligible developers before making a recommendation to the BOE essentially usurped the BOE\u2019s authority to choose the developer. In other words, 120 West Fayette asserts that, because the BDC presented the BOE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>with a single recommendation, the BDC effectively gave the BOE no choice but to agree with the recommendation, thereby stripping the BOE of its discretion and rendering approval of the LDA a mere formality.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The City proffers that, rather than exercising its sole discretion to choose a developer, the BDC offered professional consulting services to the City to assist the BOE with choosing a developer. To carry out this function, the City argues that the BDC\u2019s solicitation and consideration of proposals and eventual recommendation to the BOE were administrative and ministerial functions delegated to the BDC by the City and the BOE in Ordinance 99-423. The City contends that these actions were not discretionary because the BDC could only consider proposals and make a recommendation and never had authority to enter into the LDA on the City\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>over, though the BDC issued the RFP, considered the proposals submitted in response to the RFP, and perfected its recommendation to the BOE without the direct involvement of the DHCD, the City asserts that, because the BOE made the final decision to enter into the LDA with Lexington Square, the BDC did not usurp the BOE\u2019s \u201cdiscretionary or legislative\u201d authority to select the developer and approve the LDA. The City further contends that the BDC\u2019s recommendation did not present the BOE with a false choice, but rather presented the BOE with a proposal that the BOE evaluated, amended, and discussed before unanimously approving the LDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The City may exercise only those powers expressly granted by the General Assembly. <em>See Piscatelli v. Bd. of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs, </em>378 Md. 623, 634-35, 837 A.2d 931, 937-38 (2003) (\u201c[T]he General Assembly has the authority to determine what powers are to be exercised by Baltimore City[.]\u201d). \u201cMost of the express powers granted by the General Assembly ... are contained in ... Article II of the Balti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>more City Charter for the City of Baltimore.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634, 837 A.2d at 937-38. Article II grants the City the \u201cfull power and authority\u201d to \u201csell, lease, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of any [land acquired for development or redevelopment]\u201d to a private entity for redevelopment and to exercise that power \u201cby ordinance.\u201d Article II, \u00a7 15(c). Article II, \u00a7 15(g) further provides that the City has the authority \u201cto vest jurisdiction or authority to exercise or perform all or any part\u201d of the authority granted in Article \u00a7 15(c) \u201cin any suitable board, commission, department, bureau or other agency of the Mayor and City Council.\u201d Accordingly, the City adopted Article 13, which established the DHCD and granted it \u201call of the powers of [the City] necessary or convenient, from time to time, to carry out and effectuate any and all of the functions and purposes mentioned in [Article 13, Subtitle 2],\u201d including the power to dispose of property for redevelopment purposes. Article 13, \u00a7 2-7. Moreover, Article 13, \u00a7 2-7(n) provides that the DHCD,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">[s]ubject to the prior approval of the [BOE], to contract, from time to time, with any private, public, or quasi-public corporation, partnership, association, person, or other legal entity for the furnishing of consulting, planning, designing, engineering, or other technical or specialized services in connection with the duties, powers, and functions of the [DHCD],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Similarly, Article 13, \u00a7 2-7(o) provides that the DHCD, subject to the BOE\u2019s approval, may \u201cemploy or hire, from time to time, by contract ... persons possessing technical or specialized skills in connection with the duties, powers, and functions of the [DHCD].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">First, we shall address the legitimacy of the City contract with the BDC. 120 West Fayette argues that the City\u2019s reliance on the BDC\u2019s assistance with the redevelopment of the \u201cSuperblock\u201d violates Article II, \u00a7 15 because the BDC does not constitute a \u201csuitable board, commission, department, bureau or other agency\u201d of the City. Article II, \u00a7 15(g). We disagree. In <em>Carmel Realty, </em>we addressed whether the BDC was a public body for the purposes of the Maryland Open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Meetings Act, which requires meetings of public bodies to be open to the public. Maryland Code (2009 RepLVol.) \u00a7\u00a7 10-501-10-512 of the State Government Article; <em>Carmel Realty, </em>395 Md. at 306, 910 A.2d at 410. Section 10-502(h)(2)(i) of the act \u201cmakes multimember boards appointed by the chief executive authority of a political subdivision, which consist of at least two individuals not employed by the particular subdivision, subject to the Open Meetings Act.\u201d <em>Carmel Realty, </em>395 Md. at 324, 910 A.2d at 421. As mentioned previously, the Mayor has \u201cpower of appointment or nomination to the Board, the power of removal over the members of the Board, and the power to appoint directors and fill vacancies for the remainder of terms of vacating directors.\u201d <em>Carmel Realty, </em>395 Md. at 326, 910 A.2d at 422. By virtue of this authority, the Mayor controls the BDC\u2019s Board, and, because the BDC\u2019s Board conducts the activities of the BDC, we concluded in <em>Carmel Realty </em>that \u201cthe Mayor controls the City of Baltimore Development Corporation and it is, in essence, a public body under the plain language of \u00a7 10\u2014502(h)(2)[.]\u201d <em>Id., </em>910 A.2d at 422. Of particular relevance is that this conclusion rests on this Court\u2019s determination that the BDC\u2019s Board of Directors is a \u201cboard appointed by the chief executive authority of a political subdivision.\u201d Given that the board of the BDC is sufficiently subject to City control that it must comply with the Open Meetings Act, the BDC is a \u201csuitable board\u201d for the purposes of Article II, \u00a7 15. <em>See id. </em>at 331, 910 A.2d at 425 (\u201c[AJI deliberations preceding the final decisions made by the Mayor or the City Council, must be open to the public to the same extent as would any proceeding of the Mayor or City Council of Baltimore City. This is because every step of the process comprises the consideration or transaction of public business.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Further validating the City\u2019s reliance on the BDC\u2019s efforts is the general principle that to carry out a specific function, such as urban development, a municipal agency may obtain assistance by contracting for professional services, subject to the approval of the BOE. <em>See Hughes v. Schaefer, </em>294 Md. 653, 452 A.2d 428 (1982) (acknowledging that the BOE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>could properly contract for professional services to obtain assistance to conduct a loan program). Article 13, \u00a7 2-7(n) expressly permits the DHCD to contract, \u201cwith any private, public, or quasi-public corporation\u201d for the furnishing of consulting or other specialized services in connection with the DHCD\u2019s renewal authority. The BDC is a corporation that specializes in commercial, residential, industrial, and office development projects and offers to serve as a liaison between the public and private sector for the purpose of facilitating development projects. This expertise certainly would assist the redevelopment work of the DHCD, and, thus, under Article 13, \u00a7 2-7(n), the DHCD may properly contract with the BDC for services related to redevelopment projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Next, we shall address the lawfulness of the BDC\u2019s acts pursuant to its contract and Ordinance 99-423, which hinges on whether the BDC performed legislative or discretionary functions vested exclusively in the City or the DHCD. \u201cThe rule is plain and well established that legislative or discretionary powers or trust devolved by law or charter on a council or governing body cannot be delegated to others, but ministerial or administrative functions may be delegated to subordinate officials.\u201d <em>Baltimore v. Wollman, </em>123 Md. 310, 315, 91 A. 339, 342 (1914). To be valid, a delegation of municipal authority must contain sufficiently specific guidelines to ensure that the delegate does not act with unfettered discretion. <em>Jack Lewis, Inc. v. Baltimore, </em>164 Md. 146, 150, 164 A. 220, 222 (1933) (emphasizing that the permissibility of delegated authority turns on \u201cwhether the grant or delegation ... vested [the delegates] with a complete and uncontrolled discretion, or whether it vested them with mere ministerial and administrative functions[.]\u201d). We have had few opportunities to address the delegation of municipal authority. Yet, more than 80 years ago, this Court emphasized the difficulties courts face when distinguishing between ministerial and discretionary acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">The field has become so vast, and the things to be considered so enlarged in number and so interrelated with one another, that it has been found practically impossible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>provide in laws and ordinances specific rules and standards by which every conceivable situation can be measured and determined. The result has been that we have turned more and more to the plan of providing in our laws and ordinances general rules and standards, and leaving to administrative boards and agencies the task of acquiring information, working out the details, and applying these rules and standards to specific cases. This is not considered a delegation of legislative authority, though it probably does represent an expansion of administrative power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><em>Tighe v. Osborne, </em>150 Md. 452, 463, 133 A. 465, 469 (1926) (addressing whether the City could properly delegate the power to approve construction permit applications to the zoning commissioner).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">More succinctly stated, the magnitude and complexity of the role of modern municipal government permits delegation subject to flexible standards as long as the process is not arbitrary and the ultimate decision is rendered by the municipality. A delegate\u2019s conduct must be subject to reasonably specific standards, but a ministerial task is not rendered discretionary merely because the applicable standards fail to address every decision the delegate might make. This approach is reflected in our analysis in <em>Hughes, </em>in which we considered whether a BOE-administered City loan program for development and redevelopment involved an unlawful delegation of discretionary power. 294 Md. at 655, 452 A.2d at 429. To administer the program, the BOE placed in four separate trusts certain municipal funds and designated two trustees to manage the trusts. <em>Id. </em>at 656, 452 A.2d at 429-30. The terms of each trust agreement provided that the trustees would review the proposed transactions involving trust funds and make recommendations to the BOE regarding the transactions and the BOE would approve or reject the transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 658, 452 A.2d at 430-31. The agreements provided, however, that the BOE could not approve any transactions unless the trustees had first favorably recommended the transaction to the BOE. <em>Id. </em>at 659, 452 A.2d at 431. Although we concluded in <em>Hughes </em>that the BOE could properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>delegate to the trustees the authority to review and recommend proposals, we held that the provision limiting the BOE\u2019s power of approval to only those proposals recommended by the trustees was an invalid limit on the BOE\u2019s discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 661-62, 452 A.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Just as the trustees in <em>Hughes </em>were imbued with the authority to consider and recommend proposed transactions, the BDC is authorized to consider proposals for developing the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d The trustees evaluated the proposals based on financial feasibility and whether they served the purposes of the trust, and, similarly, the BDC evaluated the proposals submitted in response to the RFP based on whether they served the Renewal Plan\u2019s purposes and the criteria set forth in Ordinance 99-423. Moreover, the ordinance charged the BDC with specific tasks and established protocols for the proposal evaluation process. Subject to these limitations, the BDC considered the proposals, met with the competing developers, and negotiated an offer with Lexington Square, contingent on BOE acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">120 West Fayette makes much of the BDC\u2019s suggestions that Next Generation include HAD Baltimore, II, LLC and Nakash-Lexington, LLC in the Lexington Square development team and that the former Greyhound terminal property be included within the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d We are not persuaded that these acts exceeded the BDC\u2019s administrative and ministerial responsibilities. We noted above that, to carry out their mandate, agencies often must acquire information and apply that information in the field. <em>See Tighe, </em>150 Md. at 463, 133 A. at 469 (describing agencies as \u201cacquiring information, working out the details, and applying [the applicable] rules and standards to specific cases\u201d). No set of standards can anticipate every eventuality that an agency will face; thus the standards must be flexible. By including the former Greyhound site within the RFP and introducing additional developers to the prospective development team, the BDC simply responded to the evolving facts on the ground in an effort to achieve the City\u2019s redevelopment objectives. The BDC did not usurp the City\u2019s authority to determine which properties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>were redeveloped, but rather ensured that the properties the City had selected for redevelopment were offered for redevelopment. Before the BDC offered the former Greyhound terminal site as part of the \u201cSuperblock\u201d redevelopment project, the BDC had been negotiating separately the terminal\u2019s redevelopment with the Weinberg Foundation and Arrow Parking. When those parties withdrew from negotiations, the BDC recognized an opportunity to include that site within the RFP and achieve the City\u2019s objective. Given that the BDC already had authority to negotiate the redevelopment of the site, this cannot be considered discretionary decision-making inconsistent with the BDC\u2019s administrative and ministerial delegations. Moreover, the BDC did not overstep its boundaries by recommending that additional partners with experience in Baltimore be included in the development team. Only Next Generation, not the BDC, had the authority to create the Lexington Square entity, and the formation of Lexington Square did not obligate the City in any way. Furthermore, neither the BDC\u2019s decision to include the former Greyhound terminal in the \u201cSuperblock\u201d redevelopment site nor the BDC\u2019s decision to introduce additional partners to Next Generation interfered with or constrained the BOE\u2019s authority to approve or reject the LDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Yet, 120 West Fayette contends that the LDA is <em>ultra vires </em>because the City merely appears to be the decision-maker. The facts belie this contention. Under the RFP, the Mayor reviews the BDC\u2019s evaluation of the proposals and \u201c[a]ny contract awarded by BDC ... [is] subject to approvals as required by City law, including the final approval by the [BOE].\u201d Moreover, in a specially designated section, the RFP explicitly provides that \u201c[a]pproval of a LDA is by action of the City\u2019s [BOE].\u201d At all times, the potential developers had notice that the LDA could be approved only by the City. Unlike in <em>Hughes, </em>in which the BOE\u2019s approval was limited to only those proposals recommended by the trustees, the City\u2019s hand is not forced. The BOE\u2019s approval is not contingent on a favorable recommendation from the BDC. The BOE could have rejected the BDC\u2019s recommendation and requested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>the BDC reconsider other proposals or re-solicit proposals for the project. <em>Cf. Hughes, </em>294 Md. at 661-62, 452 A.2d at 432 (permitting the BOE to approve only those proposals that had received favorable recommendations from the trustees and, therefore, effectively giving the trustees veto power over the BOE). Instead, before unanimously approving the proposal at a public meeting, the BOE reviewed the proposal, solicited additional information about the proposal from the BDC president and staff members, and requested that the proposed LDA be amended to include a cap on the purchase price offsets. This amendment is reflected in the LDA. For the aforementioned reasons, we agree with the Circuit Court that the City\u2019s contract with the BDC was not an improper delegation of discretionary authority. Therefore, we hold that the LDA is not <em>ultra vires.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We shall now address the remaining issue: whether the Circuit Court properly granted the City\u2019s motion to dismiss Count Two of 120 West Fayette\u2019s amended complaint, seeking a declaratory judgment that the proposed plans for the \u201cSuperblock\u201d are subject to the MOA and the Renewal Plan standards, because the controversy was not ripe for judicial consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">120 West Fayette argues that Count Two of the amended complaint presents a controversy ripe for adjudication because, to date, Lexington Square has not submitted to the City proposed plans that conform to the MOA and the Renewal Plan. Consequently, 120 West Fayette contends that Lexington Square does not intend to comply with the standards set forth in the MOA and the Renewal Plan. To further support this contention, 120 West Fayette points to a deposition in which, when asked, \u2018Would you proceed [with the demolition of historical buildings within the \u201cSuperblock\u201d] without the Maryland Historic[al] Trust giving you the go-ahead or saying it complies with the MOA?,\u201d BDC president Mr. Brodie responded, \u201cI would ask for legal advice.\u201d 120 West Fayette further argues that BDC inquiries regarding the applicability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>of the standards to a proposed twenty-seven-story high rise within the \u201cSuperblock\u201d demonstrate Lexington Square\u2019s intent to flout the MOA and Renewal Plan standards. To preempt any such violations, 120 West Fayette requests that we declare the applicable height standards within the \u201cSuper-block\u201d and the enforceability of the MOA and the Renewal Plan standards to development within the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The City responds that a declaratory judgment is improper at this juncture because 120 West Fayette has no evidence that Lexington Square or the City intends to circumvent the MOA or the Renewal Plan standards. The City argues that, to date, no plans have been finalized and that the City and Lexington Square are in the midst of negotiating a plan that conforms to the applicable standards. Moreover, the City disputes that Mr. Brodie\u2019s statement, that he would \u201cask for legal advice\u201d regarding whether he could proceed with the project without MHT approval, indicates anything more than that he would attempt to do what was legal under those circumstances. As to the proposed twenty-seven-story tower, the City asserts that the tower is part of a \u201cconceptual design\u201d that has not been adopted or approved. For these reasons, the City contends that any declaration regarding the applicability of the MOA and Renewal Plan standards would be tantamount to an \u201copinion on an issue that may never ripen into a judicial dispute\u201d and therefore would be premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The Maryland Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Maryland Code (2006 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 3-401 et seq. of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d), provides that \u201ca court of record within its jurisdiction may declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-403(a).

The test of the sufficiency of the bill is not whether it shows that the plaintiff is entitled to the declaration of rights or interest in accordance with his theory, but whether he is entitled to a declaration at all; so, even though the plaintiff may be on the losing side of the dispute, if he states the existence of a controversy which should be settled, he states a cause of suit for a declaratory decree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><em>Id., </em>494 A.2d at 936 (quoting <em>Shapiro, </em>219 Md. at 302-03, 149 A.2d at 398-99).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">When a complaint fails to allege a justiciable controversy, however, a motion to dismiss is proper. <em>See </em>C.J. \u00a7 3-409(a)(l) (authorizing declaratory judgments only when the complaint establishes that \u201c[a]n actual controversy exists between contending parties\u201d); <em>Boyds Civic Ass\u2019n v.

Prince George\u2019s County, </em>281 Md. 279, 288, 380 A.2d 12, 17 (1977).' \u201cTo be justiciable the issue must present more than a mere difference of opinion, and there must be more than a mere prayer for declaratory relief. Indeed, the addressing of non-justiciable issues would place courts in the position of rendering purely advisory opinions, a long forbidden practice in this State.\u201d <em>Hatt v. Anderson, </em>297 Md. 42, 46, 464 A.2d 1076, 1078 (1983) (internal citations omitted). A declaratory relief action that requests adjudication based on facts that have yet to occur or develop lacks ripeness and should be dismissed for failure to allege a justiciable controversy. <em>See Hickory Point P\u2019ship v.

Our review of the record, which assumes the truth of all well-pleaded facts and construes all \u201creasonable inferences drawn from them, in a light most favorable to the non-moving party,\u201d reveals nothing that rises to the level of an actual dispute between the parties that merits the declaratory judgment requested. <em>120 West Fayette St., </em>407 Md. at 261, 964 A.2d at 666 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 120 West Fayette effectively alleges that the proposed plan for the \u201cSuperblock\u201d will violate the MOA and the Renewal Plan, but the City has not yet adopted or approved any plans. <em>See Boyds, </em>309 Md. at 690, 526 A.2d at 602 (\u201c \u2018In a declaratory judgment proceeding, the court will not decide future rights in anticipation of an event which may never happen, but will wait until the event actually takes place[.]\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Tanner v.

Hatt, </em>297 Md. at 46-47, 464 A.2d at 1079 (dismissing a firefighter\u2019s request for declaratory relief on ripeness grounds because the fire department regulation prohibiting certain speech had not been applied or even threatened to be applied and \u201c[a]t most, [the firefighter] speculate^] as to what might happen under the regulation\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The RFP and the LDA both require the development to conform to the MOA and the Renewal Plan, and the record evidences nothing from which we can infer that the City would approve plans to the contrary. <em>See Boyds, </em>309 Md. at 691, 526 A.2d at 602 (explaining that the ripeness doctrine\u2019s purpose is \u201cto ensure that adjudication will dispose of an actual controversy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Finally, just as we are unable to infer from the <em>proposed </em>designs and project plans that Lexington Square or the City intends to violate the MOA or the Renewal Plan, we are unable to infer bad faith from the <em>proposed </em>twenty-seven-story tower that allegedly violates the height restrictions in the Renewal Plan. As 120 West Fayette alleges in its complaint, the drawings and plans for that tower \u201chave yet ... to be adopted, approved, or authorized.\u201d The possibility remains that Lexington Square will propose, and the City will approve, plans that, in accordance with the LDA\u2019s requirements, conform to the MOA and the Renewal Plan. Accordingly, we hold that the Circuit Court properly granted the City\u2019s motion to dismiss Count Two of the amended complaint on the grounds that 120 West Fayette failed to alleged facts ripe for adjudication and thus failed to establish a justiciable controversy.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">In sum, we hold that the LDA with Lexington Square is not subject to the Article VI, \u00a7 11 competitive bidding requirements because the LDA is not a public work contract. The project is neither for public use nor publicly funded. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>further hold that the LDA is not <em>ultra vires </em>because the process through which the LDA was granted did not constitute an improper delegation of the City\u2019s discretionary authority as related to urban renewal and redevelopment of the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d Finally, we hold that, because none of the allegedly violative design plans for the \u201cSuperblock\u201d has been finalized or approved, and none of the facts evidences the City\u2019s intent to adopt a proposal that violates the MOA or the Renewal Plan, 120 West Fayette failed to allege facts sufficiently ripe to rise to level of a justiciable controversy. For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court; dismissal of Count Two of 120 West Fayette\u2019s amended complaint shall be without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.
