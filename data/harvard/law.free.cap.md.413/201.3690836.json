In 1998, Crofton entered into a financing arrangement that, through the use of an interest rate swap agreement, exchanged the variable interest rate on Crofton\u2019s mortgage for a fixed rate. Crofton then submitted the interest payments made according to the swap agreement (\u201cswap payments\u201d) as mortgage interest payments for reimbursement from the respondent Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDHMH\u201d). DHMH, however, disallowed Crofton\u2019s claim that interest paid under its swap agreement was a reimbursable expense under CO-MAR.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Crofton appealed DHMH\u2019s decision to the Nursing Home Appeal Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d), which hears appeals from providers participating in Maryland\u2019s Medicaid program, and which ultimately affirmed DHMH\u2019s decision. Crofton then petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which reversed the Board\u2019s decision. On appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Special Appeals held, in an unreported opinion, that the swap payments were not reimbursable.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Crofton argues that, because the financing arrangement that included the swap agreement was incidental to refinancing Crofton\u2019s mortgage, the Court of Special Appeals erred when it determined that the swap payments were not mortgage interest payments. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Board applied the proper definition of mortgage interest and that Crofton\u2019s swap payments do not qualify as mortgage interest under that definition. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Crofton provides nursing and other medical services, in part, through Maryland\u2019s Medical Assistance Program (\u201cMed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ieaid\u201d), which is a state program partially funded by the federal government. <em>Liberty Nursing Center, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>330 Md. 433, 438, 624 A.2d 941, 943 (1993). \u201cWhen a state elects to participate in the [federal] medicaid program, it prepares and submits for approval by the federal Health Care Financing Administration ... a state medicaid plan for the provision of medical assistance that complies with the federal Medicaid Act[.]\u201d <em>Jackson v. Millstone, </em>369 Md. 575, 580, 801 A.2d 1034, 1037 (2002). \u201cIf the federal agency approves the state plan, then the state qualifies for federal funding, whereby the federal government will reimburse the state up to 50% of the cost of the medicaid program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 801 A.2d at 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Maryland\u2019s Medicaid program is administered by DHMH. <em>Id. </em>at 581, 801 A.2d at 1037. Pursuant to federal and state law, the Maryland Medicaid program reimburses nursing homes for patient-related costs of medical care, including interest payments on loans necessary for patient care. <em>See </em>Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1396 <em>et seq. </em>(2006); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430-456 (2008); Md.Code (2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 15-103, 15-105 of the Health General Article; COMAR 10.09.10 <em>et seq. </em>The Maryland Medicaid statutes charge DHMH with the promulgation of rules and regulations to govern the reimbursement of providers. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15-103, 15-105 of the Health General Article. Crofton\u2019s status as a Medicaid provider in Maryland entitles it to State reimbursements, which are issued by DHMH.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">When DHMH denies reimbursement to a provider participating in Maryland\u2019s Medicaid Program, the Board considers the provider\u2019s appeal. The present case arises out of the Board\u2019s denial of Crofton\u2019s request that DHMH reimburse the swap payments Crofton made subsequent to refinancing its mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\n<em>This Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In 1998, the term on Crofton\u2019s $4.2 million mortgage was expiring, bringing due a balloon payment on the loan. To avoid making the balloon payment, Crofton sought to refi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>nance the mortgage through a fixed rate loan. Crofton considered several bids, including a bid from M &amp; T Bank (\u201cthe Bank\u201d) for a loan with a 6.55% fixed interest rate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Seeking an even lower rate, Crofton entered negotiations with the Bank, which then produced a financing package that consisted of a $4.2 million term loan with an interest rate of LIBOR<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> plus one percent, a $500,000 term loan at an interest rate of LIBOR plus one percent, and a \u201cswap agreement\u201d trading the variable interest rate on the two term loans for a fixed interest rate of 5.5% based on a $4.7 million \u201cnotional amount,\u201d both of which quoted terms we next explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">A basic, \u201cplain vanilla,\u201d swap agreement \u201cis a contract between two parties, ... to exchange or \u2018swap\u2019 cash flows at specified intervals, calculated by reference to a particular rate or index.\u201d <em>See </em>S. Lawrence Polk &amp; Bryan M. Ward, <em>A Guide to the \u201cRegulatory No Man\u2019s Land\u201d of Over-The-Counter Interest Rate Swaps, </em>124 Banking L.J. 397, 399 (2007). The \u201c[m]ost commonly employed [interest rate swaps] are fixed/floating rate swaps in which the first counterparty pays the second at designated intervals, a specific amount of interest based on a fixed interest rate multiplied\u201d by an agreed principal amount called the \u201cnotional\u201d amount. Stuart Somer, <em>A Survey of Legal &amp; Regulatory Issues Relevant to Interest Rate Swaps, </em>4 DePaul Bus. L.J. 385, 387 (1992). Concurrently, the second counterparty pays the first counterparty based on a floating interest rate, such as LIBOR, applied to the notional amount. <em>Id. </em>The notional amount is used solely to calculate the interest payments and is not exchanged between the parties. <em>Thrifty Oil Co. v. Bank of America Nat\u2019l Trust and Sav. Ass\u2019n, </em>310 F.3d 1188, 1191 (9th Cir.2002) (adopting 249 B.R. 537 (S.D.Cal.2000)), <em>modified, Thrifty Oil Co. v. Bank </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>of America Nat\u2019l Trust and Sav. Ass\u2019n, </em>322 F.3d 1039, 1043 (9th Cir.2003) (addressing counsel fee issue). The swap enables a party to hedge against interest rate fluctuations by exchanging \u201cinterest payment streams of one debt instrument for those of another, where both debt obligations are the same amount.\u201d Somer, <em>supra </em>at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">In <em>Thrifty Oil Co., </em>a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals explained a hypothetical five-year interest rate swap between Counterparties A and B:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">(1) Counterparty A agrees to pay a floating interest rate equal to LIBOR ...; (2) Counter-party [sic] B agrees to pay a 10% fixed interest rate; (3) both counterparties base their payments on a $1 million notional amount and agree to make payments semiannually. If LIBOR is 9% upon commencement of the first payment period, Counterparty B must pay A: (10%-9%) \u2605 $1 million \u2605 (.5) = $5,000. These net payments vary as LIBOR fluctuates and continue every six months for the term of the swap. If interest rates rise, the position of Counterparty B, the fixed-rate payor, improves because the payments it receives increase. For example, if LIBOR rises to 11% at the beginning of the next payment period, Counterparty B receives a net payment of $5,000 from A. Conversely, the position of Counterparty A, the floating-rate payor, improves when interest rates fall. The party whose position retains positive value under the swap is considered \u2018in the money\u2019 while a party with negative value is considered \u2018out of the money.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">310 F.3d at 1191-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Interest rate swaps are typically documented in a confirmation and a master agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 1192. The master agreement is often a standard form agreement prepared by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (\u201cISDA\u201d). <em>Id. </em>In this case, Crofton and the Bank memorialized the swap in an ISDA master agreement accompanied by a separate confirmation and amortization schedule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>financing package, Crofton agreed to refinance its mortgage with a term loan with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus one percent and then to swap the variable rate with the Bank for a fixed rate of 5.5%. During the relevant time period, however, the variable interest rates were below 5.5%, and thus Crofton was required under the swap agreement to pay the difference to the Bank. If the LIBOR plus one percent rate had been above 5.5%, Crofton would have paid the variable rate loan amounts, and the Bank would have reimbursed Crofton for the difference, effectively bringing Crofton\u2019s interest payments back down to the 5.5% interest rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Under Crofton\u2019s accounting system, Crofton treated the swap payments as mortgage interest payments, which are reimbursable costs under COMAR 10.09.10.10.C. Crofton reports costs for which DHMH should reimburse providers (\u201callowed costs\u201d), to DHMH each fiscal year. DHMH reviews the reports and adjusts the costs by disallowing costs that are not reimbursable under the applicable laws and regulations. In 2002, DHMH hired Clifton Gunderson, LLP, to review Crofton\u2019s 2002 cost report and to recommend adjustments. Based on its review, Clifton Gunderson determined that Crofton\u2019s swap payments were not eligible for reimbursement. Accordingly, DHMH disallowed the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\n<em>The Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Crofton appealed the decision to the Board, which referred the appeal to the Office of Administrative Hearings for a contested evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ALJ issued his recommended findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>of fact and conclusions of law, finding that the interest payment should have been reimbursed on the grounds that the swap payments were part of an integrated mortgage transaction and mortgage interest payments are allowable costs. The ALJ\u2019s decision was based, in part, on the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">10. A separate agreement, the swap interest agreement, was entered into with a fiscal intermediary. The swap agreement required payments that would convert the floating rate term payments into a fixed 5.5% interest rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asd\">15. Mortgage interest paid by Medicaid providers is reimbursable by Medicaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">17. The above referenced notes are part of a total capital financing agreement that includes linked mortgage interest and swap interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">18. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), all of the above referenced interest payments to the bank are treated as mortgage interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">DHMH filed exceptions with the Board, which then held a hearing at which both parties presented oral arguments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The Board accepted the ALJ\u2019s findings except the above-mentioned four findings of fact.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Board determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeM\">Fact 10. The parties to the loan entered into a separate agreement called an interest swap rate agreement, (swap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>agreement or interest swap agreement) Under the interest swap agreement, the two parties exchanged monthly interest payments, i.e., Crofton exchanged its variable or floating mortgage interest rate of LIBOR plus 1 for a fixed interest rate of 5.5%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\">Fact 15. Mortgage interest paid by Medicaid providers is reimbursable by Medicaid, subject to certain ceilings and exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">Fact 17. M &amp; T Bank treats the 4.2 million dollar mortgage note and the second $500,000 mortgage note as one agreement requiring one monthly payment at the variable interest rate. It treats the swap interest agreement as a separate, independent agreement, requiring a separate payment. Fact 18. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the above referenced interest payments are treated as mortgage interest. However, under Medicaid reimbursement rules, GAAP is not controlling, state and federal regulations are.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">After making these findings, the Board concluded that the interest payments under the swap agreement were not reimbursable. The Board reasoned as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">First, the Board evaluated the nature of a swap agreement and determined that payments under it did not meet the definition of mortgage interest. In reaching that conclusion, the Board noted that Maryland\u2019s Medicaid program applies the federal Medicare definition of mortgage interest, which is \u201cthe cost incurred for the use of borrowed funds. Interest on current indebtedness is the cost incurred for funds borrowed!.]\u201d 42 C.F.R. 413.153(b)(1). Because Crofton\u2019s swap payments were interest paid on a notional amount, not on money borrowed under a mortgage agreement, the Board determined that the payments did not qualify as mortgage interest. Then, noting that COMAR does not expressly address swap payments, the Board, based on the COMAR provision that directs the Board to applicable federal law, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>COMAR 10.09.10.29, concluded that the federal Provider Reimbursement Manual (\u201cPRM\u201d) provision addressing swap interest applied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under PRM \u00a7 202.2, swap interest payments are prohibited and, therefore, the Board affirmed the disallowance of the swap payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Crofton filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The Circuit Court reversed the Board\u2019s decision, finding that the refinanced mortgage and the subsequent interest rate swap agreement were two parts of an integrated transaction that effectively converted the swap payments into mortgage interest payments. The court therefore found that the swap payments were costs for which Crofton was entitled to reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">DHMH appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. That court first addressed the applicable standard of review of administrative agency decisions and rejected DHMH\u2019s contention that the court should review an agency decision for \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d Instead, the court applied the standard articulated by this Court in <em>Adventist Health Care, Inc. v. Maryland Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>392 Md. 103, 896 A.2d 320 (2006), which directs appellate courts to defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a regulation unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 120, 896 A.2d at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Then, citing <em>Thrifty Oil Co., </em>310 F.3d 1188, a bankruptcy case that examined interest rate swap agreements, the court concluded that swap payments are not interest payments because swap payments do not compensate a lender for the loan of any underlying debt. Further, the court determined that the Board appropriately applied PRM \u00a7 202.2 because COMAR does not define mortgage interest and COMAR 10.09.10.29 provides that, in the absence of any contrary state regulation, the reimbursement regulations should be interpreted in conformity with applicable federal statutes and regulations. PRM \u00a7 202.2 expressly denies reimbursement of swap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>payments. Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, holding that even though the swap payments were made incident to the refinanced mortgage, such payments are not interest on a loan and thus, as a matter of law, are not mortgage interest payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">We granted certiorari, <em>Crofton Convalescent Center, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>405 Md. 62, 949 A.2d 651 (2008), to address the following questions, the order of which we have reversed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">1. Should interest paid by a nursing care facility pursuant to an integrated mortgage financing transaction securing commercial real property that includes a swap agreement be treated without regard to the integrated nature of the transaction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">2. Does <em>Thrifty Oil Co. v. Bank of Am. Nat\u2019l Trust &amp; Sav. Ass\u2019n, </em>310 F.3d 1188 (9th Cir.2002) establish Maryland law governing whether interest paid by a nursing care facility pursuant to a swap agreement that secures the facility\u2019s real property is mortgage interest under the Maryland Medicaid regulation making mortgage interest an allowable, reimbursed cost?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">To determine whether, regardless of a provider\u2019s intent to \u201cintegrate\u201d its swap and loan agreements, COMAR treats swap payments as mortgage payments for reimbursement purposes, we must examine the scope of the term \u201cmortgage interest\u201d as it appears in COMAR.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Crofton argues that the definition of mortgage interest is controlled by Maryland common law, which defines a mortgage as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">A loan is secured by a mortgage when: the property is conveyed or assigned by the mortgagor to the mortgagee, in form like that of an absolute legal conveyance, but subject to a proviso or condition by which the conveyance is to become void, or the estate is to be reconveyed, upon payment to the mortgagee of the principal sum secured, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>interest, on a day certain; and upon nonperformance of this condition, the mortgagee\u2019s conditional estate becomes absolute at law, and he may take possession thereof[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><em>Norwest Bank Minnesota v. Pence, </em>132 Md.App. 363, 369, 752 A.2d 681, 684 (2000) (quoting <em>Equitable Trust Co. v. Imbesi </em>287 Md. 249, 253-54, 412 A.2d 96 (1980)). Based on this definition, Crofton argues that whether the swap payments constitute mortgage interest payments under Maryland law hinges on whether the Bank could foreclose on Crofton\u2019s property if Crofton failed to fulfill its swap payment obligations. Consequently, Crofton contends that because the swap agreement was secured by Crofton\u2019s property, which was therefore subject to foreclosure upon Crofton\u2019s default, \u201cthe interest due under the Swap Agreement was mortgage interest[.]\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Crofton further argues that the Board improperly relied on the PRM\u2019s guidelines because the Board should only rely on federal statutes and regulations when COMAR is silent. Crofton asserts that COMAR is not silent as to mortgage interest reimbursement because COMAR 10.09.10.10C,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 10.09.10.10A,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 10.09.10.101<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> explicitly refer to mortgage interest and the reimbursement of interest costs associated with refinancing existing debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">DHMH counters that COMAR does not explicitly refer to swap payments or interest paid pursuant to a swap agreement. DHMH argues, moreover, that without evidence that the agency intended the term mortgage interest, as referenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>in the regulations, to include swap payments, COMAR cannot be construed to encompass swap payments. DHMH contends, instead, that mortgage interest should be interpreted according to the PRM as required by COMAR 10.09.10.29, which provides: \u201cExcept when the language of a specific regulation indicates an intent by the Department to provide reimbursement for covered services to Program recipients without regard to the availability of federal financial participation, State regulations shall be interpreted in conformity with applicable federal statutes and regulations.\u201d COMAR 10.09.10.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">An agency\u2019s interpretation of a regulation is a conclusion of law. <em>Adventist Health Care, </em>392 Md. at 121, 896 A.2d at 331; <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005).

The bonds were issued for a patient care related purpose and the interest is an allowable expense under Medicare. The hospital prefers a fixed rate and enters into a swap interest rate agreement with a bank. The amount of the note is $10 million. The agreement stipulates that the hospital will pay the bank a fixed rate of 12% and the bank will pay the hospital a variable rate of prime plus 2%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">For the first year, prime remains at 10% and there is no exchange of funds between the bank and the hospital. For the second year, the prime drops to 8%. The hospital pays the bank $200,000 in interest. This interest is NOT reimbursable under Medicare. For the third year, the prime rate increases to 12%. The bank pays the hospital $200,000. This is NOT considered investment income for Medicare reimbursement. The transaction has no impact on the allowability of the interest expense associated with the bonds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Although this example does not address mortgage interest specifically, the example is especially instructive because it addresses swap payments substituted for otherwise allowable interest payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Crofton distinguishes its swap payments by arguing that, unlike Hospital A\u2019s swap agreement, which was separate from the bonds, Crofton\u2019s swap agreement was an inseparable piece of an integrated financing package, and because the package refinances a mortgage secured by Crofton\u2019s property, the swap payments constituted mortgage interest payments. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Crofton further argues that the swap payments must be construed as mortgage interest payments because the \u201cBank and Crofton intended the Notes, Loan and Security Agreement, Swap Interest Agreement and Deed of Trust to function as a singular, non-severable transaction, not a separate, independent, stand alone agreement,\u201d and Maryland contract law requires courts to construe contracts in conformance with the parties\u2019 intent. Moreover, Crofton argues that Maryland public policy supports treating the swap agreement and the related loan as one integrated transaction because Crofton entered into the swap agreement in an effort to operate more efficiently and to lower Crofton\u2019s fixed costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Conversely, DHMH agrees with the Board\u2019s finding that the swap agreement was related to Crofton\u2019s loans only because the swap agreement enabled Crofton to \u201cexchange interest rates without modifying the terms of the mortgage loan agreement\u201d and \u201c[t]he fact that in 2002 Crofton paid interest under both the loan and the swap agreements does not make the interest paid under the swap agreement reimbursable[.]\u201d DHMH further agrees \"with the Board\u2019s determination that COMAR only allows reimbursement of interest expenses incurred to refinance existing debt or to obtain a new loan. Therefore, DHMH argues that the Board properly referred to the PRM to determine whether Crofton\u2019s swap payments were allowable costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We are not persuaded that Crofton\u2019s intent to integrate the swap and mortgage agreements overcomes the PRM\u2019s clear directive that swap payments, even when incurred in place of allowable interest expenses, are not reimbursable interest payments. Similar to Crofton, \u201cHospital A\u201d entered into its swap agreement to secure a fixed interest rate on bonds upon which, but for the swap agreement, the provider would have made allowable interest payments. Even though the hypothetical swap agreement supplants the bonds\u2019 variable interest rate, the PRM explains that the swap payments are not bond interest payments and thus are not reimbursable. The PRM\u2019s analysis focuses on neither Hospital A\u2019s intent nor the swap agreement\u2019s effect-replacing the variable bond interest rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>with a fixed rate. Consequently, to treat Crofton\u2019s intent and the timing of the transactions as determinative in this case would be inconsistent with the PRM, and we decline Crofton\u2019s invitation to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">In promulgating its rules governing reimbursement of expenses, DHMH has elected, in the absence of an express indication of its intent to reimburse a specific expense, to decide reimbursement questions by resort to the C.F.R. and the PRM. <em>See </em>COMAR 10.09.10.29. This DHMH is authorized to do. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15-103, 15-105 of the Health General Article; <em>Adventist Health Care, </em>392 Md. at 119, 896 A.2d at 330 (recognizing the authority of administrative agencies to \u201c \u2018promulgate legislative-type rules or regulations in order to implement [a] statute.

In my view this holding ignores the fundamental nature of the transaction between Crofton Convalescent Center, Inc. (\u201cCrofton\u201d) and First National Bank of Maryland (\u201cFirst National\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Examining the facts of the transaction reveals that the parties took a complicated route to reach a simple result. Crofton sought a fixed-rate loan from First National. After initial negotiations, First National offered Crofton a 6.55% fixed-rate loan, which was not accepted by Crofton. Subsequently, First National proposed a more complicated, two-step transaction. First, Crofton paid interest according to a variable rate. Second, First National and Crofton exchanged the difference between the variable rate and the 5.5% fixed rate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>which was the swap role. The variable interest payments existed only in form; in substance, they were subject to an immediate adjustment, via the swap payment, to the 5.5% level.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The majority, like the Board, dismantled the parties\u2019 Loan and Security Agreement, in order to reach its conclusion that the swap payments were a separate transaction from the mortgage loan, and therefore were not reimbursable because they were not \u201cmortgage interest.\u201d In doing so, it ignored the clear and undisputed intent of the lender and borrower.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The majority defers to the Board\u2019s reasoning that the swap arrangement is separate from the mortgage loan simply because First National requested that Crofton make two separate payments, one for the swap, and one for the variable-rate loan. This bookkeeping accommodation made by Crofton for the lender is an insufficient basis for the Board\u2019s ruling that the swap payments were not part of an integrated loan agreement made for the purpose of refinancing the existing mortgage loan when the parties\u2019 clear written agreements say otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The Master Agreement, which sets up the swap arrangement between the parties, explicitly states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties ... and the parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\u201cTransactions\u201d is defined in the Master Agreement as \u201cone or more transactions ... that are or will be governed by this Master Agreement, which includes the schedule ... and the documents and other confirming evidence ... exchanged between the parties confirming those Transactions.\u201d Correspondingly, the Loan and Security Agreement says: \u201cThe Borrowers and the Bank have entered into an ISDA Master Agreement dated the date hereof (which ... is herein called the \u2018Swap Agreement\u2019).\u201d The Term Note for the $4,200,000 indebtedness proves that it is issued \u201cpursuant to the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sions of\u2019 the Loan Agreement. The Term Note for the $500,000 contains the same provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Equally important is the undisputed fact that Crofton sought from the bank a fixed 5.5% loan, turned down the bank\u2019s offer for a 6% loan, and deferred to the bank\u2019s proposal that this more complicated deal would accomplish what Crofton sought in the first place\u2014a 5.5% loan for capital purposes. Yet the Board concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">The ALJ found that the swap agreement was an agreement linked to the above referenced notes, [i.e. for the $4.7 million dollar loan], to ensure that the interest rate was 5.5%. But that is exactly what a swap interest rate agreement is supposed to do. It allows one of the parties to swap the uncertainties of a floating or variable interest rate for the certainty of a fixed interest rate. Nor is the fact that the interest rate swap agreement includes a notional principal amount [footnote 2 omitted] that is the same as the amount of the loan unusual, controlling, or change the character of the agreement. Most, if not all, swap agreements refer to an amount that is the principal amount of a loan (i.e. the swap agreement\u2019s notional principal.) ... The stated amount of principal is \u201cnotional,\u201d because an interest swap agreement is a separate, independent, stand alone agreement [footnote 3 omitted] that does not modify or exchange the principal amount owed on the loan. In short, the interest swap agreement in question, like all interest rate swap agreements, did not produce a new loan or any additional principal for either of the parties to the agreement. The swap agreement simply allowed the parties to exchange interest rates without modifying the terms of the mortgage loan agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The Board\u2019s rationale is circular and mischaracterizes this loan transaction. The Board\u2019s thinking goes like this: most transactions using swap agreements involve no actual loans; therefore the Crofton-First National transaction was not a mortgage loan because it included an interest swap agreement. This logic falls apart upon close perusal: classification of the transaction as a mortgage loan does not depend on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>whether the amount of interest payable is at a set rate, or is determined by a formula. What COMAR says is that mortgage interest is reimbursable. So the Board should have considered whether the swap payments were mortgage interest, not whether most transactions involving swap payments involved actual loans. Instead, the Board made a sweeping generalization about swap agreements, and ignored the undisputed fact that the Loan Agreement, Notes, and Master Agreement constituted a refinance of an existing mortgage loan entered into by Crofton for operation of its facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Rather than looking at the transaction in question, as the Administrative Law Judge did, the Board relied on several internet definitions of swap agreements, which indicate that in the typical swap transaction the principal amount is never exchanged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The possibility or popularity of using swap payments as investments securities should play no role in the Board\u2019s consideration of whether the bank actually loaned money to Crofton pursuant to a loan agreement and whether the swap payments were an integral part of that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Contrary to Respondent\u2019s suggestion, there is no evidence that Crofton entered into the swap agreement to gamble on market rates. The Administrative Law Judge found as a fact that the \u201cswap agreement required payments that would convert the floating rate term payments into a fixed 5.5% interest rate.\u201d The parties\u2019 intent that Crofton pay 5.5% interest on the capital loan is undeniable.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">COMAR 10.09.10.10(C) lists five classes of capital expenses which are reimbursable: \u201c(1) Property taxes; (2) Property insurance; (3) Mortgage interest (including bond interest); (4) Net capital value rental; and (5) Central office capital costs.\u201d \"While the regulations provide detailed and complex reimburse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ment procedures and formulas, they do not provide further details regarding reimbursable capital expenses generally or mortgage interest in particular.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">As the majority acknowledges, \u201cwe may not abdicate our responsibility to examine independently the regulations upon which the Board relied in deciding Crofton\u2019s appeal[.]\u201d Majority Op., <em>supra, </em>at 216, 991 A.2d at 1265-66. In my view, the majority does exactly this when it accepts the Board\u2019s reliance on the Federal Provider Reimbursement Manual (\u201cPRM\u201d) Section 202.2A to justify its conclusion, because the limitations set forth in that subsection clearly do not apply to an integrated loan agreement like this one. PRM Section 202, titled \u201cDEFINITIONS,\u201d provides the details to flesh out the requirement, set forth in PRM Section 200, that a cost will be reimbursable for \u201c[njecessary and proper interest on both current and capital indebtedness[.]\u201d It includes a subsection (Section 202.2) on what is considered \u201cnecessary\u201d interest, which says that the interest must be \u201c[ijncurred on a loan that is made to satisfy a financial need\u201d of the provider. Subsection A of Section 202.2 addresses what is meant by \u201cfinancial need,\u201d and it starts out as follows: \u201cWhen borrowed funds create excess working capital, interest expense on such borrowed funds is not an allowable cost.\u201d It is in this context that the PRM sets forth the example relied on by the Board for the proposition that swap interest payments are never reimbursable. The example involves a hospital that has issued ten million dollars in bonds, on which it pays interest to bondholders at a variable rate. Not liking the variable rate it must pay to the bondholders, the hospital hedges its risk by entering into a separate agreement with a bank, using the notional amount of ten million dollars principal, and stipulating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>that \u201cthe hospital will pay the bank a fixed rate of 12% and the bank will pay the hospital a variable rate of prime plus 2%[.]\u201d Under the PRM, this transaction constitutes use of excess working capital, and is therefore not reimbursable.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">This example is not applicable to Crofton\u2019s loan. Unlike Crofton\u2019s loan, the swap interest rate agreement in the example does not \u201csatisfy a financial need of the provider\u201d because the hospital already had the capital it needed, which it obtained when it issued the bonds. The swap interest rate agreement was with a <em>third party, </em>and thus was separate and apart from the borrowing represented by the bonds. The third party bank never lent any money to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Accordingly, I submit that it was wrong, as a matter of law, for the Board, tasked with applying the clear language of COMAR 10.09.10.10, which requires reimbursement to a nursing home for mortgage interest on capital loans, to rest its decision on the federal PRM addressing dissimilar financial arrangements utilized by a hospital that had issued bonds. The deference we give to agency determinations of law has limits. As the majority recognizes, \u201c \u2018it is always within our prerogative to determine whether an agency\u2019s conclusions of law are correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adventist Health Care, Inc. v. Md.

In my view, the majority errs in declining to exercise its prerogative to overrule the Board\u2019s misreading of the unambiguous term \u201cmortgage interest!,]\u201d contained in COMAR 10.09.10.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Judge HARRELL has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>InvestorWords.com-Investing Glossary, http://www. investorwords.com, (last visited March 12, 2010); Investopedia.com, http://www.investopedia.com (describing swap agreements as: \"Traditionally, the exchange of one security for another to change the maturity (bonds), quality of issues (stocks or bonds), or because investment objectives have changed.
