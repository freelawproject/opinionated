We shall hold that the record provided substantial evidence in support of the ALJ\u2019s decision that Dove refused an alcohol concentration test, and that the ALJ properly suspended Dove\u2019s license pursuant to Md.Code (1977, 2009 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 16-205.1(b) of the Transportation Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">At approximately 5:50 p.m., on March 3, 2008, Dove was involved in a motor vehicle collision. Dove was traveling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>southbound on Route 4 in Calvert County on a <em>motorcycle </em>when he hit the rear of another vehicle that was slowing for a traffic light.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Officer Traas from the Calvert County Sheriffs Office responded to the scene, where he found Dove lying in the median receiving medical treatment. Officer Traas noticed Dove\u2019s red, watery eyes and a \u201cstrong odor\u201d of alcohol emanating from his person. Upon questioning, Dove acknowledged that he had consumed one beer earlier in the day. Dove was subsequently transported to Calvert Memorial Hospital for medical treatment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">At Calvert Memorial Hospital, Officer Traas read to Dove his rights granted by statute, as contained in the DR-15 Advice of Rights form (\u201cDR-15\u201d), and asked him to submit to a blood test to determine alcohol concentration based on the officer\u2019s suspicion that Dove was driving under the influence of alcohol. Dove indicated that he was not willing to submit to a blood test because he does not \u201cdo needles.\u201d He volunteered to take a breath test, which Officer Traas declined to administer. Dove also offered to refuse medical treatment and proceed to the police station, which Officer Traas rejected. Officer Traas asked Dove to sign the DR-15 form to acknowledge that he was advised of the consequences of refusal, which Dove signed. Dove asserted in his testimony that he was strapped to a backboard when he signed the form. Officer Traas confiscated Dove\u2019s driver\u2019s license and issued him a temporary license. After Officer Traas left the emergency room, hospital personnel administered a preliminary breath test (\u201cPBT\u201d) to determine alcohol concentration as part of Dove\u2019s medical care, the result of which was 0.00. The medical staff provided routine medical care for Dove\u2019s injuries, including administering an intravenous morphine drip.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Dove requested a hearing on the pending 120-day mandatory license suspension for refusal to take an alcohol concentration test. After conducting an administrative hearing, the ALJ found that Officer Traas had reasonable grounds to believe that Dove was driving his vehicle while under the influence or impaired by the consumption of alcohol, based on the odor of alcohol on Dove\u2019s breath, his watery and red eyes, his dilated pupils, and his acknowledgment that he consumed one beer earlier in the day. The ALJ made the following factual findings: Officer Traas requested that Dove submit to an alcohol concentration test, which Dove refused. Officer Traas then fully advised Dove of the administrative sanctions to be imposed should he refuse an alcohol concentration test. Dove initially refused medical treatment at the scene, but was subsequently transported to a hospital. At the hospital, Dove refused to take a blood test to determine alcohol concentration after having been advised of his rights and of the consequences of refusal. Dove offered to take a breath test instead of a blood test, stating that he is afraid of needles, but refused the test as offered by Officer Traas. The ALJ determined that when an individual is not available to take a breath test at the police station, Maryland law requires that a blood test be offered. In this case, Officer Traas offered a blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">While Dove was at the hospital, staff administered a PBT. The breath test administered as part of hospital protocol was not an alcohol concentration test pursuant to \u00a7 16\u2014205.1(a)(2) of the Transportation Article, which mandates that \u201c[a]ny person who drives ... on a highway ... in this State is deemed to have consented ... to take a test\u201d for alcohol concentration. Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Dove refused an alcohol concentration test in violation of \u00a7 16-205.1(b) of the Transportation Article, which penalizes refusal of the test described in \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2) of the Transportation Article, and suspended Dove\u2019s driving privilege for 120 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">On judicial review, the Circuit Court for Calvert County reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision and held that it is improper to request a blood test rather than a breath test when a suspect states a preference for a breath test due to a fear of needles. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Also, the court opined that a blood test was not required pursuant to Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-305(a)(l)(ii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article because it was \u201cdebatable\u201d whether Dove\u2019s injures \u201crequired\u201d removal to a hospital, given that Dove was conscious, aware, and refusing medical treatment at the scene. Because this Court noted the Legislature\u2019s preference for breath tests rather than blood tests in <em>Hyle v. MVA, </em>348 Md. 143, 156, 702 A.2d 760, 764 (1997), the Circuit Court strictly construed the exceptions warranting a blood test enumerated in \u00a7 10-305(a)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The Circuit Court also held that Dove did not make a knowing and voluntary refusal of the alcohol concentration test because he believed that signing an acknowledgment of refusal was a prerequisite to receiving medical treatment. Finally, the Circuit Court held that the ALJ erred in refusing to accept evidence of the preliminary breath test administered by the hospital staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">This Court granted the State\u2019s petition for certiorari, pursuant to Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-305(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to determine 1) whether an officer may rely on the judgment of medical personnel regarding a driver\u2019s removal to a hospital when evaluating whether a blood test for alcohol concentration is required pursuant to \u00a7 10-305(a)(l)(ii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article; and 2) whether a driver\u2019s offer to consent to a method of alcohol concentration testing other than the method required by \u00a7 10-305(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, or the driver\u2019s consent to an alternative method of alcohol concentration testing for purposes of medical treatment, constitutes a refusal of an alcohol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>concentration test as required by \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2) of the Transportation Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Pursuant to the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Md.Code (1984, 2009 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 10-201 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article, \u201cMaryland courts play a limited role when reviewing adjudicatory decisions of administrative agencies.\u201d <em>MVA v.

Rather, in the MVA\u2019s view, the test must be administered in the method proscribed by \u00a7 10-305 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. In this case, Deputy Traas arrived on the scene after medical personnel determined that Dove\u2019s injuries required removal to a hospital for treatment. According to the MVA, when he detected evidence of alcohol, Deputy Traas properly requested a blood test to determine blood alcohol concentration under \u00a7 10-305(a)(l)(ii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The MVA argues that the Circuit Court erroneously concluded that \u00a7 10-305(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article did not apply in hindsight, infringing on the ALJ\u2019s role in determining whether the facts of the case met the requirements of the statute. The MVA further contends that the ALJ correctly ignored the PBT performed by hospital personnel because the test was performed for purposes of providing medical treatment and does not constitute a withdrawal of refusal under \u00a7 16-205.1(g) of the Transportation Article. The MVA points out that the PBT performed by the hospital did not meet the requirements outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article because the sampling equipment was not approved by the State Toxicologist and the test was performed outside of the required two hour time limit. Thus, according to the MVA, Dove refused the alcohol concentration test required by \u00a7 16\u2014205.1(a)(2) of the Transportation Article and \u00a7 10\u2014305(a)(l)(ii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, and substantial evidence in the record supported the sanction imposed by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Dove counters, arguing that he did not refuse an alcohol concentration test because he indicated to Officer Traas that he was willing to consent to a breath test. In Dove\u2019s opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>his circumstances did not warrant a blood test under \u00a7 10-305(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article because his injuries did not \u201crequire\u201d removal to the hospital. Dove defines \u201crequired\u201d medical treatment as \u201c[n]ot, simply, was the motorist injured such that medical treatment was appropriate, advisable or standard,\u201d but rather \u201cthat the injuries mandate removal to a hospital\u201d because the injuries require immediate urgent medical care. In this case, according to Dove, medical personnel should have given him a Refusal of Care form, released him to law enforcement, and allowed Officer Traas to take him to the Sheriffs station or the Maryland State Police Barracks for a breath test. Dove also argues that his alleged fear of needles warranted his refusal, relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966). Even if a blood test was required, Dove argues that he did not knowingly and voluntarily refuse the blood test because he was under duress and subjectively believed that he would not be released from the backboard until he signed the DR-15 form. Finally, Dove argues that even if he refused the alcohol concentration test, the PBT administered by Calvert Memorial Hospital negated his refusal, even though \u201cthe Calvert Memorial Hospital breathalyzer test for alcohol concentration was probably not performed by a person qualified nor performed on approved equipment.\u201d Further, Dove asserts that the PBT result, showing a reading of 0.00, should have been admitted for the purpose of \u201cdetermining if probable cause did exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In the present case, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Dove\u2019s circumstances warranted a blood test for alcohol concentration pursuant to \u00a7 10-305(a)(l)(ii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article because Dove\u2019s injuries required his removal to a medical facility. Medical personnel who responded to the scene of the collision determined that Dove\u2019s injuries, including a displaced wrist fracture and a possible head injury, required his removal to Calvert Memorial Hospital. The independent judgment of trained medical professionals about the need for medical care, made at the time of the motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>vehicle collision with the available information, is substantial evidence to support a finding that removal for medical care was required. We decline the invitation to review the medical judgments of trained medical personnel \u201cin hindsight.\u201d Even if we were to take into account that Dove ultimately had not sustained a head injury, the emergency room physician noted on Dove\u2019s medical chart that he or she, upon discharging Dove, \u201c[ejmphasized [the] <em>necessity </em>of [followup care], [because of the] possible loss of hand [function] or perm[anent] deformity if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Clearly, an injury that, if left untreated, could lead to a permanent loss of function or deformity is of the type that requires urgent medical care. Further, Dove acknowledged in his testimony that, after the collision, he had a \u201cknot ... on [his] head [sustained] when [his] head hit the street at 60 miles per hour.\u201d If trained medical personnel determine that the contact of one\u2019s head with the pavement at 60 miles per hour warrants immediate transport to a hospital, this determination appears reasonable, considering the need to evaluate and treat the patient\u2019s medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Because Dove\u2019s injuries required removal to Calvert Memorial Hospital, Officer Traas properly offered a blood test to determine alcohol concentration pursuant to \u00a7 10-305(a)(l)(ii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which states that \u201cthe type of test administered to the defendant to determine alcohol concentration <em>shall </em>be ... [a] test of blood if ... [ijnjuries to the defendant require removal of the defendant to a medical facility.\u201d (Emphasis added). \u201c[T]he use of the word \u2018shall\u2019 in this statute imposes a mandatory duty upon police officers. As we have stated repeatedly: \u2018Under settled principles of statutory construction, the word \u2018shall\u2019 is ordinarily presumed to have a mandatory meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Werkheiser, </em>299 Md. 529, 533, 474 A.2d 898, 900 (1984) (internal citations omitted) (interpreting whether \u00a7 10-305 required that an officer direct medical personnel to draw blood while a driver was unconscious and unable to refuse consent). Thus, because the Legislature established the circumstances under which the officer \u201cshall\u201d offer a blood test pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>\u00a7 10-305(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, neither the officer nor the driver has the discretion to choose whether the alcohol concentration test may be a breath test or a blood test. Rather, the Legislature exercised its discretion and determined that a blood test would be the appropriate test.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">As we discussed in <em>Hyle, </em>348 Md. at 151-52, 702 A.2d at 764, the legislative history of \u00a7 10-305 supports our interpretation. We stated in <em>Hyle:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">Prior to a 1983 amendment, \u00a7 10-305 permitted the defendant to choose whether to take a blood test or a breath test. Chapter 289 of the Acts of 1983. Concern arose regarding the increasing number of defendants choosing blood tests over breath tests because of: (1) the difficulty of accomplishing the blood test in certain situations; (2) the delay in processing caused by administering blood tests instead of breath tests; and (3) the problems caused by the necessity to have medical personnel attend hearings where a blood test was used---- When 10-305 was being amended, it originally called for the police officer to select the type of test. Ch. 238 of the Acts of 1983.... This version, however, did not pass. In fact, \u201c[t]he bill failed 28-17 after a number of senators complained that it would give too much discretion to law enforcement officers and harm motorists\u2019 rights.\u201d The version that ultimately passed eliminated officer discretion with respect to the type of test to be administered, and instead <em>statutorily determined which type of test would be administered.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-8\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting Tom Linthicum, <em>Bill to tighten intoxication tests given new life, </em>Baltimore Sun, March 16, 1983, at F14) (emphasis added). Dove notes correctly that the Legislature stated a general preference for breath tests in \u00a7 10-305(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, absent the special circumstances stated in \u00a7 10-305(a)(l). The Legislature\u2019s general preference for breath tests, however, does not override the plain language of the statute, mandating a blood test when the driver\u2019s injuries require removal to a hospital. Clearly, the Legislature expressed a specific preference for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>blood tests where the driver was unconscious, unable to refuse the test, or removed to a medical facility because of injury, or where the equipment for administering a breath test is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The record also contains substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Dove knowingly and voluntarily refused the alcohol concentration test as offered by Officer Traas. The strongest evidence supporting a knowing, voluntary refusal is Dove\u2019s own testimony. In his testimony, Dove acknowledges that Officer Traas asked him to take a blood test, that he refused, and that Officer Traas advised him of his rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">Administrative Law Judge Zell (\u201cALJ\u201d): All right. Well the officer\u2019s report indicates that he read you the advice of rights. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">Defendant Dove (\u201cDove\u201d): The advice of rights, meaning ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">ALJ: Your rights ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">Dove: ... what\u2019s on that paper that states I\u2019m refusing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaf\">ALJ: Well that would be the [DR-15] advice of rights form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av\">Dove: Yeah, he did read it to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">ALJ: He explained to you what the sanctions were for refusing an alcohol test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-11\">Dove: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-12\">ALJ: Okay. He requested you take the test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-13\">Dove: He requested that he stick me with a needle, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APP\">ALJ: So he requested that you [take] the test. Did you agree to the test at the hospital which would have been a blood test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-14\">Dove: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-15\">Dove acknowledged that Officer Traas read to him from the DR-15 Advice of Rights form, providing substantial evidence that Officer Traas advised him of the administrative penalties of refusing an alcohol concentration test, as required by \u00a7 16-205.1(b) of the Transportation Article. Dove also acknowledged that he refused a blood test to determine alcohol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>concentration, offered by Officer Traas as required by \u00a7 10-305(a)(l)(ii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Dove\u2019s offer to submit to a breath test fails to mitigate his refusal to take a blood test as required by \u00a7 10-305(a)(l)(ii) because, as discussed <em>swpra, </em>the only alcohol concentration testing option available to him under \u00a7 10-305(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article was a blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Dove\u2019s assertion that his refusal was not voluntary because he felt compelled to sign the DR-15 form is not persuasive. As discussed <em>supra, </em>a refusal to submit to an alcohol concentration test is complete when it is communicated to the officer, regardless of whether the driver signed the DR-15 form. In the present case, Dove\u2019s refusal to submit to the alcohol concentration test was complete the moment he communicated it to Officer Traas. Even if Dove were persuaded to sign the DR-15 form because he was on the backboard, Dove clearly testified that the fact that he was strapped to the backboard had no effect on his decision to refuse the blood test for alcohol concentration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">Dove: I get to the hospital. He [Officer Traas] comes in, he says, \u201cMr. Dove, I need to do an alcohol test on you.\u201d I said not a problem. Get the breathalyzer; I\u2019ll be more than happy to take one. \u201cNo, Sir. We\u2019re going to do it by needle.\u201d <em>I said, \u201cNo. We\u2019re not doing it by needle because I don\u2019t do needles.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">(Emphasis added). Dove testified that he offered to submit to various other tests, including a horizontal nystagmus test (\u201cthe eye tests\u201d) or a breath test. At no point, however, did he agree to a blood test. Even if the signed DR-15 were excluded from the record, Dove\u2019s own testimony provides substantial evidence that Dove made a knowing and voluntary refusal to submit to a blood test to measure alcohol concentration.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Additionally, Officer Traas did not restrain Dove or strap him to the backboard. Dove was placed on the backboard as part of his medical care. Dove testified that he was \u201c[taken] to the hospital strapped to the backboard\u201d by the paramedics. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The emergency room records reflect that when upon his admission to Calvert Memorial Hospital, Dove\u2019s room assignment was the \u201challway outside Room 2.\u201d Thus, we surmise that Dove\u2019s location in the hallway on the backboard was the result of the decisions of his medical providers, not the will of Officer Traas. Further, pursuant to \u00a7 10\u2014303(a)(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Officer Traas had a duty to approach Dove and request that he submit to the required alcohol concentration test within two hours of Dove\u2019s apprehension. Under the circumstances, the ALJ had substantial evidence to reasonably conclude that Dove was not improperly coerced by the constraints imposed by his medical providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Dove\u2019s fear of needles does not excuse his knowing, voluntary refusal of the alcohol concentration test offered to him. Dove\u2019s reliance on <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908, is unconvincing. In <em>Schmerber, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States considered the admissibility of a blood sample that was taken despite the defendant\u2019s refusal, on the advice of counsel, to consent to the test. <em>Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 759, 86 S.Ct. at 1829, 16 L.Ed.2d at 913. The Court held that the blood sample, taken despite the defendant\u2019s express refusal, was not taken in violation of the defendant\u2019s Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches. 384 U.S. at 772, 86 S.Ct. at 1836, 16 L.Ed.2d at 920. The Court noted in dicta that the fear of needles might be a legitimate reason for refusing an involuntary blood test that \u201cwould have to be respected.\u201d 384 U.S. at 771, 86 S.Ct. at 1836, 16 L.Ed.2d at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\"><em>Schmerber </em>is distinguishable from the present case because in <em>Schmerber, </em>the blood sample used to measure alcohol concentration was taken over the suspect\u2019s express objection. The Court speculated that a blood sample taken by force over an express objection might be an unreasonable intrusion into the suspect\u2019s person if the suspect were afraid of needles. Unlike in <em>Schmerber, </em>in the present case, Dove had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>express statutory right to refuse the blood test, as enumerated in \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l) of the Transportation Article. The blood test was not performed over Dove\u2019s objection. Rather, Officer Traas presented Dove with a choice: submit to the blood test as required by \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2) of the Transportation Article and \u00a7 10-305(a)(l)(ii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, or face the administrative penalty mandated by \u00a7 16-205.1(b) of the Transportation Article. Dove was informed of the consequences of refusal and free to decide whether his fear of needles outweighed his desire to maintain his driving privilege in the state of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In the present case, the ALJ had before him for consideration Dove\u2019s testimony that he was afraid of needles, and Dove\u2019s medical records relating to his treatment at Calvert Memorial Hospital. Dove\u2019s medical records revealed that he was administered pain medication by a intravenous morphine drip. The admission of Dove\u2019s medical records into evidence was substantial evidence from which the ALJ could have reasonably inferred that Dove\u2019s fear of needles was relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Finally, the ALJ correctly determined that the breath test administered by Calvert Memorial Hospital staff did not nullify Dove\u2019s refusal of the alcohol concentration test. Section 16-205.1(g) of the Transportation Article permits withdrawal of a driver\u2019s refusal to take a blood alcohol concentration test if the withdrawal is unequivocal and made in a timely fashion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case, Dove\u2019s expression of consent to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>alcohol concentration breath test administered by hospital staff for purposes of medical treatment was not an unequivocal withdrawal of the refusal communicated to Officer Traas. Dove consented to a PBT by hospital staff, not a blood test as requested by Officer Traas pursuant to \u00a7 10-305(a)(l)(ii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. As discussed <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 10-305(a)(l)(ii) mandated a blood test in this case, not a breath test. Dove\u2019s consent to an alternative method of testing fails to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 16\u2014205.1(a)(2) of the Transportation Article and \u00a7 10\u2014305(a)(l)(ii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article because the statute does not grant the driver discretion to choose the method of testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Additionally, the PBT performed by staff at Calvert Memorial Hospital did not meet the procedural requirements of \u00a7 10-304 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Pursuant to \u00a7 10\u2014304(b)(1) of the Courts and Judicial Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ceedings Article, even if a breath test were appropriate in this case, the person administering the test must be \u201ca qualified person [using] equipment approved by the toxicologist under the Postmortem Examiners Commission.\u201d <em>Id., see also Vermeersch, </em>331 Md. at 192, 626 A.2d at 974. Dove admitted in his brief that neither the person conducting the test nor the equipment used to administer the test met the requirements of \u00a7 10-304(b)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Further, pursuant to \u00a7 10-304(b)(l), the breath test must also be performed \u201cat the request of a police officer,\u201d not by the hospital staff for purposes of medical treatment. Section 16-205.1(a)(2) of the Transportation Article states that the driver consents to an alcohol concentration test \u201csubject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309 of the Judicial Proceedings Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">As this Court noted in <em>Vermeersch, </em>331 Md. at 193, 626 A.2d at 975, a driver may not refuse the alcohol concentration test requested by the officer, then obtain an independent test that fails to meet the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 10-304 and 10-305 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and argue that his refusal is vitiated by \u201csubstantial compliance.\u201d In this case, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the hospital performed a test within two hours of Dove\u2019s apprehension, the breath test performed by Calvert Memorial Hospital did not comply with the statutory requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 10-304 and 10-305. The test was performed for the purpose of providing medical care and not at the request of Officer Traas, the test was not performed using equipment approved by the Postmortem Examiner\u2019s Commission, and the test was not a blood test. Accordingly, Dove did not withdraw his refusal to consent to an alcohol concentration test pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article when he consented to a breath test at Calvert Memorial.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The fact that the preliminary breath test performed at Calvert Memorial Hospital showed a reading of 0.00 is irrelevant to the analysis of whether Dove refused the required blood test. The purpose of the sanction for refusal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>not to punish driving under the influence directly, but rather \u201cto provide an incentive for drivers detained under suspicion of drunk driving to take, rather than refuse, a test for alcohol concentration.\u201d <em>Vermeersch, </em>331 Md. at 194, 626 A.2d at 975; <em>see also Shepard, </em>399 Md. at 255, 923 A.2d at 108 (\u201cThe purpose of the statute was to reduce the incidence of drunk driving and to protect public safety by encouraging drivers to take alcohol concentration tests.\u201d); <em>Forman, </em>332 Md. at 206, 630 A.2d at 756 (holding that the statute is a \u201cstrict penalty ... designed to encourage licensees to take, rather than to refuse, such alcohol tests\u201d). Dove argues that the preliminary breath test result, 0.00, should have been applied to a \u201cprobable cause\u201d analysis. Dove, however, ignores the fact that a probable cause analysis has no place in this case. Section 16-205.1(a)(2) of the Transportation Article does not require probable cause when an officer requests an alcohol concentration test, but rather permits a test \u201cif the person should be detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d Suspicion based on reasonable grounds is a lower standard than a preponderance of the evidence or probable cause. <em>Shepard, </em>399 Md. at 254, 923 A.2d at 107. In this case, the record provided the ALJ with substantial evidence that Officer Traas had reasonable suspicion that Dove was driving his vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, based on the odor of alcohol detected on Dove\u2019s person at the scene, his watery eyes, and his involvement in a motor vehicle collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CALVERT COUNTY IS REVERSED.

Dove testified that he \"refused medical treatment on the scene and they did not want to let [him] go.
