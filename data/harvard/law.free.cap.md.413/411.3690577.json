For reasons we shall explain, we answer that question in the affirmative. As such, we shall hold that the Circuit Court for Cecil County did not exceed its authority when it appointed John K. Northrop (\u201cNorthrop\u201d), the Deputy District Public Defender for Cecil County, or a member of his office or a panel attorney, to represent Jason Flynn Stinnett (\u201cStinnett\u201d), a criminal defendant whom the Circuit Court found qualified as indigent under the Maryland Code, but to whom representation had been denied previously and wrongfully by the local OPD. Despite our holding, we shall reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment of contempt against Northrop, issued in response to his refusal (on orders from his superiors) to appear in court on Stinnett\u2019s behalf in accordance with the order of appointment, because the Circuit Court failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of the Maryland Rules governing contempt judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Jason Flynn Stinnett was indicted by a grand jury in Cecil County on multiple burglary charges and other related offenses. Stinnett applied timely for public legal representation from the local OPD. On 19 March 2008, the local OPD determined that Stinnett failed to meet the requirements for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>its services because his income<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> exceeded 110% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the limit to qualify for representation by the OPD according to COMAR 14.06.03.05A<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and D(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Thus, the local OPD informed Stinnett, by letter dated 19 March 2008, that, because his income exceeded the maximum net income level, he did not qualify for representation by that agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">On 7 April 2008, Stinnett appeared, unrepresented by counsel, at a status hearing before the Circuit Court and requested that an attorney be appointed for him because he could not afford to retain private counsel and the local OPD had denied representation. Upon Stinnett\u2019s request, the trial judge proceeded (at some length) to describe his perception of the relative roles of the local OPD and the court in providing counsel for indigent defendants, and the authority of the court to appoint counsel on an indigent defendant\u2019s behalf where the local OPD denies representation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">Our Chief Administrative Judge here ... has indicated that he has researched this matter and has determined that case law does not seem to indicate that we cannot appoint the Public Defender\u2019s ourselves and has ask (sic) us, other judges, from now on that if we do find indigency to actually appoint the Public Defender. He said he\u2019s reviewed the cases and there is some dicta about their being Executive Agency, but he does not believe that\u2019s controlling because the issues before the Appellate Court, at that time, were not those that dealt with the authority of the Court to appoint the Public Defender\u2019s Office to represent somebody. I just checked with ... the Acting Administrative Judge, and he says exactly the same thing. That, if we do find a defendant indigent, we are to appoint the Public Defender\u2019s Office itself to represent the defendant. And the Court has done a lot of investigation on this, previously, personally talked with Judge Bell, this Court had ordered ... or requested the Court Clerks to research this issue about 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>years ago and we had researched 42 other states, we hadn\u2019t quite got all 50, and every single one, the Court always has the authority, at least as a last resort to appoint the Public Defender. In speaking with Judge Bell, Judge Bell told me, personally, on the telephone that he had- researched all 50 states and all 50 ... Maryland would be the only one that, it didn\u2019t seem to him, that we had a direct authority to appoint the Public Defender. But, he didn\u2019t say that prohibited it, either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">Anyway, I\u2019m following the Administrative Judges (sic) and the Acting Administrative Judges (sic) decisions that we are to appoint the Public Defender if we do find indigency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\"># * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">The next thing, under Article 27A, Section 7,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>1 it\u2019s the Public Defender article. It talks about the duty of the Public Defender\u2019s Office. Um ... to provide representation and it follows the case, I believe, of <em>State v. Baldwin,[</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>if I\u2019m remembering this correctly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">Anyway, as a result of the case, the case spelled out what the Public Defender\u2019s Office has to do in determining whether a defendant qualifies for the Public Defender\u2019s services. It also states, basically, that the Court has to do the same thing when it makes it\u2019s (sic) own determination. Although, it does make a separate, independent determination. And the Court certainly will do that. But what happened after Article 27A, Section 1 et sec. (sic) was passed, evidently the Public Defender\u2019s Office then went and got a regulation passed which was actually contrary to the ... Art. 27A, Sec. 1 and thereafter. In that it used a formula which is not at all what <em>Baldwin v. State </em>says or <em>State v. Baldwin. </em>You have to figure each case separately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>and then there is supposedly the District Public Defender then can review some ... a determination made by the local Public Defender\u2019s Office, but that certainly is not presented to any defendant and the determination factor is 110% of the Federal Poverty guidelines for Circuit Court cases. There\u2019s absolutely nothing in the underlying case which provided for those factors to be used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Following this explication, the court proceeded to conduct an indigency hearing, examining the factors to be considered in determining indigency contained in Maryland Code, Article 27A, \u00a7 7;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> COMAR 14.06.03.05A; and <em>Baldwin;</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rather than applying the maximum income level rule contained in COMAR 14.06.03.05A and D(2), the standard used by the local OPD with regard to Stinnett\u2019s application. In doing so, the Circuit Court maintained that, under <em>Baldwin, </em>any determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>indigency, whether conducted by the local OPD or a trial court, must take into account the statutory indigency factors contained in Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, and COMAR 14.06.03.05A, and that the local OPD acted contrary to the mandates of <em>Baldwin </em>when it considered solely whether Stinnett\u2019s net annual income exceeded 110% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Turning to examine the specifics of Stinnett\u2019s financial situation, in response to the court\u2019s questioning, Stinnett testified that: (1) he was employed with Mid-Atlantic Electrical Contractors, a job which paid him $19 per hour (resulting in a net take-home income of approximately $2123 per month), without any opportunity for overtime; (2) he had approximately $400 in a bank account and no other assets that could be liquidated to pay for an attorney; (3) at the time of the hearing, he resided in a halfway house, paying $650 per month in boarding costs and $65 per month for food; (4) he had been ordered by the Circuit Court for Harford County to pay $331 per month in restitution arising from a prior robbery conviction; (5) he paid the entirety of his daughter\u2019s private school tuition, at a cost of $440 per month; (6) he spent approximately $108 per month to purchase lunch; and, (7) he paid $520 per month for transportation operating costs to and from work in a vehicle loaned to him by his father. In addition, based on standard child support calculations, the Circuit Court determined that Stinnett\u2019s expenses relating to the shared custody of his daughter amounted to $420 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Totaling Stinnett\u2019s income and expenses, each aspect of which it found to be \u201cfair and reasonable,\u201d the Circuit Court determined that Stinnett had, in fact, no net income; Stinnett\u2019s net income of $2123 per month fell well below the $2534 in expenses he incurred each month. In addition, the Circuit Court found that the reasonable cost for a private attorney to represent Stinnett would be between $3000 and $5000. On this basis, the judge determined that, despite the local OPD\u2019s conclusion to the contrary, Stinnett, in fact, was indigent under the factors enumerated in Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, and COMAR 14.06.03.05A, as explicated in <em>Baldwin, </em>and was entitled to the appointment of an attorney at the State\u2019s expense. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ingly, the Circuit Court issued an order<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> naming Northrop, the Deputy District Public Defender for Cecil County, or another qualified attorney from the local OPD or its list of panel attorneys, to represent Stinnett.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Northrop filed a notice of appeal from the order appointing him counsel for Stinnett, but did not seek to stay its effect pending the outcome of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">At a later hearing in Stinnett\u2019s case, held on 8 August 2008, Northrop did not appear. As a result, the trial judge found him in direct contempt of court and fined him $10.00. Subsequent to the contempt finding against Northrop, Stinnett entered a guilty plea, which the Circuit Court accepted, and was sentenced to a three-year term of imprisonment, suspended, and two years unsupervised probation. Stinnett did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>appeal the judgment entered against him. On the other hand, Northrop noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from the 8 August 2008 order finding him in direct contempt. He also filed with this Court a petition for writ of certiorari, in which he raised two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">(1) Did the trial court err in ordering Public Defender staff attorney/s to represent a criminal defendant in a criminal case after the Public Defender declined to provide representation in the case; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">(2) Did the trial court err in finding Mr. Northrop in contempt?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">We granted Northrop\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, 407 Md. 275, 964 A.2d 675 (2009), prior to further proceedings in the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\n<em>MOOTNESS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">As a threshold matter, the State contends that the present case is moot, noting that Stinnett was convicted and sentenced, but did not appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Ordinarily, in order for a case to be heard and an appellate court to provide a remedy, there must be an existing controversy. <em>Suter v. Stuckey, </em>402 Md. 211, 219, 935 A.2d 731, 736 (2007); <em>Dep\u2019t of Human Res., Child Care Admin. v. Roth, </em>398 Md. 137, 143, 919 A.2d 1217, 1221 (2007); <em>Attorney Gen. v. Anne Arundel County School Bus Contractors Ass\u2019n, </em>286 Md. 324, 327, 407 A.2d 749, 752 (1979). If no existing controversy is present, the case is moot and an appellate court ordinarily will not consider the case on its merits. <em>Suter, </em>402 Md. at 219-20, 935 A.2d at 736; <em>Roth, </em>398 Md. at 143, 919 A.2d at 1221; <em>State v. Peterson, </em>315 Md. 73, 82, 553 A.2d 672, 677 (1989); <em>Mercy Hosp. v. Jackson, </em>306 Md. 556, 562, 510 A.2d 562, 565 (1986); <em>State v. Ficker, </em>266 Md. 500, 506-07, 295 A.2d 231, 235 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Although it is true, as the State contends, that the criminal proceedings against Stinnett (which, in turn, led to the contempt finding against Northrop) have concluded with a final judgment from which no appeal has been taken, the issue at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the center of the present appeal does not concern the merits of Stinnett\u2019s case, <em>i.e., </em>the adequacy of his guilty plea or the propriety of the sentence he received. Rather, this case presents the question of whether a circuit court possesses the authority to appoint an attorney from the local OPD to represent an indigent criminal defendant, where the circuit court determines the local OPD denied erroneously representation. When Northrop was held in contempt for refusing to comply with the Circuit Court\u2019s order appointing him counsel for Stinnett, an entirely new controversy, separate from Stinnett\u2019s case, arose. That it arose out of the underlying criminal prosecution of Stinnett, which has concluded, does not ameliorate, in any way, the jeopardy in which the order placed Northrop. Northrop\u2019s timely appeal of the contempt judgment against him entitles him to adjudication of the propriety of both the order appointing him to represent Stinnett and the order holding him in contempt. As such, because the present appeal presents an existing controversy which has yet to be resolved, it is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">In addition, even where a case may be moot technically, there exist a number of exceptions to the general rule that the appeal must be dismissed. For example, where a case, while technically moot, presents a recurring matter of public concern which, unless decided, will continue to evade review, we nonetheless have considered the case on its merits. <em>In re Julianna B., </em>407 Md. 657, 665-66, 967 A.2d 776, 780-81 (2009); <em>Suter, </em>402 Md. at 220, 935 A.2d at 736; <em>Arrington v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>402 Md. 79, 91-92, 935 A.2d 432, 439-40 (2007); <em>Coburn v. Coburn, </em>342 Md. 244, 250, 674 A.2d 951, 954 (1996); <em>Anne Arundel County School Bus Contractors Ass\u2019n, </em>286 Md. at 328, 407 A.2d at 752; <em>Lloyd v. Supervisors of Elections, </em>206 Md. 36, 43, 111 A.2d 379, 381-82 (1954). It is clear that the question of a trial court\u2019s authority to appoint counsel, including an attorney from the local OPD, for an indigent individual, and the relation of that authority to OPD\u2019s power to determine eligibility for representation by its attorneys in the first instance, are matters of public concern. As noted by the Circuit Court, these questions are impacting presently numer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>ous criminal proceedings in Cecil County. Unless addressed and decided on appeal, the questions at issue likely will recur, in Cecil County and in other counties within Maryland. Accordingly, even if the case was moot technically, we nevertheless would consider the issues raised in the present appeal as matters of public concern likely to evade review.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\n<em>THE APPOINTMENT OF NORTHROP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">At the outset, it is clear to this Court, as it was to the Circuit Court in the proceedings below, that the local OPD denied erroneously representation to Stinnett.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As noted <em>swpra, </em>Article 27A, \u00a7 7, entitled \u201cDetermination of eligibility for services; investigation of financial status of defendant; recovery of expenses,\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">(a) Determination of eligibility for services.\u2014Eligibility for the services of the Office of the Public Defender shall be determined on the basis of the need of the person seeking legal representation. <em>Need shall be measured according to the financial ability of the person to engage and compensate competent private counsel and to provide all other necessary expenses of representation. </em>Such ability shall be recognized to be a variable depending on the nature, extent and liquidity of assets; the disposable net income of the defendant; the nature of the offense; the effort and skill required to gather pertinent information; the length and complexity of the proceedings; and any other foreseeable expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Art. 27A, \u00a7 7(a) (emphasis added). Rather than apply the statutorily-mandated criteria for determining indigency provided by Art. 27A, \u00a7 7(a), the local OPD, in denying representation to Stinnett on this record, relied solely on certain language contained in COMAR 14.06.03.05A and D(2). CO-MAR 14.06.03.05, entitled \u201cDetermination of Eligibility for Services,\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>A.

By evaluating Stinnett\u2019s application solely under the maximum net annual income and asset ceiling standard of COMAR 14.06.03.05A and D(2), while ignoring wholly the statutorily-mandated indigency factors contained in Art. 27A, \u00a7 7(a), and COMAR 14.06.03.05A, the local OPD applied the incorrect standard for determining indigency of applicants and erred, both legally and factually, in concluding that Stinnett did not qualify for representation by its attorneys.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Medstar Health v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>Maryland Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>376 Md. 1, 21, 827 A.2d 83, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>96 (2003) (\u201cMoreover, where the General Assembly has delegated ... broad power to an administrative agency to adopt [legislative rules] or regulations [in a particular area], this Court has upheld the agency\u2019s rule or regulations as long as they did not contradict the language or purpose of the statute.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Christ v.

As noted <em>supra, </em>according to the Circuit Court\u2019s calculations, the defendant\u2019s net income totaled $2123 per month, falling well below the $2534 in expenses he incurred each month. In addition, the trial judge determined that the reasonable cost of a private attorney in Stinnett\u2019s case would be between $3,000 and $5,000. As such, the Circuit Court found properly that Stinnett qualified as indigent under Art. 27A, \u00a7 7(a), the applicable standard for determining indigency, and that the local OPD\u2019s conclusion to the contrary, based solely on the maximum net annual income level and asset ceiling language of COMAR 14.06.03.05A and D(2), was erroneous and contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">After concluding properly that Stinnett, in fact, was indigent under Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, the trial court appointed Northrop, the Deputy District Public Defender for Cecil County, or, alternatively, another attorney from the local OPD or its list of panel attorneys, to represent Stinnett. On appeal, OPD contends that the Circuit Court\u2019s actions in this regard exceeded its authority, and that, although a circuit court may appoint counsel for an indigent defendant who has been denied repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>sentation by the local OPD, the circuit court may not appoint an attorney from the local OPD once the local OPD declines representation of the defendant. For reasons we shall explain, we disagree and hold that, upon finding that the local OPD denied erroneously representation to an indigent defendant, a circuit court may appoint any attorney, including an attorney from the local OPD, to represent a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">We previously addressed the statutory division of labor between the courts and the local OPD, with regard to assuring legal representation to indigent individuals, in <em>Thompson v. State, </em>284 Md. 113, 394 A.2d 1190 (1978). In <em>Thompson, </em>the OPD determined, at an initial proceeding, that the defendant was \u201ctechnically\u201d eligible for representation, although it noted to the trial court that, despite having no income, the defendant managed to post $750 for a surety bond. <em>Id. </em>at 127, 394 A.2d at 1197. Two weeks later, at a subsequent hearing, the defendant requested that the court appoint counsel to represent him, having failed to acquire private representation on his own. <em>Id. </em>at 127-28, 394 A.2d at 1197. At that hearing, the OPD maintained to the court that it determined at its initial interview with the defendant that, in fact, he did not qualify for representation and that it informed the defendant that it would not represent him. <em>Id. </em>at 128, 394 A.2d at 1197. Apparently, the OPD \u201cwanted to leave it up to the court, making clear that if the court so ordered [it] would provide representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather than make an independent determination of the defendant\u2019s alleged indigency, the trial court accepted in full the OPD\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was not entitled to have representation provided, stating that \u201cyou tell me he is not eligible and that is good enough for me.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 394 A.2d at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We reversed the trial court, holding that it erred by failing to determine independently whether to appoint counsel under Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> following the local OPD\u2019s denial of represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>tation. <em>Id. </em>at 128, 394 A.2d at 1197. Specifically, we observed that \u201cthere is a clear duty imposed on the court, in order to decide whether it should appoint counsel, upon the Public Defender declining to do so, to make its own independent determination whether a defendant is indigent and otherwise eligible to have counsel provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 394 A.2d at 1198. Regarding the OPD\u2019s representation to the court that it would represent the defendant if the court so ordered, we stated, in dicta and without citation to authority, that \u201c[t]he court refused to so order, properly we believe, on the ground that the question whether the Public Defender represented a particular defendant was for the Public Defender and not for the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128, 394 A.2d at 1197.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Four years after our decision in <em>Thompson, </em>the Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Baldwin, </em>observed, also in dicta, that <em>Thompson </em>\u201cseemed to hold that if the Public Defender declines to represent a defendant\u2014even on grounds of non-eligibility (as opposed to a potential conflict of interest)\u2014the court has no authority to order him to provide representation.\u201d <em>Baldwin, </em>51 Md.App. at 552, 444 A.2d at 1067. In a footnote, the intermediate appellate court conjectured further that \u201c[i]t would appear from [the language of Thompson], by logical extension, that, although the court may appoint any other qualified counsel to represent an indigent defendant, it may not appoint the Public Defender against his wish.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>552 n. 11, 444 A.2d at 1067. This question, however, was not at the core of <em>Baldwin. </em>Rather, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the trial court based on the latter\u2019s refusal to appoint counsel for the defendant on the ground that the trial court, in making its required independent determination of indigency, violated Art. 27A, \u00a7 7(a), by relying improperly \u201cupon inferences of wealth for which there is no support in the record and upon resources over which [the defendant] had no control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554, 444 A.2d at 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">In the present appeal, the OPD and the Dissent rely heavily on the above quoted language, and other dicta in <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Baldwin,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to support their contentions that, where the OPD declines representation, a reviewing court is powerless to correct a manifest error in the local OPD\u2019s determination of eligibility by appointing the local OPD as counsel for the indigent defendant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Such dicta is wholly unpersuasive, particularly in light of the statutory scheme designed by the General Assembly to govern the respective responsibilities of the OPD and the courts in determining whether a criminal defendant qualifies as indigent and whether such individual is entitled to representation paid for by the taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Under Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, the <em>\u201cinitial </em>determination, under the law, is to be made by the Public Defender,\u201d based upon the criteria enumerated in the statute for determining indigency. <em>Baldwin, </em>51 Md.App. at 551, 444 A.2d at 1066 (emphasis added). The OPD\u2019s initial determination of indigency is not final, however, because \u201c[i]n obvious recognition of the fact that the whole system has Constitutional underpinnings and that the courts must, of necessity, be the ultimate protector of those underpinnings,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 552, 444 A.2d at 1067, the General Assembly provided in Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), a clear oversight and corrective role for the courts in the indigency determination and appointed-counsel process. Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), entitled \u201cPanel attorneys; courts not deprived of authority to appoint counsel in certain situations,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">Authority of courts to appoint counsel in certain situations.\u2014Nothing in this article shall be construed to deprive any court mentioned in \u00a7 4(b)(2) of this article of its authority to appoint <em>an attorney </em>to represent an indigent person where there is a conflict in legal representation in a matter involving multiple defendants and one of the defendants is represented by or through the Office of the Public Defender, <em>or where the Office of the Public Defender declines to provide representation to an indigent person entitled to representation under this article.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f) (emphasis added). Although Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), does not specify either the procedure or the standard to be employed by the court, under <em>Thompson, </em>the court must \u201cmake its own independent determination whether a defendant is indigent and otherwise eligible to have counsel provided,\u201d 284 Md. at 129, 394 A.2d at 1198, considering \u201cany information offered by the parties which may reasonably bear upon the defendant\u2019s ability to afford private counsel ... [and] us[ing] the same statutory standards\u201d provided in Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, which, as discussed <em>supra, </em>are the statutory indigency factors that the local OPD should have applied. <em>Baldwin, </em>51 Md.App. at 553-54, 444 A.2d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Of utmost importance to the present case, Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), contains no language indicating a legislative intent to prohibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the appointment of an attorney from the local OPD by a trial court to represent an individual that the court determines qualifies as indigent, except where an actual and unwaived or unwaivable conflict of interest would arise.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Despite the OPD\u2019s argument to the contrary, the proposition that a court may not appoint the local OPD against its unjustified wishes finds its legal toehold solely in the crevice of the unpersuasive dicta of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Baldwin. </em>In order to conclude, as the OPD urges, that Art. 27A, 6(f), prohibits the court, in exercising its responsibility to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant, from appointing an attorney from the local OPD, after the local OPD has refused to provide representation for the defendant, we would have to add the phrase \u201cother than the local OPD\u201d to the language of Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), which states that the trial court may \u201cappoint an attorney to represent an indigent defendant.\u201d Such a judicial insertion into clear legislative language violates sound canons of statutory interpretation and should be avoided. <em>See Lonaconing Trap Club, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t, </em>410 Md. 326, 339, 978 A.2d 702, 709 (2009) (stating that we neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute). Although it is clear that the trial court may not appoint the local OPD where the local OPD is prevented from representing an indigent defendant due to an actual and unwaived or unwaivable conflict of interest,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the language of Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), contains no language prohibiting a court from appointing the local OPD where it determines that the local OPD found erroneously that a defendant did not qualify for representation based on the local OPD\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>consider the appropriate eligibility criteria, consideration of which is mandated by Art. 27A, \u00a7 7. To the extent <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Baldwin </em>relied on the statutory scheme in support of the conclusion that the court may not appoint the local OPD to represent an indigent defendant where the local OPD declined representation of that individual erroneously, such reliance was wholly misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">As opposed to the contentions put forth by the OPD in its appeal, we hold that, in accordance with the provisions of Art. 27A, \u00a7 \u00a7 6 and 7, and the holdings of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Baldwin, </em>where the local OPD declines representation to a defendant erroneously, because of the local OPD\u2019s failure to consider properly the statutorily-mandated criteria for determining indigency, and where a court finds, upon its subsequent mandatory independent review, that the individual qualifies for representation, the trial court, in carrying out its role as \u201cultimate protector\u201d of the Constitutional right to counsel, may appoint an attorney from the local OPD to represent the indigent individual unless an actual and unwaived or unwaivable conflict of interest would result thereby.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Though by no means a perfect analogy to the situation here, such a procedure is somewhat analogous to legislatively-sanctioned judicial review of decisions made by an administrative agency. Where an administrative agency acts contrary to law by ignoring its statutory mandate and instead relies solely on a self-initiated regulation that does not comply with its enabling statute, a court has the power to order the agency to comply with its statutory mandate. <em>See Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 302, 884 A.2d 1171, 1207 (2005) (\u201cAn agency decision, for example, may be deemed \u2018arbitrary or capricious\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>if it is contrary to or inconsistent with an enabling statute\u2019s language or policy goals.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In the present case, where the local OPD disregards the statutorily-mandated criteria for determining indigency provided by Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, and relies instead on language contained in a regulation that, as discussed <em>supra, </em>is contrary to its enabling statute, a court may direct the local OPD, upon a proper finding of indigency by the court, to represent the indigent individual for which the local OPD denied representation erroneously. Of course, where the local OPD rejects representation based on its own consideration of the indigency criteria provided by Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, its determination is entitled to deference, and the court will interfere only when that decision is arbitrary or capricious. Where the OPD acts, however, contrary to its statutory mandate by wholly disregarding the indigency factors contained in Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, it abuses its discretion and its eligibility determination is entitled to no weight. In such a scenario, under the plain language of Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), the trial court, upon finding properly that the defendant qualifies as indigent under the statutorily-mandated indigency factors appearing in Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, may appoint \u201can attorney\u201d to represent the defendant, including an attorney from the local OPD.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>No language in the Public Defender Statute suggests that, when the General Assembly provided the trial courts with the power to appoint \u201can attorney\u201d for an indigent defendant where the OPD declines representation means, in fact, only the power to appoint \u201can attorney other than the OPD.\u201d No appellate court in this State has held previously that the attorneys in the local OPD are ineligible from appointment by a circuit court following the local OPD\u2019s factually and legally erroneous rejection of representation of an indigent defendant. As such, we hold that, under the Article 27A and case law, where the OPD has denied representation for an indigent individual erroneously, based on the OPD\u2019s failure to apply the statutorily-mandated indigency criteria contained in Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, and the circuit court finds that the defendant, in fact, is indigent under that standard, the circuit court may appoint an attorney from the local OPD to represent the defendant, unless an actual and unwaived or unwaivable conflict of interest would result.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\n<em>THE ORDER OF CONTEMPT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Although we hold that the Circuit Court acted within its authority when it appointed Northrop to represent Stinnett, we nevertheless reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s order finding Northrop in direct contempt for refusing to appear as Stinnett\u2019s counsel.

Failure to comply with the requirement mandates reversal of the judgment of contempt. <em>See King v. State, </em>400 Md. 419, 445, 929 A.2d 169, 184 (2007) (noting that the failure of a court to comply with the Maryland Rules renders its order of contempt fatally defective and requires reversal).

Although we are not called on in the present case to address directly the legal validity of COMAR 14.06.03.05A and D(2), we pause to note that a seemingly compelling argument exists that those subsections, as they presently stand, purporting to allow the OPD to consider an applicant\u2019s maximum net annual income and asset ceiling in determining eligibility for representation, rather than mandating consideration of the six indigency factors, are unauthorized by, and, in fact, conflict directly with, Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, the enabling statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">In this regard, it may be helpful to note the history of COMAR 14.06.03.05.

As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>a result, Stinnett sought legal representation from the Office of the Public Defender (\u201cOPD\u201d).

It found, in fact, that the OPD\u2019s rejection letter was based on Stinnett\u2019s income alone and did not take into account the other factors required by \u00a7 7(a) to be considered. Accordingly, the court concluded that Stinnett \u201ccannot afford an attorney\u201d and given the \u201cvery, very serious charges\u201d he was facing, needed legal representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Based on the indigency hearing, \u201cand considering and applying the factors of Art. 27A, Secs. 6(f)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 7(a), <em>Baldwin v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>State, </em>51 Md.App. 538, 444 A.2d 1058 (1982), and Md.

Stinnett did not appeal the judgment thus entered. On the other hand, Northrop noted an appeal of the August 8, 2008 Order finding him in direct contempt to the Court of Special Appeals. He also filed with this Court, a petition for Writ of Certiorari, in which he raised two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">\u201c(1) Did the Trial Court err in ordering public defendant staff attorney/s to represent a criminal defendant in a criminal case after the public defender declined to provide representation in the case; and (2) Did the trial court err in finding petitioner in contempt?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">This Court granted his petition prior to proceedings in the intermediate appellate court. <em>Public Defender v.

The underlying case from which today\u2019s issue arises has been finally adjudicated. For the reasons articulated by the majority, however, this Court is not precluded from considering this case on its merits. This case presents an exception to the general rule governing mootness. In particular, the issue promises to be a recurring matter of public concern, which, unless decided, will continue to evade review. <em>See generally In re Julianna B., </em>407 Md. 657, 665-66, 967 A.2d 776, 781 (2009); <em>Suter v.

In those situations, the Court cannot, and should not, avoid its responsibility to ensure that the questions are resolved in full accordance with the law. It may not, therefore, adopt simple solutions that do not enjoy legal support, or stretch logic to the breaking point, for the sake of reaching a preferred resolution. Sadly, that is precisely what the majority does today.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">This case presents the question of the \u201cdivision of labor between the courts and the local OPD, with regard to assuring legal representation to indigent individuals.\u201d <em>Office of the Public Defender v.

The majority, after a careful manipulation of legal principles and relevant, indeed controlling case law, holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN6\">\u201cthe Circuit Court for Cecil County did not exceed its authority when it appointed John K. Northrop (\u2018Northrop\u2019), the Deputy District Public Defender for Cecil County, or a member of his office or a panel attorney, to represent Jason Flynn Stinnett (\u2018Stinnett\u2019), a criminal defendant whom the Circuit Court found qualified as indigent under the Maryland Code, but to whom representation had been denied previously and wrongfully by the local OPD.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><em>OPD v. State, </em>413 Md. at 415, 993 A.2d at 57. This holding is contrary to the statutory language governing the OPD, namely Article 27A \u00a7\u00a7 4(a) (placing the primary duty on the OPD to provide indigent representation) and 6(f) (preserving in certain enumerated courts the authority to appoint counsel when the OPD cannot or does not do so) and to this Court\u2019s previous holdings, both of which inform the trial courts with regard to their responsibility when the OPD declines, properly or improperly, to provide representation. Together, they teach that the courts do not have oversight over the eligibility determination decisions of the OPD. The majority\u2019s disregard of precedent and statutory pronouncements not only is troubling, but it tramples on the doctrine of separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">1. <em>Applicable Caselaw</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The Court previously has addressed the juxtaposition of appointment responsibility between the OPD and the State\u2019s trial courts in <em>Thompson v. State, </em>284 Md. 113, 394 A.2d 1190 (1978). Accordingly, and indeed, <em>Thompson </em>and its progeny control the result of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In <em>Thompson, </em>the defendant had been convicted in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Montgomery County, of shoplifting and assault and battery. 284 Md. at 114, 394 A.2d at 1191. He appealed that conviction to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Although represented by the OPD in the District Court, he posted bond pending appeal and appeared without counsel in the Circuit Court. <em>Id. </em>at 116, 394 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>A.2d at 1191. The OPD determined that he did not qualify for the services of the OPD, <em>id. </em>at 118, 394 A.2d at 1192-93, and the trial court, having refused the invitation by the OPD to \u201cleave it up to the Court as to whether or not the Court wanted [it] to appoint a lawyer on his behalf,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 118, 394 A.2d at 1193, advised the defendant to get counsel and of the consequences of not doing so. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 394 A.2d at 1193. After some delay occasioned by the defendant\u2019s expressed intent, but unsuccessful attempt, to get private counsel, the case proceeded to trial and sentence with the defendant unrepresented. <em>Id. </em>at 121-122, 394 A.2d at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Although there were three issues presented in <em>Thompson, </em>the dispositive one, namely, \u201c[d]id the trial court err in not fully complying with the mandate of Rule 723 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure by not properly advising ... Thompson of his rights and obligations as contained therein?,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 114, 394 A.2d at 1191, related to the advice required by Rule 723 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure (1978) to be given to a defendant, by the court, upon his or her appearance in court not represented by counsel and before accepting or finding a waiver of counsel. Maryland Rule 723, Appearance-Provision for or Waiver of Counsel,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> after requiring in \u00a7 (a) that a defendant appear in court at the time and place specified in the summons or other writ when a charging document is filed against him or her, prescribed the inquiry requirements for several scenarios in which the defendant appeared without counsel: when the defendant appeared without counsel, \u00a7 (b)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>; when the defendant appeared without counsel and indicated that he or she \u201cdoes not want representation,\u201d \u00a7 (c),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>when the defendant appeared without counsel subsequent to his initial appearance, \u00a7 (d). We concluded that the trial judge violated Rule 723 in three particulars, by failing to \u201cadvis[e] Thompson pursuant to \u00a7 (b), in not conducting the waiver inquiry required by \u00a7 (c), and in not making a determination upon proper considerations whether Thompson was eligible to have it appoint counsel upon the refusal of the Public Defender to provide representation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 130-31, 394 A.2d at 1199, either one of which constituted reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 130, 394 A.2d at 1199. It is the latter that is of interest in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">As to Rule 723(c), which implements the right to counsel, including appointed counsel, guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, <em>Thompson, </em>284 Md. at 122-23, 394 A.2d at 1194-95,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">\u201cThe inquiry required to be made and the test to be met under \u00a7 c before the court may accept a waiver of counsel applies not only to a defendant\u2019s appearance pursuant to \u00a7 a but also <em>to any proceeding at which he appears without counsel thereafter. </em>In such event, the court is prohibited from proceeding before determining whether the defendant <em>at that time </em>desires to waive counsel or has waived counsel. \u00a7 d 2.

That also was the message being conveyed by this Court\u2019s discussion of the trial court\u2019s approach to the defendant\u2019s right to representation<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">\u201cThe record before us does not show what investigation was made by the Office of the Public Defender and all that was considered by it with respect to Thompson\u2019s eligibility <em>vel non. </em>It seems, however, that the primary reason for declining to represent him was that a surety bond had been posted for him. As we have seen, the Public Defender raised this specter at the first hearing on 10 February 1978 when he mentioned the bond after stating that Thompson was \u2018technically\u2019 eligible for the services of the Public Defender. Whereupon, Thompson flatly declared that the Public Defender had told him that \u2018if I had somebody to post the money out on bond, I should get my own lawyer. That\u2019s what he told me.\u2019 The judge then presiding expressly did not dispute that the Public Defender had so stated. Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Dean represented to the court at the hearing on 19 April that \u2018[t]he amount of the bond that [Thompson] made indicated to the Public Defender\u2019s Office that he wasn\u2019t really as indigent as expected, whereas he represented.\u2019 The judge originally in the case was completely content with the Public Defender\u2019s conclusion, whatever it may have been based upon, that Thompson was not entitled to have representation provided\u2014\u2018you tell me he is not eligible and that is good enough for me.\u2019 This view governed the court\u2019s action in the face of an utter lack of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>data contemplated by art. 27A, \u00a7 7, the absence of any expression by the Office of the Public Defender of the reasons why it declined to provide representation, and the fact that the Public Defender had represented Thompson in the District Court.... The judge made no attempt to determine whether the refusal of the Office of the Public Defender to provide representation was despite Thompson\u2019s eligibility to have counsel provided. Neither judge thereafter involved in the case took any steps to determine whether Thompson was in fact an indigent person entitled to representation. The court was obligated to make that determination in the circumstances. As we have indicated, if Thompson were indigent and otherwise entitled to assistance of counsel, the law, implemented by statute and our rules of procedure, required the court to appoint an attorney when the Office of the Public Defender declined to provide counsel. The failure of the court to determine whether Thompson was eligible to have counsel provided was reversible error.\u201d (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">284 Md. at 129-80, 394 A.2d at 1198-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The message was received.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See Maus v.

Upon that premise, the question before us is not whether the Public Defender erred in declining representation but whether the court was derelict in discharging its own responsibility to assure compliance with appellant\u2019s Constitutional right of counsel, in accordance with its authority under \u00a7 6(f) of art. 27A.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">51 Md.App. at 552-553, 444 A.2d at 1067.

The first option is representation by the Public Defender\u2019s Office as authorized by Maryland Annotated Code, Article 27A, \u00a7 4 (1993 Repl. Vol.). If the Public Defender\u2019s Office determines it is unable to represent a defendant due to his or her income, the court must conduct its own inquiry as to whether the defendant qualifies for a court-appointed counsel.

The necessity for this independent court evaluation stems from the judiciary\u2019s role as the \u2018ultimate protector\u2019 of the rights awarded under the Constitution, including the right to counsel. <em>Baldwin, </em>51 Md.App. at 552, 444 A.2d 1058.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">100 Md.App. at 380-81, 641 A.2d at 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The majority does not agree that the appointment responsibilities of the court and the OPD are separate and distinct and that the court does not review the OPD\u2019s determination of ineligibility. Indeed, characterizing this Court\u2019s statement in <em>Thompson </em>as <em>dicta, </em>but without clearly saying why, it expressly holds that the trial court\u2019s responsibility extends to inquiring into the correctness of the OPD\u2019s indigency, and thus representation, decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201cthe OPD and the Dissent rely heavily on the above quoted language,[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] and other dicta in <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Baldwin, ... </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>to support their contentions that, where the OPD declines representation, a reviewing court is powerless to correct a manifest error in the local OPD\u2019s determination of eligibility by appointing the local OPD as counsel for the indigent defendant____ Such dicta is wholly unpersuasive, particularly in light of the statutory scheme designed by the General Assembly to govern the respective responsibilities of the OPD and the courts in determining whether a criminal defendant qualifies as indigent and whether such individual is entitled to representation paid for by the taxpayers.\u201d (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><em>OPD v.

Before explaining why the majority is wrong, however, it is necessary to address its assertion that statements in <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Baldwin </em>indicating that the appointment responsibilities of the court and the OPD are separate and distinct and that the court may not appoint the OPD are <em>dicta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Distinguishing between what is <em>dicta </em>and what is the court\u2019s holding can be challenging. Without understanding what dicta is, it is not possible to know or appreciate the difference. This Court considered the meaning of <em>dicta </em>in <em>Carstairs v. Cochran, </em>95 Md. 488, 52 A. 601 (1902). There, concerned with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>whether the Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Monticello Distilling Co. v. Baltimore City, </em>90 Md. 416, 45 A. 210 (1900), interpreting the Act of 1892, was dicta or holding, the Court rejected the argument that <em>Monticello </em>was decided on one \u201csole ground\u201d and that \u201cthe expression of opinion upon any other point was not involved in the decisive objection on which the judgment was reversed, and was therefore <em>\u2018obiter dictum,\u2019 \u201d Carstairs, </em>95 Md. at 499, 52 A. at 601, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">\u201cWe cannot agree that the expression of opinion referred to was an <em>obiter dictum. </em>... It may be difficult to frame a concise definition of an <em>obiter dictum </em>applicable to every such expression of opinion, and some Courts incline to the rule that the most deliberate expression of opinion, upon a question distinctly raised in the record, and fully argued by counsel, may nevertheless be regarded as a <em>dictum, </em>unless essential to the actual disposition made of the case. But as Bouvier well says: \u2018It is difficult to see why, in a philosophic point of view, the opinion of the Court is not as persuasive on all the points which were so involved in the cause that it was the duty of counsel to argue them, and which were deliberately passed on by the Court, as if the decision had hung upon but one point;\u2019 and in Maryland the rule is in accord with this view. In <em>Alexander v. Worthington, </em>5 Md. 471 [1854], it is said: \u2018All that is necessary in Maryland to render the decision of the Court of Appeals authoritative on any point decided, is to show that there was an application of the judicial mind to the precise question adjudged;\u2019 and in <em>Michael v. Morey, </em>26 Md. 239 [1867], it was said that a decision there cited, could not be said to be <em>obiter dictum, </em>\u2018as the question was directly involved in the issues of law raised by the demurrer to the bill, and the mind of the Court was directly drawn to, and distinctly expressed upon the subject.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><em>Carstairs, </em>95 Md. at 499-500, 52 A. at 601-02.

Indeed, it required the Court to define the role and the duty of the trial court in the process. The issue in <em>Thompson </em>related to Rule 728, the whole of it, not just certain provisions. <em>Thompson, </em>284 Md. at 114, 394 A.2d at 1191 (\u201cThe issue posed by the second question, \u2018[d]id the trial court err in not fully complying with the mandate of Rule 723 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure by not properly advising ... Thompson of his rights and obligations as contained therein?\u2019 \u201d). As we have seen, the Thompson Court recognized that its shared responsibility, acknowledged by Rule 723(c)(4), to provide counsel to indigent defendants, was grounded in Art. 27A \u00a7 6(f), which it construed as imposing on the court not simply the responsibility of appointing counsel when the OPD declined to do so, but also required, as a prerequisite to doing so, that it independently determine the defendant\u2019s indigency. It was in explaining this responsibility that the Court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">\u201cThe Public Defender wanted to leave it up to the court, making clear that if the court so ordered he would provide representation.

Considering the question whether the \u201c \u2018trial court abused its discretion, and thus denied [the defendant] rights secured ... by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and Md.Code Ann., Article 27A, \u00a7 6(f),\u2019 \u201d <em>Baldwin, </em>51 Md.App. at 545, 444 A.2d at 1063, the Court of Special Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">\u201cBy declining to appoint counsel, the court failed to discharge its responsibility under \u00a7 6(f) of art. 27A, proceeded to trial in contravention of Maryland Rule 723, and thus effectively denied appellant his Federal and State Constitutional right to counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 556, 444 A.2d at 1069.

First, noting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">\u201c[a]t the outset, it is clear to this Court, as it was to the Circuit Court in the proceedings below, that the local OPD denied erroneously representation to Stinnett.... Rather than apply the statutorily-mandated criteria for determining indigency provided by Art. 27A, \u00a7 7(a), the local OPD, in denying representation to Stinnett on this record, relied solely on certain language contained in COMAR 14.06.03.05A and D(2)....

State, </em>413 Md. at 428-29, 992 A.2d at 66. Moreover, relying on <em>Baldwin, </em>it reasons that the OPD\u2019s indigency determination is only \u201cinitial,\u201d \u201cnot final,\u201d because the \u201ccourts must, of necessity, be the ultimate protector of those underpinnings!]]\u201d <em>OPD v.

The third faulty premise is that Article 27A, \u00a7 6(f), by requiring trial courts to make an independent determination as to whether a defendant is indigent, <em>OPD v. State, </em>413 Md. at 432, 992 A.2d at 68 and despite \u201cnot specifying] either the procedure or the standard to be employed by the court,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 432, 992 A.2d at 68, provides \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>clear oversight and corrective role for the courts in the indigency determination and appointed-counsel process.\u201d <em>OPD v. State, </em>413 Md. at 432, 992 A.2d at 68. Finally, the majority emphasizes that Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f) \u201ccontains no language indicating a legislative intent to prohibit the appointment of an attorney from the local OPD by a trial court,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>\u201d <em>OPD v.

In enacting this statute, the Legislature clearly announced its purpose and, subject to the right of local governments to opt out and provide their own public defender system,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to whom it was entrusting implementation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\u201cIt is hereby declared to be the policy of the State of Maryland to provide for the realization of the constitutional guarantees of counsel in the representation of indigents, including related necessary services and facilities, in criminal and juvenile proceedings within the State, and to assure effective assistance and continuity of counsel to indigent accused taken into custody and indigent defendants in criminal and juvenile proceedings before the courts of the State of Maryland, and to authorize the Office of Public Defender to administer and assure enforcement of the provisions of this article in accordance with its terms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00a7 1. It accordingly established the OPD and designated the Public Defender as its \u201chead.\u201d \u00a7 3. To the Public Defender was committed \u201cthe primary duty ... to provide legal representation for any indigent defendant eligible for services,\u201d to be provided in certain enumerated proceedings, \u00a7 4(a) and (b), and the \u201cgeneral responsibility for the operation of the Office of the Public Defender and all district offices,\u201d \u00a7 5(1), including such powers and duties, \u00a7 5(2)-(8), as will \u201ceffectuate the purposes\u201d of the statute and \u201cpromote the efficient conduct of the work and general administration of the office, its professional staff and other employees.\u201d \u00a7 5(3). The Office of the Public Defender was charged with determining the eligibility for services of any person seeking legal representation, which it was required to do on the basis of that person\u2019s need, as defined in \u00a7 7(a). To make that determination, it was empowered to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cmake such investigation of the financial status of each defendant at such time or times as the circumstances shall warrant, and in connection therewith the office shall have the authority to require a defendant to execute and deliver such written requests or authorizations as may be necessary under applicable law to provide the office with access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>records of public or private sources, otherwise confidential, as may be needed to evaluate eligibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00a7 7(b).

In pursuing that intent, this Court will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An0\">\u201cneither add words to, nor delete words from, a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature chose to use, and we do not engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\"><em>In re Gloria H., </em>410 Md. 562, 581, 979 A.2d 710, 720 (2009); <em>see also Chow v.

State, </em>413 Md. at 431-34, 992 A.2d at 67-69, and the primary, as \u00a7 4(a) provides, responsibility for insuring that indigent defendants receive the legal representation to which they constitutionally are entitled. Indeed, \u00a7 4(a) says as much: \u201cIt shall be the primary duty of the Public Defender to provide legal representation for any indigent defendant eligible for services under this article.\u201d To be sure, there is a role reserved for the trial courts. That role was prescribed in \u00a7 6(f). It is telling that the only reference to a court role in the appointment of counsel process simply provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u201cNothing in this article shall be construed to deprive [a circuit court] of its authority to appoint an attorney to represent an indigent person ... where the Office of the Public Defender declines to provide representation to an indigent person entitled to representation under this article,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">and does not characterize the court as having \u201ccorrective\u201d responsibilities for the OPD or prescribe a review regime for its eligibility determinations. This is perfectly consistent with the interpretation given it by both <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Baldwin: </em>that the appointment authority of the courts was simply supplemental and a failsafe; as the court in <em>Baldwin </em>put it, the role reserved to the courts to appoint counsel is \u201c[i]n obvious recognition of the fact that the whole system has Constitutional underpinnings and that the courts must, of necessity, be the ultimate protector of those underpinnings.\u201d 51 Md.App. at 552, 444 A.2d at 1067, explicating \u00a7 6(f). All of the other provisions that address eligibility or appointment refer to the OPD and prescribe the procedures and standards that the OPD must apply and/or the authority that the OPD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>has. I repeat, there simply is no provision, expressly or otherwise, calling for, never mind requiring, court review of the appointment or eligibility determinations made by the OPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">b. <em>Corrective Role</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The Public Defender statute does not provide for a \u201ccorrective role\u201d by which trial judges may review the OPD\u2019s eligibility determinations, erroneous or otherwise. When the OPD declined representation, the trial court, to be sure, was required independently to determine whether it found the defendant to be indigent. When, as a result of that determination, it concluded that the OPD had misapplied its governing statute, as the \u201cultimate protector of those [Constitutional] underpinnings,\u201d <em>Baldwin, </em>51 Md.App. at 552, 444 A.2d at 1067, the trial court, in accordance with our holdings, could have, and should have, pursuant to the statutory authority prescribed in \u00a7 6(f), appointed \u201can attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Not so, says the majority. It reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">\u201cUnder Art. 27A, \u00a7 7, the <em>\u2018initial </em>determination, under the law, is to be made by the Public Defender,\u2019 based upon the criteria enumerated in the statute for determining indigency. <em>Baldwin, </em>51 Md.App. at 551, 444 A.2d at 1066 (emphasis added). The OPD\u2019s initial determination of indigency is not final, however, because \u201c[i]n obvious recognition of the fact that the whole system has Constitutional underpinnings and that the courts must, of necessity, be the ultimate protector of those underpinnings, <em>id. </em>at 552, 444 A.2d at 1067[.]\u2019 ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\"><em>OPD v. State, </em>413 Md. at 432, 992 A.2d at 67-68. The majority further concludes that: \u201cthe General Assembly provided in Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), a clear oversight and corrective role for the courts in the indigency determination and appointed-counsel process.\u201d <em>OPD v. State, </em>413 Md. at 432, 992 A.2d at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">It is true, of course, that the initial determination of a defendant\u2019s eligibility for appointive counsel generally will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>made by the OPD. It is also true that, when it has a conflict or when it declines representation, the OPD may not, and likely will not, make the final determination; indigent individuals are entitled to representation even when the OPD cannot, or will not, provide it. Section \u00a7 6(f) recognizes this to be so and, thus, addresses those situations. With regard to the situation <em>sub judice, </em>it makes clear that the trial courts may appoint when the OPD has refused to. Giving courts that authority, in that circumstance, is a far cry from giving them a \u201ccorrective role\u201d over the OPD, which, by express statutory provision, <em>see </em>\u00a7 4(a), is the \u201cprimary player\u201d in the process. Neither this Court nor the Court of Special Appeals has ever held that \u00a7 6(f) prescribes a \u201ccorrective role\u201d for trial courts and \u00a7 6(f), by its express terms, do not purport to give trial courts such a role, as it pertains to the \u201cindigency determination and appointed-counsel process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The majority all but concedes this point when it acknowledges, as it must, that \u00a7 6(f) \u201cdoes not specify either the procedure or the standard to be employed by the court.\u201d <em>OPD v. State, </em>413 Md. at 432, 992 A.2d at 68. Nevertheless, relying on <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>pronouncement that courts must make their own independent indigency determination, <em>id., </em>and the absence of prohibitory language\u2014\u201c[n]o appellate court in this State has held previously that the attorneys in the local OPD are ineligible from appointment by a circuit court following the local OPD\u2019s factually and legally erroneous rejection of representation of an indigent <em>defendant\u201d\u2014OPD v. State, </em>413 Md. at 436, 992 A.2d at 70, it reads into that section an affirmative \u201ccorrective\u201d role.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The lift is too heavy. Requiring trial courts to make an independent assessment of the indigency of a defendant turned down by the OPD is a far cry from investing those courts with a \u201ccorrective role.\u201d It must be remembered that the Court that imposed the \u201cindependent assessment\u201d requirement on trial courts, the <em>Thompson </em>Court, rejected the notion being espoused by the majority, <em>Thompson, </em>284 Md. at 129, 394 A.2d at 1198, that it had a responsibility, a role to play in directing or correcting the OPD. That Court was clear in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>holding that there was no such role. Nor is the absence of appellate decisions holding the OPD, who has declined representation, immune to appointment by a circuit court persuasive. The converse is equally true. There are an equal dearth of appellate opinions holding the OPD eligible\u2014that the OPD can be forced to represent an individual\u2014for appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">I reject the assertion that appointing the OPD is necessary in order to prevent the court from being rendered \u201cpowerless to correct a manifest error.\u201d <em>OPD v. State, </em>413 Md. at 431, 992 A.2d at 67. The goal of the Public Defender statute is to ensure a defendant\u2019s right to counsel. A manifest injustice would occur if the defendant were wrongly denied counsel. The OPD is entrusted with the primary responsibility to provide counsel and, in discharging that responsibility, is required to make eligibility determinations. Section 6(f) addresses the situation when the OPD\u2019s determination is to deny representation; its purpose and effect are to ensure that an indigent individual is provided representation. The trial court, in that event, is authorized to determine for itself whether the defendant is eligible and, if so, to appoint counsel. Thus, the trial court is not powerless to correct a manifest injustice. As the ultimate arbiter of the constitutional mandate, it is empowered, as, where appropriate, it may, and is expected, to appoint counsel. Denying the trial court the ability to appoint the OPD simply does not have the effect the majority posits and supposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">3. <em>Statutory Construction\u2014The OPD\u2019s Authority to Decline Representation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The canons of statutory construction demand that no word in the statutory text is interpreted in a way which makes it meaningless. <em>Foley, </em>410 Md. at 152, 978 A.2d at 237. That is exactly what the majority does here; it completely ignores this canon. Sections 7 and 6(f) give the OPD the ability to determine the eligibility of defendants for appointed counsel, which includes the authority to decline representation. Nevertheless, the majority holds that, despite the statutory au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>thority given the OPD to decline representation, the OPD may be forced to represent individuals whom it has rejected, that it does not actually possess the power to decline representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">According to the majority, the OPD\u2019s determination to decline representation is subject to review by the court and, should the court determine that it misapplied its statute, reversal of that decision, which, worse yet, will take the form of being appointed to represent the individual it had previously rejected. This flies in the face of \u00a7 6(f), which does not provide for such review. Moreover, to read \u00a7 6(f) as the majority does, requires that you read out of \u00a7 6(f) the OPD\u2019s right to decline representation and make it subject and subordinate to the court\u2019s eligibility decision, rendering that portion of the statute completely meaningless. <em>Foley, </em>410 Md. at 152, 978 A.2d at 237. This result conflicts with the language of the statute and, thus, with what the Legislature intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">4. <em>Arbitrary and Capricious Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The majority\u2019s holds that the court has the authority to appoint the OPD as \u201can attorney,\u201d upon finding that the OPD\u2019s determination was arbitrary or capricious. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcY\">\u201cOf course, where the local OPD rejects representation based on its own consideration of the indigency criteria provided by Art. 27A \u00a7 7, its determination is entitled to deference, and the court will interfere only when that decision is arbitrary or capricious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\"><em>OPD v. State, </em>413 Md. at 435, 992 A.2d at 69-70. It is not clear what the source of this review standard is. That it is novel, not previously applied, and is reminiscent of, but not identical to, that applicable to administrative cases comes to mind. The OPD is not an administrative agency. Nevertheless, I will test it under the administrative umbrella.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">5. <em>The Administrative Agency Context.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">If OPD were an administrative agency, we would have to look to \u00a7 6(f) to determine whether the court had jurisdiction to review its decisions. \u201c[I]n order for an administrative agency\u2019s action properly to be before this Court (or any court) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>for [statutory] judicial review, there generally must be a legislative grant of the right to seek judicial review.\u201d <em>See Appleton Reg\u2019l Cmty. Alliance v. County Comm\u2019rs, </em>404 Md. 92, 98-99, 945 A.2d 648, 651 (2008), quoting <em>Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 273, 884 A.2d 1171, 1189 (2005). Section 6(f) contains no language from which a grant of judicial review of the OPD\u2019s eligibility determinations can be discerned. If that section sufficed, it would be a far cry from the language the Legislature customarily uses to grant judicial review. <em>See Rogers v. Eastport Yachting Ctr., LLC., </em>408 Md. 722, 732, 971 A.2d 322, 328 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Administrative agencies can have quasi-judicial functions. This Court has stressed that, while the courts have the ability to review administrative decisions, its \u201crole in reviewing an administrative agency[\u2019s] adjudicatory decision is narrow.\u201d <em>Md.

Counsel retained or appointed to represent a defendant shall enter an appearance in writing within five days after accepting employment, after appointment, or after the filing of the charging document in court, whichever occurs later. An appearance entered in the District Court will automatically be entered in the circuit court when a case is transferred to the circuit court because of a demand for jury trial. In any other circumstance, counsel who intends to continue representation in the circuit court after appearing in the District Court must re-enter an appearance in the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">(b) Extent of duty of appointed counsel. When counsel is appointed by the Public Defender or by the court, representation extends to all stages in the proceedings, including but not limited to custody, interrogations, preliminary hearing, pretrial motions and hearings, trial, motions for modification or review of sentence or new trial, and appeal. The Public Defender may relieve appointed counsel and substitute new counsel for the defendant without order of court by giving notice of the substitution to the clerk of the court. Representation by the Public Defender's office may not be withdrawn until the appearance of that office has been stricken pursuant to section (c) of this Rule. The representation of appointed counsel does not extend to the filing of subsequent discretionary proceedings including petition for writ of certiorari, petition to expunge records, and petition for post conviction relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">(c) Striking appearance. A motion to withdraw the appearance of counsel shall be made in writing or in the presence of the defendant in open court. If the motion is in writing, moving counsel shall certify that a written notice of intention to withdraw appearance was sent to the defendant at least ten days before the filing of the motion. If the defendant is represented by other counsel or if other counsel enters an appearance on behalf of the defendant, and if no objection is made within ten days after the motion is filed, the clerk shall strike the appearance of moving counsel. If no other counsel has entered an appearance for the defendant, leave to withdraw may be granted only by order of court. The court may refuse leave to withdraw an appearance if it would unduly delay the trial of the action, would be prejudicial to any of the parties, or otherwise would not be in the interest of justice. If leave is granted and the defendant is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>represented, a subpoena or other writ shall be issued and served on the defendant for an appearance before the court for proceedings pursuant to Rule 4-215.

Judge Thompson previously had issued an \"Order Appointing An Attorney Of the Office Of The Public Defender To Represent Indigent Defendant.\u201d Following the issuance of that Order, Deputy District Public Defender, John K. Northrop (\"Northrop\u201d) wrote a letter to Stinnett, advising him that, notwithstanding the court order, the OPD would not be representing him.

He also was aware, and influenced by the fact, based on representations from the County Bar Association, that the county attorneys would not act pro bono voluntarily. As we shall see, the trial court\u2019s duty is to determine whether a defendant is indigent and, if so, to appoint counsel. <em>See Thompson v.

That responsibility is not dependent on a county\u2019s representations with regard to the availability of funds earmarked for attorneys fees for indigent criminal defendants or the willingness of the county bar to act in such cases pro bono. Rather, \"[t]he court\u2019s obligation [is] to uphold the Constitution in the manner directed by the statute and by [the] Maryland Rule[s], and that obligation is not subject to or in any way dependent upon the level of appropriations received by the Public Defender. <em>See Bramlett v.

Office of the Atty. Gen. Md., Opinion No. 91-044, 1991 Md. AG LEXIS 54, at *2 (Oct. 4, 1991). The Attorney General opined that court-appointed attorneys, qualify as \u201cspecial officers\u201d that Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Replacement Vol.) \u00a7 2-102(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article permit courts to appoint, and, therefore, should, and ordinarily are, compensated for their services by the subdivision, county or City of Baltimore, in which the appointing court is located. He relied on \u00a7 2-102(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which provides that \"[a] special officer\u2019s fee may be taxed as costs or paid by the county.\u201d 1991 Md.

Specifically, the judges were instructed that the court, after considering the Public Defender\u2019s report, then would appoint the recommended attorney as a \"special officer,\u201d pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1991 Supp.) Section 2-102(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, rather than as a panel attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Under \u00a7 2-102(c), \"[a] special officer\u2019s fee may be taxed as costs or paid by the county.\u201d 1991 Md.

Section 2-102(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article has been interpreted by the Attorney General as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">\"Obviously, an indigent defendant, by definition, could not pay these costs even if the court chose to tax them. <em>See </em>Rule 4-353. Thus, as a practical matter, the fee for counsel appointed to represent an indigent defendant would be payable by the county whose State\u2019s Attorney brings the prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">1991 Md.

The logic of this analysis escapes me.
