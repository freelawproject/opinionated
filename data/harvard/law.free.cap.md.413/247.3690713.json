Thomas was charged with bribery, conspiracy to commit bribery, and conspiracy to commit theft by deception for his role in an alleged bid-rigging scheme relating to the award of a local government security contract. Thomas was tried in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (the \u201cCounty\u201d), and convicted on both bribery counts. On appeal, Thomas presents two questions for consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">1. Did the trial court err in instructing the jury that it is not a defense to the crime of bribery that the public employee did not have the actual authority, power, or ability to perform the act for which payment was demanded or received?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-12\">2. Did the trial court err by allowing a witness for the State to testify to his opinion regarding [Thomas\u2019s] role in the alleged bribery scheme?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Because Thomas\u2019s solicitation of a bribe was for an act reasonably related to his official capacity, and because the challenged testimony was relevant to the charge of conspiracy to commit theft by deception, we affirm Thomas\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">During the events giving rise to this case, Thomas was the Deputy Director of the Prince George\u2019s County Office of Central Services (\u201cOCS\u201d). In this capacity, he was responsible for managing the County\u2019s vehicle fleet and facilities. He was not responsible for procurement of goods and services, which were the responsibilities of another Deputy Director, Floyd Holt.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In June 2003, the County invited contractor bids for the installation of a security management system in two County buildings. The invitation to bid included a notice that the County would consider expanding the contract to cover some one hundred forty additional buildings if funding so permitted. Forney Enterprises provided the lowest bid, on June 2, 2003. The next day, however, a new Director, Pamela Piper, was appointed to head OCS, and she retracted the invitation for bids shortly thereafter. In February 2004, OCS issued a request for proposals to fulfill the security contract, and appointed a five-person proposal analysis group to review submitted proposals and recommend a selection. Any recommendation made by the group still required Piper\u2019s approval in order to take effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">On July 15, 2004, the group unanimously recommended that Forney Enterprises again be awarded the contract. The recommendation was rejected, however, after Thomas alerted Piper to a possible business relationship between Forney Enterprises and one of the group members, Corporal Keith Washington. Piper then directed interested vendors to give oral presentations on their proposals, and restructured the group, replacing two of its members with Thomas and Holt. On September 29, ADT/Tyco, the company that would ultimately receive the group\u2019s recommendation, gave its presentation. That presentation was attended by Melvin Pulley and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Dallas Evans, respectively the Director of Telecommunications and President of Interior Systems, Inc. (\u201cISI\u201d), which would act as a subcontractor on the project. Thomas did not attend that presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Following what they believed to be a successful presentation, Pulley, Evans, and others went to celebrate at a restaurant. According to Pulley, he there encountered Robert Isom, a \u201csocial Mend\u201d of his who was at the time working for the County. Isom offered to introduce Pulley to Thomas, whom he suggested \u201ccould help [ISI] win the contract.\u201d Pulley followed Isom to another restaurant, where they met Thomas. According to Pulley, Thomas told Pulley that he \u201cknew all about ISI and the contract\u201d and that \u201ceveryone on their committee worked for [Thomas]____\u201d Pulley and Thomas discussed ISI; the next day, Isom contacted Pulley, saying that Thomas \u201cwants to know if ISI and ADT will play.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pulley replied in the affirmative, \u201cas long as ISI knows what the game is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">On October 1, Isom called Pulley to arrange a lunch meeting between Thomas and Pulley. Thomas and Isom went to the same restaurant that had been the site of ISI\u2019s initial celebration, and waited for Pulley. Before Pulley arrived, Thomas told Isom that they would ask ISI for $250,000. When Pulley arrived, he met briefly with Thomas, who then directed him to Isom\u2019s table. Isom gave Pulley a piece of paper stating that Thomas could guarantee ISI the contract for $250,000, with half to be paid up front and half to be paid when the contract was awarded. The note also said that Thomas would then issue \u201cchange orders\u201d so that ISI could recoup its expenses and be able to work on the additional one hundred forty buildings that might eventually be covered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the contract. After leaving the restaurant, Pulley reported the events of the meeting to Evans. On October 4, Pulley and Evans spoke to ISPs Chief Operating Officer, William Marcel-lino, as well as to ISPs counsel and vice-president. The group collectively decided to notify the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">On October 6, Special Agent John Poliks of the Office of the State Prosecutor was assigned to investigate the case. The next day, Poliks met with Pulley, who allowed Poliks to copy a voicemail that had been left on Pulley\u2019s phone by Isom. The message contained directions from Isom for Pulley to contact him to set up a meeting with Thomas. In Poliks\u2019s presence, Pulley called Isom, to say that he had spoken with Evans, who felt that the \u201camount\u2019s a little steep.\u201d Isom replied that it was \u201cno problem\u201d and that \u201cwe just need to ... get them together.\u201d On October 14, Pulley allowed Poliks access to five new voicemails from Isom, which included a phone number for \u201cthe other Bob[,]\u201d presumably meaning Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">That same day, Evans called Thomas in Poliks\u2019s presence, saying that he was \u201ctrying to understand exactly what the deal is.\u201d Thomas replied that he \u201c[didn\u2019t] want to talk about it on the phone.... \u201d Evans asked Thomas to clarify \u201cwhat consideration [ISI would] be getting[,]\u201d to which Thomas replied in part that \u201cthere\u2019s 144 buildings ... [to] add security to,\u201d and that he was \u201cgoing to make the decision\u201d and then going to send a letter of intent to award. Later in the day, Evans called Isom, who told Evans that \u201cwhat we\u2019re talking about\u201d could be completed in twelve months. Isom added that \u201cwe understand that [the payment amount was] kind of steep ... but [Thomas] just wanted to get assurance from you.\u201d Isom further added that Thomas wanted \u201cto assure [Evans] that he\u2019s going to take you on your word[,]\u201d and that ISI should \u201cgo ahead on and sign and you\u2019ll know the job\u2019s out there for contractor [sic].\u201d Finally, Isom stated that he needed Evans\u2019s commitment because Thomas had to \u201cmake a decision today____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Under Poliks\u2019s direction, Isom and Pulley met at a Washington D.C. restaurant on October 19. The meeting was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>surveilled by Poliks and Special Agent Rick Barger. At the meeting, Isom gave Pulley an envelope containing a draft \u201cconsulting agreement,\u201d and told Pulley that once the agreement was signed, Thomas would award the security contract to ADT/Tyco. The agreement called for ISI to retain Washington Business Management Consulting Group, LLC (\u2018WCG\u201d) for a total fee of $260,000, payable in monthly installments. WCG was a consulting company belonging to Paul Wright, who had prepared the consulting agreement. Wright testified at Thomas\u2019s trial that Thomas had contacted him in October 2004 with an eye towards jointly pursuing consulting opportunities, but that he had never heard of ISI prior to these events, and that he never thought the consulting agreement was illegal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Pulley returned a \u201cmarked-up\u201d copy of the consulting agreement to Thomas at the restaurant where the two had initially met. Thomas took the envelope without opening it, and told Pulley that \u201che was going to award the contract the next day to ADT and ISI.\u201d The contract was not in fact awarded the next day, though Thomas returned the signed agreement to Wright shortly after receiving it. When the contract was not awarded, Poliks directed Pulley to arrange a meeting, through Isom, between Thomas, Pulley, and William Marcellino. The meeting was set for November 1. Prior to the meeting, the Federal Bureau of Investigation supplied Marcellino with a check for $10,000, doctored to look like an ISI check. Thomas called Wright before the meeting, however, to say that he would not attend. Instead, Marcellino met with Isom and Wright (who had by then signed the consulting agreement himself). At the meeting, Marcellino gave Wright the check as an initial payment on the consulting agreement. Isom told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Pulley and Marcellino that Thomas was \u201cgoing to release the contract that day\u201d and follow with change orders thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Despite Isom\u2019s assurances, the contract was not awarded to ADT/Tyco that day. During this period, the proposal analysis group did unanimously recommend that the security contract be awarded to ADT/Tyco, with ISI as a subcontractor on the project. The group notified Piper of its recommendation during November 2004. Poliks again asked Marcellino to arrange a meeting with Thomas, which Thomas again did not attend. That meeting, on December 6, was attended by Wright at Thomas\u2019s request. Wright gave Marcellino a copy of a recommendation memorandum from Piper to Corporal Washington, indicating that Piper had accepted the group\u2019s recommendation to award the contract to ADT/Tyco. In January 2005, Poliks made an unsuccessful attempt to meet with Wright while posing as a project manager for ISI. Wright testified that around this time he ended his business relationship with Thomas for a number of reasons. Also in January, Isom told Pulley that he was \u201cno longer part of this mess [Thomas] was doing [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">On May 24, 2005, Poliks and Barger executed search warrants for the homes and offices of Thomas, Isom, and Wright. Numerous documents relating to WCG and the consulting agreement were seized from Wright\u2019s house. Thomas, for his part, stated during the search that he had no capacity to affect bidding on contracts in the County. He also denied that he had taken the \u201cmarked-up\u201d consulting agreement from Pulley, though he admitted to doing paid accounting work for WCG. The seized documents showed that Wright had opened a business account on WCG\u2019s name on November 3, 2004, and had deposited the $10,000 check into that account. Both Thomas and Wright made withdrawals from that account, and Wright testified that he gave some or all of his withdrawals to Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Thomas was tried in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, in August 2006, on charges of bribery, conspiracy to commit bribery, and conspiracy to commit theft by deception. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>During trial, and over defense objections, Evans testified that at the time of his October 14 phone call to Thomas, he believed that Thomas had the authority to influence the awarding of contracts for the County.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to deliberations, the jury received instructions on bribery, including the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">It is not a defense to the crime of bribery that the public employee did not have the actual authority, power or ability to perform the act for which the money was demanded or received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Thomas was convicted on charges of bribery and conspiracy to commit bribery, and acquitted on charges of conspiracy to commit theft by deception. On May 11, 2007, Thomas was sentenced to twelve years in prison with all but thirty months suspended in favor of five years of supervised probation. He was also ordered to pay $10,000 restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Thomas appealed the verdict on the grounds that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that Thomas\u2019s lack of actual authority to award the contract was not a defense to bribery, and that the trial court erred in allowing Evans to testify as to his belief in Thomas\u2019s actual authority to award the contract. <em>Thomas v. State, </em>183 Md.App. 152, 166, 173, 960 A.2d 666, 674, 678 (2008). The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court on both grounds, holding that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions \u201cfairly conveyed Maryland law on bribery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 960 A.2d at 677. The intermediate appellate court further held that even if Evans\u2019s testimony was improper, Thomas suffered no harm or prejudice as a result of the testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 173-74, 960 A.2d at 678. We granted Thomas\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>both issues. <em>Thomas v. State, </em>407 Md. 529, 967 A.2d 182 (2009) (granting certiorari).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Thomas presents two issues for our consideration upon appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We will discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The Jury Instruction On Bribery</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Thomas argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on bribery because the court stated that a defendant\u2019s lack of actual authority to perform an act was not a defense to receiving or soliciting a bribe to commit that act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">An appellate court, reviewing jury instructions, will leave the judgment undisturbed so long as the instructions fairly cover the law. <em>Smith v. State, </em>403 Md. 659, 663, 944 A.2d 505, 507 (2008). We will reverse a judgment and remand for a new trial, however, where the instructions are \u201cambiguous, misleading, or confusing\u201d to jurors. <em>See Battle v. State, </em>287 Md. 675, 684-85, 414 A.2d 1266, 1271 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">In this case, our determination as to whether the instruction on bribery \u201cfairly covered the law\u201d requires interpretation of Section 9-201(c) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d), which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">A public employee may not demand or receive a bribe, fee, reward, or testimonial to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">(1) influence the performance of the official duties of the public employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>(2) neglect or fail to perform the official duties of the public employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><em>See </em>Md.Code (2002, 2008 Supp.) \u00a7 9-201(c) of the Criminal Law Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The statute does not discuss the connection between an employee\u2019s actual authority and the act for which the employee was bribed. Instead, the statute refers only to the employee\u2019s \u201cofficial duties.\u201d In this' case, therefore, we must determine if the act for which Thomas solicited a bribe, though outside of his actual authority, was sufficiently related to the performance of his official duties so as to be encompassed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Although this question is one of first impression for this Court, the Court of Special Appeals has twice before the present case held that a public employee need not have actual authority to act in a particular capacity in order to be guilty of soliciting a bribe in relation to that act. <em>See Richardson v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 324, 331-33, 492 A.2d 932, 936-37 (1985); <em>Kable v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 16, 22, 299 A.2d 493, 497 (1973). In <em>Kable, </em>for example, that court held that it was bribery for \u201ca public official [to accept money] to act corruptly in a matter to which he bears some official relation.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Likewise, several of our sister states, without explicit legislative commands on this issue, have consistently held that a public employee acting within her official capacity need not have authority to complete a specific act in order to be convicted of soliciting a bribe in connection with that act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The Supreme Court of Arizona clearly stated the rationale for interpreting bribery statutes to encompass those activities within a broad definition of an employee\u2019s official duties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC3\">The reason for making it an offense to bribe a public officer is because of its tendency to pervert justice.... An officer\u2019s conduct need not be specifically prescribed by statute in order to constitute official action, and it is sufficient that the duty exists by reason of natural implication from the powers specifically granted by statute, or by reason of the lawful custom or regulation of a department of government.... Once the gist of the crime is apparent, a strict and technical interpretation of an officer\u2019s duty becomes as senseless to logic as it is legally deplored by the weight of authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aeq\"><em>State v. Hendricks, </em>66 Ariz. 235, 186 P.2d 943, 947-48 (1947) (citations and quotation marks omitted). We view this line of authority as implicitly introducing an element of reasonableness into the determination of what are the bribed person\u2019s \u201cofficial duties.\u201d In our view, the reasonableness element involves both consideration of what an objective, outside observer would understand her duties to be, and what the public employee would expect the penal statute to proscribe, or common sense for that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Our sister states have permitted a lack of actual authority to stand as a defense only when the act that is the object of bribery is completely and utterly unrelated to a public employee\u2019s official duties. Those courts have correctly held that, under such circumstances, while it \u201cmight be morally improper and may well involve some other crime to give or offer money to [induce] an officer to do an act totally unrelated to his job, it would not be bribery.\u201d <em>Hendricks, </em>186 P.2d at 948. Thus, if a public employee accepts a payment for an act that could not reasonably be construed as related to her official duties, it cannot be considered a bribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Thomas, in his brief, argues that we should apply this rationale in holding that his solicitation here was entirely outside of his official duties. We disagree. Thomas was a member of the proposal analysis group charged with evaluating bids for the security contract. Even if he lacked the actual authority to award the contract himself, he was intimately involved in the award process as a function of his official position, and it is therefore reasonable to view his solicitation as related to his official duties. Accepting Thomas\u2019s position on this issue would mean that only the most powerful public officials, those vested with the unilateral or ultimate power to act, could be convicted under the bribery statute. This is not consonant with the text or purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Thomas\u2019s case bears a particular resemblance to <em>Raines v. State, </em>65 So.2d 558 (Fla.1953). In <em>Raines, </em>the Supreme Court of Florida held that a member of a state licensing board for barbers could be convicted of soliciting a bribe to issue a barber\u2019s license, in spite of the fact that he himself could never issue such a license without the acquiescence of other members of the licensing board.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 560. The court noted that it was \u201cwell settled that an officer cannot be charged and convicted of an act that is entirely outside the scope of his legal duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, the court upheld the bribery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>conviction, applying the rationale that the defendant\u2019s acts could fairly be termed \u201creceiv[ing] anything of value to influence the receiver\u2019s official action.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, Thomas himself was incapable of awarding the security contract, despite his blunt assertion to ISI that he possessed the power to ensure the award in exchange for illicit compensation. But with Thomas\u2019s position in the proposal analysis group, he could influence the award to be made by the Director of OCS. The combination of Thomas\u2019s official position and his statements to ISI make it reasonable to view this solicitation as related to his official duties. As such, his actions are included within our bribery statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">We hold that a public employee cannot claim as a defense to bribery the lack of actual authority to commit an act where the act is reasonably related to the employee\u2019s official duties. The trial court\u2019s jury instruction was thus a proper statement of Maryland law on bribery, and does not require a reversal of that court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Propriety of Evans\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Thomas additionally argues that it was error for the trial court to permit Evans to testify that he believed Thomas was actually capable of awarding the security contract. Thomas contends that Evans\u2019s subjective beliefs are irrelevant to all three of the charges allayed against Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\n<em>Preservation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Before reaching the substance of this issue, we must first dispense with the State\u2019s argument that \u201c[t]here is nothing in the record which suggests this basis for the petitioner\u2019s objection at the trial.\u201d The record shows that the following exchange occurred during Evans\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">THE STATE: And what did you believe, again, this date and this time; what did you believe was [Thomas\u2019s] ability to influence the awarding of the contract that you were involved in bidding on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\">THOMAS\u2019S COUNSEL: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-11\">THE COURT: Let\u2019s approach the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>[At the bench:]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">THE COURT: Do you have much more to go on this witness [Evans]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">THE STATE: I have about maybe two minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">THE COURT: His beliefs, his understandings, his perceptions are not at issue. The issue is, did this man enter into a conspiracy and accept a bribe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">THE STATE: If I may, Your Honor, I respectfully disagree insofar as it\u2019s been no secret from the beginning of the case that [it is the] defense\u2019s position that [Thomas] didn\u2019t have actual ability to influence, actual ability to do certain things. And I think it\u2019s crucial that the jury hear what these people believed [Thomas] could do the whole way. If they believed he had the ability to influence the contract, that would be why he\u2019s entering-why he\u2019s going into the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">This is also, as [co\u2014counsel] just pointed out to me, we\u2019re talking about conspiracy to commit theft by deception. This is evidence of his intent to deceive, as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">THE COURT: Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-11\">THE STATE: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-12\">THE COURT: You can ask the questions, but let\u2019s get it to a close.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">What we deduce from the colloquy above is that the trial court\u2019s initial reaction to the testimony offered by the State was that the testimony was not relevant because Evans\u2019s understanding or beliefs were not relevant to the question of whether Thomas accepted a bribe. The State countered with two theories of relevancy, and the trial judge then stated that he would allow the testimony, apparently accepting one or both of those theories. This Court ordinarily will not consider any issue on review unless it has been raised in or decided by the trial court. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a). Grounds for objection, however, need not be stated unless so directed by the trial court or on a party\u2019s own initiative. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-323(a)-(c). In this case, Thomas\u2019s objection was a general one, and thus preserved all available grounds, including the arguments he now presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>\n<em>Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Thomas argues that Evans\u2019s testimony should not have been admitted because it was not relevant to the charges against him. He also contends that the testimony was lay opinion that does not qualify under Maryland Rule 5-701, which governs opinion testimony by lay witnesses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">To determine whether there was error in the admission of Evans\u2019s testimony, we consider the purposes for which it was admitted. Although the trial court did not indicate any basis for its decision to admit Evans\u2019s testimony, it decided to do so after the State offered two theories of relevancy, which are stated above. We begin and end with the State\u2019s second theory-that Evans\u2019s testimony was relevant to the charge of conspiracy to commit theft by deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Section 7-104 of the Criminal Law Article makes it a crime to \u201cobtain control over property by willfully or knowingly using deception----\u201d C.L. \u00a7 7\u2014104(b). Section 7-101 of the Criminal Law Article defines \u201cdeception,\u201d in part, as knowingly \u201cfailing] to correct a false impression that the offender previously has created or confirmed____\u201d C.L. \u00a7 7\u2014101(b)(ii). Applying these definitions, we consider it clear that Evans\u2019s testimony was relevant to the charge of conspiracy to commit theft by deception. As the State indicates in its brief, Thomas told Evans that he was \u201cgoing to make the decision\u201d during the phone call that was the subject of Evans\u2019s testimony. It is indisputable that Thomas made this statement, as the phone call was recorded by Poliks\u2014at trial, the recording was played in open court, and a transcript of the call was admitted as an exhibit. The fact-finder could conclude that Thomas endeavored to create a false impression in Evans\u2019s mind that Thomas had the capacity to award the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Indeed, Thomas\u2019s fraudulent intent is suggested by his defense that he had no authority to award the contract, when there was evidence that Thomas told Evans the exact opposite, i.e., that he was going to make the contract award decision almost immediately. In this context Evans\u2019s testimony was admissible not to prove that Thomas actually had the authority to award the contract, but that Thomas said that he did, intending to deceive Evans. Evans\u2019s belief in Thomas\u2019s abilities to influence the contract is relevant in that it helps to demonstrate the shrewdness of Thomas\u2019s deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Thomas also argues that Evans\u2019s testimony was lay opinion evidence in violation of Maryland Rule 5-701. We do not agree. Evans\u2019s testimony that he believed Thomas had that authority is not a lay opinion, because it was admitted not to show that Thomas actually had any authority. Rather, the testimony simply demonstrated the skillfulness that Thomas brought to bear on his deception of Evans.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Because Evans\u2019s belief in Thomas\u2019s authority to deliver the security contract was relevant to the charge of conspiracy to commit theft by deception, the trial court did not err in permitting Evans to testify on that matter. Thomas could have sought an instruction limiting the use of Evans\u2019s testimony to the bribery charges alone. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-105. There is no indication that he did so. Thus, we need not decide if Evans\u2019s testimony was also admissible with respect to the bribery charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">We hold that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction on bribery was sufficient because it fairly described Maryland law on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>bribery\u2014namely, that it was not a defense to bribery that Thomas lacked the actual authority to perform an act. Because the act to be performed was reasonably related to Thomas\u2019s official duties, the bribery convictions will stand. We also hold that the admission of Evans\u2019s testimony was not in error, because Evans\u2019s beliefs with respect to Thomas\u2019s actual authority were relevant to the charge of conspiracy to commit theft by deception. The judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Isom eventually pled guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery, and testified at Thomas\u2019s trial in exchange for a reduced sentence. His description of these events differs in that he claims that he spoke to Evans, and not Pulley, at the first restaurant, and that it was Evans who suggested a meeting with Thomas. Nonetheless, Isom confirmed in his testimony that he called Pulley the next day, at Thomas's request, to \"see if ISI would play.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\">. Wright was charged with bribery, conspiracy to commit bribery, and conspiracy to commit theft in connection with these events. He was acquitted on all counts prior to Thomas\u2019s trial. His testimony against Thomas came as part of an agreement to cooperate in an ongoing public corruption investigation in exchange for transactional, use, and derivative use immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">. Specifically, Thomas objected to the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">[THE STATE:] And what did you believe, again, this date and this time; what did you believe was [Thomas's] ability to influence the awarding of the contract that you were involved in bidding on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">[EVANS:] As [Thomas was] Deputy Director of Contracts and Procurement, I believed that the position can have influence over or does influence or would influence the awarding of a contract.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-14\">. The questions presented for review are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-15\">1. Did the trial court err in instructing the jury that it is not a defense to the crime of bribery that the public employee did not have the actual authority, power, or ability to perform the act for which payment was demanded or received?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-16\">2. Did the trial court err by allowing a witness for the State to testify to his opinion regarding [Thomas\u2019s] role in the alleged bribery scheme?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\">.

The Florida statute on bribery, <em>see </em>Florida Statutes \u00a7 838.02 (1953), at the time was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">838.02 Officer accepting bribe.\u2014Every officer, state, county or municipal, or any public appointee, or any deputy of any such officer or appointee, who corruptly accepts, requests or solicits a gift or gratuity, or a promise to make a gift, or do an act beneficial to such officer, public appointee or deputy, under an agreement or with an understanding that his vote, opinion or judgment shall be given in any particular manner or upon a particular aside of any question, cause or proceeding which is or may be by law brought before him, in his official capacity, or that in such capacity he shall make any particular nomination or appointment, shall forfeit his office or appointment, be forever disqualified to hold any public office, trust or appointment under the constitution or laws of this state, and be punished by imprisonment in the state prison not exceeding ten years, or in the county jail not exceeding one year, or by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b287-11\">. Rule 5-701 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-12\">If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness\u2019s testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019s testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\">. Even if we were to treat Evans's testimony as lay opinion, it likely would meet the criteria of Rule 5-701. His testimony that he believed Evans had the authority to award the contract is the direct product of Evans\u2019s personal perceptions (his phone conversation with Thomas), and is relevant to understanding part of his testimony (the false impression that Thomas created). Evans's testimony thus meets both requirements of Rule 5-701.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
