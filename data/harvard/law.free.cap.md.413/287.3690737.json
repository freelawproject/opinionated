The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in a reported opinion, <em>Henriquez v. Henriquez, </em>185 Md.App. 465, 971 A.2d 345 (2009), and we granted certiorari, <em>Henriquez v. Henriquez, </em>410 Md. 165, 978 A.2d 245 (2009), to address the following question,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which we have compressed and rephrased for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Whether an award of counsel fees directly to a non-profit legal services organization that represented a prevailing party, on a pro bono basis originally, in a child custody matter, is appropriate pursuant to Section 12-103 of the Family Law Article, Maryland Code (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol.)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARqA\">We shall hold that the plain meaning of Section 12-103 permits an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, consistent with consideration of the statutory factors, when the prevailing party receives pro bono legal representation from a non-profit legal services organization, and that the award may be made directly to the legal services organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Ana and Jose Henriquez were married in El Salvador on April 18, 1998. They had two children during the marriage, Ana, born in 1998, and Jessica, born in 2000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In December of 2005, Mrs. Henriquez filed a Complaint for Absolute Divorce in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, requesting \u201csole legal and physical custody\u201d of the children, \u201ctemporary and permanent child support,\u201d as well as \u201creasonable counsel fees and costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Judge Durke G. Thompson bifurcated the proceedings, considering issues of custody, visitation, and child support on January 8 and 9, 2007, first, prior to exploring the grounds for divorce and property disposition matters. During the custody, visitation, and child support phase of the trial, counsel for Mrs. Henriquez introduced an itemized bill entitled \u201cAttorney\u2019s Fees for Custody, Visitation and Support Issues Only,\u201d documenting legal work on her behalf undertaken by the House of Ruth amounting to 58.34 hours, at $200 per hour, for a total of $11,668. Counsel for Mr. Henriquez objected to the introduction of the bill for attorneys\u2019 fees, because the House of Ruth agreed to represent Mrs. Henriquez on a pro bono basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">At the conclusion of the custody, child support, and visitation phase of the trial, Judge Thompson awarded Mrs. Henri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>quez sole physical custody of the children and ordered Mr. Henriquez to pay child support. Judge Thompson also awarded attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $5,000 to the House of Ruth for legal work on Mrs. Henriquez\u2019s behalf regarding custody, visitation, and support issues, explaining his decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">The Court also believes that there should be some award of fees for representation given that essentially Mrs. Henriquez is wholly dependent and went to a community services organization for her representation. She\u2019s virtually penniless as far as I can tell. Mr. Henriquez makes what he makes. Any payment to counsel obviously goes out of the family pocket and into, into counsel\u2019s pocket. Mr. Henriquez has made a payment of $5,000 to [his attorney]. I think that represents an exceptionally reasonable amount and I make an award of a similar amount to, for counsel fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">The award of fees to the plaintiff are for the purposes of costs and to whatever extent attorneys\u2019 fees have been expended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">which was later reduced to an order stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">ORDERED, that the Defendant shall pay to the Plaintiffs counsel, the House of Ruth Domestic Violence Legal Clinic, the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for attorney\u2019s fees</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Mr. Henriquez noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed in a reported opinion, <em>Henriquez v. Henriquez, </em>185 Md.App. 465, 478-79, 971 A.2d 345, 353-54 (2009), holding that Section 12-103 contains \u201cno <em>per se </em>bar to awarding attorney\u2019s fees to a party who is represented by a non-profit organization that provides the party with free legal representation,\u201d relying in part on a finding that a majority of states have held that providers of pro bono legal representation are eligible to receive fee awards in domestic relations matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We are asked to interpret a fee shifting statute in the family law arena, to resolve the question of whether attorneys\u2019 fees to a prevailing party in a child custody and support proceeding can be ordered to be paid directly to a non-profit, legal services organization that provides pro bono representation to the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We generally adhere to the \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in which each party is responsible for its own legal fees, regardless of who wins in the litigation. <em>See Friolo v. Frankel, </em>403 Md. 443, 456, 942 A.2d 1242, 1250 (2008), citing <em>Montgomery v. E. Corr. Inst., </em>377 Md. 615, 637, 835 A.2d 169, 183 (2003); <em>see also Hess Constr. Co. v. Bd. of Educ. of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>341 Md. 155, 159, 669 A.2d 1352, 1354 (1996). Fee shifting, an exception to the American rule, whereby a court orders payment of the prevailing party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees by the losing side, may be accomplished by an express agreement or by statute. <em>Friolo, </em>403 Md. at 456, 942 A.2d at 1250; <em>see also Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 566, 592, 735 A.2d 1081, 1095 (1999) (\u201cMaryland law has never recognized fee shifting ... absent contractual provision, statute, or rule.\u201d). <em>See also Nova Research, Inc. v. Penske Truck Leasing Co., </em>405 Md. 435, 445 &amp; n. 3, 952 A.2d 275, 281 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (2008) (describing additional bases for fee shifting).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">In terms of pro bono legal service, we have emphasized the importance of such activities by the profession and have attempted to increase the availability of free or reduced fees for legal representation of indigent individuals throughout our State.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rule 6.1 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>duct, in which an aspirational goal of fifty hours of annual pro bono service by all attorneys is encouraged,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as well as Rule 16-903,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requiring mandatory reporting of pro bono hours, fortified by the adoption recently of the Ideals of Professional<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ism,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> reflect this commitment. Approximately one million Marylanders satisfy eligibility for pro bono legal services, yet \u201c[b]ecause of inadequate resources, legal services providers must reject thousands of compelling cases,\u201d especially in the area of family law. <em>See </em>Standing Committee of the Court of Appeals on Pro Bono Legal Service, <em>State Action Plan and Report, </em>at 5, 11 (2006) (\u201cFamily law cases consistently overwhelm the legal services delivery system and pro bono programs. Contested cases are the most difficult to place because they are time consuming and the pool of experienced family law practitioners is relatively small.\u201d), <em>available at </em>http://www.mdcourts.gov/probono/pdfs/stateactionplanl2-1806.pdf (last visited Apr. 9, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Within this framework, we consider the award of $5,000 to the House of Ruth,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> who represented Mrs. Henriquez on a pro bono basis during the child custody and support proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Our focus in the present case is the language of Section 12-103, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014The court may award to either party the costs and counsel fees that are just and proper under all the circumstances in any case in which a person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">(1) applies for a decree or modification of a decree concerning the custody, support, or visitation of a child of the parties; \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">(b) <em>Required </em>considerations.\u2014Before a court may award costs and counsel fees under this section, the court shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>(1) the financial status of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">(2) the needs of each party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">(3) whether there was substantial justification for bringing, maintaining, or defending the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Mr. Henriquez argues that the award of attorneys\u2019 fees was improper as a matter of law, contending that Section 12-103 authorizes an award of attorneys\u2019 fees only when a party actually incurs expenses for legal representation, defining \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d as \u201cthe <em>charge to a client for services performed for the client, </em>such as an hourly fee, a flat fee, or a contingent fee,\u201d quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 148 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis in original). He emphasizes that Mrs. Henriquez did not actually incur any counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Mrs. Henriquez counters that the word \u201cincurred\u201d does not even appear anywhere in the language of Section 12-103 and submits that \u201c[attorney\u2019s fees are simply monies due to an attorney for legal services rendered,\u201d and that nothing in the mandatory factors set forth in Section 12-103 \u201crequires a court to consider the status of the legal services rendered or whether a litigant actually owes fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">In interpreting this statutory language in issue, we recognize that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">In construing the plain language, \u201c[a] court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u201d Statutory text \u201c \u2018should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d The plain language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation. Rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole and attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">If statutory language is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then we give effect to the statute as it is written. \u201cIf there is no ambiguity in that language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends; we do not need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction, for \u2018the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\"><em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 613-14, 937 A.2d 242, 257-58 (2007), quoting <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576-77, 870 A.2d 186, 193-94 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The plain meaning of Section 12-103 permits the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in the present case, because \u201ccounsel fees\u201d are limited only to that which \u201care just and proper under all the circumstances.\u201d The only other statutory mandate that restricts a court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees is contained in Section 12-103(b), which enumerates considerations a court must weigh before awarding fees, to include (1) the financial status of each party, (2) the needs of each party, and (3) whether there was substantial justification for bringing or defending the proceeding. <em>See Petrini v. Petrini, </em>336 Md. 453, 468, 648 A.2d 1016, 1022 (1994) (\u201cConsideration of the statutory criteria is mandatory in making the award and failure to do so constitutes legal error.\u201d); <em>see also Carroll County v. Edelmann, </em>320 Md. 150, 177, 577 A.2d 14, 27 (1990). There is no language restricting an award to fee paying clients; in fact the considerations of financial status and need belie the necessity that an attorney must have been remunerated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Mr. Henriquez\u2019s interpretation of the statute, however, would require that we insert, after the statutory phrase \u201ccosts and counsel fees,\u201d the word \u201cincurred.\u201d This Court, however, has repeatedly stated that \u201c[w]e will not ... judicially insert language [into a statute] to impose exceptions, limitations, or restrictions not set forth by the legislature.\u201d <em>St. Joseph Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Cardiac Surgery Assocs., P.A., </em>392 Md. 75, 95, 896 A.2d 304, 316 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original); <em>see also Nesbit v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 65, 75, 854 A.2d 879, 885 (2004) (\u201cWe will not divine a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute or judicially insert language to impose exceptions, limitations or restrictions not set forth by the legislature.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 477, 842 A.2d 743, 746 (2004) (\u201c[W]e will not add or delete words from the statute.\u201d). \u201cIncurred\u201d is just not included in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Mr. Henriquez, nevertheless, emphasizes that \u201cattorney\u2019s fee\u201d has been defined as \u201cthe <em>charge to a client for services performed for the client,\u201d </em>referring to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 148 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis in original). We have previously indicated, however, that a \u201cdictionary definition is not dispositive of the meaning of a statutory term,\u201d <em>Comptroller v. Science Applications Int\u2019l Corp., </em>405 Md. 185, 202, 950 A.2d 766, 776 (2008), citing <em>Ishola v. State, </em>404 Md. 155, 161, 945 A.2d 1273, 1276 (2008), because \u201cdictionaries provide possible meanings, not dispositive resolutions.\u201d <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 606, 573 A.2d 1346, 1350 (1990), quoting Comment, <em>Jurisprudence by Webster\u2019s: The Role of the Dictionary in Legal Thought, </em>39 Mercer L.Rev. 961, 963 (1988). In this regard, as noted at oral argument, other dictionaries have no such mention of a \u201ccharge to a client,\u201d such as Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary, which defines \u201cattorney\u2019s fee\u201d as \u201c[a]n allowance made by the court as costs in addition to the ordinary statutory costs.\u201d Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary 109 (3rd ed. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">He also refers us to the case of <em>Patronelli v. Patronelli </em>175 N.C.App. 320, 623 S.E.2d 322 (2006), in which the North Carolina intermediate appellate court relied upon this definition to deny a wife attorneys\u2019 fees in a domestic relations matter, in which she was represented on a pro bono basis. In so doing, the court opined, \u201ccounsel fees cannot, by definition, be implicated in the present case where the dependent spouse never incurred counsel expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Mr. Henriquez, however, fails to note that in subsequent appellate history, the North Carolina Supreme Court rejected the reasoning of its intermediate appellate court, relying instead on the plain meaning of the fee shifting statute in issue, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">At any time that a dependent spouse would be entitled to alimony ... or postseparation support ... the court may, upon application of such spouse, enter an order for reasonable counsel fees <em>for the benefit of such spouse, </em>to be paid and secured by the supporting spouse in the same manner as alimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>Patronelli v. Patronelli, </em>360 N.C. 628, 636 S.E.2d 559, 560 (2006) (emphasis in original). The court determined that Mrs. Patronelli \u201cwould have not benefitted in any way from an award of counsel fees,\u201d because she was not financially obligated to her attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 562. Our statute differs significantly from that of North Carolina, because it makes no mention of \u201cfor the benefit of [a dependent] spouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Finally, Mr. Henriquez asserts that prior to the enactment of fee shifting statutes in the family law area, reimbursement for receipt of a gratuity was not permitted in the marital arena, citing <em>Mason v. Mason, </em>181 Md. 666, 30 A.2d 748 (1943), so that analogously, Mrs. Henriquez could not have been awarded attorneys\u2019 fees when she did not incur any expense for legal fees. In <em>Mason, </em>we upheld the denial of alimony pendente lite to Lela Drucilla Mason, after consideration of factors similar to those found in Section 12-103. We reasoned that Mrs. Mason was employed earning \u201c$7 or $8 a week\u201d and was living with her brother-in-law where she \u201cwas not required to pay any board,\u201d while Mr. Mason, her husband, owned a modest farm, \u201cwas without any other financial means,\u201d and was unable to work steadily because of poor health. Clearly, in <em>Mason, </em>we emphasized the balance of the parties\u2019 financial resources, rather than merely Mrs. Mason\u2019s gratuitous receipt of room and board. Here, the Circuit Court also engaged in balancing under Section 12-103, finding that Mrs. Henriquez was \u201cwholly dependent\u201d and \u201cvirtually penniless,\u201d warranting an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, given Mr. Henriquez\u2019s financial ability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Therefore, we conclude that Section 12-103 permits an award of counsel fees when a prevailing party initially receives legal representation from a non-profit legal services organization on a pro bono basis, as here. As aptly noted by our intermediate appellate court, \u201cpursuant to the plain language of the statute, there is no <em>per se </em>bar to awarding attorney\u2019s fees to a party who is represented by a non-profit organization that provides the party with free legal representation.\u201d <em>Henriquez, </em>185 Md.App. at 478, 971 A.2d at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We turn now to whether the Circuit Court for Montgomery County properly awarded attorneys\u2019 fees directly to the House of Ruth. Mr. Henriquez asserts that Section 12-103(a) imparts counsel fees to a \u201cparty and not the attorney or for the use of the attorney,\u201d and that if Mrs. Henriquez received $5,000 she would receive a windfall. Mrs. Henriquez counters that an award of counsel fees, directly to the House of Ruth, avoids this allegation of windfall and comports with the reasoning of a majority of jurisdictions that have considered the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Mr. Henriquez essentially asserts that because Sections 7-107,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 8-214,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and 11-110<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of the Family Law Article, Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>land Code (1984, 2006 RepLVol.), expressly permit a prevailing party fee award to be paid directly to an attorney, that Section 12-103 must prohibit such an award to be paid to the attorney, rather than to a party.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Section 12-103 does not contain language that provides for payment of attorneys\u2019 fees directly to an attorney, as in Sections 7-107, 8-214, and 11-110. Nevertheless, these statutes comprise one family law scheme and are in <em>pari materia </em>so that they are construed \u201cby reference to other statutes dealing with the same subject.\u201d <em>Willis v.

In that case, we interpreted the meaning of the verb \u201capprehended\u201d in Section 10-303 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 1984 RepLVol.), which governed the timing of administering a blood alcohol test, in reference to the verb \u201cdetained\u201d in Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article, Maryland Code (1977, 1981 Supp.), dealing with the procedure for administering such a test. In doing so, we recognized the value of cohesively interpreting statutes having the same object, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">Harmonizing these statutory provisions in this manner avoids needless conflict between statutes having the same object: the identification and removal of drunk drivers from Maryland\u2019s highways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 376, 488 A.2d at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Similarly, Section 12-103 must be construed in harmony with Sections 7-107, 8-214, and 11-110, governing fee shifting in divorce, marital property disposition, and alimony matters, respectively. To do otherwise would foster the illogical result of permitting an award of fees directly to an attorney when a party prevails in a divorce proceeding on fault grounds, or when a party obtains a monetary award and could then pay the attorney, or when a party receives alimony, but not permitting an award of fees directly to an attorney in a determination of physical custody of children, in which each party \u201chas equal constitutional rights to parent\u201d and at stake is the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the children. <em>See McDermott v. Dougherty, </em>385 Md. 320, 354, 869 A.2d 751, 771 (2005); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>also Ricketts v. Ricketts, </em>393 Md. 479, 501, 903 A.2d 857, 869-70 (2006), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In so holding, we find succor in cases similar to the case <em>sub judice, </em>from sister jurisdictions interpreting statutory provisions analogous to Section 12-103. In <em>Pearson v. Pearson, </em>200 W.Va. 139, 488 S.E.2d 414 (1997), the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia considered Ms. Pearson\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees in a divorce action, which was denied by the circuit court, because she was represented by the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund, a non-profit legal services organization. <em>Id. </em>at 425. Ms. Pearson further contended that \u201cshe was inhibited from effectively prosecuting her divorce,\u201d because she relied upon free legal services and sought an award of counsel fees personally. The court interpreted a fee shifting provision that did not expressly provide for an award of counsel fees directly to an attorney, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">The court may compel either party to pay attorney\u2019s fees and court costs reasonably necessary to enable the other party to prosecute or defend the action in the trial court. The question of whether or not a party is entitled to temporary alimony is not decisive of that party\u2019s right to a reasonable allowance of attorney\u2019s fees and court costs....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIH\"><em>Id. </em>at 425-26 n. 12. In determining that attorneys\u2019 fees in a divorce proceeding \u201cmay be awarded to a party who received free legal aid services or pro bono legal representation,\u201d the court concluded that \u201csuch an award is to compensate and reimburse for legal services rendered and shall not be paid to the litigant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426; <em>see also Benavides v. Benavides, </em>11 Conn.App. 150, 526 A.2d 536, 539 n. 2 (1987) (reasoning that \u201c[t]o avoid a windfall to the plaintiff, the award of attorney\u2019s fees should be made directly to the organization providing the legal services,\u201d interpreting Conn. GemStat. \u00a7 46b-62, which provided that \u201cthe court may order either spouse to pay the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of the other\u201d); <em>Miller v. Wilfong, </em>121 Nev. 619, 119 P.3d 727, 730-31 (2005) (determining an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to pro bono counsel was proper, reasoning that \u201c[t]o impose the burden of the cost of litigation on those who volunteer their services, when the other party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>has the means to pay attorney fees, would be unjust,\u201d considering Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 126.171, which stated that \u201c[in paternity actions,] [t]he court may order reasonable fees of counsel ... to be paid by the parties in proportions and at times determined by the court\u201d (alterations in original)); <em>Olson v.

Mr. Henriquez does not challenge the reasonableness of the fee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\">. Mr. Henriquez argues that payment of attorneys\u2019 fees should be analogized to a husband's obligation at common law to provide his wife with necessaries, referring us to <em>Sterling v. Sterling, </em>145 Md. 631, 643-44, 125 A. 809, 813 (1924), <em>Hood v. Hood, </em>138 Md. 355, 360, 113 A. 895, 897 (1921), <em>Chappell </em>v. <em>Chappell, </em>86 Md. 532, 536, 39 A. 984, 986 (1898), as well as early common law cases from other jurisdictions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Pursuant to the necessaries doctrine, \"the husband had a legal duty to supply his wife with necessaries suitable to their station in life,\u201d <em>Condore v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>289 Md. 516, 520-21, 425 A.2d 1011, 1013 (1981), citing <em>Ewell </em>v. <em>State, </em>207 Md. 288, 114 A.2d 66 (1955); <em>Coastal Tank Lines, Inc. v.

In so arguing, Mr. Henriquez appears to be saying that fee shifting in the context of the wife prevailing in a lawsuit was solely predicated on the necessaries doctrine. That is not the case, first, because Section 12-103, as well as its predecessor, Section 5A of Article 16, Maryland Code (1957, 1966 Repl.Vol., 1967 Supp.), use gender neutral language, and second, because fee shifting statutes in other arenas were enacted prior to Section 5A of Article 16, so, obviously, the Legislature had other bases to shift fees. At least two fee shifting statutes predated the enactment of Section 5A of Article 16, Maryland Code (1957, 1966 Repl.Vol., 1967 Supp.). <em>See Shulton v. Rubin, </em>239 Md. 669, 686-87, 212 A.2d 476, 486 (1965) (interpreting The Maryland Securities Act, Section 34(a)(2) of Article 32A, Maryland Code (1957, 1964 Supp.), which enabled a buyer of a security who was misled by the seller to recover \"reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d); <em>see also U.S. Elec.

Roosevelt, </em>170 Md.App. 572, 907 A.2d 885 (2006), for the proposition that only expenses personally incurred by a spouse are compensable under Section 12-103.

At issue in that case was whether Ms. Roosevelt could recover a $200,000 fine against Mr. Corapcioglu, as well as $252,930 in \"fees and costs,\u201d both based upon her significant expenditures in reuniting with her son. <em>Id. </em>at 609, 907 A.2d at 907.
