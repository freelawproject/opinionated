Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County ruled that the police did not comply with the requirement of <em>Miranda </em>that a suspect be properly advised of the right to counsel that attends custodial interrogation. The Circuit Court granted Respondent\u2019s motion to suppress the statement he gave to the police following what the court ruled was a constitutionally defective advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The State challenged the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling by filing an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Maryland Code (2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-302(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Upon its independent review of the suppression ruling, the Court of Special Appeals agreed with the Circuit Court that the police had violated <em>Miranda </em>and affirmed the suppression order. <em>State v. Luckett, </em>188 Md.App. 399, 981 A.2d 835 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">We granted the State\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. We now affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Respondent stands charged by indictment with two counts each of first-degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. He filed a motion to suppress three statements he had made to the police, only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>last of which is the subject of this appeal. The four-day hearing <em>on </em>the suppression motion was followed by the Circuit Court\u2019s issuance of a written opinion denying the motion as to the first and second statements and granting the motion with respect to the third statement. We adopt portions of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 recitation of the facts underlying the crimes, the suppression motion, and the Circuit Court\u2019s decision: <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">On August 2, 2007, Tunja Luckett, Respondent\u2019s wife, was found dead of a gunshot wound at the couple\u2019s Fort Washington home. On that same day, John Scales was shot to death at his barbershop in Clinton. On August 3, charges were filed against Respondent, charging him with both murders. Respondent himself, however, was not yet apprehended. On August 4, Prince George\u2019s County Police Officer Stephen Fox responded to the Southern Avenue Metro Station, where Respondent had reportedly leaped backward from the Metro platform directly into the path of an oncoming train.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">Respondent was pulled from the tracks and rushed by helicopter to the Prince George\u2019s County Hospital. Both legs were crushed and, in the course of two operations over the next two days, both of Respondent\u2019s legs were amputated. In his meticulously thorough 14-page Opinion of the Court, [the suppression hearing judge] began with a summary that made this bizarre string of events comprehensible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">The state essentially alleges that Mr. Luckett believed that his wife was having an affair with his son\u2019s football coach. Mr. Luckett is alleged to have killed his wife and after doing so, gone to the football coach\u2019s place of business, a barber shop, and proceeded to kill the football coach on August 2, 2007. On August 4, 2007 having what can best be described as \u201cshooter\u2019s remorse,\u201d Mr. Luckett <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>attempted to take his life in two ways. First, he slit his wrists. Failing in that attempt, Mr. Luckett went to a Metro station a little after two in the afternoon and threw himself in front of a moving Metro train.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The First Statement to Officer Fox</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">When he first arrived at the hospital, Respondent spontaneously spoke to Officer Fox, who had accompanied him to the hospital from the Metro station. Respondent volunteered to Officer Fox that he had not meant to kill his wife but that he had meant to kill Scales, because he believed that Scales was having an affair with his (Respondent\u2019s) wife. Respondent referred to Scales as his \u201cenemy\u201d and said that he had wanted to kill Scales for eight and a half months. Respondent further stated that after he shot Scales, he threw the gun out of the car window. He also stated that after the shootings, he tried to slit his wrists because he did not want to go to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">[The Circuit Court] ruled that Respondent\u2019s statements to Officer Fox were totally spontaneous and were not in response to any interrogation. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>therefore, did not apply. <em>Smith v. State, </em>186 Md.App. 498, 520-22, 974 A.2d 991 (2009). The judge ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">There is no evidence that either officer interrogated or came close to interrogating Mr. Luckett in any way. These statements were volunteered by Mr. Luckett. \u201cVolunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The correctness of that ruling is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The Second Series of Statements to Detective Selway</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">On the next day, August 5, Detective Brian Selway, of the Homicide Division, took over the duty of being posted as guard at Respondent\u2019s hospital room. He came on duty at 7 A.M. Respondent awoke between 10:15 and 10:20 A.M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>and immediately started talking. [The] Opinion of Court again well summarized Detective Selway\u2019s initial concern and his observations with respect thereto[:]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">Det. Selway was concerned with Mr. Luckett\u2019s level of alertness and asked him questions such as who the President of the United States was and what the Detective\u2019s first name was. Answering correctly, Det. Selway observed Mr. Luckett to be alert and responsive. Mr. Luckett also answered questions of hospital personnel and was aware of his surroundings. Selway watched as Mr. Luckett joked with the hospital staff when they came into the room to monitor his medicines. Through the conversation Mr. Luckett revealed that he was aware an arrest warrant had been issued for him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">At 10:33 A.M. Detective Selway read Respondent his <em>Miranda </em>warnings from the small business card he carried in his wallet----</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer and to have him with you during questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you before a statement is taken, if you wish. If you decide to give a statement, you still have the right to stop at any time so you may talk to a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Respondent waived those rights by saying, \u201cI understand.\u201d From then until 2:20 P.M., Detective Selway simply listened as Respondent talked. Respondent reaffirmed that he believed that his wife had been having an affair with their son\u2019s football coach. He repeated his earlier statements to Officer Fox that he did not mean to kill his wife and that he threw the gun away after shooting Scales at the barbershop. He also told Detective Selway that he kept a journal under the mattress in his bedroom, and he asked Detective Selway to retrieve it. At approximately 2:15 P.M. a District Court Commissioner arrived at Respondent\u2019s intensive care room. Respondent, in Detective Selway\u2019s presence, told the Commissioner, \u201cI know what I did was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>wrong.\u201d Respondent then asked, \u201cIs there any way I can get off the death penalty?\u201d The Commissioner responded that she could not give legal advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">[The Circuit Court\u2019s] primary concern with respect to those statements was whether Respondent was in a sufficiently lucid state 1) to make a free and voluntary confession and 2) to make a free and voluntary waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. [The court] found that Respondent was lucid and rational and ruled that the motion to suppress those statements would, therefore, be denied[:]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">[T]he Court finds Detective Selway to be believable and places great weight on his testimony. Although Det. Selway was initially concerned about Mr. Luckett\u2019s state of mind, he concluded [that] Mr. Luckett was lucid after asking him non-interrogational questions. The Court finds that Mr. Luckett understood what he was saying and was not improperly coerced by Detective Selway into giving these statements. The Court concludes that the statements made to Detective Selway and the statement made in the presence of the Commissioner, Detective Selway and Detective Codero was made freely and voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The Third Statement to Detective Barba</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">This appeal by the State is taken only from [the Circuit Court\u2019s] decision to suppress a third statement, given by Respondent to Detective Matthew Barba on August 13, 2007. Detective Barba briefly visited Respondent in his hospital room on August 8, identified himself as the lead investigator in the two homicides with which Respondent was charged, dropped off a business card, and said that he would be back on another day. Detective Barba returned on August 13 with audio/video equipment and a technician with the hope of conducting a videotaped interview with Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\"><em>Luckett, </em>188 Md.App. at 405-09, 981 A.2d at 838-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">The Circuit Court recited in its written opinion what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>On August 13, 2007, at 12:35 p.m. Detective Barba along with Michael Coatley, an audio technician, arrived at Mr. Luckett\u2019s hospital room. After identifying himself Detective Barba stated that Mr. Luckett immediately engaged in conversation with him asking him if he had found the tapes. Detective Barba was unsure as to what Mr. Luckett was asking. Barba indicated that he would \u201chelp him out\u201d but that he needed to get a waiver first. Barba advised Luckett that he had certain rights. Mr. Luckett asked about his kids, his mother and grandmother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">With equipment set up, at approximately 12:52 p.m. Detective Barba began reading Mr. Luckett his rights under <em>Miranda v. </em>Arizonal:]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">DETECTIVE BARBA: Like, like I said, I\u2019m not here, I\u2019m here to help.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">MR.

All right, this is an advice of rights and waivers form, right here okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">MR. LUCKETT:\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">DETECTIVE BARBA: I\u2019m going to show it to you afterward. You want to move your thing up a little bit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWR\">MR. LUCKETT: Yeah, let me see that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">DETECTIVE BARBA: Okay.

LUCKETT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\">DETECTIVE BARBA: You have the right to remain silent, if you choose to give up this right, anything that you say can be used against you in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-15\">MR.

You have the right to talk to a lawyer before you are asked any questions to have a lawyer present with you while you\u2019re being questioned, that\u2019s about this case specifically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-17\">MR.

LUCKETT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-20\">At the end of that discussion, Respondent gave a lengthy statement describing his belief that his wife had been having an affair with Mr. Scales, his activities during the months leading up to the murders, and the murders themselves. Respondent repeated his earlier statements to the police that he did not mean to kill his wife but he did intend to kill Mr. Scales. Respondent said that he knew what he had done was wrong, and he was willing to \u201caccept my punishment and be accountable for my actions.\u201d He stated that he hoped Detective Barba would not \u201cthrow the book at me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>In its written opinion, the Circuit Court set forth Respondent\u2019s arguments for why the videotaped statement to Detective Barba should be suppressed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">Mr. Luckett\u2019s counsel argues that Detective Barba\u2019s advice is defective in two respects: 1. The five-word statement of \u201cyou don\u2019t need a lawyer\u201d is false and not a correct statement of the law. 2. The offer to help in presenting the case, the promise to help and the promise to investigate are violation[s] of <em>Hillard v. State, </em>141 Md.App. 199, 784 A.2d 1134 (2001).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The Circuit Court addressed the \u201cyou don\u2019t need a lawyer\u201d argument first:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">Detective Barba\u2019s statement \u201cyou don\u2019t need a lawyer\u201d is not a correct recitation of the law and should never be spoken by any law enforcement officer to a person in custody under any circumstances. These words were related to Mr. Luckett two times in the videotape and according to Detective Barba, stated at least two other times. It appears from Detective Barba\u2019s statement that he may have stated the same words before the tape was turned on as well. Any statement that could possibly lead the defendant to misconstrue his rights under <em>Miranda </em>is contrary to the law requiring a knowing and voluntary waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The Circuit Court also noted that Detective Barba should have known that <em>anything </em>Respondent might say during interrogation could compromise his defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">By the ninth day of investigating this matter, Detective Barba, a seasoned Prince George\u2019s County Officer, either knew or should have known that the defense would allege that Mr. Luckett was not criminally responsible for his actions, or that his sanity would be questioned. Any statement shedding light on his mental capacity or understanding, regardless of whether it was about this case or not, could be relevant and Mr. Luckett would have greatly benefited from a counsel. Mr. Luckett\u2019s entire life was more or less in question at this time. This was not simply a \u201cdomestic\u201d case as the State believes.

The court explained that there was no need to do so because \u201c[t]he State has not asked that the Court make a determination of whether the statement was voluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The State noted an appeal from the grant of Respondent\u2019s motion to suppress the statement he gave to Detective Barba. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court, holding: \u201c[Ujnder the totality of the circumstances, the unnecessarily lengthy and rambling discussion about the nature of the <em>Miranda </em>rights not only included specifically questionable statements of the law but utterly failed effectively to communicate the message mandated by <em>Miranda.\u201d Luckett, </em>188 Md.App. at 410, 981 A.2d at 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">We granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that Luckett\u2019s August 13, 2007 statement must be suppressed where that holding: 1) expands the concept of \u201cimproper inducement\u201d to include situations where the interrogator makes no offers or promises in exchange for a statement; 2) is based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>upon a flatly incorrect interpretation of the record; and 3) erroneously concludes that Luckett did not knowingly waive his right to counsel[?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Upon our independent review of the facts developed at the suppression hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals that Respondent\u2019s statement to Detective Barba was obtained in violation of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>requirement that a suspect be properly advised of the right to counsel.

The State disagrees. The State points out that Detective Barba correctly informed Respondent of all of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at the outset of the exchange between the two. The State directs us to the following advisements by Detective Barba. He advised Respondent: \u201cYou have the right to remain silent, if you choose to give up this right, anything that you say can be used against you in court.\u201d Detective Barba added: \u201cYou have the right to talk to a lawyer before you are asked any questions[,] to have a lawyer present with you while you\u2019re being questioned----\u201d He further advised: \u201c[I]f you want a lawyer and cannot afford [one], a lawyer will be provided with [sic] you at no cost[,]\u201d and, \u201cIf you want to answer questions now without a lawyer, you still have the right to stop answering questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>at any given time.\u201d Detective Barbara also asked Respondent if he understood those rights, and Respondent replied that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">We agree with the State that those advisements comport with <em>Miranda. </em>The problem, however, does not lie in Detective Barba\u2019s recitation of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings we have just quoted. The problem instead lies in the detective\u2019s further \u201cclarifications\u201d and \u201cexplanations\u201d of the rights covered by those warnings. As we shall see, it is those comments that nullified what otherwise were proper warnings, and rendered the <em>Miranda </em>advisement constitutionally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">When advising Respondent that he had \u201cthe right to talk to a lawyer before you are asked any questions [and] to have a lawyer present with you while you\u2019re being questioned,\u201d Detective Barba added, \u201cthat\u2019s about this case, specifically.\u201d Detective Barba followed that statement with an example of the type of exchange that would <em>not </em>be considered interrogation accorded protection under <em>Miranda: </em>\u201cLike I said, if we want to talk about the Redskins, you don\u2019t need a lawyer for that because it does not concern\u2014okay.\u201d Following that, Respondent asked whether, in discussing \u201cthe incident\u201d without a lawyer, he would be \u201csetting [himself] up\u201d in \u201cdiscussing] the case without my lawyer.\u201d Respondent sought an answer to that concern from either Detective Barba or the unknown male in the room. In answer to Respondent\u2019s concern, Detective Barba simply repeated the words that conveyed, in effect, that not all that he and Respondent might discuss during the interrogation was covered by the right to counsel: \u201cOkay, if we discuss any matters outside of the case, you don\u2019t need a lawyer present at all period. Okay.\u201d Then, when Respondent sought confirmation that he would not \u201cbe hurting\u201d himself, Detective Barba again repeated that Respondent did \u201chave rights\u201d but only \u201c[w]hen we are discussing matters of the case.\u201d Detective Barba re-emphasized, moreover, that not everything Respondent might say during interrogation was covered by the right to counsel: \u201cWhen or if you tell me something specifically, you have a right to have a lawyer present here.\u201d The detective ended these \u201cadvise<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ments\u201d with the following: \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing here is that you are giving up a right to having a lawyer present to tell me your side, okay.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Respondent purported to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights by signing the form declaring that he \u201cunderstood\u201d the rights he was waiving.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Detective Barba did not inform Respondent, as the detective should have done in answer to Respondent\u2019s query about incriminating himself, that <em>anything </em>Respondent said during interrogation could incriminate him. To the contrary, Detective Barba repeatedly advised Respondent that any of his statements that were not directly related to \u201cthe case\u201d (whatever the detective meant by \u201cthe case\u201d) were outside the purview of the right to counsel and, impliedly at least, not subject to being used against Respondent at trial. Detective Barba\u2019s repeated \u201cexplanations\u201d of what <em>Miranda </em>does and does not protect during interrogation were incorrect as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><em>Miranda </em>covers any custodial exchange that occurs between interrogator and suspect, other than routine booking questions and the like.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In other words, the protections afforded by <em>Miranda </em>extend to the entirety of the interrogation, from beginning to end, without limitation on the matters discussed. <em>See Arizona v. Roberson, </em>486 U.S. 675, 684, 108 S.Ct. 2093, 2099, 100 L.Ed.2d 704, 715 (1988) (stating that \u201c[a] suspect\u2019s request for counsel should apply to any questions the police wish to pose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Therefore, no police officer advising a suspect of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>should intimate, much less declare affirmatively, a limitation upon the right to counsel. Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Barba\u2019s statements that the right to counsel applied only to discussion of the specifics of \u201cthe case,\u201d being wrong as a matter of law, rendered the advisements constitutionally infirm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The constitutional infirmity of the warnings rendered similarly infirm Respondent\u2019s subsequent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, because his purported waiver was not \u201cmade with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u201d <em>Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 421, 106 S.Ct. at 1141, 89 L.Ed.2d at 421; <em>see also Missouri v.

The State\u2019s thesis defies common sense, runs directly afoul of the requirement that <em>Miranda </em>advisements be analyzed in their totality, and is contrary to the dictates of <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We hold that a suspect is not properly informed of his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights when a statement of those rights, however correct the statement may be, is nullified by other incorrect statements concerning those rights. In that event, the <em>Miranda </em>advisements are constitutionally infirm, a purported \u201cwaiver\u201d of those rights is constitutionally invalid, and any statement the police obtain from the suspect during the ensuing interrogation violates <em>Miranda. </em>Here, Detective Barba misadvised Respondent of his right to counsel under <em>Miranda, </em>rendering invalid his purported <em>Miranda </em>waiver and requiring suppression of Respondent\u2019s post-\u201cwaiver\u201d statement to the detective.

Hass, </em>420 U.S. 714, 721, 95 S.Ct. 1215, 1220, 43 L.Ed.2d 570, 577 (1975) (applying the rule of <em>Harris </em>to permit the prosecution to use a <em>Miranda-v </em>iolative statement during its rebuttal case to impeach the defendant's direct testimony that contradicted the statement); <em>State v. Kidd, </em>281 Md. 32, 40-43, 50-51, 375 A.2d 1105, 1110-12, 1115-16 (1977) (recognizing the rule <em>o\u00ed Harris </em>and <em>Hass, </em>but holding that the rule did not apply in that case because the <em>Miranda-v </em>iolative statement did not contradict the defendant's direct testimony); <em>State v. Franklin, </em>281 Md. 51, 60-61, 375 A.2d 1116, 1121-22 (1977) (applying <em>Harris </em>and <em>Hass </em>to hold that the State properly impeached the defendant with what this Court \"assumed\u201d was a Miranda-violative statement, not challenged as involuntary, that contradicted the defendant\u2019s direct testimony), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1018, 98 S.Ct. 739, 54 L.Ed.2d 764 (1978); <em>Hall v. State, </em>292 Md. 683, 688-89, 441 A.2d 708, 711 (1982) (applying <em>Harris </em>and <em>Hass </em>to uphold the prosecution\u2019s use of the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda-violative </em>statement to impeach the defendant\u2019s direct testimony that contradicted the statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">We have mentioned that the Circuit Court did not rule on Respondent\u2019s voluntariness claim because the State did not press for a ruling on the issue. Presumably the court was of the view that, unless and until the State sought to use the statement for impeachment purposes, there was no need to decide the matter. Ordinarily, however, when a motion to suppress a statement raises both <em>Miranda </em>and voluntariness concerns, the court should rule at the suppression stage on the voluntariness of the statement, even if the court also rules that the statement was obtained in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>A voluntariness ruling at that time has obvious benefits. The evidence that was developed on the issue is fresh in the minds of counsel and the court, the issue is fully ripe for decision, and a ruling at that time makes clear to both parties before trial the extent to which, if at all, the State may use the defendant\u2019s statement at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\">. <em>See Pennsylvania v.

Detective Barba\u2019s legally incorrect advisements concerning the scope of the right to counsel were enough to render the advisements constitutionally defective, and our conclusion in that regard provides the basis for our disposition in this case. We therefore need not consider the effect of other comments that Detective Barba made during the <em>Miranda </em>advisements, and which caught the attention of the Court of Special Appeals. We refer here to Detective Barba\u2019s comment at the beginning of the recorded colloquy, \"Like, like I said, I\u2019m not here, I\u2019m here to help[,]\u201d and to his comment much later during the colloquy that \u201cBut for me to be able to present your side\u2014along with everything else that I\u2019ll be presenting, ... then that goes on my integrity.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals noted: \"The inevitably seductive effect of repeated assurances that the interrogator is there 'to help\u2019 the defendant is that the officer is presented as an alternative source of 'help.' Such a choice is an unspoken inducement to waive the right to counsel.\u201d <em>Luckett, </em>188 Md.App. at 419, 981 A.2d at 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Any statement on the part of a police officer that attempts to mislead, or has the effect of misleading, a suspect as to the scope of the rights afforded by <em>Miranda </em>renders the advisement defective. <em>See 2 </em>Wayne R. Lafave, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 6.9(c) (3d ed. 2000) (\u201c[T]here is an absolute prohibition upon any trickery which misleads the suspect as to the ... dimensions of any of the applicable rights.\u201d). We caution the police, and those advising them, that this Court will not tolerate any attempt to mislead a suspect about the full scope of the rights afforded by <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
