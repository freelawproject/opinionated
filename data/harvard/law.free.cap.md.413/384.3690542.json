Usiak, Esquire, in direct contempt. Usiak appealed to the Circuit Court for Frederick County, which vacated the order and remanded the matter to the District Court on the basis that the initial order failed to comply with the mandates of Maryland Rule 15-203. The District Court, almost three months after its initial defective order, entered a corrected order and Usiak again appealed to the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court, finding that Usiak\u2019s conduct constituted contempt, affirmed the order. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and remand with directions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>vacate the corrected order of contempt and dismiss the contempt action. The Circuit Court erred in affirming the second contempt order.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>1</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">On 15 May 2008, Usiak appeared in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Frederick County, as defense counsel for Ruben Paz-Rubio, who was scheduled to go to trial that day on a criminal charge of driving without a license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the case was called for trial, Usiak, with the acquiescence of the prosecutor, requested a continuance. The court denied the continuance request, but agreed to \u201cpass\u201d the case until later in the day. When the case was called again, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney moved to place the case on the stet docket<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201cbased on some evidentiary problems in th[e] case.... \u201d The court inquired why the State wished to stet the case. Usiak, apparently believing that the court had no authority or discretion other than to grant the State\u2019s motion, interrupted the colloquy between the court and the prosecutor. The following ensued between the court, the prosecutor, and Usiak:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">MR. USIAK: We have no objections to [a stet] being entered, Your Honor. If we may be excused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">COURT: No, you may not. This case is being heard Mr. Usiak.

Excuse me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-11\">COURT: We are going to pass this case until you decide what to do. The case is passed. It is not off the docket, Mr. Usiak. Sir have a seat in the courtroom. Mr. Usiak, your client is staying; the case is not concluded. You can hear me. You\u2019re in contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-12\">For the record, Counsel for the Defendant has walked out of the courtroom while the case was not concluded and simply passed for a decision; that\u2019s under Rule 15-203. This case is not over [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney].[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAN\">STATE: Thank you Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">After hearing other matters, the court resumed the Paz-Rubio case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-14\">COURT: Is Mr. Ruben Paz-Rubio in the courtroom? Mr. Interpreter you want to call for him please [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>INTERPRETER: Se\u00f1or Ruben Paz-Rubio [are you present (in Spanish) ]? (Pause) No response, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A54\">COURT: All right, thank you. For the record, this case was called earlier. Mr. Usiak, who represents the Defendant was rude and disrespectful, arguing with the Court over an issue regarding the Court\u2019s refusal to stet this case. The Court has found Mr. Usiak in contempt of court, direct contempt of court, for interrupting with the flow of the Court\u2019s judicial proceedings. Mr. Usiak has elected not to come back to court. The Court is sanctioning him in the amount of a two hundred and fifty dollar fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">With regard to his client, who was told to stay in the courtroom because this case was not completed\u2014Mr. Interpreter, did you tell Mr. Paz-Rubio that he was to stay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxM\">INTERPRETER: I did tell him to stay Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtN\">COURT: The Court is issuing a bench warrant for his arrest for not staying in the courtroom after being ordered to stay here until his case was finished. Bond is set in the amount of five hundred dollars. All right, thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmD\">[PROSECUTOR]: Thank you Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">On 22 May 2008, the District Court judge entered a written order of contempt against Usiak. The Order stated merely that the court found him in direct contempt and referred to findings made on the transcript record of the 15 May 2008 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Usiak appealed to the Circuit Court for Frederick County. After a hearing, the Circuit Court vacated the 22 May 2008 order of contempt on the ground that the order did not comply with Maryland Rule 15-203<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in that the order did not specify</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>(1) whether the contempt is civil or criminal in nature and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">(2) the evidentiary facts known to the Court from the judge\u2019s own personal knowledge as to the conduct constituting the contempt and as to any relevant evidentiary facts not so known, the basis of the court\u2019s findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The Circuit Court remanded the matter to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">On 11 August 2008, almost three months after the original contempt order was entered, the District Court judge entered a second, corrected order of contempt against Usiak. The order stated that the judge found Usiak to be in direct criminal contempt of court and summarized the facts giving rise to the contempt charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">On May 15, 2008, [I] attempted to conduct a trial in the underlying case. Upon the case being called for trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>State\u2019s attorney moved to have the matter placed on the STET docket. Mr. Usiak noted that his client did not object; however, the Court denied the State\u2019s motion and attempted to proceed with the trial. Mr. Usiak refused to proceed with the trial, incorrectly advising the Court that it did not have the authority deny [sic] the motion for STET. Despite the Court\u2019s advice to the contrary, Mr. Usiak persistently asserted that the Court could not deny the motion and requested to be excused. Twice, during the hearing, the Court admonished Mr. Usiak that he was being disrespectful. Six times, the Court advised Mr. Usiak that he could not be excused and that the hearing had not concluded. Notwithstanding, Mr. Usiak stated \u201cNo Your Honor I, I, we\u2019re leaving, Your Honor. Excuse Me.\u201d and [sic] proceeded to walk out of the courtroom. The Court called out to him as he was leaving, but he did not respond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">(Internal citations to the transcript omitted). The order imposed a sanction of $250, but stated that the sanction could be \u201csuspended, modified or revoked\u201d if Usiak were to make a written apology to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Rather than pay the sanction or apologize, Usiak appealed once more to the Circuit Court. He also filed a motion to dismiss the contempt charges on the ground that the second order constituted a denial of due process and thus was against the notions of fundamental fairness. Further, he argued that a second, corrected order of contempt constituted impermissible double jeopardy. The Circuit Court denied the motion and affirmed the contempt order finding that \u201c[t]he record, without a doubt, demonstrates a blatant disrespect of the trial court on the part of Norman Usiak. His words and actions occurred in the courtroom in the trial judge\u2019s presence and constituted a direct criminal contempt and amply support the trial judge\u2019s decision to impose summary sanctions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Usiak next appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which, on its motion, transferred the appeal to this Court pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Rule 8-132.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We granted Usiak\u2019s subsequent petition for a writ of certiorari, 409 Md. 413, 975 A.2d 875 (2009), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">I. Did the Circuit Court for Frederick County err by refusing to consider the Petitioner\u2019s affidavit of defense when Maryland [Rule] 15-203 explicitly authorizes such a filing and Petitioner was otherwise denied the opportunity of presenting a defense (calling witnesses, etc.)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">II. Whether a judge has the authority to refuse to allow the State to stet a driving without a license charge, on personal policy grounds, when the State and the accused consent to the entry and the conditions upon the entry are non-objectionable and laudable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">III. Should [the District Court judge] have, personally, summarily declared Petitioner in contempt, after the matter was remanded and several months had transpired, and what should be the appropriate standard of review on appeal, if not <em>de novo </em>?[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">For the reasons we shall explain, we shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and hold that a defective, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>intended, order of direct and summary criminal contempt, with summary sanctions, that fails to comply with Rule 15-203 may not be re-issued as corrected on remand. Accordingly, we do not reach the other questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">While the existing jurisprudence and rules governing the exercise of the contempt power are fulsome, they often seem not well understood or followed in application. Consequently, we shall reiterate here, as a sort of primer, many of those core principles. \u201cThe contempt power has stood as a sentry at the citadel of justice for a very long time....\u201d <em>State v. Roll and Scholl, </em>267 Md. 714, 717, 298 A.2d 867, 870 (1973). The authority of a court to punish for contempt is \u201c[o]ne weapon in the court\u2019s arsenal useful in defending its dignity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWithout this power, the courts would be subject to the whim of any person who seeks to disrupt their proceedings. Consequently, it is beyond cavil that the power to hold a person in contempt is inherent in all courts as a principal tool to protect the orderly administration of justice and the dignity of that branch of government that adjudicates the rights and interests of the people.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>382 Md. 329, 337, 855 A.2d 339, 343 (2004) (citing <em>Ex Parte Maulsby, </em>13 Md. 625, 635 (1859)).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code, the Maryland Rules, and the common law of this State govern the procedures and power of contempt. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 l-202(a) (\u201cA court may exercise its power to punish for contempt of court or to compel compliance with its commands in the manner prescribed by Title 15, Chapter 200 of the Maryland Rules.\u201d); <em>King v. State, </em>400 Md. 419, 431, 929 A.2d 169, 176 (2007); <em>Smith, </em>382 Md. at 338, 855 A.2d at 344. \u201cWe recognize two forms of contempt\u2014 direct and constructive\u2014and two types of each form\u2014criminal and civil.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCriminal contempt serves a punitive function, while civil contempt is remedial or compulsory and must provide for purging.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A court may charge someone with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>direct contempt if the \u201ccontempt [was] committed in the presence of the judge presiding in court or so near to the judge as to interrupt the court\u2019s proceedings.\u201d Md. Rule 15-202(b). A constructive contempt \u201cmeans any contempt other than a direct contempt.\u201d Md. Rule 15-202(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The Rules permit the summary imposition of sanctions for direct contempt if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">(1) the presiding judge has personally seen, heard, or otherwise directly perceived the conduct constituting the contempt and has personal knowledge of the identity of the person committing it, and (2) the contempt has interrupted the order of the court and interfered with the dignified conduct of the court\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Md. Rule 15-203(a). Although permitted by the Rules, a summary proceeding should be an exceptional case. <em>King, </em>400 Md. at 433, 929 A.2d at 177. Summary procedures are appropriate where \u201cthe conduct of the alleged contemnor poses an open, serious threat to orderly procedures that instant____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such procedures are necessary in such a circumstance because of \u201cthe need for <em>immediate </em>vindication of the dignity of the court.\u201d <em>Roll and Scholl, </em>267 Md. at 733, 298 A.2d at 878 (emphasis supplied); <em>see also King, </em>400 Md. at 433, 929 A.2d at 177; <em>Smith, </em>382 Md. at 338, 855 A.2d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">If a court chooses not to issue sanctions summarily, it shall, \u201creasonably promptly after [the contemptuous] conduct, ... issue a written order specifying the evidentiary facts within the personal knowledge of the judge as to the conduct constituting the contempt and the identity of the contemnor.\u201d Md. Rule 15-204. In that event, Rule 15-204 provides further that \u201cthe proceeding shall be conducted pursuant to Rule 15-205[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>or Rule 15-206,[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] whichever is applicable, and Rule 15-207[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] in the same manner as a constructive contempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Petitioner makes several arguments regarding the second order of contempt by the District Court. We shall address first (and ultimately only) Petitioner\u2019s argument that it was improper for the District Court to enter a second, corrected order of direct criminal contempt with summary sanctions approximately three months after the alleged contemptuous conduct occurred. Rule 15-203(b) provides that \u201c[ejither before sanctions are imposed or promptly thereafter, the court shall issue a written order stating that a direct contempt has been committed.... \u201d In <em>King v. State, </em>the contemnor, an attorney, failed to appear in court for her client\u2019s scheduled trial date in a criminal case. The trial judge chose not to impose summary sanctions and issued a contempt show cause order to the attorney, thus treating the conduct as constructive criminal contempt. Subsequently, at a hearing on the contempt charge, the court vacated the previous order and indicated that it found the attorney in direct criminal contempt. On appeal, we held that because the trial judge \u201cdid not summarily impose sanctions for King\u2019s direct criminal contempt, Maryland Rule 15-204 governed the procedure for adjudication of the direct contempt and the imposition of sanctions.\u201d 400 Md. at 441-42, 929 A.2d at 182. We opined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">following a direct contempt, the court may defer the imposition of sanctions until the conclusion of the proceeding during which the contempt was committed, <em>only if </em>the court \u201csummarily finds and announces on the record that direct contempt was committed.\u201d The plain language of the rule contemplates that summary imposition of sanctions should occur contemporaneously with the proceeding in which the direct contempt occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 441, 929 A.2d at 182 (emphasis in original) (quoting Md. Rule 15-203). We explained further that, in the absence of summary proceedings, \u201cRule 15-204 requires that the direct contempt shall be treated like a constructive contempt for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>purposes of adjudication and disposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although under Rule 15-203 deferral of a summary sanction until a later time in the underlying proceeding does not affect the summary nature of the sanction, we explained that the time frame contemplated by the Rule is a de minimis amount of time. <em>Id. </em>at 442, 929 A.2d at 182-83. The reason that the Rules treat a direct contempt as a constructive contempt when the court does not proceed summarily is grounded in the purpose behind the allowance of summary proceedings. \u201cThe imposition of sanctions weeks after the contumacious conduct ignores the purpose for which sanctions are imposed summarily, i.e., to vindicate the court so that \u2018a court [will] not be at the mercy of the obstreperous and uncouth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442, 929 A.2d at 183 (alteration in original) (quoting R. Goldfarb, <em>The Contempt Power </em>306 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In <em>Smith v. State, </em>394 Md. 184, 905 A.2d 315 (2006), the trial judge held Smith in direct criminal contempt for refusing to testify in a criminal case. Two days after the conclusion of the case, the trial judge conducted a separately docketed hearing and imposed upon Smith sanctions for direct criminal contempt. On a writ of certiorari to this Court, Smith argued that \u201cthe trial judge did not summarily impose sanctions following her determination that he was guilty of direct criminal contempt and that, therefore, his contempt conviction must be vacated because the trial court failed to comply with the applicable Maryland Rules governing contempt proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 905 A.2d at 323. We noted that the Committee Note to Rule 15-203 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">Sanctions may be imposed immediately upon the finding of the contempt, or, in the court\u2019s discretion, may be deferred to a later time in the proceeding. Deferral of a sanction does not affect its summary nature. The sanction remains summary in nature in that no hearing is required; the court simply announces and imposes the sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">We observed that the \u201cterm \u2018summary\u2019 generally connotes an immediate action undertaken without following the usual formal procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215, 905 A.2d at 333 (citing <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1476 (8th ed.2004)). We concluded that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>fact that the court held an independently docketed proceeding in which to dispense sanctions is entirely inconsistent with the concept of summary proceedings. Moreover, the trial judge engaged in an involved colloquy with Smith, permitted his attorney to present a mitigating argument, and solicited sentencing recommendations from the State and Smith\u2019s counsel.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>394 Md. at 215, 905 A.2d at 323. Accordingly, we held that \u201cthe trial judge erred in characterizing the imposition of sanctions in the present case as summary in nature and should have followed the procedures delineated in Maryland Rules 15-204, 15-205, 15-206, and 15-207.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, 905 A.2d at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Here, the asserted contemptuous conduct occurred on 15 May 2008. The District Court judge issued the initial order of contempt on 22 May 2008. The Circuit Court vacated the defective order and, on remand, the District Court judge issued a revised, new order on 11 August 2008. Similar to the delayed imposition of sanctions in <em>King </em>and the independent docketing of the contempt proceeding in <em>Smith, </em>the almost three-month delay between the original order of contempt and the revised order is inconsistent with the nature of a summary contempt proceeding. As noted <em>supra, </em>Rule 15-203 permits the court \u201cto defer imposition of sanctions until the conclusion of the proceeding during which the contempt was committed.\u201d The length of time the court may defer sanctions, however, is de minimis and typically should be no later than the end of the proceeding during which the triggering conduct occurred. Three months, in these circumstances, is not de minimis. Direct criminal contempt with summary imposition of sanctions is a relatively rare criminal offense where the judge finds a contemnor guilty upon witnessing the conduct and impose a sanction immediately. The imperative to vindicate the dignity or the efficient operations of the court almost three months after the misconduct occurs diminishes greatly the immediacy of the justification for summary sanctions. An order of contempt entered almost three months after the fact \u201clack[s] the hallmarks of summary imposition of sanctions under Maryland Rule 15-203(a).\u201d <em>Smith, </em>394 Md. at 215, 905 A.2d at 333. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>we explained in <em>King, </em>\u201cproceeding summarily at a later date, in effect, circumvents compliance with Maryland Rules 15-204 and 15-205 and, therefore, is improper.\u201d 400 Md. at 445, 929 A.2d at 184. Accordingly, we hold that the Circuit Court erred when it affirmed the second contempt order.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The unique facet of contempt law that permits summary imposition of sanctions also militates against a judge having two bites at the contempt apple. In effect, in circumstances such as occurred here, where the trial judge believes summary action is required, he or she must get it right the first time. The first order was deficient because it failed to specify whether the contempt was criminal or civil or to marshal the facts that formed the basis of the finding of contempt. By the time the District Court entered the second order, the justification for the summary nature of the contempt order had dissipated greatly. There was no longer an immediate need to vindicate the dignity or efficient operation of the court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>result, there should not have been a remand of this case for further proceedings. \u201cFurther proceedings in the present case ... would be inconsistent with the purpose of empowering the trial court to sanction direct contempt, which is to \u2018assur[e] the efficiency and dignity of the judiciary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>394 Md. at 216, 905 A.2d at 334 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Roll and Scholl, </em>267 Md. at 726, 298 A.2d at 875).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, we shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and remand with directions to vacate the contempt order and dismiss the contempt action.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS TO VACATE THE CONTEMPT ORDER OF 11 AUGUST 2008 AND DISMISS THE ACTION.

The Dissent takes exception to the Majority's holding in this regard. The Dissent opines that it is \"unrealistic\u201d for a trial judge to enter immediately the contempt order, as he or she is required to do by Maryland Rule 15-203. Furthermore, the Dissent concludes that it is \"unfair\u201d to prohibit the judge from entering a corrected contempt order after he or she failed to enter a corrected order the first time. Although the Dissent states that it disagrees with the Majority\u2019s holding, it actually takes issue with the plain language of Rule 15-203 itself, which provides that <em>\"/ejither before sanctions or promptly thereafter are imposed, </em>the court shall issue a written order stating that a direct contempt has been committed and specifying\u201d the facts giving rise to the contempt finding. (Emphasis supplied). The Rule plainly contemplates that the imposition of sanctions shall be imposed in rapid succession to the contumacious conduct. As discussed <em>supra, </em>the Rule states that the court \"may defer imposition of sanctions,\u201d but shall do so before the conclusion of the proceedings. A short deferral of sanctions, exercised within the court's sound discretion, does not affect the summary nature of the proceedings. In contrast, imposing a corrected order almost three months after the proceeding had concluded vitiates the summary nature of the sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Moreover, the dissenting opinion\u2019s reliance on <em>Kandel v. State, </em>252 Md. 668, 250 A.2d 853 (1969), is injected inaptly into any analysis of the iteration of the Rule as it existed at the relevant times of the present case. We decided <em>Kandel </em>under the predecessor to the current rule governing the summary imposition of sanctions for direct criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>contempt, Maryland Rule P3 b (1967) and is, thus, inapplicable to the disposition of the present case. Rule P3 b provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJV\">[w]here a direct contempt is committed, the court shall sign a written order to that effect. The order shall recite the facts, be signed by the judge and entered of record. The order shall state which of the facts were known to the court of its own knowledge and as to any facts not so known, the basis for the court\u2019s finding with respect thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASb\">In contrast to Rule 15-203, Rule P3 b did not contain a requirement stating a timing consideration by which sanctions must be imposed. Thus, we held that the delay in <em>Kandel </em>from May to November 1968 did not prejudice the contemnor. 252 Md. at 670, 250 A.2d at 854. When we adopted Rule 15-203, however, we found it appropriate to include a timing requirement. Accordingly, it is clear from the plain language of the Rule that a delay such as occurred in <em>Kandel </em>no longer would be acceptable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\">. The Court of Special Appeals reached a different conclusion in <em>Thomas v. State, 99 </em>Md.App. 47, 635 A.2d 71 (1994).

(1) The appellant shall file a memorandum in opposition to the decision of the District Court within 30 days after the date the appeal was entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>on the docket or as otherwise ordered by the court. The appellee may file a response within 15 days after service of the appellant\u2019s memorandum, but in no event later than five days before the date of argument, if argument has been scheduled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">(2) In addition to otherwise complying with Rule 1-301, a memorandum or response shall be typewritten or printed, shall be double spaced, and shall not exceed ten pages in length. The appellant\u2019s memorandum shall contain (A) a statement of the questions presented for review, (B) a concise statement of the facts material to a determination of the questions presented, and (C) argument in support of the appellant\u2019s position, stating the grounds for the relief sought and the authorities in support of each ground. The appellee\u2019s response shall contain argument in support of the decision of the District Court, stating the grounds for affirmance and the authorities in support of each ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">(3) If an appellant fails to file a memorandum within the time prescribed by this Rule, the circuit court may dismiss the appeal if it finds that the failure to file or the late filing caused prejudice to the moving party. An appellee who fails to file a memorandum within the time prescribed by this Rule may not present argument except with the permission of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">(e) Oral argument. A party desiring oral argument shall request it in the memorandum or response under the heading \u201cRequest for Oral Argument\u201d. Unless oral argument is requested by a party or ordered by the circuit court, the appeal shall be decided without oral argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">(f) Scope of review. The circuit court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the District Court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the District Court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">(g) Disposition. (1) As to each party to an appeal, the circuit court shall by order dispose of an appeal in one of the following ways:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>(A) dismiss the appeal pursuant to Rule 7-114;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">(B) affirm the judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">(C) vacate or reverse the judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">(D) modify the judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">(E) remand the action in accordance with subsection (2) of this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">(F) an appropriate combination of the above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">(2) If the circuit court concludes that the substantial merits of a case will not be determined by affirming, reversing, or modifying the judgment, or that justice will be served by permitting further proceedings, the court may remand the case to the District Court. In the order remanding a case, the circuit court shall state the purpose for the remand. The order of remand and the opinion upon which the order is based are conclusive as to the points decided. Upon remand, the District Court shall conduct any further proceedings necessary to determine the action in accordance with the opinion and order of the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-11\">(h) Opinion. In every appeal, the circuit court shall render a concise opinion, which shall be reduced to writing and filed with the clerk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">From my review of the record, Appellant did not comply with requirements of sections (b) and (d) of Md. Rule 7-113. I would therefore direct that the Circuit Court dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">Assuming that the Circuit Court was required to reach the merits, however, it is clear to me that the Circuit Court was expressly authorized by Md. Rule 7-113(g) to do precisely what it did: remand to the District Court for entry of an order that complied with the requirements of Md. Rule 15-203(b). Nothing in the history of Md. Rule 7-113(g) supports the conclusion that a District Court\u2019s judgment of direct criminal contempt cannot be vacated and remanded for further proceedings. Moreover, such a conclusion is directly contrary to federal precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>In <em>Buffington v. Baltimore County, </em>913 F.2d 113 (4th Cir.1990), while vacating \u201ccivil\u201d contempt judgments entered in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against two lawyers who violated their obligation to comply with discovery orders, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">There was no clear error in the district court\u2019s subsidiary fact-findings that [the lawyers] had possession of [certain] witness statements ... and that the refusal to apprise the Buffingtons of those critical statements permitted drawing the \u201cweighty inference of knowing concealment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">Any monetary sanction the court might impose on remand without reinstituting criminal proceedings must be civil in character^] ... Any reinstituted criminal contempt proceedings must of course comply with the requisites of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the constitutional protections afforded defendants in such proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we ... vacate and remand the contempt sanctions against [the attorneys].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 135-36. <em>Buffington </em>was cited with approval in <em>Cromer v. Kraft Foods N. Am., Inc., </em>390 F.3d 812 (4th Cir.2004), in which the Fourth Circuit vacated a judgment of contempt and remanded for further proceedings at which the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina would be required to apply \u201cthe procedural safeguards necessary prior to the imposition of criminal penalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that there should not have been a remand because \u201c[t]here was no longer an immediate need to vindicate the dignity or efficient operation of the [District Court].\u201d The conclusion that the second order was entered \u201ctoo late\u201d to vindicate the dignity of the court cannot be reconciled with this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kandel v. State, </em>252 Md. 668, 250 A.2d 853 (1969). In that case, on March 12, 1969, this Court affirmed \u201can order of ... the Circuit Court for Baltimore County finding [the appellant] in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>contempt for failing punctually to appear at the trial of an accused whom he represented, and imposing a fine of $150.00,\u201d even though the Circuit Court (1) announced its finding and punishment in open court on May 27, 1968 (the day of trial), but (2) did not sign the order of contempt, then required by Md. Rule P3(b), until November 5, 1968, and (3) did not file that order until November 18, 1968. <em>Id. </em>at 669-70, 250 A.2d at 853-854.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">While it is true that former Md. Rule P3 (b) did not expressly require that the trial court issue a written order \u201ceither before sanctions are imposed or promptly thereafter,\u201d the absence of that express requirement was of no consequence to the holding in <em>Kandel. </em>Even though the order required by Md. Rule P3(b) was not filed until after Mr. Kandel noted his appeal, this Court affirmed the conviction (over nine months after the contempt occurred) on the ground \u201cthat Mr. Kandel was not prejudiced by the delayed compliance with Rule P3 b.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670, 250 A.2d at 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Moreover, Md. Rule l-201(a), in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATW\">When a rule, by the word \u201cshall\u201d or otherwise, mandates or prohibits conduct, the consequences of noncompliance are those prescribed by these rules or by statute. If no consequences are prescribed, the court may compel compliance with the rule or may determine the consequences of the noncompliance in light of the totality of the circumstances and the purpose of the rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">No consequences of noncompliance with the \u201cprompt issuance\u201d requirement in Md. Rule 15-203(b) are prescribed by any rule other than Md. Rule 7-113(g), or by statute. It is clear that the purpose of Md. Rule 15-203(b) is not to place busy trial judges \u201cat the mercy of the obstreperous,\u201d but rather to enable the appellate court to determine whether a contempt has been committed. <em>Kandel, supra, </em>252 Md. at 670, 250 A.2d at 854. The \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis should obviously include a determination of (1) why the order was not issued \u201cpromptly,\u201d and (2) whether the appellant was prejudiced in any way by the delayed compli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>anee with the rule. In the case at bar, the first order was entered one week after the contempt occurred. As was the situation in <em>Kandel, </em>Appellant is unable to show that he was prejudiced by the delayed compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis should also focus upon the impact of the contumacious conduct. If Appellant had contumaciously walked out of a courtroom while representing a party in a civil case, the trial court would not have been prohibited from continuing the trial. In the case at bar, however, Appellant contumaciously walked out of the courtroom while representing a criminal defendant who had a constitutional right to be represented by counsel. Under these circumstances, if we do not direct that the Circuit Court dismiss this appeal, we should certainly affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court on the ground that the record shows beyond any doubt that (in the words of the Circuit Court) \u201c[Appellant\u2019s] words and actions occurred in the courtroom in the trial judge\u2019s presence and constituted a direct criminal contemptf.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Judges BATTAGLIA and BARBERA have authorized me to state that they join this dissenting opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
