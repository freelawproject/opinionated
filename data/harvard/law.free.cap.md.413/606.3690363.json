In each case, a former employee of WSSC brought an action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against the Commission, pursuant to \u00a7 42(a), alleging that WSSC engaged in race-based employment discrimination in violation of Prince George\u2019s County Code (\u201cPGCC\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 2-186<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 2-222.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response, WSSC maintained that, because it is a State agency or instrumentality, it is not considered a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 42(a) and, as such, may not be sued for employment discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>pursuant to that section. For reasons we shall explain, we hold that, for purposes of \u00a7 42(a), WSSC is a \u201cperson,\u201d and, therefore, may be sued for employment discrimination under \u00a7 42(a) for violations of the anti-discrimination provisions of the Prince George\u2019s County Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Because the question with which we are confronted in these cases is purely a legal one, we set forth only briefly sufficient factual backgrounds underlying each action to give context.</p>\n<p id=\"AcW\">\n<em>Shaaron Phillips</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In 2003, Shaaron Phillips, an African-American female who served as leader of WSSC\u2019s Small, Local, and Minority Business Enterprise Group, approached her general manager \u201cto discuss harassment and racial discrimination she was experiencing at WSSC.\u201d After she was unable to have her concerns resolved satisfactorily, Phillips filed, on 16 June 2003, complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), the Maryland Commission on Human Rights, and the Prince George\u2019s County Human Rights Commission. The complaints identified a number of Caucasian WSSC employees who held similar positions to Phillips, but who received higher pay than she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">After the EEOC denied her claims, Phillips<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> filed in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, on 22 June 2004, a civil action against WSSC alleging various claims of unlawful retaliation and pay discrimination based on race and national origin. Of note to the present appeal, Phillips\u2019s complaint charged WSSC with engaging in discriminatory retaliation in violation of \u00a7 42(a) and PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 2-186 and 2-222 by failing to give Phillips a performance evaluation, and attendant merit pay increase in 2003.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response, WSSC filed a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>dismiss Phillips\u2019s complaint, contending, among other things, that the claim asserted by Phillips pursuant to \u00a7 42(a) and PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 2-186 and 2-222 could not be maintained because the General Assembly\u2019s use of the term \u201cperson\u201d in \u00a7 42(a) demonstrated its intent that \u00a7 42(a) not apply to State agencies, a club to which, WSSC argued, it belonged. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-322(c), the trial court converted WSSC\u2019s motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. On 18 January 2005, in a written order and opinion, the trial court denied WSSC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that, although WSSC was a State agency, it nevertheless qualified as a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7 42(a), subject to actions for employment discrimination brought pursuant to \u00a7 42(a) for violations of PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 2-186 and 2-222.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">While the retaliation-grounded suit was pending in the Circuit Court, on 31 January 2005, Phillips\u2019s employment was terminated by WSSC.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Phillips challenged her termination in an administrative proceeding, but the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) of the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings presiding over the appeal found that WSSC\u2019s termination of Phillips was justified and denied Phillips relief. Phillips appealed the ALJ\u2019s ruling to the Circuit Court, which affirmed the administrative decision. Upon further appeal, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>of Special Appeals upheld the ALJ\u2019s ruling that WSSC\u2019s termination of Phillips was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Following the administrative proceedings and subsequent appeals process arising from her termination, Phillips amended her existing retaliation complaint to include claims for unlawful termination, in violation of \u00a7 42(a) and the Prince George\u2019s County Code, and common law wrongful discharge. Upon WSSC\u2019s motion, the termination-based causes of action were dismissed by the Circuit Court prior to trial on the grounds that, because the ALJ ruled that WSSC had lawful cause to terminate Phillips, the doctrine of res judicata barred any further termination-based claims asserted by Phillips. As such, only Phillips\u2019s retaliation-based claim remained. After a nine-day trial<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>'-brr that' claim in December 2006, the jury returned a verdict of $16, 483.16 in favor of Phillips, finding that WSSC engaged in discriminatory retaliation in violation of \u00a7 42(a) and PGCC \u00a7 \u00a7 2-186 and 2-222. In addition, the trial court awarded Phillips attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in the amount of $60,242.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Phillips appealed timely the triai court\u2019s dismissal of her termination-based claims to the Court of Special Appeals. WSSC cross-appealed, arguing that \u00a7 42(a) does not apply against State agencies and instrumentalities such as WSSC, and, therefore, the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment on Phillips\u2019s claim for retaliation premised upon \u00a7 42(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In its 19 March 2009 unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling on Phillips\u2019s termination-based claims, finding that the ALJ\u2019s decision established that there were non-discriminatory reasons for Phillips\u2019s termination and that the reasons accepted by the ALJ were supported by the evidence. Therefore, the court held, WSSC was entitled to summary judgment on Phillips\u2019s termination-based claims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Regarding WSSC\u2019s cross-appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>intermediate appellate court again affirmed the Circuit Court, holding that, based on its view of the statutory scheme of Article 49B as a whole and WSSC\u2019s nature as a \u201cunique,\u201d albeit a State, agency, the General Assembly intended for \u00a7 42(a) to apply to WSSC as a \u201cperson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">On 19 May 2009, WSSC filed with this Court a petition for writ of certiorari, which, on 21 August 2009, we granted, 410 Md. 165, 978 A.2d 245 (2009). In our grant of certiorari, we directed, in coordination with the related cases then pending before us (and decided in this opinion), that Phillips and WSSC address the following three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">(1) Whether the term \u201cperson,\u201d as it is used in Md.Code, Article 49B, \u00a7 42, includes the State of Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">(2) If so, is the WSSC an agency or. instrumentality of the State for those purposes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">(3) If not, is the WSSC a unique entity that should be considered a \u201cperson,\u201d within the meaning of Md.Code, Art. 49B, \u00a7 42, even if the State, in general, is not included within the meaning of that term?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">\n<em>James K Sillers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">James K. Sillers, a Caucasian male, was employed by WSSC from 1975 until 2007. Sillers rose through the ranks of the Commission staff, starting as a general laborer and ultimately becoming Group Leader for Wastewater Collections Systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">According to Sillers, on or around 27 March 2006, he was demoted from his position as Group Leader for Wastewater Collections Systems to a new position as a Program Administrator. In response, Sillers filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging that his demotion was the result of \u201cenormous pressure ... to have white employees removed from management positions and replaced with minorities.\u201d Sillers elaborated that \u201cWSSC has altered its racial demographics and intentionally forced or encouraged numerous white employees to retire or resign, replacing them with minority employees.\u201d On 13 March 2007, the EEOC determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that WSSC had engaged in race-based dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>crimination against Sillers and, on 20 August 2007, issued Sillers a right to sue letter. Subsequent to the EEOC\u2019s issuance of the right to sue letter, Sillers retired from the WSSC because, according to him, \u201chis working conditions and work environment had become intolerable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Following his retirement from WSSC, Sillers filed suit against the Commission in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, basing his claim upon violations of \u00a7 42(a) and PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 2-186 and 2-222. In response, WSSC moved to dismiss Sillers\u2019s complaint, asserting the same grounds for dismissal as in <em>Phillips, </em>namely, that the term \u201cperson\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 42(a) does not include State agencies, such as WSSC. In addition, WSSC contended that PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 2-186 and 2-222, if applied to the Commission through \u00a7 42(a), constitute unconstitutional public general laws with improper extra-territorial effect because, if a judgment in Prince George\u2019s County were to be rendered against it, WSSC has the statutory authority to satisfy the judgment by levying taxes upon citizens of Montgomery County. Agreeing with WSSC, the Circuit Court dismissed Sillers\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Sillers noted timely an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On 19 December 2008, while the appeal was pending in that court, we issued a writ of certiorari, on our initiative, 406 Md. 744, 962 A.2d 371 (2008), to consider the issue framed by Sillers, namely, \u201c[wjhether or not the Circuit Court erred in holding that the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, which is a State agency, is not subject to civil action under Md.Code, Art. 49B, \u00a7 42.\u201d Subsequent to oral argument on 5 June 2009, we ordered the parties to rebrief and reargue the case based on the three issues which we ordered the parties in <em>Phillips </em>to address, noted <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">\n<em>Allen W. Cartwright, Jr.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Allen W. Cartwright, Jr., an African-American male, was an employee of WSSC for more than six years. Beginning in February 2004, Cartwright served as Chief of Customer Care, a position responsible for overseeing WSSC\u2019s Infrastructure Maintenance and Customer Service Departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>According to Cartwright, in September 2005, a supervisor asked him to transfer back to being Chief of Mission Support, a position he occupied earlier in his career at WSSC, because the General Manager of WSSC \u201cdid not want African-Americans in management positions.\u201d Following his refusal to accept the demotion, Cartwright was terminated from WSSC on 3 October 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In response to his termination, on 6 September 2006, Cartwright filed, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, a complaint against WSSC premised upon violations of \u00a7 42(a) and PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 2-186 and 2-222. WSSC filed a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment on substantially the same grounds as those asserted in its motions to dismiss Sillers\u2019s complaint and for summary judgment on Phillips\u2019s retaliation complaint, namely, that \u00a7 42(a) did not apply to WSSC because WSSC is a State agency and not a \u201cperson.\u201d After initially denying WSSC\u2019s motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, the Circuit Court granted WSSC\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s denial of summary judgment. Upon reconsideration, the Circuit Court, on 16 July 2008, granted WSSC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, agreeing with WSSC\u2019s premise that \u201cWSSC is not a person under the provisions of Article 49B \u00a7 42.\u201d In the alternative, the court held that any interpretation of \u00a7 42(a) to include WSSC would imbue the underlying County Code provisions with improper extraterritorial impact, rendering them unconstitutional general laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Cartwright noted timely an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. While the appeal was pending in that court, we issued a writ of certiorari, on our initiative, 406 Md. 744, 962 A.2d 371 (2008), in order to consider whether the use of the term \u201cperson\u201d in \u00a7 42(a) includes State agencies, such as WSSC. Because Sillers\u2019s and Cartwright\u2019s appeals presented the same legal question, we consolidated them for argument upon motion of the parties. As noted <em>supra, </em>following initial oral argument, we ordered the parties to rebrief and reargue the appeal to address the three questions we directed be addressed in <em>Phillips.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\n<em>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\u201c[W]here an order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland constitutional, statutory or case law, our Court must determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019.... \u201d <em>Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175, 184 (2006). With regard to the motion to dismiss entered by the Circuit Court in <em>Sillers, </em>the standard of review is well settled: \u201c \u2018[B]ecause we must deem the facts to be true, our task is confined to determining whether the trial court was legally correct in its decision to dismiss.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDaniel v. Am. Honda Fin. Corp., </em>400 Md. 75, 83, 926 A.2d 757, 762 (2007) (quoting <em>Debbas v. Nelson, </em>389 Md. 364, 372, 885 A.2d 802, 807 (2005)); <em>Fioretti v. Md. State Bd. of Dental Exam\u2019rs, </em>351 Md. 66, 71-72, 716 A.2d 258, 261 (1998). Similarly, with regard to the relevant summary judgments entered by the Circuit Court in <em>Phillips </em>and <em>Cartwright, </em>the standard of review is also clear: \u201cThe trial court properly grants summary judgment ... \u2018if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tyma v. Montgomery County, </em>369 Md. 497, 503-04, 801 A.2d 148, 152 (2002) (quoting <em>Jones v. Mid-Atlantic Funding Co., </em>362 Md. 661, 675-76, 766 A.2d 617, <em>624-25 (2001)). </em>Thus, in each of the appeals presently before the Court, \u201cour sole task is to determine whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. 525, 530-31, 697 A.2d 861, 864 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\n<em>PERTINENT PRINCIPLES OF SOUND STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, 412 </em>Md. 257, 987 A.2d 18 (2010), we recently outlined the well-established canons governing the process of sound statutory interpretation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature. A court\u2019s primary goal in interpreting statutory language is to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by the statutory provision under scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">To ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, we begin with the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction. We neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, and we do not construe a statute with \u201cforced or subtle interpretations\u201d that limit or extend its application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">We, however, do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we conf\u00edne strictly our interpretation of a statute\u2019s plain language to the isolated section alone. Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute. We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">Where the words of a statute are ambiguous and subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, or where the words are clear and unambiguous when viewed in isolation, but become ambiguous when read as part of a larger statutory scheme, a court must resolve the ambiguity by searching for legislative intent in other indicia, including the history of the legislation or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the legislative process. In resolving ambiguities, a court considers the structure of the statute, how it relates to other laws, its general purpose, and the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>In every case, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\"><em>Lockshin, </em>412 Md. at 274-78, 987 A.2d at 28-29 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In addition to these canons, it is a basic and longstanding principle of sound statutory interpretation that the State is not deemed to be bound by an enactment of the General Assembly unless the enactment specifically names the State or manifests a clear and indisputable intention that the State is to be bound. <em>Floyd v. Mayor and City Council of Balt., </em>407 Md. 461, 488, 966 A.2d 900, 916 (2009); <em>Atlantic Golf, Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Md. Econ. Dev.

State, </em>281 Md. 217, 223, 378 A.2d 1326, 1329 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Supplementing the foregoing for present purposes, remedial statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of claimants \u201cto suppress the evil and advance the remedy.\u201d <em>Haas v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>396 Md. 469, 495, 914 A.2d 735, 750-51 (2007); <em>Montgomery County Bd. of Educ. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., </em>383 Md. 527, 544, 860 A.2d 909, 919 (2004); <em>Marsheck v.

State, </em>359 Md. 492, 509, 754 A.2d 1018, 1028 (2000); <em>Bd. of Educ. v.

As noted <em>supra, </em>at the time the present actions commenced, \u00a7 42(a) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">Authorized.\u2014In Montgomery County, Prince George\u2019s County, and Howard County, in accordance with this subtitle, a person who is subjected to an act of discrimination prohibited by the county code may bring and maintain a civil action against the person who committed the alleged discriminatory act for damages, injunctive relief, or other civil relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">\u00a7 42(a). At issue in the present case is whether WSSC properly may be considered a \u201cperson\u201d subject to suits brought pursuant to \u00a7 42(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">According to WSSC, it does not qualify as a \u201cperson\u201d subject to actions for employment discrimination brought pursuant to \u00a7 42(a) and county anti-discrimination ordinances. The Commission maintains that, under well-established rules of construction, the term \u201cperson\u201d in a statute ordinarily does not include the State or its agencies and instrumentalities unless the statute provides specifically otherwise. WSSC notes first the obvious, that \u00a7 42(a) does not refer specifically to the State as a \u201cperson.\u201d As such, according to WSSC, the State and its agencies and instrumentalities are not \u201cpersons\u201d and, thus, as a State agency, WSSC is not a proper object for an employment discrimination suit under \u00a7 42(a). In addition, WSSC maintains that, if the Court were to determine that WSSC is a \u201cunique\u201d agency, rather than a more traditional State agency, it is nevertheless immune from suit under \u00a7 42(a) because nothing in \u00a7 42(a) suggests that the General Assembly intended for the section to apply to \u201cunique\u201d agencies. Finally, WSSC argues that the application of PGCC \u00a7 \u00a7 2-186 and 2-222 to it through \u00a7 42(a) would imbue im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>properly the County Code provisions with extra-territorial effect and render them unconstitutional general laws.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In countering WSSC\u2019s contentions, Phillips, Sillers, and Cartwright submit that the term \u201cperson,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 42(a), includes the State. In urging the Court to adopt their interpretation of \u00a7 42(a), they cite certain definitions contained in \u00a7 15, which, they maintain, indicate that the General Assembly intended for the term \u201cperson\u201d to include the State. Thus, in light of the rule of statutory construction that instructs a court to interpret similar, related statutes in harmony with each other, Phillips, Sillers, and Cartwright contend that the same definition of \u201cperson\u201d should apply to \u00a7 42(a). Therefore, in their view, because the term \u201cperson\u201d in \u00a7 42(a) includes the State, WSSC, a State agency or instrumentality, is subject to suits brought pursuant to that provision. In the alternative, they maintain that, even if \u00a7 42(a) does not apply to State agencies generally, WSSC\u2019s unique characteristics qualify it nevertheless as a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7 42(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">A. The Term \u201cPerson\u201d in \u00a7 42(a) is Ambiguous</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">We have long recognized that, in general, the term \u201cperson\u201d in a statute does not include the State and its agencies and instrumentalities. <em>Unnamed Physician v. Comm\u2019n on Med. Discipline, </em>285 Md. 1, 12, 400 A.2d 396, 402 (1979); <em>State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v.

Comm\u2019n, </em>152 Md. 566, 584, 137 A. 358, 365 (1927). We have noted additionally, however, that the State and its agencies and instrumentalities may fall within the purview of the term \u201cperson\u201d where such an intention is manifest. <em>Unnamed Physician, </em>285 Md. at 12, 400 A.2d at 402; <em>Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>280 Md. at 39, 371 A.2d at 647; <em>Harden, </em>277 Md. at 408, 354 A.2d at 822; <em>Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>232 Md. at 135, 192 A.2d at 93-94; <em>Huffman, </em>152 Md. at 584, 137 A. at 365. Whether the State should be considered as encompassed by the term \u201cperson\u201d depends upon the \u201clegislative environment\u201d surrounding the use of term \u201cperson,\u201d and, in reaching a conclusion on the issue, a reviewing court should look to the \u201csubject matter, the context, the legislative history, and the executive interpretation of the statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Coumantaros, </em>165 F.Supp. 695, 697 (D.Md.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Section 42(a) attempts no definition of the term \u201cperson.\u201d As such, under the general rule stated <em>supra, </em>the general assumption would be that the State and its agencies and instrumentalities are not subject to suits brought pursuant to \u00a7 42(a). We are mindful, however, of another canon of statutory construction, one that directs a reviewing court to interpret statutory provisions that are <em>in pari materia </em>(in other words, that deal with the same subject matter) consistently with each other. <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 673, 659 A.2d 1347, 1350 (1995) (\u201cWhen we are called upon to interpret two statutes that involve the same subject matter, have a common purpose, and form part of the same system, we read them in <em>pari materia </em>and construe them harmoniously.\u201d); <em>Unnamed Physician, </em>285 Md. at 10, 400 A.2d at 401; <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, </em>281 Md. 412, 418, 379 A.2d 1007, 1011 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Relying on this canon of statutory interpretation, Phillips, Sillers, and Cartwright direct our attention to the definitions contained in \u00a7 15 of Article 49B generally, which, in their view, suggest that the General Assembly intended for the term \u201cperson,\u201d as it is used in Article 49B, to include the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>and its agencies and instrumentalities. WSSC, on the other hand, contends that the definitions contained in \u00a7 15 are inapplicable to \u00a7 42(a) because \u00a7 15 rests in the subtitle of Article 49B entitled \u201cDiscrimination in Employment,\u201d whereas \u00a7 42(a) is contained within a separate subtitle entitled \u201cCivil Actions-Violations of County Discrimination Laws\u201d and states explicitly that its definitions are \u201cfor the purposes of this subtitle.\u201d We reject WSSC\u2019s contention. Although \u00a7 15 is contained within a different subtitle of Article 49B than \u00a7 42(a) and states that its definitions are confined to that subtitle, because both \u00a7 15 and \u00a7 42(a) nonetheless concern specifically discrimination in employment, we find it is appropriate, as part of our duty to construe harmoniously statutes that are <em>in pari materia, </em>to refer to the definitions contained in \u00a7 15 for guidance in the interpretation of the language used in \u00a7 42(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Section 15, entitled \u201cDefinitions,\u201d provides in pertinent part: For purposes of this subtitle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">(a) Person.\u2014The term \u201cperson\u201d includes one or more individuals, labor unions, partnerships, associations, corporations, legal representatives, mutual companies, joint-stock companies, trusts, unincorporated organizations, trustees, trustees in bankruptcy, or receivers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\u00a7 15(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> From that definition, it may appear that governmental agencies, such as WSSC, do not qualify as \u201cpersons\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 42(a). Section 15, however, provides additional definitions that cast doubt on such a final conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">(b) Employer.\u2014The term <em>\u201cemployer\u201d means a person </em>engaged in an industry or business who has fifteen or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>and any agent of such a person; <em>such term does include the State of Maryland </em>to the extent as may be provided in this article but such term does not include a bona fide private membership club (other than a labor organization) which is exempt from taxation under \u00a7 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\">(e) Employee.\u2014The <em>term \u201cemployee\u201d means an individual employed by an employer, except that \u201cemployee\u201d does not include any person elected to public office or any person chosen by the officer to be on the officer\u2019s personnel staff, </em>or an appointee in the policymaking level or an immediate advisor with respect to the exercise of the constitutional or legal powers of the office. The <em>exception set forth in the preceding sentence does not include employees subject to the State or local civil service laws.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\u00a7 15(b) and (e) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">As we see, the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d contained in \u00a7 15(b) provides that an \u201cemployer\u201d is a \u201cperson,\u201d and that \u201csuch term does include the State of Maryland.\u201d \u00a7 15(b). As such, two competing interpretations arise: (1) that the State is an \u201cemployer,\u201d which, in turn, is necessarily a \u201cperson,\u201d the position urged by Phillips, Sillers, and Cartwright; and, (2) that although an \u201cemployer\u201d is a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7 15(b), the use of a semi-colon in the definition suggests that the State is included separately as an \u201cemployer,\u201d not linked to the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d as a \u201cperson,\u201d the interpretation urged by WSSC. Confronted with both seemingly reasonable interpretations, it appears ambiguous whether the General Assembly intended for the State to be included in the term \u201cperson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Regarding the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d contained in \u00a7 15(e), we noted, in <em>Commission on Human Relations, </em>that, although the definition of \u201cperson\u201d in \u00a7 15(a) does not explicitly include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the State and its agencies and instrumentalities, \u00a7 15(e) \u201chas the effect of creating an ambiguity in [\u00a7 15] as a whole\u201d with regard to whether the State falls within the class of employers covered by Article 49B and subject to the Commission on Human Relation\u2019s investigatory powers. 280 Md. at 41, 371 A.2d at 648. In resolving the ambiguity, we noted that the General Assembly, in adding \u00a7 15(e), was attempting to conform Maryland\u2019s fair employee practices legislation to its federal counterpart, which included political subdivisions within its coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 371 A.2d at 648. In addition, we observed that \u201cthe last sentence of [\u00a7 15(e) ] has no function or meaning other than as part of a statutory scheme which includes the employees of local subdivisions within its protective ambit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to further the purpose of the statute and to avoid a construction that would render much of the language of \u00a7 15(e) mere surplusage, we held that, \u201csince its employees are protected by Art. 49B, [\u00a7 15(e) ], the City of Baltimore is subject to the investigatory authority of the commission in regard to the fair employment practices laws of this State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43, 371 A.2d at 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Although we found in <em>Commission on Human Relations </em>that political subdivisions of the State were subject to the provisions of Article 49B permitting the Commission on Human Relations to investigate claims of alleged employment discrimination, our holding in that case fails to establish conclusively that the General Assembly, in enacting \u00a7 42(a), intended for the scope of coverage which is applicable to investigations by the Commission on Human Relations to apply similarly to private actions brought in court against political subdivisions. Such a conclusion is buttressed by the fact that one of the significant underpinnings of our holding in <em>Commission on Human Relations </em>was the clearly expressed desire of the General Assembly to have \u00a7 15 conform to its federal counterpart. That rationale is not apposite, however, to the present cases because \u00a7 42(a) has no federal equivalent. As such, in light of the ambiguity remaining in the term \u201cperson,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 42(a), we turn to an examination of the legislative history of the statute for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>B. The Legislative History and Purpose of \u00a7 42(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">As observed by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Phillips, </em>\u00a7 42(a) had its genesis in a Montgomery County ordinance, namely, Montgomery County Code (\u201cMCC\u201d) \u00a7 27-20(a),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which authorized a private civil cause of action against individuals for employment discrimination occurring within the County.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>McCrory Corp. v. Fowler, </em>319 Md. 12, 570 A.2d 834 (1990), we considered whether Montgomery County\u2019s enactment of MCC \u00a7 27-20(a) exceeded the authority delegated to the County by the Charter Counties\u2019 Express Powers Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>McCrory, </em>319 Md. at 13, 570 A.2d at 834. We found that Montgomery County lacked the authority under the Express Powers Act to enact MCC \u00a7 27-20(a) because the provision of a private civil cause of action against individuals for employment discrimination in the County did not qualify as a \u201clocal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 570 A.2d at 834-35. Specifically, we noted that employment discrimination was \u201ca matter of statewide concern\u201d and that the General Assembly had not granted Montgomery County the power to enact MCC \u00a7 27-20(a). <em>Id. </em>at 20, 570 A.2d at 838. In addition, we observed that the creation of new causes of action in the courts has been accomplished traditionally on a statewide basis either by the General Assembly or by the Court of Appeals. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">In 1992, responding to our holding in <em>McCrory, </em>the General Assembly passed House Bill 722, which created the original version of \u00a7 42(a),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> thereby authorizing explicitly private civil actions for violations of the anti-discrimination provisions of the Montgomery County Code.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Preamble to House Bill 722 left no doubt that the purpose of the measure was to overrule legislatively our decision in <em>McCrory. </em>In no uncertain terms, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>WHEREAS, On March 7, 1990 the Maryland Court of Appeals invalidated Section 27-20(a) of the Montgomery County Code, which was enacted in 1973 and provides for private causes of action for violations of certain County discrimination laws; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">WHEREAS, The Maryland Court of Appeals held in <em>McCrory Corp. v. Fowler </em>that the Express Powers Act did not provide adequate authority to create private causes of actions and that the creation of a new private cause of action has traditionally been the province of the General Assembly or the Court of Appeals; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">WHEREAS, The General Assembly believes that it is important to provide full protection of the law to its citizens and that allowing private causes of action for violations of certain county discrimination laws, under certain circumstances, is appropriate;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">1992 Md. Laws 3446.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Of considerable import to the question posed by the present appeals, the \u201cFiscal Note\u201d concerning House Bill 722, prepared by the Department of Fiscal Services at the time of the bill\u2019s consideration to analyze the fiscal impact of the proposed changes on the State and local governments, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">\n<em>State Fiscal Impact Statement: No effect.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-10\">Local Fiscal Impact Statement: Expenditures may be affected as explained below. Revenues are unaffected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-11\">\n<em>State Expenditures: No effect.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-12\">\n<em>Local Expenditures: Local expenditures could be affected to the extent that the county becomes a defendant and incurs litigation and court costs.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">H.B. 722 (1992), Fiscal Note. The language of the Fiscal Note, suggesting that State expenditures would be unaffected by the passage of \u00a7 42(a), but that counties might be held liable as defendants in employment discrimination actions brought pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>suant to the section, makes clear then that the General Assembly intended that causes of action under \u00a7 42(a) alleging violations of the anti-discrimination provisions of the Montgomery County Code could not be filed against the State. The Fiscal Note, however, similarly displays the General Assembly\u2019s intention that \u00a7 42(a) would apply against Montgomery County itself. Based on this clear indication of legislative intent, we hold that the proper construction of the term \u201cperson\u201d in \u00a7 42(a) excludes generally the State and its agencies and instrumentalities, but includes county and local government entities. Having so held, we turn to determine whether, for purposes of \u00a7 42(a), WSSC qualifies as an agency or instrumentality of the State, or whether it is more properly considered a county or local entity for purposes of \u00a7 42(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">C. Whether WSSC is a State Agency or Instrumentality for Purposes of \u00a7 42(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Created by the General Assembly in 1918, WSSC is a bi-county entity imbued with jurisdiction over the Washington Suburban Sanitary District. Md.Code, Art. 29, \u00a7 l-102(a) (1957, 2003 Repl. Vol.). It is the primary provider of the public water supply and sewerage collection and treatment services for Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties. WSSC is a \u201chybrid\u201d entity, <em>see Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Elgin, </em>53 Md.App. 452, 454, 454 A.2d 408, 410 (1983), which defies simple and definitive categorization as either a \u201cState\u201d or \u201clocal\u201d agency or instrumentality for any and all purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">WSSC possesses certain characteristics indicative of State agency status. For example, WSSC possesses the power of eminent domain, Art. 29, \u00a7 l-202(c), and the ability to enter into contracts concerning water supply, sewerage, drainage systems, and waste or wastewater systems that have the full effect of a contract between the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland. Art. 29, \u00a7 1-206. In addition, Maryland\u2019s Secretary of Budget and Management oversees certain WSSC personnel matters, and, by state statute, increases in employee compensation by WSSC may not exceed increases author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ized for State employees. Art. 29, \u00a7 \u00a7 1-204 and 11-103. We also have noted that the General Assembly created WSSC by adoption of a public general law, rather than a public local law. <em>City of Bowie v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>249 Md. 611, 616, 241 A.2d 396, 399 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Furthermore, this Court held that WSSC is considered properly a State agency for purposes of determining the applicability of the doctrine of state sovereign immunity, although we also found that the General Assembly waived such immunity for matters within the scope of its responsibilities by allowing WSSC to sue and be sued and to raise revenue to pay judgments. <em>Katz v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>284 Md. 503, 509, 515, 397 A.2d 1027, 1031, 1033 (1979). We held that WSSC is a State agency subject to the requirements of the State Administrative Procedures Act. <em>Donocam Assocs. v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>302 Md. 501, 510, 489 A.2d 26, 30 (1985). Finally, we held that, as a State agency, WSSC is not subject to the running of statutes of limitations. <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Pride Homes, Inc., </em>291 Md. 537, 537, 435 A.2d 796, 797 (1981) (holding that \u201climitations do not run against the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission because it is an agency of the State\u201d). As WSSC points out, a number of other decisions of this Court refer to WSSC, in passing, as a State agency. <em>See, e.g., Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Utilities, Inc., </em>365 Md. 1, 6, 775 A.2d 1178, 1182 (2001) (noting that \u201cWSSC is a state agency, vested with broad authority to construct and operate water supply, sewerage, and storm water management systems in Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery Counties\u201d); <em>Utilities, Inc. v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>362 Md. 37, 42, 763 A.2d 129, 132 (2000) (stating that \u201c[t]he Commission, an agency of the State ... is authorized to provide water and sewage service to most of Prince George\u2019s County and to Montgomery County, Maryland\u201d); <em>Quesenberry v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>311 Md. 417, 424, 535 A.2d 481, 484 (1988) (observing that \u201cWSSC is a state agency, created by the Legislature through a public general law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Although WSSC contends otherwise, the preceding analysis does not establish conclusively that WSSC is considered properly a State agency for any and all purposes. Rather, an entity may qualify as a State agency for some purposes, while being classified as a local agency for other purposes. <em>See, e.g., Rucker v. Harford County, </em>316 Md. 275, 289-90, 558 A.2d 399, 406 (1989) (noting that, although the Court found sheriffs to be State officials under Maryland law, \u201cfor some purposes and in some contexts,\u201d a sheriff may be treated as a local government employee); <em>Clea v. Baltimore, </em>312 Md. 662, 670 n. 5, 541 A.2d 1303, 1306 n. 5 (1988) (\u2018We are aware, of course, that the General Assembly\u2019s designation of the Baltimore City Police Department as a state agency would not be controlling for all purposes.\u201d); <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. C.I. Mitchell &amp; Best Co., </em>303 Md. 544, 561, 495 A.2d 30, 38 (1985) (stating that WSSC \u201cis a state agency which is out of the mainstream,\u201d but holding nevertheless that WSSC \u201cis not a state agency within the meaning of Art. 81, \u00a7 215,\u201d a statute authorizing individuals to file claims against State agencies to collect refunds for money \u201cerroneously or mistakenly paid\u201d to the agency, because WSSC\u2019s budget \u201cis not included in the state budget submitted by the Governor and approved by the General Assembly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Despite possessing certain characteristics common to State agencies, WSSC is a unique entity, autonomous in many ways from the constraints and characteristics of most other State agencies. Its scope is entirely local in nature. The Commission is composed of six commissioners, three representing Montgomery County and three representing Prince George\u2019s County. Art. 29, \u00a7 1\u2014102(b). Each member of WSSC is appointed by the County Executive and confirmed by the County Council of the member\u2019s respective County. <em>Id. </em>A commissioner may be removed before the completion of his or her term only by action of the respective County Executive and County Council from the County that appointed the commissioner.

Beyond its statutory independence, it is worth noting that WSSC is represented in litigation matters by its own in-house legal counsel, rather than the State Attorney General\u2019s Office.

It is important to note that, in the decisions of this Court which found WSSC to be a State agency for purposes of state sovereign immunity, the State Administrative Procedures Act, and the running of statutes of limitations, we were confronted with the task of interpreting statutes that, unlike \u00a7 42(a), were not of a remedial nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\">. WSSC maintains that, if it is considered a \"person\u201d under \u00a7 42(a) subject to causes of action for violations of county anti-discrimination ordinances, such as PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 2-186 and 2-222, the county ordinances will be rendered unconstitutional \"general laws\u201d because they will have an improper extra-territorial effect. <em>See Holiday Universal, Inc. v. Montgomery County, </em>377 Md. 305, 317-19, 833 A.2d 518, 525-27 (2003) (invalidating as an unconstitutional general law a Montgomery County consumer protection ordinance which, in the Court's view, could have a \"major impact on services performed for people in the rest of the State, or even the rest of the world, based simply on a contract having been signed in Montgomery County\u201d). According to this argument, because WSSC has the statutory ability to levy additional <em>ad valorem </em>taxes on citizens of Montgomery County in order to pay judgments levied against it for violations of the Prince George\u2019s County Code, enforcement of any judgments in the present cases could \"conceivably impact\u201d improperly property tax assessments in Montgomery County. Such an argument is unavailing, however. Any improper extra-territorial effect that WSSC complains of would not result from the provisions of the Prince George\u2019s County Code, which regulate only discrimination occurring within the County by employers with a significant presence in the County. Rather, such \"unconstitutional\u201d action would be self-created by WSSC\u2019s decision to levy such a tax on citizens of Montgomery County (which, as WSSC admitted at oral argument, it has never done). In addition, it is clear that any potential \u201cimpact\u201d on citizens of Montgomery County would come as the result of \u00a7 42(a), the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>statute creating the cause of action, rather than the provisions of the Prince George\u2019s County Code, which serve only to identify the type of discrimination prohibited under County law. <em>See generally, Edwards Sys.

Because we have determined that WSSC is a local entity for purposes of \u00a7 42(a) and the county anti-discrimination ordinances, we need not consider its contentions in this regard. Assuming, however, that WSSC were to adjust its argument and maintain that the County Code provisions were not intended to apply to any governmental entities, even those qualifying as \u201cpersons\u201d under \u00a7 42(a), we note that the County Code bars race-based discrimination in the County by an \"employer,\u201d defined by the County Code to include Prince George\u2019s County government.
