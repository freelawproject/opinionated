Reid\u2019s medical history while in the institution revealed a diagnosis of high blood pressure, human immunodeficiency virus and end-stage renal disease.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In July 2007, prison medical personnel diagnosed Reid with end-stage renal disease and prescribed the application of kidney dialysis three times per week.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Initially, Reid consented to the dialysis treatment; however, even though he understood the medical consequences of ceasing dialysis (serious bodily injury and even death), he eventually requested that all treatment be terminated. As a result of his refusal to submit to kidney dialysis in April 2008, the petitioner, J. Michael Stouffer, Commissioner of Correction (\u201cCommissioner\u201d), filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to compel Reid to submit to kidney dialysis and medical treatment that medical professionals had determined was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">This case presents the question of whether the Commissioner presented sufficient evidence to override a competent adult inmate\u2019s right to object to life-sustaining medical treatment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We shall hold that, under the circumstances of the present case, the Commissioner\u2019s non-specific claim of preservation of life, safety, and security was insufficient to demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Reid\u2019s refusal of medical treatment would cause a disruption or impact safety in the institution, or endanger the ethics of the medical profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Following a hearing in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the court denied the Commissioner\u2019s request for an injunction. The Commissioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Pending the appeal, the Commissioner obtained a temporary injunction permitting Reid\u2019s physicians to continue providing Reid with dialysis and other necessary medical treatment. Prior to expiration of the temporary injunction, the Commissioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and a motion for injunction pending appeal, which this Court denied. Subsequently, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court denying the Commissioner\u2019s request for an order requiring that Reid submit to kidney dialysis. <em>Stouffer v. Reid, </em>184 Md.App. 268, 965 A.2d 96 (2009). The Commissioner filed an additional petition for a writ of certiorari, which we granted. <em>Stouffer v. Reid, </em>409 Md. 44, 972 A.2d 859 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The underlying facts are not in dispute. We shall adopt the facts as found by the Circuit Court judge at the hearing held on May 1, 2008, and as subsequently adopted by the Court of Special Appeals in its opinion in <em>Stouffer, </em>184 Md.App. at 273-76, 965 A.2d at 99-100:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">[T]he trial judge, in an oral ruling from the bench, denied [the Commissioner\u2019s] request for an permanent injunction and declared that [Reid] had the right to refuse kidney dialysis and other medical treatment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">[The Commissioner] is the head of the Department of Correction. He ... [has] the responsibility of maintaining the operation of the correctional institutions in the State of Maryland____ [Reid] is an inmate within the Department of Correction ... [and is] a charge of [the Commissioner]. [The Commissioner] has the responsibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ty of insuring [safety] ... and providing] proper medical treatment and care for ... inmates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">\u00edj\u00ab <em>% </em>s|i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">The testimony submitted by [the Commissioner] ... is that failure to abide by that medical treatment ... would negatively impact this inmate. It would impact his heart, his heartbeat, the regularity of his heartbeat, that may cause a heart attack; is that it would cause fluid to build up in the body that is not being taken out of the body under normal means and that fluid may build up in his leg, in his face, in his lungs, and in his lungs could cause respiratory failure and that respiratory failure could lead to heart attack or death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">[T]he inmate also has high blood pressure and that failure to receive the treatment in question may impact negatively to his high blood pressure. The impact could lead to the heightening of his blood pressure, that also could lead to stroke.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">Maryland is clear that a mentally competent adult may refuse medical care, even though the refusal may result in his or her death, and that unless there are compelling State interests which override the person\u2019s interest in their body\u2019s integrity, as the <em>Mack[</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>case says, is that the Court should recognize it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">In this case ... [what the Commissioner] is saying, [Reid], is that he recognizes that you are a competent individual and he recognizes that you have not been a troubling impact overall while in this facility. That is clearly what is being said here is that you have not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>disrupted the system; is that it is, in fact, raising the question of concern (a) for your health and trying to make sure that you receive the medical treatment that he and the medical providers say are necessary.... [I]t\u2019s been determined by the doctors that you need this treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">[M]y concern is as to whether or not the countervailing State interest in this case, as identified by the Court of Appeals, does apply. One of the countervailing factors is preserving your life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">The other is around the safety and the safety of others and whether or not it\u2019s there. Well, I\u2019m not hearing that you\u2019re doing this to cause [something to happen] and ... that it will simply pass.... The Court\u2019s question of [Reid] is he trying to kill himself and he said, no, that\u2019s not the case, and so prevention of suicide is not it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">The maintenance of ethical integrity of the medical profession or the medical treatment is the last point of the balancing ... [and] the medical profession has made it clear is that they believe this is needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">* * * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">I don\u2019t like playing Russian roulette with anyone\u2019s life.... However, on this date, the Court is satisfied that the inmate is aware that he has been advised that the medical treatment that\u2019s being offered to him is appropriate and necessary, and that refusal to receive that medical treatment maybe harmful to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">This Court believes that [Reid] is competent, but ill-informed in his own wisdom. However, the Court denies the request at this time. The motion for permanent injunction is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">In a written order issued on May 2, 2008, the trial court denied [the Commissioner\u2019s] request for a permanent injunction and issued a declaratory judgment on May 6, 2008, memorializing the May 1, 2008 oral ruling. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>based its declaratory judgment that \u201cthe state interests in forcing [Reid] to undergo dialysis does not outweigh [Reid\u2019s] right to refuse medical care on the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">(1) [Reid] has been diagnosed with, among other medical conditions, end-stage kidney disease, for which he should receive dialysis three times a week. [Reid] has refused this treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">(2) There has been no argument or suggestion that [Reid] is not a competent adult.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">(B) [The Commissioner], in his responsibility to oversee and maintain the proper medical care of prisoners, has petitioned this court requesting permanent injunctive relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">(4) Citing <em>Mack v. Mack, supra, </em>the court concluded that a patient has a right to refuse treatment, but this right is not absolute. This right must be balanced against the state interests of the preservation of life, protection of innocent third parties interests, suicide prevention, and the maintenance of the ethical integrity of the medical profession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">(5) [Reid] is not contemplating suicide, nor is there evidence that his refusal has caused any disruption in the operation of the prison system, nor is there any indication that he seeks to cause a disturbance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">(6) [The Commissioner] showed proper concern for the negative impact [Reid\u2019s] choice could have upon the prison community, but there has been no evidence presented that [Reid] has made any attempt to disrupt the order of the prison, nor is there any evidence suggesting the actions of [Reid] would cause disruption to the prison community, and no evidence has been presented showing that [Reid\u2019s] choice has harmed the integrity of the medical profession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">Additional facts will be presented as necessary for purposes of our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The Commissioner contends that he is entitled to compel Reid to submit to kidney dialysis and medical treatment because the State\u2019s legitimate interest in the orderly and safe operation of the state prison system outweighs Reid\u2019s right to refuse medical treatment. According to the Commissioner, both the Court of Special Appeals and the Circuit Court \u201cfailed to give appropriate deference to the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner regarding the impact of Reid\u2019s refusal to receive life-sustaining medical treatment.\u201d The intermediate appellate court\u2019s conclusion that the State has not shown a legitimate penological interest in forcing Reid to submit to dialysis, the Commissioner contends, \u201coverlooks the effect of the inmate\u2019s refusal to receive life-sustaining treatment on prison security.\u201d Finally, the Commissioner maintains that \u201cthe State\u2019s interest in preserving Reid\u2019s life\u201d and the need to \u201cmaintain ... the ethical integrity of the medical profession outweigh[ ] Reid\u2019s limited right to refuse medical treatment\u201d and \u201chis limited interest in refusing medical treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">To the contrary, Reid contends that \u201c[the Commissioner] failed to establish a sufficient factual basis constituting a countervailing State interest under <em>Mack v. Mack, </em>329 Md. 188, [618] A.2d [744] (1993).\u201d In addition to failing to establish \u201cany of the four factors enumerated in <em>Mack v. Mack, supra,\u201d </em>Reid maintains that we should reject the Commissioner\u2019s invitation to expand our decision in <em>Mack, </em>thereby creating an exception that would override Reid\u2019s qualified common law right to refuse medical treatment. According to Reid, the evidence does not support the conclusion that his refusal to accept medical treatment constituted a threat to maintenance of prison security and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Moreover, Reid points out that the State\u2019s authority over prisons and the need to maintain security does not automatically afford the Commissioner the discretion to compel an inmate to submit to medical treatment. Reid maintains that the evidence in this case does not support the proposition that he had any specific intent to \u201cmanipulate corrections officials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>or prison policies.\u201d Thus, according to Reid, \u201c[a] significant component in assessing penological interest, is whether there is the presence of a direct threat, a protest or manipulation of prison officials.\u201d Reid asserts that here, as the Court of Special Appeals concluded, no such argument was advanced by the Commissioner nor does the record reflect that Reid \u201cis a direct threat to the safety and well being of others\u201d or \u201cthat [Reid] is protesting any prison policies or attempting to manipulate an official.\u201d Finally, Reid contends that his decision to refuse medical treatment did not threaten the integrity of the medical profession because it was an informed decision made with full knowledge of the risks involved in refusing medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">As the Court of Special Appeals observed, the Commissioner attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Mack, </em>329 Md. 188, 618 A.2d 744, on the basis that in <em>Mack </em>we did not address the unique circumstances involved when the right to refuse medical treatment is asserted by a prison inmate. We note at the outset that the <em>Mack </em>case did not involve a prison inmate\u2019s refusal to accept medical treatment. In <em>Mack, </em>in the context of whether Maryland law authorized the withholding of life support to a previously competent, adult ward of the court, we had occasion to review the right of a patient, generally, under Maryland law to refuse medical treatment. <em>Mack, </em>329 Md. at 210-11, 618 A.2d at 755-56. We explained that the \u201cfountainhead of the doctrine [of informed consent] is the patient\u2019s right to exercise control over his own body, ... by deciding for himself [or herself] whether or not to submit to the particular therapy.\u201d <em>Mack, </em>329 Md. at 210, 618 A.2d at 755 (quoting <em>Sard v. Hardy, </em>281 Md. 432, 439, 379 A.2d 1014, 1019 (1977)). Further, we pointed out that \u201c[a] corollary to the doctrine is the patient\u2019s right, in general, to refuse treatment and to withdraw consent to treatment once begun.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In acknowledging this common law right of a mentally competent patient to refuse medical treatment under non-emergency circumstances, we emphasized that it is not an absolute right. It is a right subject to \u201cat least four counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>vailing State interests: (1) the preservation of life; (2) the protection of interests of innocent third parties; (3) the prevention of suicide; and (4) the maintenance of the ethical integrity of the medical profession.\u201d <em>Mack, </em>329 Md. at 210 n. 7, 618 A.2d at 755 n. 7 (quoting <em>Brophy v. New Eng. Sinai Hosp., Inc., </em>398 Mass. 417, 497 N.E.2d 626, 634 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In <em>Mack, </em>329 Md. at 211, 618 A.2d at 756, we decided the case before us based upon an application of the common law right of a competent adult to refuse medical treatment. We acknowledged that there is considerable decisional case law in other jurisdictions holding that a person\u2019s right to refuse treatment is based on a federal or state constitutional right to privacy, <em>see, e.g., Rasmussen v. Fleming, </em>154 Ariz. 207, 741 P.2d 674, 681-82 (1987), or on a constitutionally protected liberty interest guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, <em>Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>497 U.S. 261, 278, 110 S.Ct. 2841, 2851, 111 L.Ed.2d 224, 241-42 (1990). Ultimately, we did not base our decision on constitutional principles. <em>See Mack, </em>329 Md. at 211, 618 A.2d at 756 (\u201cThere [was] no issue that turn[ed] on whether the right to refuse treatment is a constitutional or common-law right.\u201d Thus, we decided the case \u201cunder the Maryland common-law right of a competent adult to refuse treatment.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">In <em>Mack, </em>329 Md. at 210 n. 7, 618 A.2d at 755 n. 7, we identified \u201cat least\u201d four countervailing State interests to consider in determining whether the State\u2019s interests outweighed the patient\u2019s right to refuse medical treatment. In so doing, we, in effect, acknowledged that there may be other interests. A consideration not directly involved in <em>Mack, </em>but directly involved in the present case, is the State\u2019s interest in maintaining prison security, order, and discipline. Accordingly, we shall evaluate the inmate\u2019s right to refuse medical treatment in light of the State\u2019s interest in maintaining a safe and orderly prison under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The Circuit Court, in rendering its decision, considered the four factors outlined in the <em>Mack </em>decision. In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>court determined that \u201cthere [has been] no evidence [presented] that [Reid] has caused any disruption in the operation of the prison system, nor is there any indication that he seeks to cause a disturbance.\u201d Just as the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals did, we shall review this case in light of the <em>Mack </em>factors. Also, we shall consider whether the State\u2019s interest in maintaining the safety, security, and good order of its prisons constitutes a legitimate penological interest and whether that interest outweighs Reid\u2019s common law right to refuse kidney dialysis. In reviewing this case, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 assessment that \u201c[t]he present case does not involve a facial challenge to a prison policy or regulation.\u201d <em>Stouffer, </em>184 Md.App. at 289, 965 A.2d at 108. In this case, \u201cour focus is very narrow and limited to [the application of a prison policy] to [Reid] and [the] specific eircumstance[s]\u201d of this case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Preservation of Life</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Commissioner contends that we should adopt the reasoning of the Iowa Supreme Court in <em>Polk County Sheriff v. Iowa District Court for Polk County, </em>594 N.W.2d 421 (Iowa 1999), and conclude that, because Reid\u2019s condition is treatable and non-terminal, \u201ccoupled with the absence of serious side effects, ... the State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life weighs heavily in the balance.\u201d In addition, the Commissioner maintains that even though there are legal and factual similarities between the present case and <em>Polk, </em>the Court of Special Appeals nonetheless disregarded <em>Polk </em>and chose to rely on cases that \u201carose outside a prison context, and [did not] involve[ ] a refusal to undergo kidney dialysis.\u201d Accordingly, the Commissioner asserts that this Court should look to both <em>Polk </em>and <em>Commissioner of Correction v. Myers, </em>379 Mass. 255, 399 N.E.2d 452 (1979), for guidance and conclude that the State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life outweighs the inmates\u2019s right to refuse medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Reid counters, arguing that \u201cthere is nothing in the record of this case that compelled a finding ... [that the State\u2019s interest in preserving this patient\u2019s life will override the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>individual\u2019s decision to refuse medical treatment].\u201d According to Reid, the Commissioner\u2019s expressed concerns regarding the preservation of life factor simply \u201care insufficient for [a court] to divest a competent adult of his right to refuse medical treatment.\u201d <em>Stouffer, </em>184 Md.App. at 288, 965 A.2d at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The Court of Special Appeals acknowledged \u201c[t]hat [Reid] suffer[s] from kidney disease\u201d and that this fact \u201cwas established beyond any doubt at the hearing.\u201d <em>Stouffer, </em>184 Md. App. at 280, 965 A.2d at 103. According to Dr. Telda, a physician employed by the State\u2019s prison medical contractor, Reid needed to receive \u201cmedical treatment and dialysis for his end-stage renal disease and related illnesses,\u201d otherwise, \u201c[he] would suffer serious bodily injury or death.\u201d <em>Stouffer, </em>184 Md.App. at 279-80, 965 A.2d at 102. The intermediate appellate court also pointed out that \u201cthe trial judge expressly acknowledged that [Reid\u2019s] failure to accept medical treatment was potentially life-threatening,\u201d <em>Stouffer, </em>184 Md.App. at 280, 965 A.2d at 103, and that Reid \u201cis a competent adult who, notwithstanding being \u2018ill-informed in his own wisdom,\u2019 ... expressly stated his desire to forego medical treatment that he finds objectionable.\u201d <em>Stouffer, </em>184 Md.App. at 283, 965 A.2d at 104. In reaching the conclusion that the preservation of life factor was not sufficient to overcome a competent adult\u2019s choice to refuse medical treatment, the Court of Special Appeals carefully considered the specific facts of this case. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">Although [the Commissioner] advances a legitimate concern relating to the \u201cpreservation of life\u201d factor, such an interest is not sufficient to overcome a competent adult\u2019s choice to refuse medical treatment. Notably, [Reid\u2019s] skepticism about his condition arises from the information that was provided to him from medical professionals that turned out to be inaccurate; namely, that he would immediately suffer severe symptoms if he discontinued dialysis, which subsequently did not happen when [Reid] ceased dialysis for weeks at a time. We note the same concerns as the circuit court regarding [Reid\u2019s] understanding as to the seriousness of his condition, but such concerns are insufficient for us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>divest a competent adult of his right to refuse medical treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\"><em>Stouffer, </em>184 Md.App. at 283, 965 A.2d at 104-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">In <em>Polk, </em>594 N.W.2d at 423, Jerrell Brown, a pre-trial detainee, was held in the Polk County jail awaiting trial on drug related charges. While in jail, he received kidney dialysis treatments three times per week at Lutheran Hospital for a year and subsequently refused to continue with the dialysis treatments. <em>Polk, </em>594 N.W.2d at 424. The County Sheriff filed an application in the district court seeking an order to compel Brown to submit to emergency treatment stemming from his refusal to continue dialysis. <em>Polk, </em>594 N.W.2d at 423. Medical testimony presented at the hearing for emergency treatment revealed that Brown\u2019s kidneys were \u201cminimally functional\u201d and unless Brown received the treatment, \u201che would die within one week,\u201d probably due to cardiac arrest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Brown did not testify at the hearing. <em>Id. </em>A psychiatrist who evaluated Brown one day before the hearing testified. <em>Id. </em>The court considered both his oral testimony and written report. <em>Id. </em>According to the psychiatrist, \u201cBrown was competent, appeared to be of at least average intelligence, and understood the risks of ... discontinuing the treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The psychiatrist testified further that, \u201cBrown said that spending any further time in any correctional facility was unacceptable and that he was going to stop his dialysis treatment \u201cwhether he was looking at another month, or another year, or another five years\u2019 in incarceration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The psychiatrist\u2019s report also revealed that Brown stated that \u201che was tired of the routine of being taken to the hospital in jail garb and in manacles only to have to return to jail.\u201d <em>Polk, </em>594 N.W.2d at 425. Further, according to statements in the report attributable to Brown, \u201c \u2018[Brown] ... decided to refuse any future dialysis until March 4, 1999,\u2019 which according to Brown was his pretrial conference date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen [the psychiatrist] expressed doubt that Brown could live until March 4, Brown responded that he really did not care.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>As Brown explained, \u201cI\u2019d be dead, so there would be nothing to worry about.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The district court judge concluded that under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Brown\u2019s liberty interest was superior to the State\u2019s interest in compelling Brown to submit to dialysis. <em>Id. </em>As a result, the court rejected the Sheriffs request for an order compelling medical treatment. <em>Id. </em>Subsequently, the Sheriff filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Iowa Supreme Court, which was granted. <em>Id. </em>The Iowa Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">In balancing Brown\u2019s diminished liberty interest to refuse treatment against the State\u2019s countervailing interests in preserving life, preventing suicide, protecting the interests of innocent third parties, maintaining the ethical integrity in the medical profession, and maintaining prison security, order, and discipline, we conclude the State\u2019s interests must prevail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\"><em>Polk, </em>594 N.W.2d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The court reasoned that ordinarily \u201ca state\u2019s interests in [preserving] life are strong, [but] such interests standing alone will usually not preclude a competent person from declining life-sustaining medical treatment.\u201d <em>Polk, </em>594 N.W.2d at 426. The underlying rationale for this approach, the court explained, is that \u201cthe life the state is seeking to protect in such a situation is the life of the same person who has competently decided to forego the medical intervention; it is not some other actual or potential life that cannot adequately protect itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted). Notwithstanding, in Brown\u2019s case \u201cthe State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life weigh[ed] heavily in the balance\u201d because \u201ccompelling Brown to submit to dialysis \u2018d[id] not involve a situation where \u2018heavy physical and emotional burdens\u2019 would be imposed to effect a brief and uncertain delay in the natural process of death.\u2019 \u201d <em>Polk, </em>594 N.W.2d at 427 (quoting <em>Myers, </em>399 N.E.2d at 456). In its analysis, the Iowa Supreme Court indicated that the State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life \u201cd[id] not alone control Brown\u2019s right to refuse treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the court reasoned that it \u201cmust also factor into [the] balancing process the magnitude of the invasion brought about by dialysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in the court\u2019s view, the degree of invasiveness was minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Apparently, the fact that death was certain, in the event that Brown discontinued dialysis, and that the dialysis procedure \u201cis not painful and produces no serious side effects\u201d informed the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s decision that the State\u2019s interest in preserving life weighed heavy in the balance. <em>Id. </em>In rendering its decision, the court gave little or no consideration to the mental and emotional pain to Brown resulting from unwanted kidney dialysis treatment. <em>Polk, </em>594 N.W.2d at 433 (Snell, J., dissenting); <em>see also Brophy, </em>497 N.E.2d at 637 (acknowledging that \u201cthe invasiveness of the treatment sought to be terminated is an important factor to be considered in balancing the individual\u2019s and the State\u2019s interests,\u201d but agreeing to adopt the view expressed by the New Jersey courts that \u201cthe primary focus should be the patient\u2019s desires and experience of pain and enjoyment\u2014not the type of treatment involved\u201d) (internal citations omitted); <em>Myers, </em>399 N.E.2d at 457 (noting that dialysis \u201cis a relatively complex procedure, which requires considerable commitment and endurance from the patient who must undergo the treatment three times a week\u201d).

Ordinarily, courts defer to prison officials to make difficult judgments concerning institutional operations. <em>Id. </em>In determining whether a regulation, policy, rule or restriction impermissibly burdens the exercise of a constitutional right, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Turner, </em>directs the court to assess the overall reasonableness of the institutional restriction on the exercise of an inmate\u2019s constitutional rights by weighing four factors. \u201cFirst, there must be a \u2018valid, rational connection\u2019 between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct. at 2262, 96 L.Ed.2d at 79 (quotation omitted). This connection must not be \u201cso remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 89-90, 107 S.Ct. at 2262, 96 L.Ed.2d at 79. Prison regulations or policies based upon \u201cexaggerated\u201d concerns are not reasonably related to any state interest. <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 97-98, 107 S.Ct. at 2266-67, 96 L.Ed.2d at 84. Moreover, prison regulations and policies grounded on \u201cwhims ... about prospective hypothetical situations\u201d or \u201cspeculative and uncertain anxieties\u201d do not satisfy the <em>Turner </em>standard of reasonableness. <em>See Campos v. Coughlin, Commissioner New York State Dep\u2019t of Correctional Services, </em>854 F.Supp. 194, 209 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (holding that speculation that Santer\u00eda beads would exacerbate gang violence was unfounded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>when Catholic rosary beads and Christian crosses caused no violence). Likewise, the possibility of an adverse impact upon a governmental interest will not justify the restriction on the exercise of a constitutional right. <em>See Turley v. Adel Community Sch.

Third, a court must take into account the costs that accommodating the right would impose on other inmates, guards, and prison resources generally. <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 90, 107 S.Ct. at 2262, 96 L.Ed.2d at 79-80. And fourth, a court must consider whether there are alternatives to the regulation that \u201cfully accommodate[ ] the prisoner\u2019s rights at <em>de minimis </em>cost to valid penological interests.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 90-91, 107 S.Ct. at 2262, 96 L.Ed.2d at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, in the present case, pointed out correctly that the <em>Turner </em>analysis \u201cdoes not assist us in \u2018balancing the competing interests\u2019 of [Reid] and [the State]\u201d because <em>Turner </em>involved a facial challenge to a prison regulation. <em>Stouffer, </em>184 Md.App. at 289, 965 A.2d at 108. In other words, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Turner, </em>provided the framework for determining whether a prison regulation or restriction was reasonable on its face. Here, however, we are reviewing a challenge to a specific prison directive as applied to Reid. <em>See McNabb v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>163 Wash.2d 393, 180 P.3d 1257, 1264-65 (2008) (acknowledging that <em>\u201cTurner </em>delineates the State\u2019s ... compelling interest in maintaining security and orderly administration in its prison system\u201d and the \u201cdue deference [given correctional authorities] regarding the manner in which the officials carry out their mandate to provide medical services to incarcerated individuals\u201d). Nonetheless, we agree with the Supreme Court of Washington, in <em>McNabb, </em>that the State\u2019s interest in maintaining security and order in prison and due deference given to prison officials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>\u201cshould be considered in addition to the four established compelling state interests\u201d implicated by refusal of medical treatment, as adopted by this Court in <em>Mack v.

Thus, the court in that case was justified in deferring to the professional expertise of correctional authorities, in the absence of any substantial evidence in the record that the correctional officials exaggerated their response to preserve internal order and discipline. <em>See Polk, </em>594 N.W.2d at 430. Furthermore, in <em>Polk, </em>the appellate court explained, on the basis of the record before the court, that \u201cthe chief jailer\u2019s concerns that other inmates would \u2018copycat\u2019 Brown\u2019s actions as an excuse to get out of jail\u201d were reasonable and that there was no substantial evidence that \u201cthe chief jailer\u2019s application to the district court was an exaggerated response to Brown\u2019s refusal\u201d to submit to dialysis treatment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The court in <em>Polk </em>acknowledged that a State\u2019s interests in \u201c[m]aintaining security and preserving internal order and discipline \u2018are essential goals that may require limitation or retraction of the retained constitutional rights of ... prisoners.\u2019 \u201d <em>Polk, </em>594 N.W.2d at 430 (quoting <em>Bell, </em>441 U.S. at 546, 99 S.Ct. at 1878, 60 L.Ed.2d at 473; <em>Procunier v.

Particularly, the Commissioner maintains that \u201c[wjhere ... there is an absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations,\u201d the \u201ccourts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters.\u201d Through testimony before the trial court, Commissioner Stouffer expressed \u201cconcern that Reid\u2019s injury or death as a result of his refusal to receive medical treatment may increase \u2018angst\u2019 within the general population.\u201d This the Commissioner predicted would lead \u201cto disruption and disorder through peaceful protests or potentially through acts of violence.\u201d In addition, according to Assistant Commissioner Watson\u2019s affidavit, filed in these proceedings, \u201cReid\u2019s actions require a \u2018substantial and disproportionate utilization of limited case management, medical and psychological resources.\u2019 \u201d According to the Commissioner, in the Assistant Commissioner\u2019s view, as Reid\u2019s health deteriorates, the demand upon institutional resources will increase and morale of staff will diminish. Further, Commissioner Watson predicted that if Reid is allowed to manipulate resources by refusing medical care, his \u201ccondition will create a perception that the administration is not in control of the inmate population.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">No testimony was presented, however, as to why the concerns expressed by the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner would be any different if Reid were compelled to submit to weekly dialysis treatment. Thus, in our view, if the court is to defer to the expert judgment of correction officials, that judgment must be reasonable and informed. <em>See Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 93, 107 S.Ct. at 2264, 96 L.Ed.2d at 82 (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>that the standard is whether the actions of prison officials were \u201creasonably related to valid corrections goals\u201d and not \u201can exaggerated response to those objectives\u201d); <em>Jones, </em>433 U.S. at 128, 97 S.Ct. at 2539, 53 L.Ed.2d at 640 (holding that regulations prohibiting inmates from soliciting other inmates to join a prisoner\u2019s union were reasonable and consistent with legitimate operational considerations of the prison). In this case, the evidence presented was merely speculative, which is insufficient under <em>Turner </em>to present a \u201cvalid, rational connection\u201d between the infringement on Reid\u2019s right to refuse medical treatment and the legitimate governmental interests asserted. Here, the trial judge noted that consideration of the impact on institutional operations was an appropriate penological objective of the corrections system; however, the evidence presented at the hearing did not persuade the court that the correction officials\u2019 conclusions were reasonable and supported by the evidence. In effect, the trial court determined that, based upon the evidence presented, or lack thereof, the correctional officials exaggerated their response to Reid\u2019s refusal to submit to dialysis treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Maintaining the Integrity of the Medical Profession</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The Commissioner cites <em>Polk </em>as authority to support his claim that the ethical integrity of the medical profession has been impaired by Reid\u2019s refusal to submit to kidney dialysis. <em>See Polk, </em>594 N.W.2d at 428 (holding that the ethical integrity of the medical profession was impaired by permitting the inmate, Brown, to refuse kidney dialysis). In addition, the Commissioner contends that \u201cReid\u2019s ill-informed refusal to accept standard medical treatment for a set of non-terminal conditions impairs the ethical integrity of his physicians.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals stated that it failed to see how the medical profession has been harmed by Reid\u2019s refusal to accept treatment, and likewise, so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The intermediate appellate court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">[T]he circuit court found that [Reid] is a competent adult who has expressly stated his desire to forego medical treatment he finds objectionable. [The Commissioner] has ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>glected to illuminate any ethical dilemma on which to base his argument. Medical professions continue to provide ... diagnoses and continue to attempt to treat patients with no question as to their ethics or integrity. Furthermore, in light of the well-defined right of an individual to refuse medical treatment, discussed <em>supra, </em>and having been provided no authority by [the Commissioner] to indicate otherwise, we hold that the ethical integrity of the medical profession is not harmed by allowing [Reid], a competent adult, to refuse medical treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><em>Stouffer, </em>184 Md.App. at 285, 965 A.2d at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The Iowa Supreme Court in <em>Polk </em>determined that \u201cpreserving the ethical integrity of [the medical professional\u2019s] recommendation [of treatment] also favors [the] decision to compel treatment\u201d because if Brown would voluntarily submit to dialysis treatment, his submission would be consistent with the medical professionals\u2019 recommendation in helping to prolong Brown\u2019s life. <em>Polk, </em>594 N.W.2d at 428. In our review of that opinion, we are not persuaded that Brown\u2019s refusal to submit to kidney dialysis had any effect on the integrity of the medical profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In the present case, merely because health care professionals recommended kidney dialysis or other treatment for Reid, and he rejected that recommendation, his rejection did not harm the integrity of the medical professional. An inmate, by virtue of his incarceration, is not divested of his right to disagree with his medical providers. Although Reid has both a common law and constitutional right to refuse unwanted medical treatment, <em>Mack, </em>329 Md. at 210-11, 618 A.2d at 755; <em>see also Cruzan, </em>497 U.S. at 277, 110 S.Ct. at 2851, 111 L.Ed.2d at 241, in the present case we base our decision on Reid\u2019s common law right to refuse medical treatment and therefore need not reach the constitutional question. As noted by courts in other jurisdictions, a patient\u2019s right of self-determination, ordinarily, is superior to the considerations of the medical profession as to treatment options. <em>See Thor, </em>21 Cal.Rptr.2d 357, 855 P.2d at 386 (noting that \u201cpatient autonomy and medical ethics are not reciprocals; one does not come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>at the expense of the other\u201d); <em>Myers, </em>399 N.E.2d at 458 (noting that the interest in maintaining the integrity of the medical profession is not controlling because a \u201cpatient\u2019s right of self-determination would normally be superior to ... institutional concerns\u201d of the government and medical profession).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The Commissioner also asserts that the trial court\u2019s written finding that Reid\u2019s refusal of treatment did not affect the integrity of the medical profession contradicts the court\u2019s oral findings and is clearly erroneous. Based upon our review of the record, we fail to see any contradiction in the written findings of the trial judge and his oral pronouncements. In addition, the court\u2019s written findings of fact are not clearly erroneous. The court acknowledged that Reid rejected the advice and efforts of his physicians, and that the physicians believed that Reid\u2019s treatment was necessary. Ultimately, the trial judge concluded that Reid\u2019s refusal of treatment did not affect the integrity of the medical profession. In the present case, there was appropriate consultation by medical providers with Reid concerning his treatment. After consultation, Reid rejected the recommendations of his physicians. On the basis of this record there is no violation of the integrity of the medical profession. Moreover, the record supports the trial judge\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Interests of Third Parties and Prevention of Suicide</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The Commissioner advances no contention that the \u201cinterests of innocent third parties\u201d or \u201cthe prevention of suicide\u201d are implicated in this case. Although the Commissioner contends that we should follow the case of <em>Polk, </em>we suggest that <em>Polk </em>is further distinguishable from the present case on another basis. In concluding that the State of Iowa had a compelling interest in preserving Brown\u2019s life, the court in <em>Polk </em>factored into its analysis the \u201cemotional impact upon\u201d Brown\u2019s minor children and that Brown might someday be \u201cin a position to provide financial support for them.\u201d <em>Polk, </em>594 N.W.2d at 428. Here, as the Court of Special Appeals pointed out, \u201c[t]here is nothing in [Reid\u2019s] condition that endangers or affects the public health.\u201d In addition, as the intermediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>appellate court noted, Reid has no \u201cchildren or dependents that would be affected by any choice [he] makes concerning his health.\u201d <em>Stouffer, </em>184 Md.App. at 284, 965 A.2d at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Considering the specific circumstances of this case and Reid\u2019s right to refuse medical treatment, absent evidence that Reid is a direct threat to the safety and well being of others or that he is protesting any prison policies or attempting to manipulate an official, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the State has not shown a valid penological interest in compelling Reid to submit to dialysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
