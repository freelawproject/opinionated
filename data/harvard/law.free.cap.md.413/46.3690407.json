On May 5, 2009, a Texas Evidentiary Panel for State Bar District No. 09A3 of the State Bar of Texas<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> imposed a Judgment of Public Reprimand against Gordon after determining that he violated Rules 3.03(a)(1),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 3.03(a)(5),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 8.04(a)(3)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>On August 10, 2009, the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cPetitioner\u201d or \u201cBar Counsel\u201d), acting pursuant to Rules 16-751(a)(2)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 16-773(b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> filed a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action against Gordon to which a certified copy of the State Bar of Texas\u2019 Judgment of Public Reprimand was attached. Bar Counsel incorporated by reference into its Petition the findings of fact of the Texas Evidentiary Panel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">In October 2005, Respondent was representing clients on a breach of contract claim. Respondent requested leave to supplement his summary judgment record and attached what appeared to be an original signature page signed by Respondent\u2019s client (\u201cthe Client\u201d), in the year 2000. The document was not the original signature page but instead was one that had been signed by the Client the night before the 2005 summary judgment hearing. Whether the Client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>had signed the contract in 2000 was a material issue in the litigation. The tendered signature page was challenged by the opposing party as newly \u201cmanufactured\u201d evidence at the hearing on the motion for summary judgment. Respondent did not inform the Court at that time that the tendered signature page had just been signed by the Client. Respondent thereafter filed pleadings falsely suggesting that this document was the original signature page. Six weeks later, in response to discovery, Respondent and the Client disclosed to opposing counsel that the Client had signed the signature page at issue on the eve of the summary judgment hearing and also disclosed the recently found original signature page from 2000. But Respondent did not inform the Court of these facts. The Court granted Respondent\u2019s Motion for Leave to Supplement the Record, but denied the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. The case went to trial in 2007, at which time the Client testified during cross-examination that he had signed the tendered signature page just prior to Respondent submitting it as evidence in 2005. When questioned by the Court, Respondent admitted that the Client had signed the document right before the summary judgment hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">In his petition, Bar Counsel relied upon the Texas Evidentiary Panel\u2019s conclusion that Gordon violated Rules 3.03(a)(1), 3.03(a)(5), and 8.04(a)(3) of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct, which correspond to Rules 3.3(a)(1),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 3.3(a)(4),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 8.4(c)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the Maryland Rules of Professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d or \u201cRule\u201d). Bar Counsel requested that we issue a Show Cause Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">On August 10, 2009, we issued a Show Cause Order pursuant to Rule 16-773(e).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Bar Counsel responded, asked that reciprocal discipline not be imposed, and requested that we order a ninety day suspension, or in the alternative, enter an order designating a judge to hold a hearing in accordance with Rule 16-757.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s rationale was that, \u201c[i]n Maryland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the submission of false documents and/or assisting a client in the commission of a fraud warrants more than a reprimand, especially when the lawyer fails to take any mitigating or remedial action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In Gordon\u2019s response to the Show Cause Order, in his Reply, and in subsequent pleadings, he stated that his misconduct warranted a reciprocal sanction of a public reprimand.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He stated that he \u201caccepted full responsibility for [his] actions from the very beginning of the Texas disciplinary proceeding,\u201d and that he knew his \u201cactions were wrong and inappropriate and a violation of [his] duties as an officer of the court.\u201d He argued that reciprocal discipline must be ordered, because Bar Counsel did not demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that exceptional circumstances under Rule 16-773(e)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>existed. He also argued that while his actions in the Texas summary judgment proceeding were misleading and constituted professional misconduct, his actions did not constitute fraud, for which the Texas Bar would have imposed a more significant sanction. He stated that his disclosure of the newly re-signed signature page to opposing counsel six weeks after the summary judgment hearing, was a mitigating and remedial measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Gordon also argued that no exceptional circumstances existed because 1) the Texas Disciplinary procedure was neither lacking in notice or a deprivation of his due process rights, 2) there was no infirmity of proof during the underlying proceedings establishing professional misconduct, 3) a reprimand would not result in grave injustice, but a more severe sanction would result in a grave injustice, 4) the State Bar of Texas treated the matter seriously and diligently, and Maryland should defer to the Texas Bar\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">In reciprocal discipline cases, pursuant to Rule 16-773(g), we generally treat the factual findings and conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>of law from the original jurisdiction as conclusive evidence of an attorney\u2019s misconduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">(g) Conclusive effect of adjudication. Except as provided in subsections (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this Rule, a final adjudication in a disciplinary or remedial proceeding by another court, agency, or tribunal that an attorney has been guilty of professional misconduct or is incapacitated is conclusive evidence of that misconduct or incapacity in any proceeding under this Chapter. The introduction of such evidence does not preclude the Commission or Bar Counsel from introducing additional evidence or preclude the attorney from introducing evidence or otherwise showing cause why no discipline or lesser discipline should be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\"><em>See also Attorney Grievance v. Haas, </em>412 Md. 536, 988 A.2d 1033 (2010); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Whitehead, </em>390 Md. 663, 669, 890 A.2d 751, 754 (2006). We address, then, what discipline to impose\u2014a reprimand consistent with the Texas sanction or a more serious alternative, because of the existence of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d under Rule 16-773(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">We have often stated the well established principle that in reciprocal discipline cases, we are prone or inclined, but not required, to impose the same sanction the original jurisdiction imposed. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Whitehead, </em>390 Md. 663, 671, 890 A.2d 751, 756 (2006); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Weiss, </em>389 Md. 531, 546, 886 A.2d 606, 615 (2005). As we explained in <em>Whitehead, </em>390 Md. at 668, 890 A.2d at 754, our rules state that we <em>may </em>impose \u201ccorresponding discipline,\u201d not that we <em>shall </em>impose \u201cidentical discipline.\u201d <em>See </em>Rule 16-773(f).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Our use of the words \u201cinclined,\u201d \u201cprone,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u201ctend to,\u201d and \u201coften,\u201d explicitly indicate our reluctance to adopt a blanket rule of reciprocity, <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 547, 886 A.2d at 615. We are required to analyze each case individually and decide whether to deviate from the original jurisdiction\u2019s sanction. <em>Id. </em>at 547, 886 A.2d at 615; <em>see also Attorney Grievance v. Scroggs, </em>387 Md. 238, 254, 874 A.2d 985, 995 (2005) (\u201cWe are required to assess for ourselves the propriety of the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction and that recommended by the Commission.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We, generally, follow the original jurisdiction\u2019s sanction \u201cwhen the purpose for the discipline in the original jurisdiction is congruent with ours.\u201d Weiss, 389 Md. at 547, 886 A.2d at 615. Our purpose in attorney discipline cases is the protection of the public, rather than the punishment of the erring attorney. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Attorney Grievance v. Steinberg, </em>385 Md. 696, 703, 870 A.2d 603, 607 (2005) (other citations omitted). Nevertheless, we find that although most jurisdictions have the same purpose as we do, \u201c[w]e have recognized that the public interest is served when this Court imposes a sanction which demonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated.... \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Sperling, </em>380 Md. 180, 191, 844 A.2d 397, 404 (2004) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Obviously, in so demonstrating, we are concerned with what sanction a lawyer in Maryland could expect in response to similar conduct, were it to have occurred in Maryland. We have consistently stated that when considering an appropriate sanction in a reciprocal discipline case, we are duty bound to look \u201cnot only to the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction but to our own cases as well. The sanction will depend on the unique facts and circumstances of each case, but with a view toward consistent dispositions for similar misconduct.\u201d <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 548, 886 A.2d at 616, quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Parsons &amp; Reback, </em>310 Md. 132, 142, 527 A.2d 325, 330 (1987). In this regard, and in an effort to avoid inconsistent sanctions, we need not follow the original jurisdiction\u2019s sanction when our cases demonstrate that we would apply a different sanction, had the conduct occurred or the case originated here. <em>Whitehead, </em>390 Md. at 673, 890 A.2d at 757. \u201c[W]e must balance our tendency to follow the original jurisdiction\u2019s sanction under our reciprocal discipline doctrine, against our prior cases and the sanctions imposed upon members of this Bar for similar misconduct committed in this jurisdiction, always with a view towards the protection of the public.\u201d <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 546, 886 A.2d at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">All this being said, we acknowledge that there have been cases in which we have deferred to the sanction of the original jurisdiction, despite the different sanction we may have imposed had the proceedings originated in this jurisdiction, <em>see Attorney Grievance v. Ayres-Fountain, </em>379 Md. 44, 58-59, 838 A.2d 1238, 1246-47 (2003) (imposing identical three year suspension sanction as Delaware Supreme Court for the lawyer\u2019s knowing misrepresentations to that court regarding her certifications in annual tax filings even though the sanction that may have been imposed by this Court would not have been identical had the conduct occurred in Maryland); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gittens, </em>346 Md. 316, 327, 697 A.2d 83, 88-89 (1997) (imposing identical indefinite suspension sanction of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals on an attorney who was convicted of theft of client funds from his escrow account citing that deference should be paid to the District of Columbia court).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We have, nevertheless, also declared that we have become \u201cmuch less lenient towards any misconduct involving theft, misappropriation, fraud, or deceit.\u201d <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 551, 886 A.2d at 617. When attorney misconduct has been more serious, and \u201cwhen the conduct involved is of such nature that it would not be tolerated from any member of the Bar in this State if the conduct occurred here,\u201d we have deviated from the original jurisdiction\u2019s sanction and imposed a more severe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>sanction. <em>Id. </em>at 551-52, 886 A.2d at 618, citing <em>Attorney Grievance v. Dechowitz, </em>358 Md. 184, 191, 193, 747 A.2d 657, 660-61 (2000) (substituting disbarment for California\u2019s sanction of suspension, after the attorney was convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute); <em>Attorney Grievance v. White, </em>354 Md. 346, 367, 731 A.2d 447, 459 (1999) (imposing disbarment instead of indefinite suspension for attorney\u2019s false testimony under oath). <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Beatty, </em>409 Md. 11, 18, 972 A.2d 840, 843-44 (2009) (imposing indefinite suspension in a reciprocal discipline case on an attorney convicted of fourth degree stalking in New Jersey in spite of lesser sanction of three month suspension imposed by the Supreme Court of that state).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In the present case, the prohibited conduct involved Respondent who, while representing a client in a breach of contract case, submitted what appeared to be the original signature page of a year 2000 contract, but was, instead, a replacement signature page signed by his client the night before the 2005 summary judgment hearing. The existence of the signature was a material issue in the litigation, and Respondent did not inform the court that the signature page had been signed five years after the fact and during litigation involving the contract, but rather, filed pleadings falsely suggesting that the page represented the original. Six weeks later, Respondent and his client disclosed to opposing counsel during discovery, but not to the court, that the signature page had been signed on the eve of summary judgment and also disclosed the original signature page from 2000. This conduct is clearly violative of MRPC 3.3(a)(1), 3.3(a)(4), and 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">To support the sanction of a reprimand, however, Gordon cites <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Heinze, </em>293 Md. 193, 442 A.2d 570 (1982), in which F. George Heinze, III, told his client, another attorney, that he had filed suit in a collection case when, in fact, he had not. We concluded that this misrepresentation violated Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(4) of the Code of Professional Responsibility, the precursor to Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>8.4(c), which provided that a lawyer shall not \u201c[ejngage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation,\u201d and reprimanded Heinze. <em>Heinze, </em>293 Md. at 196-97, 442 A.2d at 572. In so doing, we acknowledged that Heinze\u2019s conduct did not rise to the level of seriousness as that of the attorneys in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bailey, </em>286 Md. 630, 408 A.2d 1330 (1979), and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Levitt, </em>286 Md. 231, 406 A.2d 1296 (1979), in which misrepresentations were made to a court. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Stancil, </em>296 Md. 325, 463 A.2d 789 (1983) (attorney reprimanded for misrepresentations made to Bar Counsel); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. O\u2019Neill, </em>285 Md. 52, 400 A.2d 415 (1979) (\u201cNeophyte lawyer\u201d reprimanded for making false statements to a judge, an assistant state\u2019s attorney, and a probation agent in the same day, but who immediately informed the judge of his deceit and expressed remorse to Bar Counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Bar Counsel, in support of his requests that we impose \u201csubstantially different discipline in Maryland than that which [Respondent] received in Texas,\u201d because Gordon\u2019s conduct warranted \u201csubstantially different discipline,\u201d in accordance with Rule 16-773(e), bases his argument upon three Attorney Grievance cases, in which we ordered a period of suspension, <em>i.e., Attorney Grievance v. Tanko, </em>408 Md. 404, 969 A.2d 1010 (2009) (suspending lawyer for sixty days for knowingly filing expungement petitions that were not ripe), <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Rohrback, </em>323 Md. 79, 591 A.2d 488 (1991) (suspending lawyer for forty-five days for misrepresenting to a probation officer that his client was using a false name), and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Maxwell, </em>307 Md. 600, 516 A.2d 570 (1986) (suspending lawyer for ninety days for knowingly making a false notarization and falsely witnessing a deed).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In <em>Tanko, </em>Louis P. Tanko, Jr., was charged with numerous Rule violations, including Rules 3.3 and 8.4. We affirmed a hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Tanko violated Rules 3.3(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>and 8.4(d)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> when he filed expungement petitions in the District Court for charges he believed, although negligently and mistakenly, were eligible for expungement in an attempt to have the petitions \u201cslip by\u201d the court and be granted. <em>Tanko, </em>408 Md. at 423-26, 969 A.2d at 1022-23. Tanko filed the petitions with lines drawn through words indicating that at least three years had passed since the disposition in the underlying matter, knowing that less than three years had elapsed. We held that Tanko\u2019s misleading actions were clearly violative of the Rules, but because he lacked any prior disciplinary action and his actions were mitigated by a misunderstanding of the relevant case and statutory law, his violations warranted a sixty day suspension instead of disbarment. <em>Id. </em>at 426, 969 A.2d at 1023-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">In <em>Rohrback, </em>Maynard R. Rohrback\u2019s client, Lloyd Francis Asbury, was arrested on several different occasions and charged with DUI and DWI; and on one occasion, he had given a false name, Lloyd Francis Boland, to one of the arresting officers. <em>Rohrback, </em>323 Md. at 83-84, 591 A.2d at 489-90. Rohrback, though knowing Asbury was misrepresenting himself as another to a probation officer charged with developing his presentence investigation, accompanied him to the meeting with the officer. We stated that Rohrback\u2019s \u201cmere act of accompanying Asbury as Boland\u201d to a meeting with a probation officer \u201cserved as Rohrback\u2019s confirmation that Boland was the client\u2019s true name,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 99, 591 A.2d at 497-98, and we held that Rohrback\u2019s actions were tantamount to knowingly assisting in his client\u2019s fraud, and violative of Rule 4.1<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> requiring disclosure of material facts to third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>parties. Although Rohrback had never before committed any professional infractions, we imposed a forty-five day suspension. <em>Id. </em>at 101, 591 A.2d at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">In <em>Maxwell, </em>Edward Thomas Maxwell, Jr., while representing two individuals charged with drug trafficking in Florida, delivered a deed to his client\u2019s bail bondsman with the signature of \u201cRonald Jaxon,\u201d and a notarization by Maxwell. In fact, although \u201cRonald Jaxon\u201d did not exist, Maxwell knowingly witnessed one of his clients signing the deed as Jaxon. <em>Maxwell, </em>307 Md. at 602, 516 A.2d at 571. The hearing judge concluded that Maxwell made misrepresentations and false statements in violation of former Rules 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(1), and 7-102(A)(5) of the Code of Professional Responsibility.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In determining his sanction, we noted that although we could not \u201ccondone deliberate falsification of a solemn document by an experienced attorney,\u201d a ninety day sanction was appropriate after considering Maxwell\u2019s veteran experience of thirty years, unblemished disciplinary record, expressed remorse for his actions, and lack of harm resulting from his conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 605, 516 A.2d at 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Another case addressing issues of misrepresentations made by an attorney to a tribunal is <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Parsons &amp; Reback, </em>310 Md. 132, 527 A.2d 325 (1987). In <em>Parsons, </em>we addressed the appropriate sanction for two lawyers in a reciprocal discipline case who falsified their client\u2019s signature on a complaint for divorce and caused it to be notarized and filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia, without the consent or knowledge of their client, after the original complaint had been dismissed. Despite the attorneys\u2019 admission of wrongdoing and their expression of remorse, we imposed a ninety day suspension. We were mindful that although the misconduct was intended to assist the client without personal gain, this \u201cserious transgression\u201d did not exempt them from discipline, and a suspension was necessary \u201cin order to protect the public from misconduct of this sort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142-43, 527 A.2d at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">In other circumstances in which lawyers have been untruthful to a tribunal, we have imposed suspensions greater than ninety days, as well as disbarment. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance v. McClain, </em>406 Md. 1, 20-21, 956 A.2d 135, 146 (2008) (attorney disbarred for intentionally dishonest conduct and systematic effort to mislead the court); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Siskind, </em>401 Md. 41, 75-76, 930 A.2d 328, 347-48 (2007) (attorney disbarred for dishonesty, fraud, and deceit toward a tribunal, in the absence of any mitigating factors); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Goodman, </em>381 Md. 480, 483, 499, 850 A.2d 1157, 1159, 1168 (2004) (attorney disbarred for filing pleadings and signing another attorney\u2019s name without that attorney\u2019s knowledge or permission); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Myers, </em>333 Md. 440, 449-50, 635 A.2d 1315, 1320 (1994) (attorney with a history of sanctions for misconduct was disbarred for intentional, self-serving misrepresentations to a District Court judge regarding his traffic record); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bailey, </em>286 Md. 630, 635-36, 408 A.2d 1330, 1333 (1979) (attorney received three year suspension for misrepresentations to a court regarding funds that were supposedly placed in an escrow account, but Court noted he would have been disbarred had the evidence shown he intended \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>steal or consciously misappropriate funds\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Levitt, </em>286 Md. 231, 239-40, 406 A.2d 1296, 1300 (1979) (attorney received one year suspension for knowingly making a false statement to a judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">We conclude that because Gordon\u2019s misrepresentations to the court in violation of Rules 3.3(a)(1), 3.3(a)(4), and 8.4(c) of the MRPC would warrant \u201csubstantially different discipline\u201d in Maryland, \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d do exist under Rule 16-773(e). The most difficult issue, however, is which of the myriad suspension periods to impose, which, appropriately, generally rests on what mitigation is found. In this regard, mitigating factors may include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">absence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK\"><em>Attorney Grievance v.

Then, for sanctioning purposes, important factors for the Court to consider were the location of the attorney\u2019s practice, where the misconduct actually occurred, and the seriousness with which the originating jurisdiction treats the misconduct. <em>Ayres-Fountain, </em>379 Md. at 57, 838 A.2d at 1246. Exemplary of this approach is <em>Ayres-Fountain, supra. </em>Our application of these informing factors and our explication of their relevance in that real and concrete factual setting are instructive on the issue of the proper sanction in this case. In <em>Ayres-Fountain, </em>we accepted, as our own, the sanction imposed on Ayres-Fountain by the Supreme Court of Delaware, even though we recognized that it likely was not identical to one that this Court may have imposed had the matter been initiated in Maryland. Explaining why, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u201cthe respondent essentially is a Delaware lawyer; that is where she lives and where she principally practices. More important, the misrepresentations upon which the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>principally relies are misrepresentations made to the Supreme Court of Delaware, in certifications contained in annual filings that Court requires to be made in support of its oversight of the administration of justice in that State. That Court was fully informed of the facts and circumstances of the respondent\u2019s conduct. In addition to the stipulation, which is quite detailed and explicit, not only as to the violations but with respect to the respondent\u2019s admissions, the court reviewed the Report and Recommendation of Sanction of the Board of Professional Responsibility. That Report, which accepted the facts recited in the stipulation, was prepared only after the Board conducted a hearing to determine the appropriate sanction to recommend. The Board, in addition to discussing the considerations that were taken into account in fashioning the sanction recommendation, painstakingly analyzed the cases bearing on the proper sanction and that formed the basis for the recommendation it made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">\u201cHaving been presented with the Report and the recommendation for a three year suspension, the Supreme Court of Delaware adopted the Report and accepted the recommendation, but only after it had \u2018considered the matter carefully.\u2019 That it had a firm grasp of the facts and the gravity of the situation is shown by the court\u2019s recitation of the admissions the respondent made, noting particularly that \u2018she falsely represented to the Delaware Supreme Court, in her Certificates of Compliance filed between 1996 and 2000, that she had timely paid all federal, state, and local payroll, gross receipts and income taxes [and] concealed her failure to pay various federal, state and local taxes from the ODC and its auditor.\u2019 In addition, the court referred to the aggravating factors to which the parties stipulated, indicating that the sanction was appropriate \u2018in light of their presence.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\"><em>Ayres-Fountain, </em>379 Md. at 58-59, 838 A.2d at 1246-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">In this case, Jeffrey Keith Gordon, the respondent, is a Texas attorney, who, although admitted to the Bar in this State, has never practiced in this State. The misconduct for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>which he was sanctioned by Texas occurred in Texas, during litigation and consisted of a misrepresentation of a material fact at issue in the litigation and actions taken in furtherance of that fact prior to his disclosure of the misrepresentation some six weeks after he made it. It having been determined that the misconduct was violative of the Texas counterpoint to the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct requiring candor toward a tribunal and proscribing \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,\u201d the Texas Bar, at the conclusion of disciplinary proceedings, reprimanded the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The majority does not contend that the Bar of Texas takes attorney discipline less seriously than do we or that the purpose of such discipline in Texas is different from the purpose\u2014the protection of the public\u2014for which we pursue such discipline. <em>See generally Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Gordon, </em>413 Md. 46, 56, 991 A.2d 51, 56-57. No matter, the majority, relying on <em>Weiss </em>and <em>Whitehead, id. </em>at 55-56, 56-57, 991 A.2d at 56, 57, declares that sanction insufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 63-64, 991 A.2d at 61. Noting that we would impose, in misrepresentation cases initiated in Maryland, a different sanction, <em>id. </em>at 59-63, 991 A.2d at 58-61, it suspends the respondent for a period of forty-five days, <em>id. </em>at 64, 991 A.2d at 61, presumably concluding that the sanction is \u201csubstantially different\u201d from the reprimand imposed by Texas. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 991 A.2d at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In <em>Weiss, </em>noting that our cases, at least up to that time, expressed a preference for consistency among States when dispensing discipline in reciprocal discipline cases, specially when there is no divergence in the purpose of the discipline, I lamented that \u201c[the majority\u2019s] rationale for refusing deference in th[at] case can only be that the [originating court] did not exact the pound of flesh that we would have done had the matter initiated in this Court, i.e., it did not punish the respondent to the extent we think required.\u201d 389 Md. at 564-65, 886 A.2d at 625-26. Although that is not the proper test, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>believe that, as it has done in <em>Weiss </em>and <em>Whitehead, </em>the majority has applied just that test in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-10\">.

Reciprocal discipline shall not be ordered if Bar Counsel or the attorney demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">\"(1) the procedure was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">\"(2) there was such infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give rise to a clear conviction that the Court, consistent with its duty, cannot accept as final the determination of misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">\"(3) the imposition of corresponding discipline would result in grave injustice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">\"(4) the conduct established does not constitute misconduct in this State or it warrants substantially different discipline in this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As5\">\"(5) the reason for inactive status no longer exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">\"(f) Action by Court of Appeals. Upon consideration of the petition and any answer to the order to show case, the Court of Appeals may immediately impose corresponding discipline or inactive status, may enter an order designating a judge pursuant to Rule 16-752 to hold a hearing in accordance with Rule 16-757, or may enter any other appropriate order. The provisions of this Rule 16-760 apply to an order under this section that disbars or suspends an attorney or that places the attorney on inactive status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-12\">\u201c(g) Conclusive effect of adjudication. Except as provided in subsections (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this Rule, a final adjudication in a disciplinary or remedial proceeding by another court, agency, or tribunal that an attorney has been guilty of professional conduct or is incapacitat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>ed is conclusive evidence of that misconduct or incapacity in any proceeding under this Chapter. The introduction of such evidence does not preclude the Commission or Bar Counsel from introducing additional evidence or preclude the attorney from introducing evidence or otherwise showing cause why no discipline or lesser discipline should be imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">\"(h) Effect of stay in other jurisdiction. If the other jurisdiction has stayed the discipline or inactive status, any proceedings under this Rule shall be deferred until the stay is no longer operative and the discipline or inactive status becomes effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
