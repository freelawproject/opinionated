The first amended complaint contains three counts. The first and third counts allege mental weakness on the part of Mrs. Potter and undue influence on the part of the defendant. The second alleges that the deeds mentioned were never delivered. At the trial, \u201cthe attorney for plaintiff in open court withdrew the first and third causes of action stated in plaintiff\u2019s first amended complaint and stipulated that plaintiff would go to trial on his allegations of the second cause of action, that said deeds were never delivered during the lifetime of the grantor. \u2019' Judgment was entered in favor of the defendant and the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">The defendant testified that, without any request or solicitation on his part, his wife said \u201cshe wanted me to have it all what there was without any trouble\u201d; that, at her request, he went with her to the office of a lawyer, where the deeds were signed and acknowledged; that immediately after leaving the office she handed him the deeds and said, \u201cI hand you these deeds so there won\u2019t be any trouble,\u201d or she said, \u201cTake them\u201d; that he took the deeds home and placed them in his wife\u2019s \u201ccommunity trunk\u201d in which he kept his best clothes.

Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to show a delivery of the deeds with intent to pass title. No citation of authorities is deemed necessary to show that it cannot he held, as a matter of law, that such evidence, standing uneontradicted, is insufficient to support the findings and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Thompson (R.
