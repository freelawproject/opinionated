Fraser for Respondents.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b93-8\">NOURSE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6b\">This is a proceeding in <em>mandamus </em>to require respondents to act upon an annexation petition with a view to determining whether a special election should be called to vote upon the proposition of annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">The respondents, by demurrer and answer, have presented but two excuses for their failure to act which require consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">First, it is pleaded that another action of the same character is pending. In October, 1928, a similar petition was filed with these respondents, asking them to call a special election for the same purpose. Having refused to act upon the petition a proceeding in <em>mandamus </em>was instituted in the first division of the district court of appeal. This was decided adversely to petitioners on March 15, 1929, and the judgment therein is now final. <em>(Carter </em>v. <em>Green, </em>97 Cal. App. 564 [276 Pac. 120].) Assuming that the two actions are of the same character, so that the pendency of the first action would support a plea in abatement to the second, such plea is no longer available when the former action is no longer pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Second, it is argued that the petition for mandate herein does not sufficiently allege demand made upon the respondents to perform the acts sought by this proceeding. Without engaging in a technical discussion of the pleadings it is sufficient to say that no specific demand was necessary, because the respondents are here acting under a statute for the benefit of the public in general and without any private or personal interest in the subject matter. In such eases the law itself stands in lieu of a specific demand. <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Board, etc., </em>138 Cal. 67, 69 [70 Pac. 1059]; <em>Thoits </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>Byxbee, 34 </em>Cal. App. 226, 236 [167 Pac. 166]; <em>Jensen </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>94 Cal. App. 382 [271 Pac. 568, 571].)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Let a writ issue as prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Koford, P. J., and Sturtevant, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the District Court of Appeal on June 17, 1929, and a petition by respondent to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on July 18, 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">All the Justices present concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
