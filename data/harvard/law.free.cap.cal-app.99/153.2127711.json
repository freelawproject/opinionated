J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACR\">\u2014 The plaintiff, as assignee of Nelson Brothers, brought this action to recover an amount alleged to be due for labor performed and materials furnished in the painting and decorating of the interior of a dwelling-house and to foreclose a lien for the value of such labor and materials. The court found against the existence of the alleged lien, but entered judgment against the defendants Coyne and Weisman for the amount demanded in the complaint. The defendant Coyne has appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The appellant contends that, at most, the evidence merely shows that he made an oral promise \u201cto answer for the debt or default\u201d of Weisman, and that such promise is invalid because not in writing. It is conceded, of course, that the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the respondent, and all contradictory evidence is omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Prior to May 8, 1923, Coyne and his wife were the owners of the property involved in this suit. On that day they conveyed it to S. R. and Elizabeth S. Ow, who in turn gave Coyne and his wife a mortgage on the property to secure a promissory note for $15,000, and on July 5, 1923, Ow and his wife executed a trust deed to secure another promissory note in favor of the Coynes for $7,500, payable November 8, 1923. Thereafter and prior to the employment of the Nelsons, Ow and his wife conveyed the property to Weisman, subject to the mortgage and the trust deed. After the completion of the work and before the commencement of this suit, the property was sold under the trust deed, Coyne and his wife becoming the purchasers, their bid being the only one made at the sale. The following evidence appears in the record, the quotations, except as otherwise stated, being taken from the testimony of R. A. Nelson, one of the Nelson Brothers: \u201cMr. Coyne told us that he intended selling the house to a man named Mr. Weisman, and the condition of the house at the present time it couldn\u2019t be resold; so he was trying to arrange to have us redecorate it, and arrange a contract with Mr, Weisman for the redecorating of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>it, but yet Mr. Weisman didn\u2019t have any money, he was quite sure, and he wasn\u2019t quite sure Mr. Weisman would be able to pay for the contract; and if he didn\u2019t pay us, not to worry, that he, Mr. Coyne, would pay us. . . . He told us not to worry; that he would see the money got to us all right. \u2019 \u2019 On the following day the Nelsons met with Coyne and Weisman at the house in question. They were then informed for the first time that Weisman had purchased the property. \u201cMr. Coyne called me to one side and asked me about what my figure was. ... I told him the price was $1,143, and he said: \u2018Well, I don\u2019t hardly think you will be able to get it out of Mr. Weisman, but if not I will pay you. . . . Figure about $200 on that price for me, in ease he does pay you,\u2019 . . . but if Mr. Coyne was to pay it, he would pay $1,143.\u201d The Nelsons and Weisman thereupon agreed upon a price of $1,343 for the work, but no written contract was executed. \u201cWe were to receive $500 in 30 days, $643 in 60 days and $200 in 90 days. . . . After we had started to work, Mr. Coyne advised us to take our time on it, because he told us he didn\u2019t think Mr. Weisman was financially able to pay it, and to give him plenty of time to get it. And 30 days, when our first payment of $500 came due, we hunted up Mr. Weisman, and Mr. Weisman informed us that he was unable to pay us at that time; and we went to Mr. Coyne and told him that, and Mr. Coyne told us the best thing for us to do would be to knock off the job; and he said he knew Mr. Weisman couldn\u2019t get anybody to duplicate our work or finish the job; and Mr. Weisman also knew that; and if we knocked off the job we might bring Mr. Weisman to terms and persuade him to get the money.\u201d The Nelsons then quit work for \u201ctwo weeks or more\u201d and then returned at Coyne\u2019s suggestion. \u201cHe came to our house one evening and told us ... he thought he had it arranged for Mr. Weisman to sell the house to a Mr. Eiseman; that Mr. Coyne would take care of the first initial payment due us, and we could enter into a contract for the balance of the work to be done, with Mr. Eiseman.\u201d About forty per cent of the work had been done at that time. Before commencing work under the original contract, \u201cMr. Coyne told us . . . hot to do anything on the house without consulting him first, in regards to colors and one thing and another.\u201d Coyne \u201ctold us to go ahead and draw up a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>tract with Mr. Eiseman to finish the house, and try to get as much from him as possible, but for us not to worry, that the job really went on on the old agreement.\u201d The Nelsons then entered into a written agreement with Eiseman to complete the work for $750, and \u201cMr. Coyne told us before we did any finish decorating in the house ... to consult him first, because he didn\u2019t want the house ruined again like it had been in the first place. . . . Q. Did you have any further conversation after that time with Mr. Coyne, respecting the work? A. He and Mr. Weisman came on the job one day and seemed very excited, and told us that the way things were shaping up he thought Mr. Eiseman would not be able to hold the house. ... He told us that if Mr. Weisman got the house back .from Mr. Eiseman, that we would start right in again, and Mr. Coyne and Mr. Weisman would pay us right up on the old contract. \u25a0. . . Mr. Coyne . . . came to us one day and told us that we were not to let Mr. Eiseman in the house.\u201d The Nelsons then quit work on the house. The work was \u201cpretty well advanced\u201d at that time. About \u201ca week or a week and a half\u201d later they resumed work .at Coyne\u2019s request. \u201cHe told us to come back over and resume work on the job; that he had the house back, and we should come back and finish the job and he and Mr. Weisman would pay us.\u201d After the work was completed \u201cMr. Coyne said the work was entirely satisfactory, and he was sure it would be sold in a short time to somebody with some money, and whoever he sold it to he was going to sell it with the agreement that they were going to help him pay us for our decorating.\u201d During the progress of the work Coyne visited the job \u201cnearly every day\u201d and, according to Nelson\u2019s testimony, he gave instructions that no changes be made in the decorations as planned without his approval and, from time to time, he directed the temporary discontinuance and the resumption of work. At the time the Nelsons agreed to do the work, Coyne told them that \u201cWeisman didn\u2019t have any money . . . and he wasn\u2019t quite sure Mr. Weisman would be able to pay for the contract.\u201d It is a reasonable inference from the evidence that Coyne then believed that Weisman was not financially able to pay for the property and that Coyne was anxious to have the house redecorated because in its then condition \u201cit couldn\u2019t be resold.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>knew that the promissory note for $7,500, secured by the trust deed, was long overdue and that, since Weisman had no money, it would be necessary to effect a sale of the property. He knew that the redecorating would add greatly to the market value of the house and that if he became the purchaser at a sale of the property under the trust deed he would receive the full value of the work to be done. The Nelsons were employed on March 18, 1924. Nelson testified that the work was completed about July 22, 1924. The trustee\u2019s deed to the Coynes recites that on July 12, 1924, the Coynes recorded notice of default in payment of the promissory note .and their election to cause the property to be sold. From these facts it appears that Coyne was taking steps to cause the sale of the property before the work was finished.  It. cannot be held, as a matter of law, that the evidence is insufficient to warrant the finding of the trial court to the effect that Coyne\u2019s promise was an original one rather than a mere promise to answer for the default of Weisman. Under a similar state of facts, in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Patrick, </em>141 U. S. 479 [35 L. Ed. 826, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 58, see, also, Rose\u2019s U. S. Notes], the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARi\">\u201cWere it not for the Statute of Frauds there would be no question, for obviously there were both promise and consideration. Defendant relies upon that provision of the Statute of Frauds which forbids the maintenance of an action \u2018to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer' for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another person, unless the agreement upon which such action shall' be brought, or some memorandum, or note thereof, shall be in writing,\u2019 etc. The purpose of this provision was not to effectuate, but to prevent, wrong. It does not apply to promises in respect to debts created at the instance and for the benefit of the promisor, but only to those by which the debt of one party is sought to be charged upon and collected from another. . . . Whenever the alleged promisor is an absolute stranger to the transaction, and without interest in it, courts strictly uphold the obligations of this statute. But cases sometimes arise in which, though a third party is the original obligor, the primary debtor, the promisor has a personal, immediate, and pecuniary interest in the transaction and is therefore himself a party to be benefited by the performance of the promisee. In such cases the reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>which underlies and which prompted this statutory provision fails, and the courts will give effect to the promise. . . . There is a marked difference between a promise which, without any interest in the subject matter of the promise, in the promisor, is purely collateral to the obligation of a third party, and that which, though operating upon the debt of a third party, is also and mainly for the benefit of the promisor. The case before us is in the latter category.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">When the work was nearing completion \"the defendant Coyne told the Nelsons that \u201cif Mr. Weisman got the house back from Mr. Eiseman, that we would start right in again, and Mr. Coyne and Mr. Weisman would pay us right up on the old contract.\u201d At a later time Coyne requested the Nelsons to resume work, saying that \u201che had the house back . . . and he and Mr. Weisman would pay us.\u201d In <em>Ogden </em>v. <em>United Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>206 Cal. 571 [275 Pac. 430], the defendant bank was held bound by a promise made under similar circumstances, after the work involved in that action had been partially performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Appellant contends that \u201cthe judgment is excessive, as it appears without conflict from the testimony on behalf of the respondent that the appellant was to be liable only for the sum of $500 in the event Nelson Brothers made a contract with J. J. Eiseman.\u201d The evidence referred to in the last paragraph shows that at and subsequent to the time that Eiseman gave up the property, Coyne promised to pay the Nelsons under the terms of the original agreement for the work performed and to be performed. Under the Ogden case, he is bound by such promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Appellant complains that \u201cthe trial court, over the objections of the appellant, permitted the introduction of evidence to the effect that the appellant had guaranteed the payment of work performed by others upon the premises in question.\u201d The part of the record to which appellant calls attention, however, does not support his statement. He was asked on cross-examination if he had \u201cguaranteed the payment of some of the bills on this job by a written guarantee. \u2019 \u2019 Without objection he replied that he had not. Later his objections to similar questions were overruled and in each instance his answer was either that he had not guaranteed payment or that he did not remember. Finally he gave an answer which was not responsive to the question asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>him, to the effect that he had paid some Japanese for washing windows and some \u201cworking men.\u201d Bearing in mind that the case was tried before the court without a jury, the appellant could not have been prejudiced by the cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Thompson (B. L.), J., and Plummer, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
