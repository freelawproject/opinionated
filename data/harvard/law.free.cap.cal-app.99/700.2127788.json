It evidences an entire disregard of the rule\u2014probably on the theory that since the brief is short this court could with little labor read it in its entirety. In cases of a direct violation of the rule where are we to draw the line if not by requiring a substantial compliance with the rule? If four pages can be filed without incurring the penalty of dismissal, why not twice or five or ten times that number and so on until the rule becomes a dead letter ? We think we must require compliance with the rule in all cases.  Appellant\u2019s brief was filed April 27, 1928. No substantial prejudice can result to respondent by giving appellant an opportunity to correct his error.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Appellant\u2019s brief is stricken from the files and he is given thirty days within which to file his opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Craig, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Works, P.
