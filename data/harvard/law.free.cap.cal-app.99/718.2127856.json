App. 742 [254 Pac. 939], the question should be answered in the negative. It follows that a peremptory writ of mandate should issue from this court directing respondents Superior Court and Douglas L. Edmonds, as Judge, thereof, to proceed in accordance with the provisions of the code and the statutes relating to the settlement of transcripts on appeal, without reference to the fact of whether or not the appellant is in contempt of court as hereinbefore noted. So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Conrey, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">York, J., absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
