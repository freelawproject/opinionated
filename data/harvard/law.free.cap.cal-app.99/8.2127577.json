Mayo, a widow, and that the said Lucy Frost and Hannah F. Mayo have knowledge of the existence of the covenant and know its terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">By the answer to the complaint it was admitted that the grantees in the deed of conveyance referred to in the complaint were negroes. Without consideration of possible infirmities of the alleged agreement between the parties, it will be noted that by the allegations of the complaint a <em>sale </em>of the property was contemplated by defendants, rather than a lease or a rental to, or a use or an occupation of the property by, persons \u201cother than of the white or Caucasian race.\u201d It is obvious that a <em>sale </em>of the property in question would not constitute a violation of the terms of the alleged agreement. The distinction between the two situations is considered in the case of <em>Los Angeles Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Gary, </em>181 Cal. 681 [9 A. L. R. 115, 186 Pac. 596], and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">All intendments favor the judgment by the lower court; and it is apparent that, without taldng into consideration objections which might be suggested other than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>defect to which attention has been directed, no error was committed by such court in ordering a nonsuit of plaintiffs\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Conrey, P. J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
