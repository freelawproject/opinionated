That the plaintiff here sought and was allowed a provisional remedy there can be no doubt. That the first-quoted section provides a manner and method whereby the defendant may obtain relief in such a case as this is equally free from doubt. That the defendant would also have an action against the plaintiff for the wrongful taking and conversion of the property is the holding in <em>Tapscott </em>v. <em>Lyon, </em>103 Cal. 297 [37 Pac. 225], involving a similar dismissal after answer filed. But it must be apparent that after the dismissal of the action the court was -without authority to render a judgment in favor of the defendant, for the reason that nothing was therein pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Craig, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Works, P.
