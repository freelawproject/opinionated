J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIh\">The plaintiff conducts a cold-storage warehouse in Sacramento. The Renschler Produce Company, referred to herein as the defendant, is engaged in the wholesale produce business in the same city. During October, November and December, 1925, and January, 1926, the defendant delivered to the plaintiff 4,825 boxes of apples to be kept in cold storage. Of these apples,- 2,487 boxes were stored on a seasonal basis, to remain until the end of the following June, unless sooner withdrawn by the defendant, and the remainder thereof \u201cwere stored on a monthly basis, the contract for the storage of which was renewed at the end of each month in cases where the apples were not sold. \u2019 \u2019 The defendant withdrew apples from storage as early as December, 1925, and continued to make withdrawals at frequent intervals until some time in June, 1926, when the last of them were withdrawn, and during all that time the defendant made no complaint as to the condition of the apples when withdrawn or that they were in any manner damaged while in storage. The plaintiff sent the defendant monthly bills for storage charges and instructed its collectors to call on defendant and demand payment. On the defendant\u2019s continued failure to pay these bills, this action was commenced to recover the unpaid balance of $761.28. \u201cJust before the suit was begun,\u201d the defendant presented a claim to the plaintiff, dated September 28, 1926, for $4,941.19 on account of alleged damages to the apples while in storage, and the defendant has filed a cross-complaint for that sum. The court found in favor of the .^plaintiff for the amount demanded in the complaint and against the defendant on the cross-complaint, and judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>was entered accordingly. The defendant has appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">The cross-complaint alleges that the plaintiff \u201ccarelessly and negligently and without exercising any care, . . . permitted and allowed the rooms wherein said apples were stored to become overheated and kept said rooms at a temperature of at least 11 degrees Fahrenheit too high for the safe preservation of said apples, causing said apples to become unmarketable as good fruit. \u2019 \u2019 This allegation is denied in the answer to the cross-complaint. While the appellant\u2019s argument is set forth under several headings, the only question raised by the appeal is whether the respondent maintained the proper temperature for the preservation of the appellant\u2019s apples. In appellant\u2019s opening brief it is said: \u201cWe submit that the findings that plaintiff and cross-defendant was not negligent in the care of defendant\u2019s fruit; and that defendant has not been damaged by the negligence or lack of ordinary care in the storage of defendant\u2019s apples, are not supported by the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The appellant correctly says that it was the plaintiff\u2019s duty \u201cto use ordinary care in the maintenance of such temperature as would preserve the apples.\u201d (27 R. C. L. 991.) Whether the plaintiff performed this obligation must be determined by ascertaining what temperature was maintained and what temperature was required to preserve the fruit. Records of the temperature maintained, made at intervals of four hours, and continuous \u201cautomatic thermometer disc records\u201d were introduced in evidence. It was stipulated at the trial that such records show the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The temperature in room 8, where the apples were on season storage, was maintained, during the greater portion of the time at 36 degrees Fahrenheit; but frequently the temperature was permitted to rise to 36% degrees and 37 degrees for four, eight and twelve hour periods. October 22d and 23d it stood at 37 degrees for twelve hours, immediately followed by 40 degrees for four hours, 38 degrees for the next eight hours and then 39 degrees for eight hours; October 27th, at 39 degrees for eight hours; November 21st and 22d, at 37 degrees to 40 degrees for sixteen hours; March 15th and 16th, at 37 degrees to 38 degrees for forty-eight hours; April 5th and 6th, at 37 degrees to 38 degrees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>for twenty-four hours; June 5th and 6th, at 37 degrees to 38 degrees for twenty hours; June 9th, at 38 degrees for twelve hours; June 18th, 37 degrees to 37% degrees for twenty-four hours; June 20th, 21st and 22d, at 3'6 degrees to 37% degrees for sixty hours. Temperatures ranging from 36 degrees to 37 degrees are omitted in this summary of the facts stated in the stipulation. The temperatures maintained in the monthly storage rooms do not vary greatly from those given.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\">The evidence shows without contradiction that the damage to the defendant\u2019s apples was due to a disease known as scald. Leavitt W. Renschler, one of the defendants, testified that scald \u201cis not a disease, it is caused by refrigeration,\u201d that it \u201cis the brown color that gets on the apples from the heat.\u201d The defendant, however, introduced in evidence \u201cFarmers\u2019 Bulletin No. 1380,\u201d issued by the United States Department of Agriculture. It is therein stated: \u201cApple scald is a nonparasitie or physiological disease. It ... is due to certain unfavorable conditions to which apples are sometimes subjected. Seasonal and orchard conditions are involved, as well as those that prevail in transportation, in storage, and on the market.\u201d Experiments at Wenatchee, Washington, showed that \u201capples from the heavily irrigated trees developed about three times as much scald after removal from storage as those from the lightly irrigated trees. . . . Low temperature is the best means of prolonging the life of the apple and is a most important agency in delaying the development of scald. . . . An increase of 9 degrees in the storage temperature has resulted in two to three times as much scald upon removal from storage on a particular date. It will be seen from two sets of data on the 1916 Grimes Golden that the effect of low temperature is that of delaying rather than preventing it, the disease being as serious at 32 degrees F. at the end of sixteen weeks as it was at 41 degrees F. at the end of twelve weeks. It is important that the apples be cooled as quickly as possible after picking. They should be delivered to the storage plant promptly, and the storage conditions should be such that there will be the least possible delay in bringing the fruit to the final storage temperature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In \u201cDepartment Bulletin No. 1406,\u201d also introduced in evidence by the defendant, it is said: \u201cAfter being cooled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>apples from most sections of the United States should be held at 30 degrees to 32 degrees F. An exception should be made to apples grown in Pajaro Valley of California, since storage of this fruit at 35 degrees to 38 degrees is necessary to prevent one type of internal browning or breakdown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\">Most of the apples involved in this suit were grown at Hood River, Oregon, and the remainder at Yakima, Washington, and were shipped thence to Sacramento during the months of October, November and December, 1925. Most of them had been in cold storage for periods ranging from three weeks to three months prior to shipment, but at least one carload was shipped \u201cas received from the orchard.\u201d All of them were shipped in refrigerator-cars. It thus appears that the important early cooling of the apples immediately after picking was in the hands of persons other than the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Renschler testified that some of the Spitzenburg apples were withdrawn thirty days after they were placed in storage with the plaintiff in November, that ten to fifteen per cent of them showed scald; that the other apples showed scald, ranging from eight per cent in those first withdrawn to twenty-five per cent \u201cthe latter part of the s\u00e9ason\u201d; and that he visited the storage plant \u201cthree, four or five times a week, when we were taking them out of storage,\u201d but that during all that time he failed to call plaintiff\u2019s attention to the poor condition of the apples withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">While the foregoing evidence undoubtedly is sufficient to support a finding that the plaintiff did not exercise ordinary care in the storage of the defendant\u2019s apples, the important question is whether there is sufficient evidence to support the contrary finding made by the court. A. J. Nevis, who during the period of storage and for ten years prior thereto was plaintiff\u2019s foreman, in charge of the cold-storage plant, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">\u201cWe maintain a temperature in the warehouse for the cold storage of apples of 36 degrees; we have always found that is the correct temperature. . . . Q. And do you find that produces the best results? A. In Sacramento, yes. Very good results. Q. And you have never had any bad' results ? A. None whatever. Q. This is the first time this character of complaint has ever been presented to you or. your company? A. To my knowledge, it is. . . . Q. Did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>you examine the contents of the boxes? A. Open the boxes? Q. Yes. A. No, we are not supposed to do that. ... It has been my experience that fruit would be affected with a lower temperature; . . . that a temperature of 32 . . . might be good for some apples, and not for others; apples carrying a temperature at that degree are apt to -contract what we call internal browning, which is prevalent with apples; apples carrying a much higher temperature, forty, and forty-two, would be susceptible to scald; and we consider a medium about thirty-six degrees about right. . . . Q. What is the least temperature at which scalding occurs ? A. Scalding occurs around forty-two, forty-three or more. Q. Does it at forty? A. I have never had it scald at that temperature. . . . Q. Would it scald at forty-one? A. Possibly. Q. Now, if it would scald at forty-one, about how long would it have to remain at forty-one? ... A. It would have to be\u2014in my opinion the duration of the shortest\u2014 two days possibly, where there could be any damage done. . . . Q. Did you ever store apples for the Renschler Company? A. Ever since we have been in business except this year. Q. And maintained the temperature the same? A. Yes. ... Q. Did you store any of the northwestern apples so called any time prior to 1925-1926? A. Yes sir. Q. Did you store any for Mr. Renschler? A. Yes, all his apples were northwestern apples. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-3\">The opinions relative to the cold storage of apples, expressed in the bulletin introduced in evidence, indicate that the temperature maintained in the plaintiff\u2019s plant was too high to produce the best results in the preservation of the defendant\u2019s apples, but the trial court was not required to accept such opinions as against those of the foreman, which were based upon ten years\u2019 practical experience in the cold storage of apples in plaintiff\u2019s plant.  The appellant suggests that the court should have taken judicial notice \u201cthat the high temperature was the cause of the deterioration of defendant\u2019s apples.\u201d As said in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>91 U. S. 37 [23 L. Ed. 200], \u201cthe preservative effect of cold, and especially of dry cold, is well known and exemplified in the keeping of meat and fruit in icehouses,\u201d but no authority is cited to the effect that a court may take judicial notice of the particular temperature which will best preserve a particular variety of fruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The court' found \u201cthat defendant withdrew apples from storage as early as December, 1925, and so continued to withdraw at frequent intervals until June, 1926,\u201d and \u201cthat he did nothing to prevent or minimize, such alleged damage.\u201d As stated, Renschler testified that the deterioration of his apples ranged from eight per cent in the first withdrawals to twenty-five per cent in the last. The defendant knew of this deterioration and remained silent, while the plaintiff was without knowledge thereof. In Farmers\u2019 Bulletin No. 1380, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">\u201cWhen scald begins to appear in commercial storage lots the dealer knows that the fruit can not safely be held for more favorable prices, and it is usually moved to market and sold for what it will bring.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u201cIt is a recognized rule of law that in a case where injury or damage to a plaintiff\u2019s property is threatened as the result of a tort or breach of contract by another, the duty rests upon the plaintiff to use reasonable care and diligence to protect his property against such threatened loss or injury, and if he fails to do so he will not be permitted to charge the defendant for that portion of his loss or injury which was due to plaintiff\u2019s own neglect in this behalf.\u201d <em>(Vitagraph, Inc., </em>v. <em>Liberty Theatres Co., </em>197 Cal. 694 [242 Pac. 709]; <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>North End Water Co., </em>190 Cal. 512 [213 Pac. 33]; 8 Cal. Jur. 782.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Plummer, J., and Thompson (R. L.), J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
