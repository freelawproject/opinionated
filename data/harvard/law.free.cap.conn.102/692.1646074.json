There is nothing on the face of the bond which indicates an intention to modify in any way the antecedent contract of lease. On the contrary, the recital in question is that the lessee has theretofore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>executed the lease \u201cand does under the terms of said lease agree to pay for taxes, insurance and repairs of the interior of said property during the term of said lease.\u201d And the condition of the bond is that \u201cif the said Abe Davidson shall well and truly perform and adhere to the terms of the said lease, and faithfully carry out the covenants as therein sp\u00e9cified,\u201d then this obligation shall be null and void, etc. The apparent purpose of the bond was to secure the performance of the lessee\u2019s existing covenants as specified in the lease; and not to add a new covenant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">It does not appear that any bond was required when the lease was executed, and the subsequently executed bond stands on this record as a separate collateral undertaking. Moreover, the action of summary process is wholly statutory, and is available only when a lease expires by lapse of time, \u201cor by reason of any express stipulation therein.\u201d As pointed out in <em>Du Bouchet </em>v. <em>Wharton, </em>12 Conn. 533, 538, \u201cit has ever been the policy of our law, not to submit the title to real estate to the decision of a justice of the peace,\u201d and for that reason the action of summary process is limited to \u201ca few plain, simple questions of fact.\u201d We are of opinion that under \u00a7 6119 of the General Statutes, the action is limited to cases where the issue of the expiration of the lease presents itself as a simple issue of fact, not complicated by questions as to the proper legal construction of the lease. In the case before us the lease contains no express covenant for the payment of insurance premiums by the lessee, and the most that can be said is that by construing the lease and the bond together some inconclusive indication may appear that the parties put that construction upon the <em>ejusdem generis </em>clause \u2014 \u201cand all other ordinary and necessary expenses and improvements incident to the business aforesaid.\u201d We do not think that the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>intended to leave questions of that kind to be summarily determined in a justice court.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The bill of exceptions does not set forth the rulings on evidence complained of with sufficient clearness to enable us to know what testimony was excluded by the trial justice, or whether the Court of Common Pleas erred in holding that the trial justice committed error in excluding the questions referred to in paragrapns six and eight of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The questions ruled out are not stated, no reason is given for the objection made, and no statement is made as to the character of the testimony offered and excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
