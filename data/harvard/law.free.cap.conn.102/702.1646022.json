The demurrer is overruled; the appeal is from a final judgment, and an interlocutory ruling may form the basis of such an appeal. Assuming that the facts are as stated in the application, the question of law which the claimant claims the right to have reviewed, viz.: the order requiring the filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>of the evidence, is one within the descretion of the court and cannot be reviewed on appeal. What is done with the evidence thereafter may properly furnish a ground of appeal, and the rights of the claimant will thereby be preserved. If the trial court had refused to order the filing of the evidence a different question would have been presented, and one which might have been the subject of review by this court upon application made directly to this court, as in the case of a refusal to make a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Application denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
