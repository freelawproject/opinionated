The credit to be attached to the testimony of the plaintiff was for the court, and the court has found, as the finding discloses, in important particulars, adversely to his testimony. The finding, uncorrected, does not present a case from which we can say, as matter of law, the conclusion of intolerable cruelty must be drawn. In determining such issue, we are controlled by these rules of law. The finding must show not only acts of cruelty on the part of the defendant, but facts which show that in their cumulative effect upon the plaintiff \u201cthey are intolerable in the sense of rendering the continuance of the marital relation unbearable by\u201d the plaintiff. <em>VanGuilder </em>v. <em>VanGuilder, </em>100 Conn. 1, 122 Atl. 719. \u201cIt is only when the cumulative effect of the defendant\u2019s cruelty upon the suffering victim has become such that the public and personal objects of matrimony have been destroyed beyond rehabilitation, that the condition of fact contemplated by the intolerable-cruelty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>clause of the statute (\u00a7 5280) should be found to exist.\u201d <em>McEvoy </em>v. <em>McEvoy, </em>99 Conn. 427, 122 Atl. 100. Applying these rules to the facts found, we cannot hold that the conclusion of the trial court was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">No error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
