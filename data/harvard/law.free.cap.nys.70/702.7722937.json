J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac0e\">It appears by the petition that the president and board of trustees, acting as assessors of the village of Rockville (a village of the third class), on April 24,1900, duly published a notice that they would meet on Tuesday, May 8th, \u201cfor the purpose of completing the assessment roll, and of hearing and determining complaints in relation thereto, at the village clerk\u2019s office in said village, on Tuesday, May 8, 1900, during four consecutive hours, namely, from 6 o\u2019clock in the afternoon to 10 o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u201d The board met at the time and place stated, and the assessment roll then contained the following assessment against the city:</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">Assessed Value.</p>\n<p id=\"AGE\">Acres. Real.</p>\n<p id=\"ACz9\">45 ... ......... $2,800</p>\n<p id=\"AeP\">15 ... ......... 900</p>\n<p id=\"Aev\">44 ... ......... 17,700</p>\n<p id=\"A6q7\"><em>~Ya </em>. ......... 1,200</p>\n<p id=\"A0Y\">53 ... ......... 3,300</p>\n<p id=\"b721-20\">A representative of the city appeared and examined the roll, and asked for an adjournment of the hearing, so \u201cthat a further examination might be made as to the justness of the valuation placed upon the property\u201d of the city. On May 10th the corporation counsel wrote the board that the city \u201cmakes no complaint as to any or either of said assessed valuations.\u201d Thereafter, and on the same day, the law department of the city received by telephone a communication from the board that it \u201chad increased the assessed valuations upon the property\u201d of the city, and on the 11th the department received a letter, dated May 10th, signed by the village clerk, stating that \u201cin consequence of a vigorous protest against the low assessment of the property of the city of New York, as compared with that of the rest .of the property of the village, they [the board] had changed the assessment on the property of said city of New- York.\u201d The \u201cvigorous protest\u201d was that of a taxpayer of the village, made and presented on May 10th. Thereupon the board increased the several items in the aggregate to $86,500, the increase amounting to $60,600, and the number of acres in the last item of the assessment being changed from 53 to 80. The city made no further appearance, and now contends that the board was \u201cwithout jurisdiction to make any changes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>* \u25a0* * no complaint having been made by your petitioner in regard to any or either of said valuations, as they appeared upon the assessment roll of said village, as the same was completed and filed in accordance with the provisions of the statute,- and concerning which notice was given, so that corrections might be made therein upon application of persons aggrieved thereby.\u201d The return states that the board adjourned from May 8th to May 10th, in pursuance of the city\u2019s request, and that on the 10th they \u201cproceeded to complete said assessment roll,\u201d and adjourned till May 12th, when they \u201cfinally completed said assessment, and signed and verified said assessment roll as required by law,\u201d and that the same was filed with the village clerk on the 14th. The city applied for and obtained a writ of certiorari to review and correct the action of the board and to vacate and cancel the assessment; and the court, on the return of the writ and after argument, referred to the case of People v. Forrest, 96 N. Y. 544, and decided that the \u201cassessors,.in increasing the valuation and acreage as set forth above, acted illegally and without jurisdiction.\u201d From the judgment on the decision the assessors appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Our decision turns upon the time at which the assessors are compelled by the statute to complete and file the roll,\u2014whether on the second Tuesday of May, or whether they may alter the roll at an adjourned meeting held on or before Saturday, the 12th. Section 104 of the village law (chapter 414, Laws 1897) provides that in villages of the third class the assessors \u201cshall, on or before the first Tuesday of May [in 1900 this was May 1st] prepare an assessment-roll of the persons and property taxable within the village in the same manner and form as is required by law for the preparation of a town assessment-roll.\u201d Section 105, headed, \u201cMeeting of Assessors to Hear Complaints,\u201d requires them, one week before the first Tuesday of May, to publish a notice that they will meet on that day \u201cfor the purpose of completing the assessment-roll, and of hearing and determining complaints in relation thereto, and they may adjourn such meeting from day to day, not later than the Saturd\u00e1y then next succeeding\u201d (in 1900. This was the 5th). Section 106, headed, \u201cCompletion and Verification of Assessment-Roll,\u201d provides that \u201cWhen the assessors, * * * shall have completed the village assessment-roll,\u201d they shall verify it, and \u201cth\u00e9 roll as so completed and verified shall be filed with the village clerk, on or before * * * the second Tuesday in May.\u201d Section 107, headed, \u201cFailure to Hold Meeting,\u201d provides that, \u201cif the meeting for completing the village assessment-roll and hearing complaints in relation thereto is not held on\u201d the appointed day, each of the assessors shall forfeit to the village ten dollars, and they shall fix another time and give notice thereof. \u201cThe assessors shall meet accordingly * * * shall hear complaints, complete the assessment-roll, and file the same on or before\u201d the fourth day thereafter. From this summary of the provisions of the statute, it seems evident that, except in cases where there has been a failure to hold the meeting, the assessors are required to complete, verify, and file the assessment roll on or before the second Tuesday in May. This is still further emphasized by section 108, which reads, \u201cUpon completing and filing the annual assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>ment-roll, * * * and on or before the second Tuesday in May,\u201d' the assessors shall publish notice of filing and opportunity .for. inspection for 15 days; and section 109 provides for a review on certiorari within such .15 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In Clark v. Norton, 49 N. Y. 243, decided in 1872, the tax law then in force (1 Rev. St., 5th Ed., p. 909) was under consideration. Section 8 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">\u201cBetween the first days of May and July, in each year, they_ shall proceed to ascertain, by diligent inquiry, the names of all the taxable inhabitants in their respective towns or wards, and also all the taxable property, real or personal, within the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Subsequent sections provide substantially as is now provided for the method of making up the assessment rolls, and what must be entered thereon. \u201cSec. 17. (Sec. 19) \u2018The assessors shall complete the assessment rolls on or before the first day of August, in every year,\u2019 <em>\u201d </em>etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The court said (page 247): 0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">\u201cThe [town] assessment must be made by the 1st of July, and of property and persons in respect to the liability as it exists on that day. The assessment roll must be completed, and a fair copy made and deposited for examination by those interested, on or before the 1st day of August. An individual not liable to taxation on the 1st of July could not be placed upon the-assessment roll after that time; neither could a person whose name was properly on the assessment roll be assessed for property acquired by him after that day. People v. Supervisors of Chenango Co., 11 N. Y. 563. * * * To add names to the roll, after the deposit for examination, or to change the character and amount of property for which individuals are assessed, is to deprive the party affected of the benefit of the notice required by statute, and the opportunity to apply for correction, which the legislature designed all persons should have, and which the persons named in the original roll have, in respect to property appearing on such original roll as assessed to them. * * * The duty of the assessors had been fully performed when the assessment roll was completed, except in the matter of a review of the assessment as made and as permitted by statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">In Overing v. Foote, 65 N. Y. 263, 270, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-11\">\u201cThe town assessors are therefore required \u2018between the first days of May and July in each year * * * to proceed to ascertain, by diligent inquiry, the names of all the taxable inhabitants in their respective towns or wards, and, also, all the taxable property, real or personal, within the same.\u2019 1 Rev. St. p. 390, \u00a7 8. And they are required to make an assessment roll, in which names, amounts, and values are to be specially stated. The words of \u2022 the statute are clear, and the decision of the courts of the highest authority is that these duties prescribed by law must be strictly observed (Clark v. Norton, 49 N. Y. 243), and that the assessment roll for the current year,\u2018containing the names of the persons to be assessed, must be, in one sense, determined upon by the assessors on or before the 1st day of July in each year. It is very clear that they cannot extend the time for the performance of this duty without assuming the functions of the legislature, any more than they can enlarge their powers in other respects.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">In People v. Forrest, supra, the court said (page 547):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-13\">\u201cIt has been decided, and is not now disputed, that after the completion of the roll, and the formal notice of that completion, assessors are without jurisdiction to change either the persons or property assessed, or the adjudged valuation of the latter, except upon complaint of the party aggrieved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">Summarizing these statutes and decisions, it was the duty of the assessors to complete their assessment roll on or before the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Tuesday of May (the 8th), and after that date they had no power to alter the assessment upon the city\u2019s property. The record shows that the assessment as to the city\u2019s property which appeared on the assessment roll was not changed \"till the 10th of May, two days afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Tt is claimed in the appellants\u2019 brief that the figures in the roll were only \"preliminary figures,\u201d were in pencil only, and hence not final. No such fact appears in the petition or return, and, even if it did appear, it would not alter the duty of the assessors to complete and file the roll on the second Tuesday of May. If a taxpayer, on examination of the completed assessment roll, finds that he is not inequitably assessed, and is willing to accept the decision of the assessors therein expressed, he is entitled to assume that no change will be made, and to act accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">' It becomes unnecessary to consider the contention of the corporation counsel, referred to in the opini\u00f3n of Mr. Justice Gaynor, that an assessment cannot be complained of before the board by other taxpayers on the roll, and increased, as being too low'; and we do not determine it. Judgment affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
