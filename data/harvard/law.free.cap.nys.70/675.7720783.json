Plaintiff\u2019s wife testified that she made out bills from the account book, and presented them to defendant, and defendant stated that the bills were in the hands of his attorney. <em>Held, </em>that the account book, exclusive of the accounts for 1882-83, was admissible as secondary evidence, because of defendant\u2019s failure to produce the bills, since the evidence was sufficient on a reference to show a notice to defendant to produce them.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b693-12\">Appeal from special term, Queens county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b693-13\">Action by Alfred P.

It was tried before a referee, who dismissed the complaint on the merits. I think that the judgment must be reversed for error in the exclusion of testimony. The plaintiff produced Exhibits A and B for identification, and testified that they were his account books for 1882 and 1883, respectively. He then produced Exhibit C for identification, as his account book from 1881 to 1894. He testified that he kept these books, and that he had no clerk; that A and B contained all the work done in 1882 and 1883, respectively; and that he made the transfer to 0 in 1884, specifically referring to the transfer from the book for 1883, and by implication to the book of 1882. It is contended that this testimony, and other testimony offered after the Exhibit C had been first rejected, made the said Exhibit C admissible. Even assuming that Exhibit C was the original book, and so disregarding the fact that it was in part but a copy, I think that the appellant did not\" meet the rule of Vos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>burgh v. Thayer, 12 Johns. 461. The rule is quoted in the recent case of Smith v. Smith, 163 N. Y. 168, 57 N. E. 300, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\">\u201c \u2018Unless a foundation is first laid for tlieir admission, by proving that the party had no clerk, that some of the articles charged have been delivered, that the books produced are the account books of the party, and that he keeps fair and honest accounts, and this by those who have dealt and settled with him.\u2019 The rule, as thus laid down, has been since accepted as correct. McGoldrick v. Traphagen, 88 N. Y. 334; Tomlinson v. Borst, 30 Barb. 42; Dooley v. Moan, 57 Hun, 535, 11 N. Y. Supp. 239.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The witness Place testified that he settled his indebtedness to the plaintiff according to bills presented. Kolb had a dispute over one item, and prevailed, while his settlement was upon the bill presented. Hicks did testify that he settled according to .the books; but his deal- ' ings were all within two years of the trial, and therefore subsequent to 1897, while it did not appear that Exhibit C for identification (the . account) related to any transaction subsequent to 1894. Moreover, it did not appear in what book Hicks\u2019 account was kept; and the plaintiff testified, referring to Exhibit C for identification: \u201cIt contains the work I did for Mr. Remsen and other accounts. This book does not contain account for all work done by me for other people. I have other accounts.\u2019' And, finally, Hicks admitted that there was a credit to which he was entitled, but on examination of the books the credit did not appear, although it was finally allowed. This testimony does not show that the books were fair and honest, though the plaintiff was, when his attention was called to the error in them. The testimony of witnesses that they settled according to bills presented is not sufficient. Powell v. Murphy, 18 App. Div. 25, 45 N. Y. Supp. 374; Davis v. Seaman, 64 Hun, 572, 19 N. Y. Supp. 260. It has been held (hat books constitute a personal transaction within the prohibition of section 829 of the Code, in that testimony of a claimant as to their correctness is not competent. Davis v. Seaman, supra. But I think (hat, in any event, a part of the book Exhibit C was admissible upon a ground different from that suggested by the learned counsel. The wife of the plaintiff testified that she had made out bills correctly copied from Exhibit C, and had rendered them to the testator. The defendant, upon his cross-examination, referring to the bills in question, said: \u201cMy counsel has the bills that were presented. I said I would not produce the bills rendered by Mr. Wright to Mr. Remsen.\u201d I think that on a reference this may be held sufficient as notice to produce those bills (Kerr v. McGuire, 28 N. Y. 446; Jones, Ev. \u00a7\u00a7 219, 220), and that, therefore, in the failure to produce the bills, a part of the book Exhibit 0 for identification was admissible under the facts proven in the case. I am not unmindful of the rule of Reddington v. Gilman, 1 Bosw. 235, which requires that the best secondary evidence must be produced, and which is authority against the admission of a copy when the original book is available; but the testimony in this case was sufficient to establish that Exhibit C, for the years exclusive of 1882 and 1883, was a book of original entry. The objection sustained was directed generally to the entire exhibit, and therefore did not warrant the learned referee in excluding so^ much of the exhibit as presented the best secondary evidence.
