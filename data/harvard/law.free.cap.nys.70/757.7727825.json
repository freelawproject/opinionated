Bolger, and leased by him to his mother, Eliza Bolger. The allegation is that the work, labor, and plumbing materials were furnished at the special instance and request of the defendants. There is no proof that any work or material was ordered by Charles F. Bolger, save certain work and materials, for which bills had been rendered to him, which, it is admitted, were paid. There is no presumption of his liability for work ordered by his tenant arising from the mere facts that he was the owner of the house, and for a time was a boarder therein. The plaintiff, under exception, offered testimony that, when money was demanded of the defendant Eliza Bolger, she said that her son owned the house,-and would pay the bill rendered. But this declaration of the tenant is not sufficient to cast liability upon the landlord. It does not appear but that the conversation of Charles F. Bolger with plaintiff\u2019s workmen referred to the work that he himself ordered, and for which, admittedly, he has paid; or, in any event, that it referred to any work covered by the bill of particulars in this case. On the other hand, the testimony of Eliza Bolger is that she had no authority from Tier son to order the work in question, but that she took the responsibility upon herself. She also testified that she paid an annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>rent of $900, and that there was no understanding as to who should, make the repairs, but that she had expected to make them. Mr. Bolger testifies that he never ordered any of the work, and never authorized any one to order it, but, on the contrary, that he distinctly said that none must be ordered at his expense; and that the first time that he ever learned of this claim\u2014which is for work done in 1897, 1898, and 1899\u2014was in July, 1899, when his mother tolcL him that she owed the bill, and could not attend to the plumbing any longer* He testifies, too, that no bills for any work or materials had ever been rendered to him other than those I have referred to in this-opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The judgment of the municipal court must be reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur, except H3BSCHBERG, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
