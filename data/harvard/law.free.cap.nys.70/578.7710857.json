Benham (Sup.) 63 N. Y. Supp. 923, who had previously been tried and convicted of murder in the first degree at a trial term of the supreme court held in Genesee county. Such retainer was thereafter duly approved in writing by the county judge of Genesee county, and the same was thereupon filed in the clerk\u2019s office of that county. An appeal from the judgment and conviction had in the meantime been taken to the court of appeals, and the same was argued by the relator, who had expended much time and labor in the preparation of an elaborate brief for such argument. The judgment appealed from was affirmed by the court of appeals, and thereafter a motion was made by the defendant for a new trial upon the ground, of newly-discovered evidence, and also for a change of venue. 55 N. E. 11. This motion was argued at special term, the relator appearing thereon, and' opposing the same on behalf of the people. The court at special term granted .the motion for a new trial,, which it directed should be had in the county of Ontario. Upon the second trial, which was had before a different justice from \"the one presiding at the first trial, the relator assisted the district attorney, and rendered valuable service. This trial resulted in a verdict of acquittal, -whereupon- the relator presented his bill for the services so rendered by \u2019him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\u25a0with an affidavit showing the amount of work performed by him, to the justice presiding at the second trial. The items of such bill were as follows, viz.: For services in the court of appeals, $1,000; for services on motion for new trial and for a change of place of trial, $250; for services on the second trial, $1,000. Thereafter, and on the 28th day of June, 1900, the justice to whom such bill was presented certified that the same was reasonable, and \u25a0directed the treasurer of Genesee county to pay the same, and charge it to the proper fund. Thereupon the relator presented his bill, together with fhe certificate of the trial justice, to the treasurer of Genesee county, who informed the relator that he had no funds with which to pay the same; and he subsequently presented the matter to the board of supervisors, and that hody, after consultation with the relator, assumed to audit the first two items \u25a0of the relator\u2019s bill by reducing the charge for services in the court of appeals to $500, and allowing the charge made for services in opposing the motion for .a new trial at the amount named in the bill, viz. $250. The remaining item for services rendered upon the second trial was regarded by the board as \u25a0fixed by the trial justice, and, in consequence thereof, no attempt was made to audit the same. The relator was paid the amount allowed by the board of supervisors, and he thereupon applied for and obtained this writ of certiorari to review the action of the board in reducing the first item of his bill.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b597-5\">Argued before ADAMS, P: J., and McLEMNAhT, SPBESTG, WILLIAMS, and BUMSEY, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-6\">Myron H. Peck, in pro. per.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-7\">George Bowen, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b597-8\">ADAMS, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVFY\">The relator bases his right to maintain this pro\u2022ceeding upon the provisions of section 204 of the county law (Laws 1892, c. 686), which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">\u201cThe district attorney of any county in which a capital or other important \u25a0criminal action is to be tried, with the approval in writing of the county judge, which shall be filed in the office of the county clerk, may employ counsel to .assist him on such trial; and the costs and expenses thereof, to be certified by the judge presiding at the trial, shall be a charge upon the county in which the indictment is found.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">It is contended that, although this section, when strictly construed, provides only for. the employment and. payment of counsel who may be designated to assist a district attorney upon the trial of \u201ca capital \u25a0or other important criminal action,\u201d yet, inasmuch as the services rendered and charged for by the relator were, in a sense, incidental to the trial, they properly come within its scope and spirit. The question thus raised is certainly presented with no little force and ingenuity, but it is one which, in the view we take of the case, does not require any consideration at the present time, inasmuch as we .-.are of the opinion that in no event can the relator maintain this proreeding. The statute upon which the relator rests his contention requires as a condition of charging the costs and expenses of counsel designated to assist a district attorney upon the county that the same shall first \u201cbe certified by the judge presiding at the trial.\u201d The plain purpose of this provision, it seems to us, is to secure the approval of a judge, who would know better than any one else the nature and value of the services rendered; and, this being so, we do not .see how it can be said that the judge who presided at the second trial was qualified to certify as to the services which had theretofore been rendered before other judges, and in proceedings which may .have involved quite different questions from those litigated upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>second trial. If the relator is correct in Ms contention that the appeal to the court of appeals and the motion at special term were incidental to, and a continuation of, the first trial,\u2014as to which we express no opinion,\u2014we think that, within the plain intent and meaning of the statute, the judge who presided at the first trial is the only one who has any power to certify the costs and expenses of those proceedings; and, this being so, it necessarily follows that the relator\u2019s writ should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Writ of certiorari dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
