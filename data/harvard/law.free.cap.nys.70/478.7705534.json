The said West owned an automobile of somewhat crude and unusual construction, and propelled by steam generated by a gasoline burner. In October, 1898, Mr. West and his wife were riding in their vehicle for pleasure, and passed along Tracy Park, one of the streets in the city of Rochester. This street is about 15 feet in width from curb to curb. The plaintiffs were in the laundry business, and their employ\u00e9 in delivering packages of laundry stopped in front of his father\u2019s house in that street, and left the horse unattended, but held by an iron weight of 30 pounds, attached to the bridle by a strap. The horse became frightened at the approaching horseless carriage of Mr. West, and ran away, and the horse, wagon, and harness were injured, and a recovery was. had in the municipal court therefor, which was reversed by the county court, as being against the weight of evidence. There was some evidence justifying the conclusion reached by the municipal court. The testimony of the plaintiffs tended to show that the carriage gave forth a loud, puffing noise, and could be heard for two blocks; that the odor was pronounced; that as the carriage ran along there was a humming sound from its engine; that steam or smoke issued from the exhaust, and that teams had been frightened by it; that at the time of this accident it was passing the plaintiffs\u2019 horse at the speed of 10 or 12 miles an hour, and did not slacken until the horse became frightened. The judgment of reversal in this case was rendered before the recent amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>ment to section 3063 of the Code of Civil Procedure became a law,, which perhaps permits the appellate court to reverse a judgment, of the justice\u2019s court as against the weight of evidence. The authorities were then quite uniform in holding that it was not permissible-for the county court to reverse a judgment of the justice as against the weight of evidence, if there was any disputed question of fact, Ludlum v. Couch, 10 App. Div. 603, 42 N. Y. Supp. 370; Hommel v, Meserole, 18 App. Div. 106, 45 N. Y. Supp. 407; Northridge v. Astarita, 47 App. Div. 486, 62 N. Y. Supp. 441; Tower v. Blessing, 55 App. Div. 634, 67 N. Y. Supp. 124; Clark v. Daniels, 29 App. Div. 600, 51 N. Y. Supp. 177. This rule is applicable to the municipal court of Rochester. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3226; Laws 1876, c. 196, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">That the use of the streets must become extended to meet the-modern innovations of rapid locomotion is evid\u00e9nt, and we do not mean to suggest that an automobile or any other of the present means of conveyance is an unlawful or improper user, but in this-particular case that there was evidence to support the judgment of the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The judgment of the county court is reversed, with costs and disbursements, and that of the municipal court affirmed, with costs. All concur, except ADAMS, P. J., who dissents, upon the ground that there is no evidence in the case of negligence on the part of the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
