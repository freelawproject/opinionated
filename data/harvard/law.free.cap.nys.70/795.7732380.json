The complaint alleges that, according to the agreement between the parties, the plaintiff agreed to and did prepare the architectural and engineering drawings, plans, specifications, and estimates necessary for the proper construction of a certain building, and supervised the construction of the building in accordance with the plans and specifications, and performed all the general services of a contractor and superintendent of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>\u00abtruction in and about the building. In the bill of particulars served, after stating in detail the nature of plaintiff\u2019s claim, a further statement is inserted to the effect that the action is brought to recover for services rendered in \u201cperforming all the general services of a \u2022contractor.\u201d What these services were, or their value, is not indicated either in the complaint or in the bill of particulars served. The defendant is entitled, in order that he may properly prepare his defense, to have this information; and to this extent the order appealed from is modified by requiring the plaintiff to furnish a \u25a0further bill of particulars, stating in detail what he did and the value' of the services rendered by him in \u201cperforming all the general \u25a0services of a contractor,\u201d and, as thus modified, the order appealed from is affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
