Thirteenth. I constitute and appoint my son-in-law, Charles A. Tatum, the executor of this, my will, and trustee of the several trust estates here<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>inbefore created; and I hereby authorize and empower my said executor and trustee to sell, at public or private sale, and at such time or times, and in such manner, and for such sum or sums, and upon such terms as to him, in the exercise of his best judgment, may seem most expedient, and to convey, all or any part of my real and personal estate as he may consider it necessary or proper to do for the payment of my said debts and of said legacies, and for any other purpose or purposes whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The question presented by this appeal is whether the testatrix intended that there should be a conversion of the realty. She left a house, lot, and stable, and $70,000 in personal property. Three grandchildren\u2014two of age, and one an infant 12 years old\u2014survived her. When the testatrix died, one of the elder grandchildren was married to Mr. Preston. Mrs. Preston died intestate, without issue, leaving her husband, and, as her only heir at law, her father. The husband took out letters of administration upon his wife\u2019s estate. Shortly after the death of the testatrix, the realty was sold for $15,000. The father of the said deceased grandchild claims a share of the proceeds as heir at law of his daughter; and her husband claims such share on the theory that the will of the testatrix effected conversion of said realty at the time of her death, and that therefore the proceeds pass to 'him, as personalty. Before a conversion can be justified, there must appear a positive direction. There is none expressed in this will, for the power of sale is clearly discretionary. And such a direction can only be implied \u201cwhen the design and purpose of the testator is unequivocal, and the implication so strong as to leave no substantial doubt.\u201d For, where only a discretionary power to sell is given, and the scheme of the will can be carried out without a conversion, the land will remain land. Scholle v. Scholle, 113 N. Y. 261, 21 N. E. 84; Clift v. Moses, 116 N. Y. 144, 22 N. E. 393. The eleventh paragraph provides that the residuary estate, real and personal, is given, devised, and bequeathed to the three grandchildren named, for their own use and benefit forever, share and share alike. The single limitation applies only because of the infancy of the third grandchild. But, subject to the adult grandchildren\u2019s right to a partition, the real property, as realty, could have been held for him until his majority, then to vest in him. The learned counsel for the appellant argues that the words \u201cinvest,\u201d \u201cpay,\u201d \u201cprincipal sum, with interest and accumulations,\u201d \u201cin equal proportions,\u201d \u201cshare in such fund,\u201d and \u201cpaid,\u201d all indicate that the testatrix contemplated a sale of the real estate. But it must not be forgotten that these words are used in the clause of the will whereby disposition is made of all the rest, residue, and remainder of the property and estate, real and personal, which consisted for the most part of personal property. The word \u201cinvest\u201d may be limited as applicable to the personalty, as may be the words \u201cprincipal sum, with interest and accumulations.\u201d \u201cIn equal proportions\u201d does not necessarily require a sale of the rqalty. The word \u201cfund,\u201d in its broader meaning, may include property of every kind (And. Law Dict.; Miller v. Bradish, 69 Iowa, 278, 280, 28 N. W. 594), while the word \u201cpay,\u201d while affording strong implication, is not enough to establish the rule (Chamberlain v. Taylor, 105 N. Y. 185, 11 N. E. 625). The learned counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>asks, if it was the intention of the testatrix that the real estate should be held unsold for 10 years, why did the executor sell it almost immediately? It may be answered that the exercise of a discretionary power by the executor is no proof of the intention of his testator. The fact that the executor applied the proceeds of the sale as directed by the will does not show, as is contended, that he was compelled to sell in order to carry out the scheme of the testator. There is more force in the point that the full share of the adult surviving grandchild, as provided for in the eleventh clause of the will, in case of the death of any grandchild before its maturity, could not be \u201cpaid forthwith,\u201d so far as the realty is concerned; but the argument, after all, depends upon the use of the inapt term \u201cpay,\u201d which, as I have said, is far from sufficient to establish the intention for conversion. Chamberlain v. Taylor, supra. The learned counsel for the appellant mainly relies upon Salisbury v. Slade, 160 N. Y. 278, 54 N. E. 741, and Kinnier v. Rogers, 42 N. Y. 531. In the first case, Bartlett, J., quotes: \u201cPrecedents are not very valuable where the decision must be based on the peculiar phraseology of the entire will. Delafield v. Barlow, 107 N. Y. 540, 14 N. E. 498.\u201d The scheme before his court was a devise of a life estate to the widow in an estate consisting largely of realty, which upon her death was directed to be divided into seven shares, three of which were to be paid over to the sons at once, and four of which were to pass into four separate trusts for life, and a restriction that the executors and trustees must not sell or divide up the real estate during the life estate, or the widowhood of the holder thereof. The court held that the provisions for the children raised of necessity an implied trust to sell, and that the restriction as to selling and dividing up during the life or widowhood of the widow meant that it should be sold and divided up after the period named, as the rest of the estate had been; otherwise, the will could not be carried out. Pages 289, 290, 160 N. Y., and page 743, 54 N. E. The case, is not an authority, because the scheme of this will is essentially different. For in the case at bar there is an absolute devise, effective upon the death, of the testatrix, save that an undivided third share is held by trustees during the minority of the devisees thereof, and the power of sale of the entire estate is but in discretion. The decision in Kinnier v. Rogers, supra, held that a discretionary power of sale following an absolute devise was valid, but it did not apply the doctrine of conversion. And the quotation from the opinion of Lott, J., therein, made by the learned counsel, is pertinent to the case at bar, without making for the appellant, inasmuch as it but states the reasons that may well have induced the testator to give a discretionary power of sale to his executors. Now, that power is given in this case, and similar reasons may well have moved the testatrix. Many other cases are cited by the learned counsel which are instances of the application of the rule of equitable conversion. There is no dispute about the rule. This contest turns upon the application of it. I think that the cases cited are not precedents, because provisions of the wills or the express directions of the testators, essentially different to the provisions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>directions of this will, required or justified the application of the rule. A precedent in such a case as this must show provisions similar, a scheme identical, or language equipollent. I am of opinion that the intention of the testatrix can be fully carried out without the application of the rule invoked by the appellant. 2 Story, Eq. Jur. (13th Ed.) p. 552, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-3\">\u201cIn general, courts of equity .do not incline to interfere to change the quality of the property as the testator or intestate has left it, unless there is some clear act or intention by which he has unequivocally fixed upon it throughout a definite character either as money or as land. For, it has been said, there is not a spark of equity between the next of kin and the heir as to the right of property in such cases; and therefore the general principle adopted is that the heir shall take all the property which has attached to it the quality of real estate, if there is not some other definite and specific purpose to which it is entirely devoted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The decree must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
