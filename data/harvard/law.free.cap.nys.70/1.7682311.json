The learned justice held, in dismissing the complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-5\">\u201cThe complaint is dismissed for insufficiency of proof, and for the reason that the testimony of plaintiff is so varying and contradictory that the court is unwilling to issue a body execution upon it. Furthermore, neither Margolies nor plaintiff was the owner, and there was no proof of demand to return the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">As there was no contradiction of the evidence of plaintiff and his witness, and said witnesses were not impeached, it was error to deny, its conclusiveness. Hull v. Littauer, 162 N. Y. 569, 57 N. E. 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">. The defendant having exercised an act of ownership by causing the mantles to be affixed to the building, no demand for their return was necessary; the sole object of a demand being to turn an otherwise lawful possession into an unlawful one by reason of a refusal to comply with it, and thus to supply evidence of a conversion. After a wrongful taking and carrying away of the property, the cause of action has become complete, without further act on plaintiff\u2019s part. Pease v. Smith, 61 N. Y. 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">In the case at bar defendant never came into lawful possession of the property. It was taken to the building to deliver to the builder, Margolies, on payment. Plaintiff waited two days to make that delivery and collection. On Sunday defendant ordered the articles set in the building, and paid for that work done on that day. The conversion was completed, and no demand was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
