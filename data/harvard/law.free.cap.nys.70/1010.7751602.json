That court had jurisdiction of the persons of the defendants and of the subject of the action. Worthington v. Accident Co., 164 N. Y. 81, 58 N. E. 102; Dodge Mfg. Co. v. Nassau Show-Case Co., 44 App. Div. 603, 61 N. Y. Supp. 111; Irwin v. Railway Co., 38 App. Div. 253, 57 N. Y. Supp. 21; Kantro v. Armstrong, 44 App. Div. 506, 60 N. Y. Supp. 970. The defendants answered upon the merits, and gave the bond required by section 1366 of the charter \u25a0 (Laws 1897, c. 378), and removed the case to this court. This court had \u25a0 \u2022 jurisdiction of the cause of action, which is a money demand for $500. Const, art. 6, \u00a7 14; Code Civ. Proc. <em>\u00a7 </em>340. Upon principle and authority, I think that the defendants are estopped to say that the court has not jurisdiction of their persons. McMahon v. Sherman, 14 N. Y. St. Rep. 637; Patten v. Neal, 62 How. Prac. 158; Clapp v. Graves, 26 N. Y. 418; Plankroad Co. v. Baker, 12 How. Prac. 371; Bunker v. Langs, 76 Hun, 543, 28 N. Y. Supp. 210. The defense was a general denial. The conversion could not be justified by showing title in a stranger to the suit without connecting the defendants with it. There was no such plea, and no such question was before the court. Wheeler v. Lawson, 103 N. Y. 40, 8 N. E. 360. Motion for a new trial denied; 5 per cent, extra allowance to plaintiff.
