Association, 42 App. Div. 65, 58 N. Y. Supp. 885, an order made upon a trial at special term, .dis: missing a complaint upon plaintiff\u2019s opening, upon the ground that it did not state a cause of action, was' held not appealable. - !The remedy of the aggrieved party was held to be by appeal from the judgment entered thereupon. Van Brunt, P. J., writing for a unanimous court, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-16\">\u201cIt is difficult to see how the ruling of the court upon the trial of this action can be reviewed, except upon an appeal from a judgment when such judgment shall be entered. The order appealed from was a mere decision upon the trial, holding that, in view of the admissions of the plaintiff, no recovery could , be had upon the complaint as it stood. Such a decision cannot be reviewed upon an appeal; but a judgment must be entered, an appeal taken from the judgment, a case made, and the appeal brought up in the regular way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-17\">The appellant sought upon the argument to distinguish the case at bar by section 275 of the Code, regulating appeals from decisions of the court of claims. That section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-18\">\u201cEither party may appeal from an order or judgment of the court of claims to the appellate division of the supreme court of the Third department. * * * The provisions of this Code relating to appeals in the supreme court apply, so far as practicable, to appeals from orders or judgments of the court of claims, except as modified in this article.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-19\">We have no doubt that the provisions of this section of the Code give no greater right of appeal than is given from orders in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>supreme court, and that a ruling upon a trial dismissing or refusing to dismiss- a complaint is not subject to separate appeal. The party must wait until the judgment is entered and appeal therefrom. If this ruling can be now reviewed, then, after the claimant\u2019s evidence is in, another motion can he made and denied, and an appeal taken from the order denying that motion. If that order is sustained, they may still go back and introduce the defendant\u2019s evidence, and then, upon a motion to dismiss the complaint, the order made thereon would be appealable. Such practice would be intolerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The appeal should be dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
