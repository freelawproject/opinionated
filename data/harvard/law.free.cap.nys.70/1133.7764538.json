The sole question litigated was whether such employment was for a certain period, within which the plaintiff was discharged, or by the week. This presented a fair issue of fact for the court, and the testimony before us would not warrant a disturbance of its decision. The appellant insists that the court erred in excluding his testimony offered to show the terms of his employment of his workmen other than the plaintiff. I think that the ruling was right.
