Thurston, as overseer of the poor of the town of Goshen, and for whom the defendants were sureties upon his official bond. It appears that he served three successive terms of three years each as overseer of the poor, commencing respectively in the springs of 1891, 1894, and 1897. The defendants are sureties on all of the bonds given by him for these terms, but the action is only on the last two. There is no serious dispute about the fact of his defalcation in the sum for which the defendants have been held liable, but they charge various errors in the rulings of the trial court, which will be considered as presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">The official verified reports filed by the overseer from time to time were received in evidence as proof of the condition of his accounts, both of receipts and disbursements. By section 26 of the poor law (chapter 225, Laws 1896), the overseer was obliged to keep books of account, and to render from them verified itemized accounts, to be audited and settled by the board of town auditors. That such accounts were competent evidence against the sureties would seem to follow from the decision in Board v. Bristol, 99 N. Y. 316, 1 N. E. 878. That action was on a county treasurer\u2019s bond, and Chief Judge Ruger said (page 321, 99 N. Y., and page 881, 1 N. E.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>\u201cThe undertaking o\u00ed sureties on a treasurer\u2019s official hond is that he shall faithiully perform his duties, and this involves the obligation of making correct reports, conforming to the requirements of the statute, as well as the payment of funds in his custody. In an action against sureties for an alleged breach of such a bond, the official reports made during the term covered by them are a part of the res gestae, and competent evidence, not only of the facts affirmatively appearing therein, but also of such other facts and circumstances bearing upon the liability of the sureties as are legitimately inferable therefrom. Fenner v. Lewis, 10 Johns. 38; Douglass v. Howland, 24 Wend. 36; 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 187. This arises not alone from the principle authorizing the reception of such evidence as declarations of the principal, but as being an official act performed under the direction of the statute in pursuance of the stipulations contained in the bond, whereby the sureties have assumed the liability of any neglect in the discharge of the duty. Goss v. Watlinton, 7 E. C. L. 380; Whitnash v. George, 15 E. C. L. 295; Middleton v. Melton, 10 Barn. &amp; C. 317.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">If there is anything in the cases cited by the appellants, viz. Bissell v. Saxton, 66 N. Y. 55, and Kellum v. Clark, 97 N. Y. 390, in conflict with this,\u2014and I do not think there is,\u2014it must be deemed to be overruled by the later decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In the account of the overseer audited March 1, 1895, an item of 1102.08 appears as \u201ccash on hand last settlement.\u201d The last settlement referred to was at the termination of his first three y\u00e9ars of service, and the balance then remaining on hand was carried over into the account for his second term. The defendants introduced the overseer\u2019s books of account in evidence, on which this item is carried in the 1895 account as \u201ccash on hand from last set.\u201d The evidence, therefore, all indicates that the defalcation involved in the misappropriation of this item occurred during the second, and not the first, term of the overseer, and that the defendants were properly charged with it. The case differs in this respect from Kellum v. Clark, supra, in that there the overseer testified that he had the spent money in question for his own use before the commencement of the term covered by the bond sued on. Here there is not only no such evidence, but what there is is the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The defendants offered to prove that certain members of the town board knew, before the second bond in question was executed, that the overseer was short in his accounts. The evidence was excluded, and in this there was no error. The learned counsel for the appellants cite cases to the effect that the fraudulent concealment by the obligee of material facts in relation to the character and conduct of the principal will operate to relieve the surety obligor from liability on the bond; but such cases have no application to this one. The town of Goshen, in its corporate capacity, has done and omitted nothing by which the bonds in question could be invalidated. The members of the town board are town officers, as the overseer was. If they deceived the defendants as to the condition of the overseer\u2019s accounts, the remedy is against them, and not the town. The evidence excluded might possibly have been competent if offered for the purpose of impeaching the overseer\u2019s reports or the audits. It does not appear to have been offered or intended for that purpose, nor does sufficient- appear to indicate that it would or could have been effective in that regard. But, for the purpose stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>by counsel at the time it was offered, it seems clearly incompetent and immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs, upon the law and facts. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
