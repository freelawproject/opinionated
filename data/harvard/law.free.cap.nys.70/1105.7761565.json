At the close of the evidence the trial judge directed a verdict for the defendant, and we are called upon to determine whether there was any evidence upon which a finding of fact in favor of the plaintiff could be based. It appears from the proof that the plaintiff was in the real-estate business; that the defendant employed him to take charge of and to sell the property for $7,000; that she gave him the keys, and he put up a sign reading: \u201cFor Sale or To Let. Apply to William D. Palmer.\u201d It appears that plaintiff opened negotiations with Underhill, the purchaser; gave him the keys of the house \"and the price of the property; that Underhill offered $5,500, which the plaintiff refused, whereupon Underhill applied to the defendant, who sold him the property for that sum, and then wrote to the plaintiff that she had sold the property, and, \u201cof course, I am to pay you the commission of percentage allowed you by law. It has not been possible for me to induce him to pay your commissions. * * * You had charge and keys of the place. The reward is due to you, even if I had the most trouble for the purchasing.\u201d This evidence was sufficient to call for and require the submission to the jury of the questions of plaintiff\u2019s employment by the defendant, and whether or not the sale was effected through the plaintiff\u2019s agency as its procuring cause. In Lloyd v. Matthews, 51 N. Y. 124, it was held that, if the broker\u2019s communications with the purchaser were the means of bringing him and the owner together, and the sale resulted in a contract, the compensation was earned, although the broker did not negotiate, and was not present at, the sale. It appeared by defendant\u2019s letter that she knew that the plaintiff had been instrumental in sending the purchaser, and, while it was true that the purchase price was less than the sum fixed by the defendant, the plaintiff is entitled to at least a proportion of the agreed commission, as defendant continued the negotiation commenced by the plaintiff, and the sale proceeded from his efforts. Martin v. Silliman, 53 N. Y. 615. In Ware v. Dos Passos, 162 N. Y. 281, 56 N. E. 742, the court held that defendant\u2019s admission that he considered the plaintiff to be the procuring cause of the sale was evidence supporting plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, and that a judgment entered upon a nonsuit in an action brought by the broker to recover commissions must be reversed. We are of opinion that there was sufficient evidence that the plaintiff procured the purchaser, and was, in the meaning of the term, \u201cthe procuring cause,\u201d to require the submission of the question to the jury, and that the court erred in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-7\">. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
