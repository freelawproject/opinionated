Certain charges for the year 1900 were required to be paid to preserve their rights as patentees, and these, with the expense incidental to- remittance, were borne by the plaintiff. Thereafter this action was brought to recover from the defendant his proportion of such charges and expenses, the plaintiff alleging that the payment was made in reliance upon the defendant\u2019s express promise to refund the amount in proportion to his ownership of the patents. Counsel for the appellant contends, and counsel for the respondent concedes, that under the written articles hereinbefore alluded to the parties were co-partners. However, notwithstanding this fact, the action was, nevertheless, maintainable, since no accounting of their joint transactions was involved (Ferguson v. Baker, 116 N. Y. 257, 22 N. E. 400; Bank v. Delafield, 126 N. Y. 410, 27 N. E. 797); but plaintiff clearly failed in his proof, and the evidence in no aspect justifies the judgment recovered. The defendant\u2019s alleged promise was made in August, 1899, and the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>ment of the charges imposed upon the patents was not made by the plaintiff until some time after May 21$ 1900. Between these dates correspondence ensued between the parties, which took its initiative from the plaintiff\u2019s demand of the defendant that the latter remit his proportion of the accruing charges; a demand with which the \" defendant pertinaciously refused to comply, excepting that he inti- ' mated his consent to such payment out of a balance of money claimed by him to be unexpended, and in the plaintiff\u2019s hands; and \u25a0 the correspondence culminated in the plaintiff\u2019s letter to the defendant\u2019s attorney under date of June 12, 1900, from which we quote as follows: \u201cI have now given you ample notice and opportunity ' to act in the matter of payment of taxes due the 25th inst., and . a further neglect on your client\u2019s part to furnish in. cash his proportion of the gross amount then payable will be considered by me as a refusal on his part to do so.\u201d That the defendant\u2019s attitude was a pronounced repudiation of the promise claimed to have been made by him, and that the plaintiff did not, therefore, make the asserted payment with reliance upon any such promise, seems irrefragable from the circumstances detailed. But counsel asserts that plaintiff made the payment in performance of a contract, made in August, 1899, so to do, from which neither party was at liberty .to recede. What contract? We have scrutinized the record in a vain effort to find evidence sufficient to support the contention that there was one. The plaintiff\u2019s personal attitude upon the trial was consistent only with a promise on his part to meet the defendant\u2019s proportion of the patent charges out of money to be previously remitted by the -latter. Nowhere does it appear that the plaintiff engaged to pay such charges in consideration of the defendant\u2019s promise to refund Ms proportion of the amount after it had been paid,\u2014 an engagement which might have entailed liability in damages for a breach of its performance. The plaintiff\u2019s attitude, as has already been .said, was a clear and- unmistakable disclaimer of any such engagement upon Ms part. Where, then, was the mutuality, the constituent of every contract? 5 Lawson, Rights, Rem. &amp; Prac. p. 3758, \u00a7. 2243. Clearly, from the proof there was no more than the defendant\u2019s offer to refund his proportion of the necessary charges if the plaintiff should meet them. Until acted upon by the plaintiff, he was permitted to withdraw. L\u2019Amoreux v. Gould, 7 N. Y. 349; Willetts v. Insurance Co., 45 N. Y. 45. And that he did withdraw the offer, if it was ever made, before any of the charges upon the patents were met by the plaintiff, is apparent from Ms repudiation .of it in the course of the correspondence already alluded to. Certain it is that the defendant\u2019s attitude therein was not such as to persuade the plaintiff to believe that he intended to fulfill any such promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
