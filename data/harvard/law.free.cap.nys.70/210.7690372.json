Obviously, upon this state of facts, she was entitled to judgment, and it was error to direct a verdict for the defendant. That this was a covenant real, enforceable by the assignee of the term, seems an indisputable proposition when it is considered that it, ,in effect, provided for the lessor\u2019s purchase of the remainder of the term, the payment being intended to take the place of the further use of the premises demised; and the plaintiff having, in compliance with and reliance upon the notice given her that the premises were sold, and that the purchaser wished for possession thereof, quit and surrendered the same, the defendant was estopped from \u2022 successfully availing himself of the circumstance that the sale alluded to in the notice was not consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Neither was the defendant aided by the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s actual surrender of possession of the demised premises did not occur until some days after the expiration of the 30 days immediately succeeding her receipt of the notice. The covenant did not obligate her to remove within the 30 days, and it was, therefore, satisfied on her part by her removal within a reasonable time after the expiration of that period. But, be that as it may, certain it is from the covenant that she was entitled to remain in possession until payment to her of the sum agreed. Two things were thereby required of the defendant as conditions precedent to any' right to the plaintiff\u2019s removal,\u2014the giving of a previous notice of 30 days, and the payment of $500, which latter she omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Again, the judgment is not to be supported because the lease provided against an assignment thereof without the written consent of the defendant under penalty of forfeiture and damages. There was abundant' evidence which tended to show the defendant\u2019s oral consent at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s purchase of the lease, and therefrom a waiver of this restriction would result. In any event, therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to have the question of the defendant\u2019s consent submitted to the jury, as requested by her counsel. But, aside from the fact that forfeiture of the lease, because of the assignment thereof, was not pleaded, the omission of the defendant\u2019s consent was immaterial, since it is elementary that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>assignment of a lease in violation of restrictions such as here appear is nevertheless effectual unless avoided by the lessor\u2019s re-entry. None such appeared or was claimed on the trial. Wood, Landl. &amp; Ten. \u00a7 323, p. 530, and cases cited in note 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">There is no force in the respondent\u2019s contention that this appeal' is not maintainable because not taken from the order of affirmance as well as from the judgment which was entered pursuant to-that order. The case cited by counsel (Waltenberg v. Bernhard, 27 Misc. Rep. 795, 58 N. Y. Supp. 325) is direct authority that the appeal was properly taken from the judgment only. The order alluded to is wholly of an interlocutory character, and so not appealable.. Whitfield v. Railroad Co. (Com. Pl.) 10 N. Y. Supp. 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The judgments of the general and trial terms of the court below should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
