The plaintiff, who was an engineer, and skilled in the iron and steel business, agreed to assist the defendant by advice and instructions as to the iron and steel business and the value of the patents, and by writing reports on the subject. The defendant was to have control of acquiring the rights and of disposing of them, and was to furnish the money necessary to complete the transaction, and agreed to pay plaintiff one-third of the net profits of the enterprise.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b633-8\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.

Parks v. Gates, 54 App. Div. 512, 66 N. Y. Supp. 1034. The plaintiff does not show that he requires the testimony of the defendant, or any evidence in his control, to establish the alleged agreement. He deposes that the agreement was maefe, and that the defendant told him that he had organized the company in London, with a capitalization of $500,000, to take over the patent rights; that he was obliged to give up a majority of the stock to parties in England, and to pay $30,000 to Mr. Edison, retaining the rest himself; and that the defendant promised to give a statement, which afterwards he declined to furnish. If the plaintiff can establish a partnership, then he is entitled to an accounting. On the other hand, he can testify to the agreement, and to the alleged admissions of the defendant. Such testimony, if believed, would seem to be sufficient to establish a prima facie case, provided there was proof of profits. So, in any event, the examination of the defendant is not necessary to the plaintiff, save upon that subject. I think that the rule of Parks v. Gates, supra, should apply, and I therefore advise that the order be affirmed, provided that the defendant stipulate in a general way\" that there were profits resulting from the disposal of the said patent rights, the particulars of which can be inquired into on the trial, provided the plaintiff make a case sufficient to warrant such inquiry. LTpon such stipulation being given, the order should be affirmed, without costs to either party. But, if the defendant neglect or refuse to make such stipulation, the order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and upon two days\u2019 notice this court will make such further order as may be proper in the premises. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
