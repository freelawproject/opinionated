He received his certificate as a shareholder September 1, 1891, by the terms of which the defendant agreed to pay him at the end of 78 months from that date the sum of $100 for each of said shares. The certificate, however, provided that this agreement to pay was \u201cin consideration of the membership fee, together with agreements and statements contained in the application for membership in the association, and full compliance with the terms, conditions, and by-laws printed on the front and back of this certificate, which are hereby referred to and made a part of this contract.\u201d By the terms and conditions of the certificate the plaintiff agreed to pay to the defendant a monthly installment of 75 cents on each of the 10 shares \u201cuntil such share matures or is withdrawn.\u201d By the by-laws printed on the certificate it is made \"plain that the resources of the corporation are chiefly the membership fees, monthly installments, fines, and interest or premium's; that the par value of the stock is $100 per share; and that such shares do not reach maturity until the association has received or earned sufficient money to pay that sum. By section 21 of article 14 of the by-laws it is expressly agreed \u201cbetween all shareholders and this association that a payment of one hundred dollars per share, named in their certificate, that has been in force till maturity, shall be accepted as full payment of all claims on their certificate or against this association.\u201d It is to be observed that the engagement on the part of the plaintiff to pay the monthly installments is not limited to the period of 78 months, but is to continue until the stock matures; and it would seem to follow necessarily that the agreement on the part of the association to pay the full value at the end of the 78 months must be understood as conditional upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the assumption that the receipts and profits would mature the stock by that time. In fact, the book value of the plaintiff\u2019s 10 shares at the time of the trial was only $629.47, and the learned trial justice-dismissed the complaint upon the theory that the 78 installments constituted an estimation only, which had proved too few. The same point was decided in O\u2019Malley v. Association, 92 Hun, 572, 36 N. Y. Supp. 1016. It was there held that such an association as' the defendant has no power to issue a certificate having a fixed period of maturity, and that any time of maturity specified should be considered to be an estimated time. It is evident that the adoption of the plaintiff\u2019s theory would lead to speedy bankruptcy. The defendant, aside from possible investments, has no income or means of income other than the interest and premiums paid by borrowing members, and the fees, installments, and fines paid by other shareholders; and it is unreasonable to suppose that its earnings would permit it to pay the enormous interest which would be involved in a return of $1,000 for the sum of less than $600 which it has received from the plaintiff. As the certificate does not, upon its face, purport to mature the stock, irrespective of the earnings, at the end of the estimated period, by providing that the payment of the installments should then cease, and as such_a provision would be clearly in violation of the defendant\u2019s trust duties and the rights and interests of the other shareholders, the more reasonable construction is approved which was adopted by the court below and sanctioned by the authority cited. The judgment, however, cannot be modified, as suggested by the appellant, so as to entitle him to the withdrawal value of his stock, as was done in O\u2019Malley v. Association, supra. The defendant is entitled to require notice of withdrawal, and the filing of the certificate at its home office, as preliminaries to such payment; and there is not only no claim or proof of the service of a notice of withdrawal, but, on the contrary, it is stipulated in the agreed statement of facts submitted on the trial that the plaintiff\u2019s certificate was \u201cnever filed with the defendant association for withdrawal,\u201d and was \u201cnever presented at the home office in Syracuse for payment or withdrawal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
