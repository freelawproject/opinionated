Therefore it must show legislative authoritv. In re Niagara Falls &amp; W. Ry. Co., 108 N. Y. 375, 15 N. E. 429; Railroad Co. v. Davis, 43 N. Y. 137, 146. The statute which is alleged to confer it is strictly, and not liberally, construed. In re Poughkeepsie Bridge Co., 108 N. Y. 483, 15 N. E. 601; In re Amsterdam Water Com\u2019rs, 96 N. Y. 351, 357. In Railroad Co. v. Kip, 46 N. Y. 546, 7 Am. Rep. 385, it is said that such a statute must receive \"a reasonably strict and guarded construction, and the powers granted will extend no further than expressly stated, or than is necessary to accomplish the general scope and purpose of the grant. If there remains a doubt as to the extent of the power, after all reasonable intendments in its favor, the doubt should be solved adversely to the claim of power.\u201d The plaintiff asserts power under several provisions of the statutes:</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">1. It contends that it may condemn this land under the prtivision of the railroad law which authorizes such a corporation \u201cto take voluntary grants of realty and other property as shall be made to it to aid in the construction, maintenance and accommodation of its railroad, and to acquire by condemnation such real estate and property as may be necessary for such construction, maintenance and accommodation.\u201d This provision is a subdivision of section 4, which itself expressly makes such power .\u201csubject to the limitations and requirements of this chapter.\u201d There is force in the contention that this expression may be understood as a general legislative declaration that the power of eminent domain is delegated to a railroad corporation; but, to justify the exercise of this power, it must be shown that the proposed action is within some subsequent and specific provisions of the statute. If this proceeding cannot be justified under the general provision, when read with the subsequent limitations and requirements, this affords no argument for the contention that the general provision can or should be freed therefrom; for, if no authority can be shown for this particular condemnation, then there is but a casus omissus. If, however, this provision is an isolated and a complete authority for the exercise of eminent domain, the question then presented is whether the scheme of the plaintiff is within the purview of its terms. The apt words are \u201cas may be necessary for the construction, maintenance and accommodation,\u201d referring to the preceding phrase, \u201cconstruction, maintenance and accommodation of its railroad.\u201d The difficulty that confronts the plaintiff at the outset is the fact that long ago this corporation located its route, and thereafter and for many years past has operated its road upon that route so located. How, then, can it contend that the land aimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>at is necessary in the construction or maintenance or accommodation \u2022of its road? It may be that the proposed work, when executed, would properly be described as \u201cconstruction,\u201d its continuance as \u201cmaintenance,\u201d and its use as \u201caccommodation\u201d; -but this is far from the proposition that the defendants\u2019 land is. necessary for the construction, maintenance, and accommodation of this railroad as it exists, with its route, and its tracks thereon, and its road in operation, all for many years past. The land is. not necessary for the construction or the maintenance or the accommodation of the railroad, as these terms are used in the statute. It is sought for a far different purpose. It is intended to lay thereon the tracks of a different route, \u25a0additional to the road that has been operated, is now operated, and that is to be operated. In the words of its chief engineer, it is an attempt to \u201cmaintain the main road on two different lines,\u201d both to run in the same general direction for nearly three miles, and yet half a mile apart. So far as the building of the proposed line is a second and further location of a second and further route, I have not seen the statute that permits the plaintiff to do this thing, and the authorities are against it. In re Poughkeepsie Bridge Co., supra; Mason v. Railroad Co., 35 Barb. 373; Hudson &amp; D. Canal Co. v. New York &amp; E. R. Co., 9 Paige, 323 (both cited and approved in Re Poughkeepsie Bridge Co., supra); People v. Railroad Co., 45 Barb. 73; Wood, R. R. (Minor\u2019s Ed.) \u00a7 271; Tayl. Corp. \u00a7\u00a7 162a, 164; Brigham v. Railroad Co., 1 Allen, 316; Brooklyn Cent. R. Co. v. Brooklyn City R. Co., 32 Barb. 366. In re Staten Island Rapid-Transit Co., 103 N. Y. 251, 8 N. E. 548, the only case cited by the respondent upon this contention, is not authority. The sole question raised in that \u2022case was the sufficiency of the evidence to show that the property sought to be condemned was required for the purpose of the corporation, while the matter decided was that it was not necessarily a defense to condemnation that the land was not needed for present and immediate purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">2. It is contended that this land may be taken for this proposed double-track route of nearly three miles long under the powers conferred by section 7, subd. 3, of the railroad law, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">\u201cWhere It shall require any further rights to lands or the use of lands for \u2022switches, turnouts, or for filling any structure of its road, or for constructing, widening, or completing any of its embankments or roadbeds, by means of which greater safety or permanency may be secured, and such lands shall be \u25a0contiguous to such railroad and reasonably accessible to the place where the \u25a0same are to be used for such purpose or purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Clearly the proposed work is not in constructing or widening or in completing its embankment or roadbed, for the tracks are to be laid at a mean distance of half a mile from the present roadbed. The purpose contemplated is not a \u201cswitch,\u201d which is defined as a \u25a0\u201cdevice for moving a small section of track so that rolling stock may be run or shunted from one line of track to another\u201d; and, \u201cin railroads, in its simplest form, two parallel lengths of rails joined together by rods, pivoted at one end, and free to move at the other end, forming a part of the track at its junction with a branch or siding.\u201d Stand. Dict.; Cent. Dict. Nor is the proposed construction a \u201cturn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>out,\u201d which is \u201ca short railway side track, upon which one train may be shunted to permit another to pass on the main track\u201d; \u201ca short side track on a railway, designed to enable one train to pass another.\u201d Id. The new tracks are to be straight where the present tracks are tortuous, and the final purpose is to use all four rails for the traction of cars, to the greater dispatch of business, and to the saving in part of the expense of a pusher engine, which is required on the present track because of its sharp curves and steep grades. Mr.. Moore, the plaintiff\u2019s engineer, gave a practical definition of the construction that incidentally distinguished, when he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201cThe cut-off will be connected with the present tracks by a switch or turnout. That connection is what is, in railroad parlance, a switch or. a turnout.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The construction seems to be what is technically called a \u201ccut-off.\u201d' This .is defined to be a shorter and straighter road by which the length of a course or passage is reduced. Stand. Dict.; Cent. Dict, The respondent\u2019s engineer, Mr. Parsons, thus describes it; and \u201ccutoff railroad\u201d is the descriptive term employed by the plaintiff\u2019s chief' engineer, Mr. Buchholz, in his letter, defendants\u2019 Exhibit B. Haight, J., in his dissenting opinion in People v. Board of Railroad Com\u2019rs, 160 N. Y. 202, 213, 54 N. E. 697, in speaking of this very construction,, says that the Erie Railroad devised a plan for a \u201ccut-off road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">3. It is contended that the plaintiff may proceed under subdivision 4 of section 7 of the general railroad act. Section 7, in part, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">\u201cIt shall have such rights, also, in the following cases: * * * (4) Where it shall require any further right to lands or to the use of lands for the flow of water occasioned by railroad embankments or structures now' in use, or hereafter rendered necessary, or for any other purpose necessary for the operation of such railroad, or for any right to take and convey water from any spring, pond, creek or river to such railroad, for the uses and purposes thereof, together with the right to build or lay aqueducts or pipes for the purpose of conveying such water, and to take up, relay and repair the same, or for any right of way required for carrying away or diverting any water, stream or floods from such railroad for the purpose of protecting its road or for the purpose of preventing any embankment, excavation or structure of .such railroad from injuring the property of any person who may be rendered: liable to injury thereby.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">It is quite evident from the nature of the context and the wording of the phrase that the purpose contemplated relates to some adjunct necessary to the road as it is located and operated, such as land for a yard' or for a freight station, or a site for a more capacious passenger station. New York Cent. &amp; H. R. R. Co. v. Metropolitan Gaslight Co., 63 N. Y. 326, 330, 331; End. Interp. St. \u00a7 86. There is a manifest distinction between the construction and the operation of a road, and I think that new construction of this character\u2014the building of a cut-off road\u2014does not fall within the words \u201cor for any purpose necessary for the operation of the road.\u201d If the press of business or the economical administration of the corporate affairs can find legislative warrant in the words \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201coperation\u201d for the exercise of eminent domain over lands, for the building of such a projected cut-off for 3 miles, why not, then, if the same \u201cnecessity\u201d exist, for 30 miles, or why may not a corporation under such. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>a plea based upon such authority gridiron town or country with its rails'? The learned counsel for the plaintiff cites numerous authorities. In re New York Cent. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 67 Barb. 426, is a decision at the special term. I cannot find that it has ever been reviewed or cited. There is, however, a manifest distinction in my mind between the salient words up for judicial interpretation in that case, which were \u201cfor the purpose of its incorporation,\u201d and the words \u201cnecessary for the operation of such railroad.\u201d The facts in that case were that the road owned the six rods, and could build its road thereon, but the necessary embankment encroached on the defendants\u2019 lands. In Railroad Co. v. Welsh (Sup.) 23 N. Y. Supp. 195, the company \u201cwas cramped for room, and wanted additional entrance into the yard, and a place to unload passengers off the main tracks. It had to unload passengers on the main line, and delays occurred, and room for additional tracks was needed.\u201d In Railroad Co. v. Franz (Sup.) 8 N. Y. Supp. 727, the land was required for a side track for receiving freight. In Re New York Cent. &amp; H. R. R. Co. (Sup.) 8 N. Y. Supp. 290, the lands were required for a train house and a passenger station at a terminus. In Re New York, L. &amp; W. R. Co., 33 Hun, 148, the line of the proposed railroad crossed a ship canal, and, a swing bridge being necessary, the land was required for that purpose. In all of these authorities the object sought was necessary for the operation of the road, but in none of them was the proposed work analogous to that now under consideration, which is not to afford relief by adjuncts to the road operated upon the located route, but by the construction of another route or cut-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The learned counsel for the respondent admits that the application of section 13 of the railroad law is \u201cextremely doubtful.\u201d Mr. Buchholz, the chief engineer of the plaintiff, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">\u201cThe intention of the Erie Railroad is to build only two additional tracks upon the changed alignment, and to retain as the existing main tracks the two that are there. There will exist through the village one main road on two different lines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">This plan, then, is not for the alteration or change of the route, but for construction of an addition to the existing route by means of a cut-off. I cannot find any statutory authority for the procedure taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Judgment and order reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
