The only moving affidavit relating to the materiality of the witness is that of the plaintiff, who merely states what he \u201cexpects\u201d to prove by the testimony of the witness whose examination is sought to be had. Plaintiff does not state that he has had any conversation with Albright, or disclose any fact or circumstance tending to show that he has any reasonable ground for his expectation with reference to the testimony that may be given by Albright.

The order was granted on the 9th day of March, 1901, and the moving affidavits were verified on the preceding day. The affidavit with reference to the illness of the witness was made by plaintiff\u2019s attorney. It is to the effect that on the 19th day of October, 1900, Albright informed affiant \u201cthat since the preceding spring he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>been an invalid and dangerously ill, and expected to die at anytime\u201d; that on the 27th day of November, 1900, affiant was informed, by Albright\u2019s attorney \u201cthat said Albright was then seriously ill,, having undergone an operation for appendicitis, and was not expected to live\u201d; and that on the 29th day of December, 1900, Al-bright filed an affidavit in a proceeding pending in the supreme court stating, in substance, that he was attacked with appendicitis-on the 1st of April, 1899, and that on the 15th day of the same-month, when he was supposed to be in a dying condition, he underwent an operation for appendicitis, and was unable to leave his apartment until the last of June, when he went to Europe for his health,, and was \u201cunable, by reason of such sickness and malarial poisoning, to attend to his professional work\u201d until about the 15th of December, 1900. Defendant read in opposition to the motion an affidavit of Albright showing that he was, and had been since the 15th day of December, 1900, perfectly well, and attending to his professional business. The affidavit, even if it tended to show the serious illness of the witness many months prior to the making of the motion, but failed to show any fact or circumstance indicating the continuance of the illness or inability, would be clearly insufficient to comply with the reasonable requirements of these provisions of the Code; and, manifestly, when it appeared that the witness had regained his health, the order granted for his examination should have been vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur; HATCH, J., on second ground.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
