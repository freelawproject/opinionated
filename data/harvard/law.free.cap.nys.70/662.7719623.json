The essential facts appear to he less strong in favor of the defendant than those involved in Franklin v. Brown, 118 N. Y. 110, 23 N. E. 126, 6 L. R. A. 770, and we are of opinion that under the doctrine of that case the defendant is liable for the rent. The lease contained no covenant to repair, or to keep in repair, and no express covenant that the house was fit to live in. It is universally held in this state that the lessee of real property must run the risk of its condition, unless he has an express agreement on the part of the lessor covering that subject. The tenant hires at his peril, and a rule similar to that of caveat emptor applies, and throws on the lessee the responsibility of examining as to the existence of defects in the premises, and of providing against their ill effects. Franklin v. Brown, supra (page 115, 118 N. Y., page 127, 23 N. E., and page 772, 6 L. R. A.). The fact that the defendant made a demand for repairs after signing the lease, and that this demand was, in a measure, complied with, does not operate to make a new or collateral contract; and, the defendant having visited the premises before signing the lease, and no fraud on the part of the plaintiff being alleged or proved, the judgment of the municipal court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
