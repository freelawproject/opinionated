The action was brought by the plaintiff to recover for a breach of these covenants on the part of her tenant, resulting in a judgment in her favor for $166.50, being somewhat less than the amount claimed. The only exception urged upon this appeal does not present reversible error. It was competent for the plaintiff to show what work had been done to repair the damages sustained by reason of the negligence of the defendant. The remaining questions relate wholly to facts, the evidence fully sustains the conclusion reached by the court below, and the judgment follows as a necessary consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
