The defendant demanded a bill of particulars, which was duly furnished, and which states that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is \u201cfor negotiating as broker with A. Roth, of whose share of the commission he has received as assignment the exchange of the defendant\u2019s realty No. 164 McKibben St., Brooklyn, for real estate owned by Ullrich Maurer, in Way Av., Jamaica, Queen\u2019s Co., during or about Nov., 1900.\u201d On the trial the plaintiff gave testimony tending to show that the defendant had placed his property for sale with a real-estate broker named Grossman, and that the exchange referred to in the bill of particulars was effected by the united efforts of Grossman, Roth, and the plaintiff, with the knowledge and consent of the defendant, and with the understanding that but a single commission should be paid. The evidence tends to show these facts, although it is not very clear or entirely satisfactory, and a decision upon the merits in favor of the defendant might possibly have been affirmed. But the plaintiff testified directly to the rendition of the services on defendant\u2019s employment, and that, after the transaction was consummated, the-defendant expressly promised to pay the commission in a few days. Ther\u00e9 was evidence, therefore, requiring a submission of the case to the jury, had the trial been by jury. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, however, the court dismissed the case on defendant\u2019s motion. This is to be regarded as the granting of a nonsuit, and, where there 'is sufficient evidence to require a submission and decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>of the case upon the merits, a nonsuit constitutes reversible error. Scofield v. Hernandez, <em>47 N. </em>Y. <em>313; </em>Place v. Hayward, 117 N. Y. 487, <em>23 </em>N. E. 25; Forbes v. Chichester, 125 N. Y. 769, 26 N. E. 914; Cowen v. Paddock, 137 <em>N. </em>Y. 188, 191, 33 <em>N. </em>E. 154; Raabe v. Squier, 148 N. Y. 81, 42 N. E. 516; Vitelli v. Railroad. Co., 53 App. Div. 639, 65 N. Y. Supp. 1027. The contract for the exchange of the property was executed by the defendant with Ullrich Maurer, who testified that he signed it with authority and on behalf of his wife, who was the real owner. He testified that he delivered the property. If the defendant actually received a good title to the lots, there can be no force in the defendant\u2019s objection to the validity of the contract executed. This point may be made clear on a new trial. The court, of its own motion, permitted the plaintiff to amend his complaint by alleging an assignment of his interest in the commission from Grossman, but denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a like amendment in the case of Roth. As the bill of particulars distinctly stated that the plaintiff claimed by virtue of an assignment from Roth, it is doubtful whether the amendment was actually necessary; but, in view of the court\u2019s action in voluntarily amending the complaint so as to cover Grossman\u2019s interest, the plaintiff\u2019s motion as to Roth should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">We express no opinion upon the merits of the controversy, desir-. ing only to emphasize the fact that, even if- the condition of the proof would have justified a decision in the defendant\u2019s favor, it certainly does not warrant the conclusion that there was no evidence at all to support the plaintiffs claim. It is the plaintiff\u2019s right that the sufficiency of his evidence should be considered and determined by the trial\" court. As Judge Earl said in Forbes v. Chichester, supra: \u201cThe plaintiff may fail to satisfy any court, upon nil the evidence, that he is entitled to recover. But he has the right to have his evidence properly weighed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">Judgment of the municipal court reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur, except GOODRICH, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
