The action was commenced March 16, 1900. The answer was served May 25, 1900, and, after certain admissions, sets up payments and counterclaims. The proposed amended answer sets up additional payments, and corrects alleged errors in amounts of certain payments as averred in the original answer. The principal ground urged in opposition to the motion is the alleged laches of the defendant. We are of the opinion that, under the circumstances disclosed by the record, the motion should have been granted upon such terms as justice required. The case first appeared on the general call calendar on February 8, 1901, and was to be placed on the call calendar for Friday, March 1, 1901; but on February 27, 1901, an order to show cause was granted to the defendant, upon the return of which this order was made. It is true that the defendant has not made this motion very promptly, but we do not think there has been any such laches as justifies the refusal of the remedy asked. Such laches as there was is explained by the attorney for the defendant in his moving affidavits, from which it appears that the original answer was drawrn on the last day of the time for answering, upon the statements of the agent and attorney in fact of the defendant, made from memory; and that the mistakes and omissions were not discovered until he was engaged in preparation for trial. It appears that, if the payments and counterclaims alleged in the amended answer are established, the actual amount owing from the defendant to the plaintiff will be but a few dollars; that the firm for whose creditors the plaintiff is trustee is insolvent, in consequence of which the defendant wall be deprived of any remedy therefor if not permitted to recover thereon in this action. Clearly, then, the amendment is in the furtherance of justice, and the laches has not been such as to justify a refusal to grant it. The pleas are not merely technical, nor can they be said to be dilatory, but are apparently real, substantive defenses, and so entitled to the favorable consideration of the court. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney should have consented to receive the amended answer upon some terms. Before the motion was made, defendant\u2019s attorney offered to set the case down for trial for the first day succeeding the call of the same on the Friday calendar, if plaintiff\u2019s attorney would accept the amended answer; and this was before the case had been reached for trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Had he done so, justice would not have been delayed, as is complained of by him in his affidavit. The fact, if it be a fact, that the amended answer will require further preparation for trial on the part of plaintiff, furnishes no sufficient reason for denying the motion under the existing circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">We reach the conclusion that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant, and the motion should be granted upon payment by the defendant of the taxable costs of the action after notice and before trial and $10 costs of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The appeal from the order denying a motion for a reargument of the motion for leave to serve an amended answer, which was argued with the appeal from the order, should be dismissed. It has been settled by this court that no appeal lies from such an order. In re Grout, 83 Hun, 25, 31 N. Y. Supp. 602. The appeal should, therefore, be dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
