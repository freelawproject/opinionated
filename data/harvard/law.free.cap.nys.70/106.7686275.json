On the 27th of April, 1900, the Traders\u2019 Insurance Company and the North British &amp; Mercantile Insurance Company of Edinburgh &amp; London made an agreement in writing whereby, upon the payment of $10,000 before 12 o\u2019clock noon on April 28th, the latter company (the defendant) agreed \u201cto assume the fire risks of the Traders\u2019 Fire Insurance Company of New York from six o\u2019clock p. m., April 27, 1900, not otherwise re-insured; a further payment on account of $25,000 to be paid on or before May 1st; and the balance due, namely, the net unearned premiums on outstanding policies, less 15# commission thereon, to be paid upon completion of schedules, and at least within thirty days from date thereof; this contract to be null and void unless payments as above stated are duly made. This temporary agreement to be replaced by a final contract of like terms and conditions, when the total amount due thereunder is determined as per schedule.\u201d It is quite evident from this contract, and from the proceedings ensuing thereon and thereunder, that the transaction between the two companies was intended to be of the same character as that described in Fischer v. Insurance Co., 69 N. Y. 161. \u201cOne insurance company was about to discontinue its business, and cease to carry out its contracts with its policy holders. Another insurance company, in consideration of a transfer to it of nearly all the assets of. the former, was about to agree to take upon itself the liability of the former to its policy holders.\u201d If the \u201cfinal contract, of like terms and conditions,\u201d alluded to in the agreement of April 27th, had been executed, and the consideration paid, there can be no doubt but that the facts would have been on all fours with those set forth in Glen v. Insurance Co., 56 N. Y. 379, and the doctrine of that case\u2014\u201cit is the settled law that the plaintiffs [\u00a1policy holders] might maintain this action against the defendant on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>policies which by the agreement it had assumed\u201d\u2014would govern. But the difficulty is that the final contract never was entered into between the two insurance companies. After several extensions by mutual consent, the Traders\u2019 Company not having paid the sums due at the day finally fixed, defendant wrote to it, August 3d: \u201cYou will please take notice that you have made default in the contract entered into by and between your company and the North British and Mercantile Company of London and Edinburgh, bearing date the 27th of April, 1900. We hereby declare said contract to be null and void.\u201d The said payments were conditions precedent. The said contract on its face stated it was a \u201ctemporary agreement.\u201d It expressly provided: \u201cThis contract to be null and void unless payments as above stated are duly made.\u201d The consideration for the permanent contract having failed, it was not made, and the temporary agreement or option became and was declared to be null and void. Under such circumstances, during the period in which the temporary arrangement was in force, the defendant company was, at best, a reinsurer of the policies of the Traders\u2019 Company, and, as there was no privity of contract with plaintiff\u2019s assignor, he has no cause of action. In the G-len Case the contract had been executed and completed, and it provided, in terms, that the company taking over the business \u201chereby agrees to assume all such policies, and to pay the holders thereof all such sums as the party of the second part may, by force of such policies, become liable to pay.\u201d Under the facts in this case, no such final contract was ever made, though in contemplation, by reason of the failure of consideration. Said the court of appeals in Dunning v. Leavitt, 85 N. Y. 30: \u201cBut I know of no authority to support the proposition that a person not a party to the promise, but for whose benefit the promise is made, can maintain an action to enforce the promise, where the promise is void, as between the promisor and promisee, for fraud or want of consideration or failure of consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ael\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
