Plaintiff announced to the court the only claim on which he claimed a right to recover, and defendant restated its motion to dismiss, involving the examination of questions of fact, and without any objection from plaintiff the matter was left to the referee, who thereafter filed a short decision under Code Civ.

Griffen, deceased, who claim that the defendant, a New York state banking institution, has converted to its own use certain bonds left in its custody, and which were the property of the plaintiffs. The issues joined by the pleadings were sent to a referee to hear, try, and determine, resulting in the dismissal of the complaint upon the merits. As the entire theory of the appellants is based upon the proposition that the action of the referee in dismissing the complaint constituted a nonsuit, rather than a determination of the merits of the case, and that, as there was some evidence in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, it was error to make this disposal of the controversy, it is only necessary to examine this phase of the question. If the dismissal of the complaint was in fact a nonsuit, there can be no doubt that, under the well-established rule prevailing in this state, the plaintiffs are enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>tied to a reversal of the judgment, if there is any evidence in the \u25a0case sufficient to support a finding of a jury in favor of the plaintiffs. Place v. Hayward, 117 N. Y. 487, 23 N. E. 25, and authorities -cited. It is important to understand, then, just what took place upon the trial. The plaintiffs called six witnesses, who appear to Ttave been the only persons who were in any way related to the transaction or who were familiar with the facts; and the defendant, -on cross-examination of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, brought out the facts necessary to establish the defense urged. It may be conceded, for the purposes of this appeal, that the hostile witnesses necessarily called by the plaintiffs became in fact the witnesses of the defendant upon the cross-examination, and that the testimony as to the matters \u25a0outside of the direct examination is not conclusive upon the former, so that there may be said to have been a conflict of evidence between Fernando Baltes and the documentary and other evidence \u2022submitted by the plaintiffs. But this cannot help the latter, in the view that we take of the case. The evidence covers over 56 pages \u25a0of the record, involving direct examinations, cross-examinations, redirect and recross examinations, so that it was apparent to counsel on both sides that all the material facts were in the possession \u25a0of the witnesses called by the plaintiffs. At the close of this evidence the plaintiffs formally rested, and Mr. Strauss, in behalf of the defendant, moved to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to show facts to constitute a cause of action, adding, \u201cI would like you to hear argument on the motion.\u201d The referee said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">\u201cThat motion will be decided when I go over the motion and decide the \u25a0ease. If on all this proof I think he has made out his case, I shall deny the motion and decide in his favor. I don\u2019t know of anything else but that \u25a0question involved here,\u2014whether the plaintiff has made out his case. That \u25a0is the question, on all his testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Mr. Cooke, in behalf of the plaintiffs,, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">\u201cMy claim is that the bank took the bonds and hypothecated them to raise money for the bank, which the bank had. That\u2019s what I claim. I don\u2019t care .a straw about the bailment. I won\u2019t speak of it, and I don\u2019t want counsel to take up their time, or take up the time of the court or my time, in talking about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Judge Mills, in behalf of the defendant, then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-9\">\u201cI would like to restate the motion to dismiss. The defendant moves to \u2022dismiss the complaint upon the merits upon the following grounds: First, that the evidence fails to establish a cause of action; second, that the evidence affirmatively establishes that the plaintiff has no cause of action against the defendant; third, that the evidence clearly establishes the following facts,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">It is true that the defendant did not formally rest its case, but it is difficult to understand how there could be any mistake as to the understanding of the parties. All of the available witnesses had been sworn; the merits of the case had been fully developed; the referee had announced that he would hold his decision of the motion to dismiss until he decided the case, without any suggestion on the part of either party that the motion should be decided .as of the time it was made; and plaintiffs\u2019 attorney had announced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>to the court, in somewhat informal language, it is true, the only claim upon which it is pretended. that the plaintiff has a right to-recover. With matters in this situation, defendant\u2019s counsel restated the motion to dismiss, involving the determination of questions of' fact; and, without any objection on the part of the plaintiffs, the matter was left in the hands of the referee, who subsequently filed a short decision, under the provisions of section 1022 of the Code-of Civil Procedure, dismissing the complaint upon the merits. To this decision the plaintiffs filed an exception, thus bringing before-this court, on review, all questions of law and fact involved in the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\">It is difficult to distinguish this case from that of Neuberger v. Keim, 134 N. Y. 35, 39, 31 N. E. 268, where, after the plaintiffs-rested, the counsel for the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to prove facts-sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">\u201cI will not dismiss the complaint, but I say, upon the evidence as it now stands, I would not feel justified in finding that this conveyance in question was made with the intention of defrauding creditors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Both parties prepared findings and submitted them to the court,. The complaint was dismissed upon the merits. The court, commenting upon this state of facts, say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">\u201cIt appears to us that, under these circumstances, the case must be deemed, to have been submitted to the court in such a way as to permit it to weigh the evidence, draw the legitimate inferences therefrom, and determine the facts. * * * We do not regard it as necessary that a court charged with the duty of deciding the facts should be required t.o continue its sittings, and take the evidence that the defendant may be able to produce, when its mind is satisfied upon the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case that, -under the facts disclosed, the plaintiff ought not to recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In the case at bar all of the evidence was before the referee. His-attention had been called to the claim of the plaintiffs, and it can hardly be doubted that both parties to the litigation understood that the case was submitted to the determination of the referee. Can the plaintiffs now be heard to assert that because the defendant did not, in form, rest their case, the decision which was based upon the facts disclosed by the evidence was in effect a mere nonsuit, and not a determination of the case upon the merits? \u201cIt seems to me,\u201d \u00a7ays Martin, J., in Bliven v. Robinson, 152 N. Y. 333, 338, 46 N. E. 615, 616, \u201cthat to so hold would be carrying the doctrine-of the case of Place v. Hayward altogether too far.\u201d This whole-question has recently been under review in the court of appeals, in-the case of Woodbridge v. Bank, 166 N. Y. 238, 244, 59 N. E. 828, where, after reviewing the authorities, the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">\u201cThe decision herein Is in the \u2018short\u2019 form. To this decision the plaintiff took a general exception. Under the authorities above cited, this was not enough. If the plaintiff desired to have defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss-the complaint treated as a motion for a nonsuit, and to have the decision of the court made in conformity with the motion, a proper correction of the record should have been sought. The failure to do this, coupled with the filing of the general exception to the decision upon the merits, constitutes such a waiver of the alleged error as to preclude plaintiff from raising the-question upon appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>We are of opinion that this case, in connection with the authorities cited, is decisive of the point on which the appellant relies in the case at bar, and that the dismissal of the complaint upon the merits was within the scope of the referee\u2019s duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">It is conceded by the appellant that there was a conflict of evidence in respect to the material question raised before the referee, and we are clearly of the opinion that the evidence is sufficient to support the decision reached. The material issue was whether the defendant bank received the money which had been borrowed upon the collateral in the hands of Mr. Baltes, and, while it was shown that the check by which the money was transferred was made payable to the order of the bank, it was in evidence that the indorsement upon the back of this check was such as would appear there in the natural course of business; and Mr. Baltes testified positively that no part of the proceeds of the check went to the bank, but that it was used by himself to make good a prior loan which he had personally negotiated upon the same securities, which securities he had taken from the bos belonging to the plaintiffs. If the referee believed this testimony, there was an end of the case; and we are satisfied that the plaintiffs failed to establish the fact that the money went to the benefit of the defendant, and that the case was properly disposed of upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
