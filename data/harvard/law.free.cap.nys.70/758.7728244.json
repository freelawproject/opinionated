The plaintiff, it is alleged, demanded a return of the money on .the neglect and refusal of the defendant to perform the services agreed upon; but defendant has refused to return the money, and has wrongfully kept and converted the same. There was no answer or appearance at the trial on behalf of the defendant. An inquest was taken, and all the allegations of the complaint were proven, excepting the fact that the defendant was authorized and licensed to practice his profession, Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, and an appeal has been taken to this court because of the refusal of the magistrate to insert in,the transcript the words, \u201cdefendant liabl\u00e9 to arrest and imprisonment on execution.\u201d By subdivision 2 of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>2895 of the Code of Civil Procedure it is provided that an order of arrest shall be granted where the action is brought, among other things, to recover damages for an injury to property, including the wrongful detention or conversion of personal property, misconduct or neglect in a professional employment, fraud, or deceit. We think the defendant -was within the terms of this section, notwithstanding the failure on the part of the plaintiff to prove that he was practicing his profession under the protection of a proper license. The t action is founded upon fraud. By section 3018 of the Code the section quoted above is made applicable to the judgments in justices\u2019 courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The judgment appealed from should be modified by inserting\" the words, \u201cdefendant liable to an execution against his person,\u201d and,- as so modified, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b777-5\">GOODRICH, P. J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AhFa\">I cannot agree with the result reached in the opinion of my associates. The complaint alleges that the defendant is a \u201cdentist, duly authorized and licensed to practice in the state of New York\u201d; that in November, 1900, the plaintiff- and defendant entered into an agreement whereby the defendant, in consideration of a sum not to exceed $50, to be paid him by the plaintiff, agreed to perform certain professional services on the plaintiff\u2019s teeth, and provide the necessary materials therefor; that he demanded and received of the plaintiff an advance payment of $20 on account of said services to be rendered and material to be furnished, - and thereafter refused to perform the services, and fraudulently retains the $20. The defendant did not appear on the return of the summons, and an inquest was taken, evidence being given fully proving all the allegations of the complaint, except that the defendant was 'a licensed dentist; Hence it was not shown that the action was within subdivision 2, \u00a7 2895, of the Code of Civil Procedure. For this reason I think the justice was justified in refusing the plaintiff\u2019s request to insert in the transcript of the judgment the words, \u201cdefendant liable to arrest and imprisonment on execution,\u201d and that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
