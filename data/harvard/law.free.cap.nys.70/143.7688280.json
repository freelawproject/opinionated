The issues were brought to trial at a special term on the 5th day of April, 1900; and, at the close of the evidence relating to the existence and history of the water course, the court, at the request of counsel, framed certain issues of fact for submission to a jury. The issues so framed were tried at a trial term .commencing on the 4th day of May, 1900. The questions, together with the determination of the jury thereon, were as follows: \u201cDid the defendants, or either of them, obstruct the creek or ditch mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint? Answer. Yes. Second. If either of the defendants did obstruct the creek or ditch, which one obstructed it? Answer. Both. Third. When were the several obstructions, if <em>any, </em>made, and by which defendants, respectively, were they made? Answer. Miss Anna Corning in the years 1895, \u201996, \u201997, and \u201998. F. T. Peart assisted in 1897. Fourth. Did the defendants, or either of them, obstruct the stream more than was necessary to' place back into the creek or ditch what had been excavated in the year 1895, and, if so, which one? Answer. Yes; both. Anna Corning in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the years 1895, \u201996, \u201997, \u201998. F. T. Peart assisted In 1897. Fifth. Was the plaintiff damaged in consequence of said obstructions? Answer. Yes. Sixth. How much were the damages caused by the defendant Anna Corning? Answer. ($500) Five hundred dollars. Seventh. How much were the damages caused by the defendant Frank T. Peart. Answer. ($1) One dollar. Eighth. If the plaintiff was damaged, state the nature of the crops damaged? Answer. Potatoes, carrots, onions, wheat, corn, oats, buckwheat, and grass. Ninth. Did the plaintiff go upon defendant\u2019s property and excavate .the rock in said stream without the consent of Anna Corning? .Answer. No.\u201d Thereupon defendant\u2019s counsel made a motion for a new trial upon the minutes of the court, upon all the grounds specified in section 999 of the Code, at said trial term. The motion was denied, but without prejudice to renew the same at special term, where it was reviewed and denied. The hearing before the special term was thereupon resumed, and a decision containing findings of fact and conclusions of law was made and filed. The decision followed the findings of the jury upon the questions submitted to them. The court also found that plaintiff was, and since the 28th day' of March, 1868, had been, the owner in fee and possession of the premises described in the complaint, consisting of 89 acres -and 84% rods of land in the town of Penfield, county of Monroe; that defendant Corning on or about the 24th day of January, 1893, became the owner of the premises in said town consisting of 32% acres situate next westerly of and adjoining plaintiff\u2019s said premises; that on April 1, 1893, defendant Corning entered into a land contract by which she agreed to sell and convey said premises to defendant Peart, who thereupon went into possession pursuant to. said contract, and remained in possession until April 1, 1900, at which time he removed therefrom; that \u201cthere is and has been for a great many years a natural stream of water flowing through the plaintiff\u2019s said property onto and through defendant\u2019s said property, with well-defined bed and banks, and the channel to said stream as it flows through defendant\u2019s property was and has been for over twenty years from 2% to 3% feet wide and 2% to 3% feet deep\u201d; that \u201cfor more than twenty years said channel was of sufficient width and depth to carry the water off from plaintiff\u2019s low land, and sufficiently drained the same so as to enable the plaintiff to till and crop said low land\u201d; that the defendant, by wrongfully and unlawfully damming and filling up and obstructing the stream, as found by the jury, caused the water to overflow plaintiff\u2019s premises to his damage in the sum of $500 by the acts of defendant Coming, and to his damage in the sum of $1 by the acts of defendant Peart; that in the year 1895 plaintiff deepened said stream by excavating rock from the bottom of the channel on the said premises of defendant Corning, by her parol consent and license, which she subsequently revoked, and she thereafter built a dam across \u25a0 the stream and obstructed the same more than was necessary to restore the stream to the condition in which it was before such excavation of rock. In the conclusions of law the court awarded a mandatory and permanent restraining injunction as prayed for, and damages in accordance with the verdict of the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-4\">Plaintiff gave evidence tending to show, and which would have justified findings, that this creek or stream drained a water shed comprising from 1,000 to 1,600 acres of land; that the natural slope of the ground was towards defendant\u2019s premises; that, with the bed or channel qf the creek through defendant\u2019s premises dammed up level with the surface of the banks, the surplus water from this water shed would flow over defendant\u2019s premises along the line of this stream, where there was a slight depression, making a natural outlet for this water shed; that for more than 50 years there has been a natural water course, with well-defined banks, through the premises of both plaintiff and defendant, which drained this water.shed, and was a running stream some years throughout the season, but drying up through the premises, of plaintiff and defendant for one, two, or three months most seasons; that such stream was supplied by several large living springs situate more than a mile above plaintiff\u2019s premises, one of which was never known to dry up or freeze, but the others ceased to. flow in very dry seasons, and by rain and the melting of snow, and also by the water from a small tract of- this water shed, consisting of low, marshy, muck lands, known as a \u201ctamarack swamp,\u201d from which the water does not flow readily; that prior to 42 or, 43 years ago, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>before anything had been done towards artificial drainage or to interfere with the natural condition of the locus in quo, these springs ran into this marshy muck ground, through which the waters found their way over the surface irregularly and in no defined channel for a long distance, and then, reaching harder soil, the flowing water came together and formed a natural channel, which extended through plaintiff\u2019s lands and those of defendant, also; that, after leaving plaintiff\u2019s lands and passing a few hundred feet through defendant\u2019s premises, the bed of the stream descended considerably and quite abruptly, so that there was a fall of more than 10 feet in 800; that in those early days, more than 50 years ago, a sawmill was erected from about a half to three-quarters of a mile below defendant\u2019s premises, which for a long period was run by water power from three to five months each year, principally supplied by the water that came through this stream, which ultimately, by natural water course, reached Lake Ontario; that in this vicinity there is a rock bottom, and on defendant\u2019s premises the rock comes within about a foot of the surface of the ground, but it is in layers, and is lower than the surface of plaintiff\u2019s premises; that about 42 or 43 years ago- the owners of the low lands of this water shed, including the then owner of defendant\u2019s premises, for their mutual benefit, and to enable them to clear, improve, and till their respective premises, agreed upon a plan of cleaning out, deepening, and straightening the channel of this natural water course, from the springs referred to, to and through defendant\u2019s premises a distance of more than a mile, which plan was carried into execution by them; that the witnesses who participated in or observed such cleaning out, deepening, and straightening say nothing was done at that time along the line of this slight natural depression in defendant\u2019s premises where the bed of the stream was, except to remove the loose stone and earth, but other witnesses, from subsequent appearances, say that the surface rock was likely cracked, loose, and broken, and was removed with pickaxes or crowbars, thereby enabling the water to pass off more readily, and in a certain sense deepening the channel, and others say that the rock had the appearance of having been blasted out; that, after the doing of this work 42 or 43 years ago, the creek through plaintiff\u2019s premises was from <em>3% </em>to 4 feet wide, and about the same depth, and it was about the same width, but a foot or so less in depth, through defendant\u2019s premises; that ordinarily in the spring and fall the water flowing through this creek was between 2 and -2% feet deep; that thereafter said channel remained in precisely the same condition, excepting as it was affected by the natural flow of water, until 1885, when plaintiff and others undertook, as stated in the findings, to deepen the channel by blasting rock from the bed of the stream; that lateral ditches emptying into this creek had been constructed upon either side so that the lands drained more readily and rapidly into the bed of this stream. The evidence fairly warranted the findings that plaintiff\u2019s crops were damaged to the extent found by the jury, and that such damage was caused by the obstructions placed in the bed of this stream. It appeared that ever since plaintiff owned the premises, a period of 33 years, he has tilled and cultivated the same lands without any previous loss or damage from the overflowing of water, and the surface of such lands! was above the bed of the stream through defendant\u2019s premises, as it existed before being so obstructed.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b163-5\">Argued before ADAMS.

Gould, Waters, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 225, 263, 264; 24 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 900; 14 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 926; Barkley v. Wilcox, 86 N. Y. 143; Jeffers v. Jeffers, 107 N. Y. 650, 14 N. E. 316; Wharton v. Stevens, 84 Iowa, 107-114, 50 N. W. 562, 15 L. R. A. 630. The only serious question that arises is with reference to the effect of the deepening of the channel through defendant\u2019s premises upward of 40 years ago. The case, however, was not tried, and has not been presented to us, upon the theory that, if a natural water course existed, its enlargement as stated was under a revocable license. The evidence on that point seems to have been brought into the case by plaintiff\u2019s counsel either incidentally or accidentally. It consists of part of the testimony given by a witness called in behalf of plaintiff bn rebuttal, and appears to be uncontradicted as to the fact that defendant\u2019s predecessor in title joined in making the improvement. The property owners affected by the inadeqiiacy of the water course to prevent the overflowing of their lands, and its insufficiency to so drain such lands as to render the same available for early tilling, formed a bee to straighten and deepen the water course for the better drainage of their lands. They determined upon a plan, and carried it into execution, for aught that appears in the record, under a claim of right, which was acquiesced in. by the owner of the premises where the channel has now been closed. It is apparent that this improvement was designed to be permanent ;- for it is not probable that the other property owners would till and crop their low lands, leaving it optional with defendant and her predecessors in title at any time to destroy the crops by filling the bed of the stream, and thus causing the water to overflow the premises above.The enjoyment of the improved water course by the owners of the property benefited thereby, as contemplated by all parties interested, is not consistent with the right of defendant to restore the channel to its condition as it existed before being thus improved. If this were wholly an artificial ditch or channel excavated under a parol or written license intended to be perpetual, defendant would doubtless have the right to revoke the license, even though a consideration had been paid therefor. Babcock v. Utter, *40 N. Y. 397; Wiseman v. Lucksinger, 84 N. Y. 31; Cronkhite v. Cronkhite, 94 N. Y. 323; Crosdale v. Lanigan, 129 N. Y. 604, 29 N. E. 824; White v. Railway Co., 139 N. Y. 19, 34 N. E. 887. But this extreme doctrine, which, upon grounds of public policy, precludes the enforcement of the license after part or full performance, thus constituting a departure from the rule adopted by courts of equity concerning other contracts relating to real estate (Newman v. Nellis, 97 N. Y. 285; Rindge v. Baker, 57 N. Y. 209; Dempsey v. Kipp, 61 N. Y. 462; Wheeler v. Reynolds, 66 N. Y. 227; Wiseman v. Lucksinger, 84 N. Y. 31), has no application to the case at bar. Assuming, without so deciding, that this doctrine would apply to that part of the channel of the water course which is new, and did not exist prior to the improvement to which allusion has been made, it is impossible to ascertain from the record before us the precise changes that were made in the water course through defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ant\u2019s premises at that time. The evidence is quite general and indefinite, and, while indicating that the channel was deepened through the rock, the court could not formulate a decree therefrom hy which defendant\u2019s right of revocation could be enforced, without trenching upon the rights of other property owners to have the water course kept open and unobstructed as it originally existed. In order to overcome the presumption of a grant and the acquisition of the right by adverse user, the burden was on defendant to show that the deepening of the channel 42 or 43 years ago was under a license from her predecessor in title. Gould, Waters, \u00a7 341; Hammond v. Zehner, 21 N. Y. 118; Townsend v. McDonald, 12 N. Y. 381; Ward v. Warren, 82 N. Y. 265; Heiser v. Gaul, 39 App. Div. 162, 57 N. Y. Supp. 198, and cases cited; Pierrepont v. Barnard, 6 N. Y. 285. The defendant and her grantors having acquiesced for nearly a half of a century in the enjoyment of this improved water course by plaintiff and his predecessors in title, she cannot be permitted to close it entirely now merely on account of its having been artificially deepened and enlarged. Vannest v. Fleming, 79 Iowa, 638, 44 N. W. 906, 8 L. R. A. 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">It does not appear that the water course overflowed its banks on defendant\u2019s premises in consequence of the lateral ditches or drains running into the stream from the premises of plaintiff and others. Artificial lateral drains into a natural water course, although they at limes increase the flow of water therein, and at other times decrease it, to the injury of those lower down the stream, with reference to the supply and use of water, are not unlawful, provided the stream is not \u2022 thereby made to overflow its banks. Waffle v. Railroad Co., 58 Barb. 421, affirmed in 53 N. Y. 11; McCormick v. Horan, 81 N. Y. 86; Noonan v. City of Albany, 79 N. Y. 470; Barkley v. Wilcox, 86 N. Y. 140; Peck v. Goodberlett, 109 N. Y. 180, 16 N. E. 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We find no exception which constitutes a reversible error or requires extended consideration. It follows that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur, except MCLENNAN, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
