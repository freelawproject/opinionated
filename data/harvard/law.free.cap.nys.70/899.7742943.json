Proc. \u00a7 840, requiring the superintendent of the poor to bring proceedings when a bastard is born which is a county charge, does not authorize such proceedings against a putative father of a bastard bom in .a foreign state and brought into New York, since the child is not a public charge.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b917-13\">Appeal from court of special sessions of city of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b917-14\">Bastardy proceedings by John W.

Y. Supp. 862), has now been remedied, and therefore this appeal is properly brought. The rule laid down in Sperling v. Boll, 26 App. Div. 64, 50 N. Y. Supp. 209, is not applicable. In that case two appeals were taken; the first being dismissed for failure to print and serve papers within the time prescribed by the rules of practice, and the second for the reason that no leave had been obtained to bring it, and it had not been reinstated. Here, however, the former appeal was a nullity, it appearing that this court was \u201cwithout jurisdiction to entertain\u201d it, wherefore it was dismissed, so that this is the first and only appeal that has been had in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Upon the merits, we concur in the conclusion reached by Mr. Justice INGRAHAM, as stated in his opinion upon the former appeal,\u2014that, under the statute as applicable to the facts here appearing, the commissioner has no authority to prosecute this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">The order accordingly should be reversed, and the proceeding dismissed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
