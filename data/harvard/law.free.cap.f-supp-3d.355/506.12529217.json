Jones, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this action under Virginia law, the plaintiffs seek recovery under a homeowners insurance policy due to mold that occurred because of water infiltration into their house over time from a leaky gutter. The insurance company denies coverage on the ground, among others, that the policy does not insure for loss caused by mold. The parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment, which have been fully briefed and orally argued and are ripe for decision. For the reasons stated, I find that there is no coverage under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts from the summary judgment record are uncontested, at least for the purposes of the present motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant NGM Insurance Company (the Insurance Company) issued a homeowners insurance policy (the Policy) to plaintiff Chad Poore for residential property located in Washington County, Virginia, owned by Poore and his wife Becky (the Poores), for a policy period from October 1, 2015, through October 1, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 30, 2016, the Poores notified the Insurance Company of a mold claim at their home. Their claim was not approved by the Insurance Company. The mold produced health problems for the family who, on the advice of a physician, abandoned the residence as uninhabitable and its contents as unsalvageable. The property was ultimately foreclosed upon by a lender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 26, 2018, the Poores filed suit in state court against the Insurance Company, in which it was asserted that in December of 2016 they had discovered \"that there had been a leak in the house which had caused black mold, which was causing them health problems.\" Compl. \u00b6 6, ECF No. 1-2. They sought damages under the Policy for the value of the home, the personal property in the home, and the loss of use of the property. The suit was timely removed by the defendants to this court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), based upon subject-matter jurisdiction by virtue of diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The Insurance Company filed a Counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that there is no coverage under the terms of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Each side has retained an expert. The Poores' expert opines that there was a failure of the sealant of the end cap on a rain gutter that abutted a fireplace chimney chase at the rear of the home. This failure caused water to leak from the gutter and infiltrate the sheathing of the chimney chase, making its way down to\n   the home's crawl space and producing the mold. Defs.' Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 6, Mitchell Dep. 25, 28, 32, 35, 36, ECF No. 16-6. The Insurance Company's expert agrees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex.7, Report of Findings 7, ECF No. 16-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following discovery, the parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment. The Poores explain that while there may have been minor repairable damage from the water infiltration, that damage is not the basis for their claim. Rather, \"[t]he damages which led to this claim were the black mold caused by the leak.\" Pls.' Mot. Summ. J. \u00b6 12, ECF No. 14. The Poores contend that because the Policy provides coverage for water damage they are entitled to payment. The Insurance Company argues that there is no coverage for the loss under the plain terms of the Policy and based upon the undisputed facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Each component of an insurance contract should be considered and construed together and seemingly conflicting provisions harmonized when that can be reasonably done, so as to effectuate the intention of the parties as expressed therein. When a policy does not define a given term, we give the word its ordinary and accepted meaning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   With regard to the exclusions in the ... coverage, our consideration is governed by well-settled principles. Exclusionary language in an insurance policy will be construed most strongly against the insurer and the burden is upon the insurer to prove that an exclusion applies. Reasonable exclusions not in conflict with statute will be enforced, but it is incumbent upon the insurer to employ exclusionary language that is clear and unambiguous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Transcon.

Some of these cases involve first-party claims for loss, such as here, while others involve suits by insureds seeking coverage for claims made against them by third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   While the Supreme Court of Virginia has not spoken on the exclusion of mold loss in insurance policies, relying upon that court's settled principles of contract construction, and on cases from other jurisdictions, I find that the mold exclusion here is enforceable to bar coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Arguments similar to that made by the plaintiffs here have been advanced in other cases.

This argument confuses cause with effect. The insurance policy has an exclusion for mold. There is no provision that limits the instances in which the exclusion applies. Thus, if there is a claim against the insured regarding mold, it is excluded. It is irrelevant whether the mold was caused by [the insured's] negligence, [the insured's] intentional acts, acts of unaffiliated third parties, or acts of god. In other words, damage caused by mold is excluded regardless of the underlying circumstances that led to the mold growth. Furthermore, if [the insured's] argument were accepted, then no damages arising out of or resulting from mold would ever be excluded under the terms of the present policies as mold will always be an ensuing loss resulting from a covered loss, namely, water damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    Schmitt v.

However, I find that the exclusionary language here is sufficiently plain to bar the present claim. In this case, the loss for which the Poores seek recovery was caused by the mold.

The facts of this case, however, do not include water from any of those sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Finally, the claim under Coverage D for loss of use is barred because it requires a loss covered under the property coverage provisions of the Policy.

It is understandable that they would believe that the insurance policy that they purchased would cover their financial loss.
