LAWSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Defendant FCA US LLC has filed a fourth motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b). This one is aimed at the second amended consolidated master class action complaint (SACMC) in this multidistrict litigation proceeding, and\n   it is based on Rule 12(b)(6). The parties agreed to submit this motion on the papers a waive oral argument. The parties are familiar with the facts and proceedings to date in this multidistrict litigation matter involving certain alleged defects in the transmissions of approximately 850,000 vehicles manufactured by FCA. They are summarized in the Court's earlier opinion adjudicating FCA's last motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated master class action complaint (FACMC).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re FCA US LLC Monostable Elec.

Mich. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I. Additional Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On November 15, 2017, the Court issued its opinion rejecting the defendant's principal challenges to the FACMC and dismissing several claims based on other minor defects. On December 8, 2017, the plaintiffs filed their SACMC omitting the claims and plaintiffs that had been dismissed and consolidating parties and claims from individual actions that had been transferred into the MDL after the FACMC was filed and while the defendant's previous motion was pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The SACMC contains 120 counts brought on behalf of 43 plaintiffs from 26 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \u2022 Arizona (Guy, Perkins, Yacoub)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 California (Goldsmith, Nathan)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Colorado (Felker)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Florida (Andollo)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Georgia (Willis)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Illinois (McDonald, Wells)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Iowa (Havnen)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Louisiana (Stewart)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Maryland (Schultz)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Massachusetts (Hartt, Youngstrom, Machtley)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Michigan (Scott)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Minnesota (Berken)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Missouri (Brooks)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Nevada (Bernal)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 New Jersey (Colrick)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 New York (Lynd, Mack)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 North Carolina (Gunnells)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Ohio (Danielle and Joby Hackett)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Oklahoma (Clark)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Oregon (Fisher)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Pennsylvania (Weber, Vosburgh, Metzger)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Texas (Hyatt, Phelps, Craig, Foreman, Dial, Gillispie, Waggoner)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Utah (Marble)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Washington (Stedman, Webster)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Wisconsin (Hughes)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 Wyoming (Magnuson)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After the SACMC was filed, Pennsylvania plaintiff Timothy Weber was dismissed from the case based on his notice of voluntary dismissal. Weber's dismissal does not affect the resolution of this motion since FCA does not challenge any counts raised by the Pennsylvania plaintiffs, and Weber was not the only plaintiff from that state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Oklahoma plaintiff Carol Clark also filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of her claims. In addition, at the status conference on November 21, 2108, Lead Counsel for the plaintiffs moved to dismiss the case of Justine Andollo from Florida. Clark was the only economic loss plaintiff from Oklahoma, and Andollo was the only economic loss plaintiff from Florida; the class claims from those states vanished with the dismissal of those underlying cases. However, the defendant did not challenge any of the counts asserting claims under Oklahoma law. Nevertheless, it appears that all of the claims under Oklahoma law must be dismissed due to the withdrawal of the only named plaintiff from that state. Those counts are: LXXXIII (consumer fraud),\n   LXXXIV (fraudulent concealment), LXXXV (express warranty), LXXXVI (implied warranty), and LXXXVII (unjust enrichment). The following Florida counts likewise will be dismissed: XVIII (Florida Fair Trade Practices Act), XIX (fraudulent concealment), XX (express warranty), and XXI (unjust enrichment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As the case now stands with the dismissals of those counts, the SACMC consists of live class claims by 41 plaintiffs from 24 states, pleaded in 111 counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   FCA's present motion to dismiss is based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The governing standards under Rule 12(b)(6) are well known to the parties: the purpose of the motion is to allow a defendant to test whether, as a matter of law, the plaintiff is entitled to legal relief if all the factual allegations in the complaint are taken as true.\n   <em>\n    Rippy ex rel.

The defendant also asks the Court to dismiss in part Count I (the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act claim) to the extent that it is premised on the above challenged state law claims, and Count XXVIII (for consumer fraud under Illinois state law).

Economic Loss Doctrine (Various States)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The defendant argues that the economic loss doctrine of the respective states bars\n   the claims for common law fraudulent concealment raised in Counts XIV (Colorado), XXXVIII (Maryland), XLV (Michigan), LI (Minnesota), LXIV (New Jersey), LXXIV (North Carolina), and CIII (Utah), as well as the statutory fraud claim in Count LXXIII (North Carolina).

The Court will grant that request in part congruent to the dismissals of (1) the portion of Count LI (Minnesota) that may be construed as premised on failure to disclose a known defect at the point of sale; (2) the implied warranty claims in Count LXXVI (North Carolina), LXI (Nevada), CX (Washington); and (3) and the minor redaction of Count XXVIII noted above, and will deny the request in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   IV. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, most of the plaintiffs' economic loss claims will survive, but some of them must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the defendant's motion to dismiss the economic loss plaintiffs' second amended consolidated master class action complaint (ECF No. 191) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the following claims are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   : (1) the portion of Count LI (Minnesota) that may be construed as premised on failure to disclose a known defect at the point of sale; (2) the implied warranty claims in Count LXXVI (North Carolina), LXI (Nevada), CX (Washington); and (3) that portion of Count XXVIII that may be construed as raising any claims under the authority of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 295/1A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the citation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 295/1A in Count XXVIII is\n   <strong>\n    STRIKEN\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the claims of former Oklahoma plaintiff Carol Clark pleaded in Counts LXXXIII (consumer fraud), LXXXIV (fraudulent concealment), LXXXV (express warranty), LXXXVI (implied warranty), and LXXXVII (unjust enrichment), and the claims of former Florida plaintiff Justine Andollo pleaded in XVIII (Florida Fair Trade Practices Act), XIX (fraudulent concealment), XX (express\n   warranty), and XXI (unjust enrichment) are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the defendant's motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in all other respects.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
