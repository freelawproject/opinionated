(Docket No. 66.) The Court referred Peer International's motion to a magistrate judge for a Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\"). (Docket No. 68.) For the reasons set forth below, the R &amp; R is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .

Walter Thompson Puerto Rico (\"Walter Thompson\") to produce a marketing campaign for the 2016 Christmas season. (Docket No. 1 at p. 3.) Walter Thompson procured a license from music publisher Peer International to use \"Lleg\u00f3 la Navidad\" by Ra\u00fal Balseiro (\"the composition\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2. Peer International issued the license to Walter Thompson for a $5,500.00 fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the marketing campaign aired throughout Puerto Rico, defendants Latin American Music Company, Inc. (\"LAMCO\") and ACEMLA de Puerto Rico, Inc.

(Docket No. 1.) In addition to answering the interpleader complaint, LAMCO and ACEMLA set forth copyright infringement claims against Walter Thompson, Peer International, and Walgreens. (Docket No. 14.) Peer International moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). (Docket No. 52.)

The Court ordered each attorney:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   to submit individual filings addressing (1) whether LAMCO and ACEMLA claimed to own \"Lleg\u00f3 la Navidad,\" (2) on what basis counsel filed documents to the Court representing that LAMCO and ACEMLA own \"Lleg\u00f3 la Navidad,\" and (3) why the Court should not impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    J.

Indeed, LAMCO and ACEMLA cited the same certificate of copyright for \"Lleg\u00f3 la Navidad\" that the jury rejected as proof of ownership in\n   <em>\n    Media Power\n   </em>\n   . (Civil No. 07-2254, Docket No. 209 at p. 1; Civil No. 17-1094, Docket No. 14 at p. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Representations made by LAMCO and ACEMLA in bankruptcy proceedings compound the need for sanctions. LAMCO and ACEMLA filed for bankruptcy protection pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. sections 301,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . (Docket No. 38.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In asset schedules submitted to the bankruptcy court, the only property listed that LAMCO and ACEMLA claimed to own are their respective logos, each valued at $1.00.

This inconsistency bolsters the Court's conclusion that this action is meritless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    2. LAMCO and ACEMLA's Copyright Infringement Claims Unreasonably Multiplied this Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The assertion of copyright infringement claims against Walter Thompson,\n   Peer International, and Walgreens unreasonably multiplied this proceeding. (Docket No. 14.) Indeed, Walgreens was not a party to this action until LAMCO and ACEMLA alleged that \"Walgreens is liable to LAMCO/ACEMLA for copyright infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 9. LAMCO and ACEMLA's baseless claims required Walter Thompson, Peer International, and Walgreens to file answers in defense of the copyright infringement allegations. (Docket Nos. 16, 22 and 25.) This litigation consumed considerable judicial resources. The Court held an initial scheduling conference, issued a Case Management Order, and adjudicated Peer International's judgement on the pleadings. (Docket Nos. 27, 51 and 56.) Consequently, the Court finds that the copyright infringement claims constituted \"more than mere negligence, inadvertence, or incompetence.\"\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534045\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/896/626/#p630\">\n    896 F.2d at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Disregarding preclusive precedent and asserting ownership over \"Lleg\u00f3 la Navidad\" warrants sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 and section 1927. Latiff and Talcott signed the pleading that this Court deemed frivolous. (Docket No. 14 at p. 11.) Penchina and Duchesne did not appear in this litigation until after LACMO and ACEMLA filed the copyright infringement claims. Accordingly, the Court declines to sanction Penchina and Duchesne. Latiff complied with the Court's Order to Show Cause, stating that he relied on Talcott in hopes of learning from an attorney with experience in copyright law. (Docket No. 60 at p. 2.) According to Latiff, he did not participate in drafting the copyright infringement claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4. By signing LACMO and AMCELA's pleadings, however, Latiff affirmed that \"the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2). The Court declines to impose sanctions on Latiff. Instead, the Court cautions Latiff that failure to read and verify the accuracy of the pleadings he signs may result in sanctions in the future. Talcott flouted the Court's Order to Show Cause. The Court has no reason to doubt Latiff's contention that Talcott drafted the meritless copyright infringement allegations. (Docket No. 60.) Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    SANCTIONS\n   </strong>\n   Kelly D. Talcott in the amount of $2,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Relitigating issues already disposed of in prior actions needlessly consumes judicial resources. LAMCO and ACEMLA were keenly aware that they do not own \"Lleg\u00f3 la Navidad.\" The Court cannot impose sanctions on LAMCO and ACEMLA pursuant to section 1927, because this provision applies only to counsel and\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bolivar v.

Pursuant to Rule 11, the Court \"may not impose a monetary sanction ... against a represented party for violating Rule 11(b)(2).\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(5)(A).
