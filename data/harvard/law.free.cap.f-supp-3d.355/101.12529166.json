Dennis Saylor, IV, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a case arising out of a dispute between Arian DiNapoli, a Boston dentist, and Yelp Inc., which provides a platform for customer reviews of local businesses and service providers. Jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   According to the complaint, Yelp manipulated the reviews of DiNapoli on its website to retaliate against him when he refused to purchase advertising from it. DiNapoli, who has changed lawyers, now seeks to dismiss the lawsuit voluntarily. Instead of agreeing to a voluntary dismissal, Yelp has filed a combined \"special motion to dismiss and strike\" the complaint under California's anti-SLAPP statute, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code, \u00a7 425.16. In substance, Yelp is seeking its attorney's fees and costs under the statute. For the following reasons, the motion for voluntary dismissal will be granted and the motion to strike under California law will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts appear as alleged in the amended complaint unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Arian DiNapoli is a resident of Massachusetts. He operates a dental practice called \"Ari Family Dental\" in West Roxbury, Massachusetts. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Yelp Inc. is a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California. Yelp operates a website where consumers can post reviews of businesses and services. (Am. Compl. 4, 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 15, 2015, DiNapoli performed an emergency dental surgery on an unnamed patient. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 9). DiNapoli contends that the patient called him on January 29, 2016, and requested a falsified tax receipt. DiNapoli refused. Later that day, the patient allegedly posted a negative review of DiNapoli's business on Ari Family Dental's Yelp page. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 10, 11). Yelp categorized the review as \"unreliable.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 12, 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Between March 2016 and January 2017, Yelp attempted four times to sell advertising space on its website to DiNapoli. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 14, 16, 18, 20). Each time, DiNapoli declined. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 15, 17, 19, 21). Soon after DiNapoli's last refusal, in January 2017, Yelp allegedly changed the January 2016 negative review from \"unreliable\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   to \"reliable.\" Doing so apparently caused the negative review to \"replac[e]\" positive reviews that had until then appeared on DiNapoli's page. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DiNapoli contacted Yelp and provided evidence that he contended showed the negative review was false. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 27). Yelp kept the review listed as \"reliable.\" Furthermore, in alleged retaliation for DiNapoli's refusal to purchase advertising space, it posted advertisements for competing dental practices directly next to the negative review on DiNapoli's page. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 28, 29). In addition, Yelp allegedly \"mischaracterized\" five positive reviews on DiNapoli's page as \"unreliable.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 22, 2018, DiNapoli filed suit against Yelp in Massachusetts state court. The complaint asserted two counts, one for a violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, \u00a7 11 and one for \"Negligent Mode of Operation.\" Yelp removed the action to this court on April 23, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 30, 2018, Yelp filed a combined special motion to dismiss and strike the complaint pursuant to the California anti-SLAPP statute, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code, \u00a7 425.16. On the same day, DiNapoli filed an amended complaint that added a third count-a claim that Yelp had \"intentional[ly] interfere[d] with business and/or contractual relationships.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Yelp then filed a new combined special motion to dismiss and strike the complaint. DiNapoli filed an opposition to the combined special motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On November 29, 2018, after changing attorneys, DiNapoli moved to dismiss the action voluntarily. On the same day, he filed a supplemental memorandum in opposition to Yelp's combined special motion, which effectively opposed only Yelp's motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At this point, the parties agree that the complaint should be dismissed with prejudice. They disagree, however, as to whether the amended complaint should be struck under California's anti-SLAPP statute, and thus whether defendant should be awarded attorneys' fees and costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Court concludes that the California anti-SLAPP statute does not apply to this case, it will deny defendant's motion to strike and grant the motion for voluntary dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The California Anti-SLAPP Statute\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 1992, the California legislature enacted a statute to curb lawsuits that \"masquerade[ ] as ordinary lawsuits but [are actually] brought to deter common citizens from exercising their political or legal rights or to punish them for doing so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Batzel v.

That retaliation, it alleges, was primarily composed of three wrongful \"acts\": (1) Yelp \"moved\" the sole negative review of plaintiff's business from the \"unreliable\" to \"reliable\" list, in effect displacing other reviews on plaintiff's page; (2) Yelp \"mischaracterized\" at least five reviews of plaintiff's business as \"unreliable;\" and (3) Yelp sold advertising space on plaintiff's page to his direct competitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Yelp contends that the lawsuit arises from speech subject to the anti-SLAPP law-that is, the critical review. But that is clearly incorrect. It is true that plaintiff is unhappy with the negative review, which he contends is entirely false. However, he does not contend that Yelp wrote the review. Nor is he suing Yelp because it provided a forum for publication of the review. Instead, he brought suit against Yelp for what he contends were unlawful acts of retaliation-in effect, a high-tech form of extortion-because he refused to purchase advertising from it. In other words, the \"specific acts of wrongdoing\" that gave rise to the claim are the allegedly retaliatory acts of moving and mischaracterizing certain reviews and selling advertising space on plaintiff's page to his competitors. Accordingly, it is that alleged conduct, not the critical review, from which plaintiff's claims arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Whether the Alleged Conduct Was in Furtherance of Free Speech\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The next question is \"whether that conduct was in furtherance of the right of free speech.\" A defendant can meet its burden of showing that a \"plaintiff's cause of action\" was \"based on an act in furtherance of the defendant's right of ... free\n   speech\" by \"demonstrating that the act underlying plaintiff's cause fits one of the categories spelled out in [\u00a7 425.16(e) of the statute].\"\n   <em>\n    City of Cotati v. Cashman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"777221\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/29/69/#p78\">\n    29 Cal. 4th 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 78,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20519\">\n    124 Cal.Rptr.2d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20P.3d%20695\">\n    52 P.3d 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (internal quotations and emphasis omitted). Section 425.16(e) provides four categories of acts that may qualify as \"acts in furtherance of a person's right of free speech\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law; (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law; (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest; or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20425.16\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 425.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Yelp contends that its conduct qualifies under parts three and four. Essentially, it contends that its \"display of a business page for [plaintiff's] dental practice, for the purpose of showing [reviews],\" constitutes both a \"writing in a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest\" under subdivision category three, and \"conduct in furtherance of ... free speech\" under subdivision category four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Again, the complained-of conduct by Yelp is neither the statement itself (the critical review), nor the provision of a forum for that statement, nor Yelp's refusal to remove the statement. It is Yelp's alleged acts of retaliation-which, if proved, would amount to a form of business extortion. An act of extortion, or for that matter extortionate speech, is not protected conduct under the California anti-SLAPP statute (or the First Amendment).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flatley v.
