He was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") officers\n   and on April 20, 2004 was personally served with a Notice to Appear (the \"Notice\") initiating removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). The Notice alleged that defendant was subject to removal and ordered him to appear before an immigration judge in Harlingen, Texas; however, in the blanks provided for the date and time of his hearing, the supervising patrol agent simply wrote \"on a date to be set\" and \"at a time to be set.\" The Notice also provided a series of advisements, including that defendant could obtain counsel to represent him at the hearing; that he could present evidence, elicit testimony, or otherwise challenge the allegations in the Notice; that the immigration judge would advise him of any potential grounds for relief from removal; and that he would have the right to appeal any adverse decision by the immigration judge. It further advised defendant that he was required to maintain an up-to-date address with the immigration court, that notice of his hearing date would be sent to that address, and that failure to appear at the hearing could result in an order of deportation\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   . Although the Notice was written in English, it contained a certificate of service indicating that defendant was read the notice in Spanish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant signed that certificate. He also requested an immediate hearing and waived the standard 10-day period designed to enable him to retain counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the same day he received the Notice, defendant was also presented with a prepared Stipulated Request for Order and Waiver of Hearing (the \"Stipulation\"). The Stipulation was written in both English and Spanish and was read to defendant in Spanish. It stated that although defendant had received a list of free legal service providers who could represent him in the removal proceeding, he did not \"wish to be represented by an attorney\" and instead had \"elect[ed] to represent [him]self.\" Defendant signed the Stipulation, thereby acknowledging that he understood his procedural rights under the INA-including his rights to appear before an immigration judge, to examine and object to evidence against him, to present witnesses on his own behalf, and to demand that the government prove his removability-but had chosen to waive those rights so that \"removal proceedings [could] be conducted solely by way of written record without a hearing.\" Further, in the Stipulation defendant admitted \"that all the factual allegations contained in the [Notice were] true and correct as written\"; that he was \"deportable/inadmissible as charged\"; and that he did not intend to seek \"voluntary departure, asylum, ... family unity benefits, legalization benefits, cancellation of removal, naturalization, or any other possible relief or other benefits\" under the INA. Finally, defendant affirmed that he understood signing the Stipulation would result in his removal from the United States; that he accepted such an order of\n   removal; that he waived any appeal of that order; and that he accepted those consequences \"voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently, and without duress, force, or coercion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition to his civil immigration charge, defendant was charged with the misdemeanor of unlawful entry under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The criminal complaint alleged that defendant had entered the United States at a place other than as designated by immigration officers, specifying that he had attempted to evade inspection \"by wading the Rio Grande River.\" On April 21, 2004-one day after he signed the Stipulation-he pleaded guilty to that misdemeanor charge and was sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. The record shows that defendant was represented by a federal public defender in that criminal proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 6, 2004, an immigration judge ordered defendant removed from the United States based on the Stipulation he had signed. He was deported to El Salvador a month and a half later. He returned to the United States at an unknown time and came to the attention of federal immigration authorities in July 2018 after being arrested and charged with misdemeanor assault. Immigration officials took defendant into custody after he was released on bail and have sought reinstatement of his April 2004 deportation order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, defendant was indicted for one count of the felony offense of illegal reentry after deportation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on two independent grounds. First, relying on\n   <em>\n    Pereira v.

Second, defendant argued that the lack of a date and time on the Notice rendered his resulting deportation fundamentally unfair and thus subject to collateral attack under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). As explained in open court and further developed below, although defendant's 2004 immigration proceeding was not without defects, those defects did not deprive the immigration judge of the power to order defendant's removal, and defendant's waiver of his rights in the Stipulation forecloses his \u00a7 1326(d) collateral attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Before the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\") went into effect in April 1997, removal proceedings were initiated through the filing of an \"order to show cause\"; although immigration authorities were permitted to include the time and place of the hearing in the order to show cause, they were not required to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The metes and bounds of a federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction are governed by the Constitution's vesting of the federal judicial power,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art.

By analogy, an agency's subject-matter jurisdiction would stem from congressional grants of authority to act in a particular arena. Yet in this case defendant relies not on a congressional limitation, but rather on a regulation promulgated by the agency itself. In that sense, section 1003.14(a) is more akin to a federal court's local rules, which (like the regulations at issue here) are the product of congressionally delegated gap-filling authority,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 83(a)(1), but which in no way affect the federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, the best reading of section 1003.14(a) is that although it imposes a procedural requirement on immigration authorities' initiation of removal proceedings, that requirement is not \"jurisdictional\" in the formal sense, and a defect in a notice to appear does not necessarily render a resulting deportation order void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant's second argument, framed as a collateral attack under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), also fails.

That language is inapplicable here for multiple reasons. First, in\n    <em>\n     Mendoza-Lopez\n    </em>\n    neither party had challenged the lower courts' finding that the immigration judge had \"fail[ed] ... to explain adequately [the respondents'] right to suspension of deportation or their right to appeal.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    at 840,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/\">\n     107 S.Ct. 2148\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court therefore assumed, rather than decided, the point on which defendant now seeks to rely. Moreover, whereas the noncitizens in\n    <em>\n     Mendoza-Lopez\n    </em>\n    were deprived of critical information related to affirmative rights they held under the INA, defendant here had no affirmative right to a hearing to be held within a given time. In that sense, it bears observing that some uncertainty as to when a removal hearing will be held inheres in the nature of civil immigration proceedings.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Argiz v.
