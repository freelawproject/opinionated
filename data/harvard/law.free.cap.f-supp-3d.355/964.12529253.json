Rynearson seeks a declaration that RCW 9.61.260(1)(b) is unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. In this motion, Rynearson asks this Court to declare 9.61.260(1)(b) facially overbroad and to enjoin the defendants from enforcing this particular section as against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Rynearson first filed this motion for a preliminary injunction in July 2017. The Court dismissed the suit on abstention grounds under\n   <em>\n    Younger v.

In the intervening months between the District Court decision and the Ninth Circuit's order, the Kitsap County Superior Court dismissed the stalking protective order because the communication and the conduct in this case falls under the umbrella of constitutionally protected speech.

Co., Jan. 10, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For this renewed motion, the Court has received and reviewed the memoranda from Rynearson [Dkt. # 44 and # 55], the memoranda from the defendants including a Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. # 53 and # 56], the Complaint [Dkt. # 1], Brief of Amici Curiae Electronic Frontier Foundation and American Civil Liberties Union of Washington in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Dkt. # 52], and Defendants' Response to Amici Curiae Electronic Frontier Foundation and American Civil Liberties Union of Washington [Dkt. # 54]. The Court also conducted oral argument on the issues central to this dispute. For the following reasons, the Preliminary Injunction requested by Rynearson and Amici Curiae is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rynearson is an online author and activist who regularly writes online posts and comments to the public related to civil liberties, including about police abuse and the expansion of executive power in the wake of September 11. Rynearson's writings are often critical-and sometimes harshly so-of local public figures and government officials. These writings are well within the traditions of independent American political discourse, and are intended both to raise the awareness of other citizens regarding the civil-liberties issues that Rynearson writes about, and to hold civic and political leaders accountable to the community through pointed criticism. This sort of expression is at the very heart of political speech which the First Amendment most strongly protects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Many of Rynearson's online posts and comments relate to a detention provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (\"NDAA\") of 2012. Specifically, Section 1021, which was found for authorizing the (unconstitutional) detention of American citizens without trial under the laws of war.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hedges v. Obama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274825\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/890/424/#p458\">\n    890 F.Supp.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 458 (S.D.N.Y. 2012),\n   <em>\n    rev'd for lack of jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068749\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/170/\">\n    724 F.3d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2013). Given his interest in indefinite-detention issues, Rynearson became interested years ago in public and civic organizations in the Seattle area that memorialize and seek to present the lessons of the Japanese-American internment in World War II, such as the Bainbridge Island Japanese-American Exclusion Memorial and Seattle-based Densho.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the past, Rynearson has regularly posted on public Facebook pages criticizing the leadership of public and civic organizations, either because their leaders failed to condemn the NDAA or because they vocally and strongly support politicians who voted for or signed the NDAA, such as Governor Jay Inslee and former President Barack Obama. For example, in February 2017, Rynearson wrote a series of public posts on Facebook criticizing Clarence Moriwaki, the founder of the Bainbridge Island Japanese-American Exclusion Memorial (\"Memorial\"), for failing to criticize Governor Inslee and President Obama for voting for/signing the NDAA. The thrust of Rynearson's posts was that Moriwaki should be removed from his role as board member and de facto spokesperson for the Memorial because Moriwaki used the lessons of the internment, and his role with the Memorial, to criticize Republican politicians (chiefly, President Trump) in many media articles or appearances related to the Memorial, but failed to criticize Democratic politicians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rynearson's posts often include invective, ridicule, and harsh language (but no profanity, obscenity, or threats) intended to criticize or call into question the actions and motives of these civic leaders and other public figures. He reasonably fears prosecution under the cyberstalking statute for such posts. In fact, the Bainbridge Island Police Department referred a police report to the Kitsap County Prosecutor finding probable cause for cyberstalking based on such critical posts to and about Moriwaki. The prosecutor has not brought charges, but sent an email stating that she would revisit her decision regarding charges based on Rynearson's future behavior, including his future speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For a period of time, from March 2017 to January 2018, Rynearson was also subject to a civil protection order imposed by the Bainbridge Island Municipal Court based on posts critical of Moriwaki.\n   <em>\n    Moriwaki v. Rynearson\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-2-01463-1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20733811\">\n    2018 WL 733811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (Wash. Sup. Ct. Jan. 10, 2018). The cyberstalking statute was one of the statutes invoked by the Municipal Court in imposing the protection order.\n   <em>\n    Moriwaki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20733811\">\n    2018 WL 733811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. The\n   order imposed sharp limits on Rynearson's speech, such as barring the use of Moriwaki's name in the titles or domain names of webpages. The order has now been vacated on the ground that it was impermissibly based on Rynearson's constitutionally-protected speech.\n   <em>\n    Moriwaki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20733811\">\n    2018 WL 733811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Despite the order exonerating Rynearson in the State Court, he nevertheless filed this renewed motion for Preliminary Injunction. The defendants in this matter argue that Rynearson lacks standing to challenge Washington's Cyberstalking Statute. They point out that the U.S. Constitution limits the judicial power of federal courts to \"cases\" and \"controversies.\"\n   <em>\n    Flast v.

RCW 9.61.260(1) is Unconstitutional and Overbroad and Requires Injunctive Relief.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2004, Washington enacted one of the first state statutes directly criminalizing cyberstalking. The statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A person is guilty of cyberstalking if he or she, with intent to harass, intimidate, torment, or embarrass any other person, and under circumstances not constituting telephone harassment, makes an electronic communication to such other person or a third party:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (a) Using any lewd, lascivious, indecent, or obscene words, images, or language, or suggesting the commission of any lewd or lascivious act;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (b) Anonymously or repeatedly whether or not conversation occurs; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (c) Threatening to inflict injury on the person or property of the person called or any member of his or her family or household.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   WASH. REV. CODE \u00a7 9.61.260(1) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Rynearson's suit and motion target RCW 9.61.260(1)(b). He rightly argues that 9.61.260(1)(b) criminalizes plainly protected speech under the First Amendment. Section 9.61.260(1)(b) provides that a \"person is guilty of cyberstalking if he or she, with intent to harass, intimidate, torment, or\n   <em>\n    embarrass\n   </em>\n   any other person, ... makes an electronic communication to such other person or a third party ...\n   <em>\n    anonymously\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    repeatedly\n   </em>\n   whether or not conversation occurs.\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The statute separately criminalizes electronic speech that contains \"any lewd, lascivious, indecent, or obscene words, images, or language,\" 9.61.260(1)(a), or that \"threatens to inflict injury on the person or property of the person called or any member of his or her family or household,\" 9.61.260(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Over the years, the Supreme Court has enumerated certain \"well-defined and narrowly limited\" classes of speech that remain unprotected by the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaplinsky v.

In the first case,\n   <em>\n    State v. Stanley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203868480\">\n    2017 WL 3868480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wash. Ct. Apps., Sept. 5, 2017), the Court affirmed a criminal conviction without wholly and directly dealing with the unconstitutionality plank of the appeal. In the second case, the Kitsap County Superior Court ruled that Rynearson's speech about Moriwaki was protected, and therefore that the cyberstalking statute should never have been employed in support of a stalking protection order against him.\n   <em>\n    Moriwaki v. Rynearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20733811\">\n    2018 WL 733811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). In\n   <em>\n    Stanley\n   </em>\n   , the conduct or speech (actual threat) fell clearly within the sphere of unprotected speech;\n   <em>\n    Moriwaki\n   </em>\n   demonstrates why the speech was protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   There is a third scenario. The Municipal Court in\n   <em>\n    Moriwaki\n   </em>\n   relied on the plain meaning of the statute and issued a protection order in Moriwaki's favor, and against Rynearson. It found probable cause to enter a stalking protection order on the basis of anonymous speech intended \"to harass, intimidate, torment, or\n   <em>\n    embarrass\n   </em>\n   .\" RCW 9.61.260(1)(b) (emphasis added). The opportunity for repeating this \"plain meaning\" view of the statute to criminalize protected speech calls out for a prompt curative response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Washington Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Washington v. Stanley\n   </em>\n   was presented with a criminal convicted of nine counts of felony cyberstalking after making true threats to several women. On appeal, Stanley challenged the cyberstalking statute as unconstitutionally overbroad and vague in violation of the First Amendment. The Court's analysis focused on the criminal intent language in 9.61.260(1): \"Harass, intimidate, torment, or embarrass any other person.\" Stanley argued that the statute is facially overbroad to the extent that it criminalizes communications made with intent to \"harass\" or \"embarrass.\" The Court of Appeals looked to analogous statutes and reviewing court decisions to conclude that the term \"harass\" is not unconstitutionally vague. As for the \"intent to embarrass\" provision of the cyberstalking statute, the Court was troubled by the breadth of the language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Although the telephone harassment statute cases have held that the intent to embarrass is not unconstitutionally overbroad, contemporary electronically communication, social media, and internet postings are broad in scope. A variety of political and social commentary, including caustic criticism of public figures, may be swept up as an intent to embarrass someone while using rough language. Stanley's opening brief was filed prior to our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Trey-M.\n   </em>\n   He emphasized the true threat issue. The briefs contain a limited discussion of free speech in the context of electronic communications with intent to embarrass. In view of the limited briefing, we do not decide whether the intent to embarrass in the cyberstalking statute renders the statute unconstitutionally overbroad. Even assuming the term is\n   unconstitutionally overbroad, any error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in this setting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . * 9. The \"setting\" referred to is actual threats to kill the female cyberstalking victims. In the setting of a true threat of harassment, the speech is not protected by the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    State v.
