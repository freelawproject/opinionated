Defendants have moved to dismiss, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted (Docket No. 39). For the reasons state below, Defendants' motion is\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     granted\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  in part and\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     denied\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  in part.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    1. The Attack\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are taken from Plaintiff's Amended Complaint and assumed to be true at this stage of the litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 14, 2000, a woman named M.H. awoke in her bedroom in Worcester,\n   Massachusetts to a man wearing only a t-shirt, underwear, and a cloth wrapped around his head standing at the foot of her bed. When M.H. asked him what he was doing there, he attacked her, beating her with a wooden object. As he climbed on top of her, she kicked and screamed causing her attacker to flee. The attack occurred at 4:00 a.m. and M.H.'s blinds were closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   She immediately called 911. Her initial description was only that her attacker was a white male, that he did not have hair, and what he was wearing. She repeatedly emphasized that she had never seen her attacker before. Defendants Burnes, Turgeon, Benedict, and Donohue then arrived on the scene. M.H. was not able to provide any further description of her attacker and again repeated that she had never seen the man before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    2. Identification\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Later that morning, Defendants Burnes, Turgeon, and Benedict canvassed M.H.'s apartment complex to look for witnesses. They could not find anyone who could identify the assailant but discovered that Plaintiff lived in a different building of the apartment complex. Defendants knew Plaintiff because of his past struggles with drug addiction and were not fond of him. At the time of the investigation, Plaintiff was on probation for drug offenses. In fact, Worcester police had been trying to find him in connection with a purported probation violation but had not located Plaintiff perhaps because he had been in an inpatient treatment program and had not been in contact with police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants spoke to a neighbor of M.H., who falsely alleged that Plaintiff had stolen his motorbike. According to Plaintiff, he had helped the neighbor recover the stolen motorbike and when the neighbor refused to pay the promised reward, a dispute ensued between the two. Because of this disagreement, the neighbor told Defendants he suspected Plaintiff had attacked M.H. Defendants knew that the neighbor's suspicion of Plaintiff stemmed from the motorbike dispute. Nonetheless, Defendants cited the neighbor's lead as a reason to suspect Plaintiff in the attack. According to Plaintiff, this was simply pretext. Once Defendants learned Plaintiff lived in the complex, they decided Plaintiff was the perpetrator, stopped looking for the true attacker, and reverse-engineered the investigation to implicate him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   More than 24 hours after the attack, Defendants Hazelhurst and Doherty met with M.H. Defendants utilized a suggestive photo array which caused M.H. to identify Plaintiff. Instead of using photos that matched M.H.'s description of the perpetrator (which Plaintiff did not match), they showed a photo of Plaintiff and two other men that closely resembled him. The array therefore gave M.H. a choice between Plaintiff-who she had seen before because he lived in the apartment complex-and two strangers. Notably, M.H. previously described her attacker as having no hair whereas Plaintiff did have hair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Moreover, Defendants assembled the array knowing the attack occurred in a dark bedroom, while M.H. was covering her face and eyes, and that the attacker had something around his head. Plaintiff alleges that it follows that Defendants knew M.H.'s identification was highly likely to be inaccurate and that she would be susceptible to suggestive techniques.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before M.H. reviewed the photos, Defendants stressed that M.H. had to identify someone in the array for the case to proceed. During the identification procedure, Defendants Hazelhurst and Doherty told M.H. Plaintiff's name and that he lived in her apartment complex. Plaintiff contends this was done to suggest to M.H. whom they believed was the perpetrator among\n   the nine photographs. M.H. subsequently identified Plaintiff and Defendants Hazelhurst and Doherty told her that she correctly identified the perpetrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thereafter, M.H.'s description of her attacker predictably became more detailed. In short, the description suddenly sounded like Plaintiff. For the first time, M.H. noted that her attacker had a \"familiar face\" despite the fact she had previously said the exact opposite. Also unsurprisingly, M.H. became convinced Plaintiff was her attacker. She repeated her identification of him during his criminal proceedings and her eye witness account implicated him in the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    3. Destruction of Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants recovered part of a chair rung from M.H.'s bedroom, presumably the wooden object her attacker used to beat her. Before fingerprint and forensic evidence could be developed, however, Defendant Donohue and other Defendants allowed it to be destroyed. Further, Defendants also found fingerprints that the attacked left on the window where he entered the apartment. Defendants similarly allowed that evidence to be destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Further, after the attack a pair of men's shorts were found that did not belong to M.H. or anyone else who had lawfully been in her apartment. Defendants believed that the shorts belonged to the perpetrator as he had already stripped down to his underwear when M.H. awoke and fled before getting dressed. The shorts also contained semen which the Defendants tested. When the genetic profile did not match Plaintiff, Defendants manipulated details to make it appear the shorts did not belong to the true attacker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff argues that this evidence was destroyed or manipulated in bad faith in order to frame Plaintiff for a crime he did not commit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    4. Conviction and Exoneration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff was tried for armed burglary, assault and battery with a weapon, and assault with the intent to rape. He was acquitted of assault with intent to rape but convicted of the other chargers and sentenced to 12 to 20 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 31, 2016, the Superior Court granted Plaintiff a new trial. After an evidentiary hearing, the court suppressed M.H.'s identification as the \"procedure was unduly suggestive.\" On November 14, 2017, the Commonwealth subsequently dropped all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Standard\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A defendant may move to dismiss, based solely on the complaint, for the plaintiff's \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.

Thus, I find that the first aspect of the second prong is met-it was clearly established at the time Plaintiff's investigation took place that he was constitutionally protected against unduly suggestive identification procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff argues because it was clearly established that unnecessarily suggestive identification procedures were unconstitutional at the time of Plaintiff's case, our job is done for the purposes of this motion. \"This formulation of the inquiry, however, is not sufficiently specific.

Indeed, the second aspect of the prong requires this Court to inquire whether a reasonable defendant would have understood whether his particular conduct violated Plaintiff's rights. In other words, would a reasonable officer had known the identification procedures allegedly utilized were unduly suggestive. The Supreme Court has \"repeatedly told courts ... not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Defendants argue that their identification procedures were only found unnecessarily suggestive by the Superior Court based on new state procedures promulgated after Plaintiff's conviction and not clearly established constitutional precedent. It follows, according to Defendants that there was no clearly established law to put Defendants on notice that their conduct was unlawful. Further, Plaintiff has not cited, nor has this court identified, any case that would deem the identification procedures utilized in Plaintiff's case unnecessarily suggestive under federal law.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rojas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%20169798\">\n    2003 WL 169798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (\"Moreover, courts have previously held that identification procedures are unduly suggestive\n   <em>\n    on facts similar to those here\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added). However, Plaintiff alleges in his Amended Complaint that \"during the identification procedure, when conferring with M.H. about Plaintiff's photograph, Defendants Hazelhurst and Doherty told M.H. Plaintiff's name, and they told her that he lived in her complex.\" (Docket No. 4, \u00b6 41). In addition, \"Defendants Hazelhurst and Doherty\n   <em>\n    suggested to M.H. that she should identify Plaintiff as her attacker\n   </em>\n   during the identification procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42 (emphasis added). While the Court is unaware of any caselaw explicitly holding this type of procedure is unnecessarily suggestive, the First Circuit has held that when an officer's conduct is so clearly unconstitutional, no precedent directly on point is necessary to provide adequate notice to a reasonable officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marrero-Mendez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349216\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/38/#p46\">\n    830 F.3d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Indeed, the coerciveness of appellants' conduct is so patently evident that no particular case-and certainly not one 'directly on point,'-need have existed to put a reasonable officer on notice of its unconstitutionality.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    al-Kidd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    563 U.S. at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ).

Defendants note that when Plaintiff's conviction was affirmed by the Massachusetts Appeals Courts, the court noted the corroborating evidence of Plaintiff's guilt. Thus, even if the identification procedures were unnecessarily suggestive, the other evidence sufficiently supported Plaintiff's arrest and prosecution.

In Plaintiff's view, a failure to intervene claim is merely a pathway to liability. According to Plaintiff, the relevant inquiry is whether the underlying right was clearly established. As discussed above, Plaintiffs underlying constitutional\n   rights that were allegedly violated were indeed clearly established at the time of his prosecution. The First Circuit, however, seems to have suggested that the duty to intervene in the context at issue must have also been clearly established. In\n   <em>\n    Torres-Rivera\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the First Circuit held that an officer was not entitled to qualified immunity in the excessive force context that \"the law was clearly established in 1998 that an officer\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Neill'\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    s circumstances\n   </em>\n   had a duty to intervene.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1095756\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/406/43/#p54\">\n    406 F.3d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).
