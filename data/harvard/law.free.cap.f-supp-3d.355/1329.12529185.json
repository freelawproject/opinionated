The court disagrees with Defendant's overbroad interpretation of the\n   <em>\n    Ad Hoc Shrimp\n   </em>\n   case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld Commerce's denial of separate rate status in\n   <em>\n    Ad Hoc Shrimp\n   </em>\n   because the respondent's deficiencies and inconsistencies specifically related to whether the company at issue had affiliates in nonmarket economy countries, which related to the ownership and control of the company at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ad Hoc Shrimp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341667\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/1339/\">\n    802 F.3d at 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The company's corporate structure in\n   <em>\n    Ad Hoc Shrimp\n   </em>\n   directly implicated the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   criteria for separate rate status. The language on which Defendant relies for the proposition that the \"misrepresentations may reasonably be inferred to pervade the data in the record\" appears in the section regarding Commerce's AFA determination and cannot be imported into the separate rate analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341667\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/1339/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341667\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/1339/\">\n    at 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the instant case, Zhaofeng's misrepresentations relate only to the reporting of sales data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Final IDM\n   </em>\n   at 6. Because Zhaofeng's misrepresentations do not speak directly to Zhaofeng's corporate structure or to the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   control of the company, the misrepresentations cannot and should not be inferred to pervade the separate rate analysis. The court concludes that Defendant's attempts to analogize this case with\n   <em>\n    Ad Hoc Shrimp\n   </em>\n   are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The separate rate analysis is separate and distinct from the selection of an AFA rate.\n   <em>\n    Shenzen Xinboda\n   </em>\n   , 40 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174677\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/180/1305/#p1316\">\n    180 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1315 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Nail Corp. v.

Commerce has the authority to determine if a country is a non-market economy pursuant to a completely different statutory provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273146\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/279/1372/#p1379\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1677(18). Commerce's practice of determining separate rate eligibility is derived from section 1677. Commerce developed its practice of determining separate rate eligibility based on\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    de jure\n   </em>\n   independence criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sigma Corp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11978950\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/1401/#p1404\">\n    117 F.3d at 1405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the AFA analysis and separate rate analysis are distinct statutory evaluations, the two analyses cannot be conflated. The court concludes that Commerce's decision to deny Zhaofeng separate rate status is not in accordance with the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant contends that Commerce's decision to deny Zhaofeng's separate rate status was supported by substantial evidence because of multiple instances of misreporting and misconduct by Zhaofeng stemming from Zhaofeng's March 2016 quantity and value reconciliation and its U.S. sales listing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Resp. 13. Commerce did not adequately explain how this misconduct related to its separate rate analysis in the underlying administrative review. Commerce stated that Zhaofeng cannot meet the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   criteria because \"under Commerce's\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   separate rates analysis,\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   criteria can be, in some way or another, supported (or refuted) by data recorded in the company's accounting system.\" Final IDM at 9. Commerce explained that Zhaofeng's accounting system also affected the\n   <em>\n    de jure\n   </em>\n   criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. This is an overly broad conclusion. Because it is not clear which of the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    de jure\n   </em>\n   criteria are affected by Zhaofeng's misreporting in its March 2016 quantity and value reconciliation report, the court concludes that Commerce's decision to deny Zhaofeng separate rate status is not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, the court concludes that Commerce's decision to deny Zhaofeng separate rate status is not in accordance with the law and not supported by substantial evidence.
