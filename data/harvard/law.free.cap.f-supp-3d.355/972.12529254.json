See AR 756-58, 821-23. Plaintiff argues the ALJ erred by not adopting a reasoning-level limitation that was implied by Dr. Kester and Dr. Clifford.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 20 at 8-10.

They further explained that plaintiff \"may experience occasional lapses in [concentration, persistence, and pace]. However, [with] reasonable breaks during the workday, he can keep to a schedule,\n   maintain regular attendance, and complete a normal workweek [without] special accommodation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7635572\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/74/967/#p972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff asserts, based on the following series of assumptions, that the ALJ rejected these opinions without providing any reason. Dkt. 20 at 9. The Disability Determination Explanation forms list three example occupations that plaintiff could perform. Plaintiff assumes that, because all three examples are reasoning level 1 or 2 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , unskilled work), the agency must have concluded that plaintiff could not perform at level 3. Dkt. 20 at 10. He further assumes that the example occupations, and the implied limitation to level 2, must have been based on Dr. Kester's and Dr. Clifford's opinions. Dkt. 20 at 8. Specifically, the level 2 limitation must have been based on their opinions on concentration, persistence, and pace. Dkt. 20 at 9. Not one of these assumptions is supported by any authority or grounded in the record. The forms specifically state that plaintiff is not limited to unskilled work. AR 758, 824. While the forms do indicate that they used the guideline for unskilled work as a framework, the most likely explanation is, as the forms state, that \"all potentially applicable Medical-Vocational Guidelines would direct a finding of 'not disabled' given [plaintiff's] age, education, and RFC.\" AR 758-59, 823. Next, plaintiff provides no authority or even logic supporting the assumption that concentration, persistence, and pace impairments provide the basis for reasoning level limitations. Common sense suggests that the ability to do complex work is distinct from the ability to persist at work. Finally, plaintiff provides no authority or logic supporting the assumption that the example jobs reflect plaintiff's maximum ability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff has not shown that the ALJ's reasoning level 3 determination reflects an error of law or was not based on substantial evidence. The court concludes that the ALJ did not err by concluding plaintiff had the RFC to perform work at reasoning level 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Prior Work\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff contends that his past work as a general merchandise clerk exceeded a reasoning level of 3, and thus his RFC excluded it. Dkt. 20 at 4-7; Dkt. 22 at 8. Plaintiff concedes that the vocational expert (VE) testified to the contrary, but argues that the ALJ\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   should have challenged the VE's testimony. Dkt. 22 at 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 705. A \"VE's testimony is one type of job information that is regarded as inherently reliable; thus, there is no need for an ALJ to assess its reliability.\"\n   <em>\n    Buck v. Berryhill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266823\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1040/#p1051\">\n    869 F.3d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1051 (9th Cir. 2017). An ALJ \"need not inquire\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   into the foundation for the expert's opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Shaibi v.

The hypothetical that the ALJ posed to the VE contained all the limitations in the RFC and the \"ALJ's reliance on testimony the VE gave in response to the hypothetical therefore was proper.\"\n   <em>\n    Bayliss v. Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241092\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/1211/#p1217\">\n    427 F.3d 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1217 (9th Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's attorney did not challenge the VE's testimony at the hearing. The Ninth Circuit has \"h[e]ld that when a claimant fails entirely to challenge a vocational expert's job numbers during administrative proceedings before the agency, the claimant forfeits such a challenge on appeal, at least when that claimant is represented by counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Shaibi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516040\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/1102/#p1110\">\n    883 F.3d at 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court's logic applies equally to plaintiff's challenge to the interpretation of reasoning levels 3 and 4, because the court relied on its holding in\n   <em>\n    Meanel v. Apfel\n   </em>\n   that \" 'at least when claimants are represented by counsel, they must raise all issues and evidence at their administrative hearings in order to preserve them on appeal.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516040\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/1102/#p1110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Meanel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11633500\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/172/1111/#p1115\">\n    172 F.3d 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1115 (9th Cir. 1999) ). In\n   <em>\n    Shaibi\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff presented evidence for the first time on appeal. Here, plaintiff does not even have new evidence to offer, but merely plaintiff's counsel's interpretation of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles definitions of reasoning level 3 and 4. Plaintiff's argument is foreclosed by his failure to raise it during administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Medical Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff argues the ALJ erred by rejecting the opinions of examining doctor Kimberly Wheeler, Ph.D., and treating physician Floyd Smith, M.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   An ALJ may only reject a treating or examining doctor's controverted opinion by stating \"specific and legitimate\" reasons.\n   <em>\n    Revels v.

The ALJ can meet this standard by providing \"a detailed and thorough summary of the facts and conflicting clinical evidence, stating his interpretation thereof, and making findings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265457\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/648/#p654\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). \"The ALJ must do more than offer his conclusions.

Kimberly Wheeler, Ph.D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Dr. Wheeler examined plaintiff in June 2016 and diagnosed him with generalized anxiety, unspecified depression, and gave a rule-out diagnosis of history of alcohol abuse. AR 1016-17. Dr. Wheeler opined that plaintiff had marked, or very significant, limitations in the abilities to communicate and perform effectively in a work setting, maintain appropriate behavior in a work setting (due to pain behavior such as grimacing and odd postures), and complete a normal work day and work week without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms. AR 1017-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The ALJ gave Dr. Wheeler's opinions \"little weight\" because they were \"grossly inconsistent with the overall medical evidence of record.\" AR 670. Specifically, plaintiff's mental health symptoms improved with therapy, he did not pursue medication treatment until 2017, and he regularly demonstrated strong cognitive and social functioning. The third reason is not specific or legitimate, because Dr. Wheeler's opinions did not rest on cognitive or social deficits. The other two reasons are addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Improvement with Therapy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Impairments that can be effectively controlled by medication or treatment are not considered disabling for purposes of Social Security benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warre v.

The ALJ relied on a September 2016 treatment note stating that plaintiff reported that therapy was helpful. AR 664-65 (citing AR 1574). Plaintiff told the provider that his \"pain can set off anxiety. When it does, ... he will experience dizziness, chest pressure, numbness, sweating, anxiety.\" AR 1574. Therapy was helpful in reducing the duration of these \"panic attacks\" and reducing their frequency from daily to weekly. AR 1574, 1576.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   However, Dr. Wheeler's opinions did not rely on the presence of panic attacks. Plaintiff did not report panic attacks to her, and she did not diagnose him with panic disorder or include any findings about panic attacks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1015-16. Instead, Dr. Wheeler documented rumination and a \"focus on pain\" as contributing to plaintiff's mental health impairments. AR 1016, 1018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Effective treatment of panic attacks (if a decrease to only weekly panic attacks can be described as effective) does not undermine any findings on which Dr. Wheeler relied and thus was not a specific, legitimate\n   reason to discount Dr. Wheeler's opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Failure to Seek Treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   An \"unexplained or inadequately explained failure\" to seek treatment or follow prescribed treatment can be a valid reason to discount a\n   <em>\n    claimant's\n   </em>\n   testimony, because it suggests the claimant does not find his impairments disabling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trevizo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265438\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/664/#p674\">\n    871 F.3d at 679-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is less persuasive as a reason to discount a medical opinion, however, because a doctor cannot control whether a claimant seeks treatment. Moreover, the Ninth Circuit has \"particularly criticized the use of a lack of treatment to reject mental complaints both because mental illness is notoriously underreported and because 'it is a questionable practice to chastise one with a mental impairment for the exercise of poor judgment in seeking rehabilitation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Regennitter v.

Here, plaintiff testified that he believed his underlying problem was pain; thus his mental health impairments would cease if he got effective pain treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 692. Plaintiff's reason is supported by at least one mental health professional. In September 2016, a psychiatrist examined plaintiff and concluded that \"[m]aximizing treatment of pain would [benefit plaintiff] as the pain has impacted all areas of his life.\" AR 1576.

Using an elliptical machine once is not inconsistent with plaintiff's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157089\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/995/#p1016\">\n    759 F.3d at 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (relief of pain \"for only variable, brief periods of time, ranging from a couple of months to a few days\" is not inconsistent with testimony of near-constant pain).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The only reference to firewood is plaintiff's report in October 2015 that \"he gets a lot of blurred vision when he is doing a lot of bending such as with firewood at his house.\" AR 559. The fact that bending worsens his symptoms is consistent with plaintiff's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   None of the daily activities the ALJ cited was a clear and convincing reason to discount plaintiff's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court concludes the ALJ erred by failing to provide any clear and convincing reason to discount plaintiff's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Scope of Remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiff contends the Court should remand for an award of benefits or, in the alternative, for further administrative proceedings. Dkt. 20 at 18. Only in rare circumstances should the Court remand a case for benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Treichler v. Colvin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055813\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/1090/#p1099\">\n    775 F.3d 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1099 (9th Cir. 2014). The Court may remand for further proceedings if enhancement of the record would be useful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harman v. Apfel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1743534\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/211/1172/#p1178\">\n    211 F.3d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1178 (9th Cir. 2000). The Court may remand for benefits where (1) the record is fully developed and further administrative proceedings would serve no useful purpose; (2) the ALJ fails to provide legally sufficient reasons for rejecting evidence, whether claimant testimony or medical opinion; and (3) if the improperly discredited evidence were credited as true, the ALJ would be required to find the claimant disabled on remand.\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157089\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/995/#p1016\">\n    759 F.3d at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court has flexibility, however, \"when the record as a whole creates serious doubt as to whether the claimant is, in fact, disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157089\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/995/#p1016\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157089\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/995/#p1016\">\n    at 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Here, further proceedings would not only be useful but are necessary. Even if Dr. Wheeler's opinions are credited as true, it is not clear how the opined limitations would be translated into an RFC. For example, she opined that plaintiff would have a \"very significant\" limitation on the ability to complete a normal work day and work week, but it is unclear how much off-task time that would result in, and thus the record contains no evidence supporting a determination of whether employers would tolerate that level of off-task time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1017. And as much as plaintiff would like to read Dr. Smith's opinion to mean that plaintiff is disabled for purposes of Social Security, the record does not show that Dr. Smith is familiar with the Social Security disability regulations. Dr. Smith may have meant that plaintiff could not sit for eight hours a day, but may not have considered whether plaintiff could manage with a sit/stand option. It is unclear as well how plaintiff's own testimony would translate into an RFC. Accordingly, because plaintiff's entitlement to\n   benefits is not clear and the record must be developed further, the Court remands the case for further administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Commissioner's final decision is REVERSED and this case is REMANDED for further administrative proceedings under sentence four of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   On remand, the ALJ should reassess the opinions of Dr. Wheeler and Dr. Smith, reevaluate plaintiff's testimony, reformulate plaintiff's RFC as needed and proceed to steps four and five as appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n     20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 416.920.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    20 C.F.R.
