Patterson's Offer Letter states that his employment is contingent upon an enumerated list of items, including drug testing, physical capacity testing, and other things.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Offer Letter at 1. The Offer Letter does not mention arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Offer Letter at 1-2.

The Arbitration Agreement states that \"the Company and the Employee agree to submit exclusively to final and binding arbitration any and all Disputes as defined herein in accordance with the following understanding and terms.\" Arbitration Agreement at 3. The Arbitration Agreement defines the word \"dispute\" as\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   all legal and equitable claims, demands, disputes, controversies, issues, and disagreements, of whatever nature or kind, whether in contract, tort, under statute or regulation, or any other law or source of legal obligation, including but not limited to those relating to, concerning, or arising out of this Agreement; the interpretation or subject matter of this Agreement or program ... wages or other compensation received by or owed to any Employee, including minimum wage and overtime pay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Arbitration Agreement at 2. The Arbitration Agreement continues:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Each Dispute shall be arbitrated on an individual basis. The parties forego and waive any right to join or consolidate their Disputes or claims with those of any other employee ... or to assert any Disputes or claims in arbitration as a representative or as a member of a class.... Neither the Company nor any employee or applicant for employment may pursue any Dispute or claim on a class action, collective action, or consolidated basis or in a representative capacity on behalf of other individuals, or participate\n   as a class or collective action member in such a proceeding.... The Parties waive any right to a jury trial and to pursue or participate in class or collective actions with respect to Disputes that are subject of this Agreement and for which a jury trial, class action, and collective action would otherwise be available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Arbitration Agreement at 3. The Arbitration Agreement contains several other important provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arbitration Agreement at 3-4. One states that \"arbitration shall be commenced by either Party filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   within 60 days after such Dispute has arisen.\" Arbitration Agreement at 3. Another notes:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, the Company may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief to enforce the Employee's obligations with respect to the confidentiality and protection of trade secrets and other non-public information belonging to the Company, or with respect to any non-competition, non-solicitation, or any other restrictive covenant provisions in any separate agreement between the Company and the Employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Arbitration Agreement at 4. Still another provision states: \"The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and the Parties' employment relationship affect and involve interstate commerce, and that this Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Arbitration Agreement at 5. Finally, the Arbitration Agreement contains an integration clause, stating:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either Party that are not set forth expressly in this Agreement.... This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter herein, in particular the Parties' agreement regarding the protection of Confidential Information and the procedural mechanism for the final resolution of Disputes and supersedes all prior understandings, agreements, clauses, provisions, representations, or promises, whether oral or written, of the Parties to the extent they relate to or concern the subject matter herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Arbitration Agreement at 5.

Patterson subsequently filed the Amended Complaint on November 13, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint at 1. Nine Energy filed the Motion on December 6, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Motion\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Nine Energy moves the Court to dismiss this case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and to compel arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. Nine Energy first contends that Patterson's claims fall within the Arbitration Agreement's scope, because the Arbitration Agreement's provisions \"cover all disputes, claims, or disagreements relating to Plaintiff's employment.\" Motion at 5. Nine Energy then argues that the Arbitration Agreement contains adequate consideration, asserting that \"the bargained for exchange in this case was Plaintiff's offer of employment with Nine Energy in exchange for signing the Confidentiality and Dispute Resolution Agreement as well as the Parties' mutual agreement to submit all employment disputes to arbitration.\" Motion at 6. Turning to the class action allegations, Nine Energy avers that the Arbitration Agreement expressly states that the parties waive any right to participate in a class or collective action regarding any disputes subject to the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 7-8. Nine Energy concludes that the Court should grant the Motion and compel Patterson to arbitrate his claims on an individual basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 8.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Patterson responds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Class Action Complaint and Compel Arbitration, filed January 2, 2018 (Doc. 13-1) (\"Response\"). Patterson first asserts that the Arbitration Agreement is substantively unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4. According to Patterson, the Arbitration Agreement section allowing Nine Energy to bring an action for injunctive relief in court to enforce an employee's confidentiality obligations, such as the protection of trade secrets, represents a unilateral carve-out favoring Nine Energy and is therefore unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4-5. Second, Patterson avers that the Arbitration Agreement contains no consideration and is thus illusory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5. According to Patterson \"continued at-will employment cannot serve as consideration for an agreement to arbitrate,\" which Patterson asserts is the Arbitration Agreement's purported consideration.

Nine Energy first asserts that the Arbitration Agreement's consideration is Patterson's initial offer of employment and not continued at-will employment, because Patterson signed the Arbitration Agreement on the same day he accepted his employment offer and did not begin working for Nine Energy until twenty days later.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 5. Additionally, Nine Energy contends that \"there was\n   separate, valid consideration for the Agreement. In exchange for Plaintiff agreeing to arbitrate his employment-related disputes, Nine Energy promised not only to hire Plaintiff, but also to provide him access to its confidential information and trade secrets.\" Reply at 11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, Nine Energy argues that, while part of the Arbitration Agreement may exempt Nine Energy from arbitration, other parts of the agreement contain \"exclusions for numerous types of employment-related claims that Plaintiff alone would be able to pursue.\" Reply at 9. Nine Energy continues that \"the exclusion of which Plaintiff complains relates to one limited form of relief -- injunctive relief -- that only the employer might be able to pursue to protect its confidential information and trade secrets.\" Reply at 9. According to Nine Energy, \"[i]t is impossible that the Plaintiff would be able to bring such a claim, just as it is impossible that Nine Energy would be able to bring any of the claims excluded for Plaintiff (i.e. EEOC charges, NLRB charges, unemployment claims).\" Reply at 9.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Nine Energy contends that, \"[e]ven if the Court were to find this provision unconscionable, the Court can and should modify or sever the provision rather than invalidating the entire Agreement.\" Reply at 11. According to Nine Energy, the provision allowing it to bring an action for injunctive relief to protect confidential information \"is not relevant or intertwined with the agreement to arbitrate compensation disputes, and severability is in line with the strong federal policy underlying the FAA favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements.\" Reply at 11-12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Surreply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Patterson filed a surreply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surreply in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Class Action Complaint and Compel Arbitration, filed January 10, 2018 (Doc. 16-1) (\"Surreply\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Patterson first asserts that Nine Energy's employment offer was not contingent on signing the Arbitration Agreement, so the employment offer is not consideration for the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surreply at 4. According to Patterson, Nine Energy's employment offer cannot be consideration for Patterson agreeing to arbitration, because the Offer Letter provides a list of contingencies, none of which include signing the Arbitration Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surreply at 6. Further, according to Patterson, the Arbitration Agreement \"contains an explicit merger clause that prevents the Offer Letter --\n   or any other oral/written agreement -- from being incorporated into the Arbitration Agreement or for serving as the consideration for the Agreement.\" Surreply at 6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, Patterson takes issue with Nine Energy's assertion that it promised to provide confidential information and trade secrets to Patterson as consideration for him signing the Arbitration Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surreply at 6-7. According to Patterson, the Arbitration Agreement \"does not require Defendant to disclose any specific confidential information or trade secrets.\" Surreply at 7. Patterson adds that \"no New Mexico court has reached the conclusion that an agreement to provide confidential information is adequate consideration for an agreement to arbitrate.\" Surreply at 7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Third, Patterson argues for the first time that the Arbitration Agreement is unconscionable, because \"the terms of the agreement prevent Plaintiff from vindicating his statutory rights under the FLSA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Surreply at 7. Specifically, Patterson contends that the Arbitration Agreement's provision requiring arbitration to commence within 60 days after a dispute arises is unconscionable, because \"the FLSA's limitations period may not be shortened by contract.\" Surreply at 8. Finally, Patterson avers that the Court should not sever any allegedly unconscionable provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, because the agreement contains no severance clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surreply at 9-10. Patterson instead concludes that the Court should refuse to enforce the entire Arbitration Agreement and deny the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surreply at 10.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     The Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court held a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Transcript of Motion Hearing at 1:10-11 (taken June 27, 2018) (Court) (\"Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nine Energy began by asserting that \"Mr. Patterson in the briefing concedes that this Court has recognized ... that an offer of at will employment is sufficient consideration for an arbitration agreement. And that's exactly what we have here.\" Tr. at 4:19-24 (Mann). Patterson responded that the Arbitration Agreement's integration clause precludes any outside oral or written agreement -- including Patterson's employment offer -- from being incorporated into the Arbitration Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:1-9 (Siegel). Patterson added that the Offer Letter lists several contingencies that Patterson had to meet to accept his employment offer, none of which includes signing the Arbitration Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 13:2-9 (Siegel).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The parties then discussed unconscionability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 17:1-5 (Mann). Nine Energy asserted that Patterson \"latches onto a portion of the agreement ... that reserves to Nine the right to seek injunctive relief to enforce certain aspects of the agreement pertaining to confidential information.... What Mr. Patterson chooses to ignore [is] that the same paragraph on which he bases this argument contains multiple carve-outs solely for the ... plaintiff here.\" Tr. at 17:1-14 (Mann). Nine Energy thus contended that the carve-outs in the Arbitration Agreement are bilateral and not unilateral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:3-6 (Mann).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Patterson then returned to the podium and asserted that the Arbitration\n   Agreement is substantively unconscionable for the separate reason that it \"has effectively shortened the statute of limitations period.\" Tr. at 22:15-16 (Siegel). Specifically, Patterson argued that the Arbitration Agreement shortens the limitations period from three years to sixty days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 22:21-24 (Siegel). Nine Energy responded that \"the parties cannot limit statute[s] of limitations by contract. So even if that language is contained in the agreement [, were] it be attempted to be enforced it could not.\" Tr. at 25:9-13 (Mann).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court then asked if Nine Energy contended that, if the Court were to find any provision unconscionable, it should sever the provision rather than not enforcing the entire agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 28:25-29:7 (Court, Mann). Nine Energy responded that, if the Court concluded that a provision is unconscionable, then Nine Energy would prefer the rest of the agreement enforced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 29:8-16 (Mann).

Nine Energy contends that the Arbitration Agreement is unlike that in\n   <em>\n    Cordova\n   </em>\n   , because: (i) \"the Agreement does not concern a predatory lending or consumer loan agreement,\" Reconsideration Response at 3; (ii) the Agreement permitted Patterson to pursue multiple claims outside of arbitration, and to file complaints with State and Federal administration agencies which could litigate claims against Nine Energy on Patterson's behalf,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reconsideration Response at 3; and (iii) the injunctive relief provision at issue is narrow in scope and situated in a stand-alone section of the Agreement, Nine Energy \"can only seek injunctive relief to enforce Plaintiff's obligations under restrictive covenants,\" and there is a low likelihood that Nine Energy could enforce the restrictive covenants against Patterson, Reconsideration Response at 3. Nine Energy argues, accordingly, that the Arbitration Agreement is less one-sided than the agreement in\n   <em>\n    Cordova\n   </em>\n   , and that the injunctive relief provision that the Court severed in the MOO is not so central to the Arbitration Agreement that it is incapable of severance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reconsideration Response at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Next, Nine Energy argues that\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court of New Mexico recognized a court's discretion to sever a provision in an arbitration agreement, is still good law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reconsideration Response at 4.

Patterson reiterates the arguments from the Reconsideration Motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reply at 1-2, and asserts that the unilateral carve-out provision here contains no language that limits Nine Energy's unilateral ability to seek permanent injunctive relief to enforce Patterson's obligations with respect to any other restrictive covenant in any other agreement between Patterson and Nine Energy in any court of competent jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reconsideration Reply at 2. Patterson contends, therefore, that the provision at issue here is more unconscionable than the provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    Cordova\n   </em>\n   , because, here, Nine Energy can take advantage of its employees by having them sign separate agreements with restrictive covenants and then enforce those agreements at will.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reconsideration Reply at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Patterson argues that courts of other jurisdictions agree with the Supreme Court of New Mexico that unfairly one-sided contract provisions are unconscionable and non-severable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reconsideration Reply at 3-4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Patterson asserted that, while the Court based its substantive unconscionability determination in the MOO on\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cordova\n   </em>\n   , it cited to neither\n   <em>\n    Cordova\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   in its analysis of the appropriateness of severance of the provision at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 25 Tr. at 2:23-25 (Siegel);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:7-10 (Siegel). Patterson contends that the Court instead relied on Padilla, which Patterson alleges was \"improper,\" because\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , unlike the present case, concerns an appeals provision that came into effect only after arbitration was over. Oct. 25 Tr. at 3:10-17 (Siegel). Patterson argues that, in\n   <em>\n    Clay v.

Patterson contended that the carve-out provision at issue in the Arbitration Agreement is central to the Arbitration Agreement, and therefore, the entire Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable if it is unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 25 Tr. at 4:2-12 (Siegel). Patterson argues that the key is that the provision at issue is not merely a unilateral carve-out, but a unilateral carve-out for judicial relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 25 Tr. at 4:18-21 (Siegel). Patterson argues that, although the Court in its MOO and Nine Energy in its briefing pointed to provisions in the Arbitration Agreement allowing Patterson to bring unemployment or workers compensation claims outside of the arbitration context, many courts have found that these provisions are not carve-outs for judicial relief, because they have their own adjudicatory frameworks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 25 Tr. at 4:2-5:3 (Siegel). Patterson asserted that the provision at issue is entirely one-sided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 25 Tr. at 5:6-8 (Siegel).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The night before the hearing, Patterson discovered\n   <em>\n    Tatum v.

Patterson contended that the most important claim he might raise against Defendant is for injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 25 Tr. at 6:4-6 (Siegel). Patterson contended that in the Arbitration Agreement, Nine Energy is the only person that has the unilateral right to go to court and enforce the provisions for injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 25 Tr. at 7:8-10 (Siegel).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Nine Energy then argued that Senior Judge Hansen did not discuss severability at all in\n   <em>\n    Tatum v.

Nine Energy noted that, in several of the cases which Patterson cites, the courts opted to sever the provisions at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 25 Tr. at 9:10-14 (Mann). Nine Energy argued that the \"key, as the Court noticed, is whether the substantive unconscionability clause is essential to the agreement as a whole.\" Oct. 25 Tr. at 9:14-16 (Mann). Nine Energy noted that the provision at issue in the\n   Arbitration Agreement contains eleven paragraphs, addressing eleven separate points, but that the Court opted to strike only one sentence in one paragraph out of eleven, so that the remaining agreement requires both parties to submit all disputes to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 25 Tr. at 9:20-25 (Mann). Nine Energy argued that the Court found a justifiable way to sever and quoted from the MOO: \"Further, it would make little sense for the Court to trash the entire Arbitration Agreement because of an unconscionable provision unrelated to this case.\" Oct. 25 Tr. at 10:12-15 (Mann) (quoting MOO at 42,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527084\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/1280/\">\n    330 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1311 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Patterson then argued that the provision at issue pertains to the most likely actions that Nine Energy might bring against its employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 25 Tr. at 11:3-5 (Siegel). Patterson reiterated that no case in New Mexico has allowed the severance of an arbitration agreement provision that is a unilateral carve-out for judicial relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 25 Tr. at 11:5-8 (Siegel).

Second, after twenty-eight days, when the court may consider motions under rule 60, if a party has filed a notice of appeal, the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction trumps the district court's, and the district court needs the Court of Appeals' permission even to grant a rule 60 motion.

First, when a case is not appealed, there is an interest in finality. The parties and the lawyers expect to go home, quit obsessing about the dispute, and put the case behind them, and the final judgment -- especially once the twenty-eight-day window of robust district court review and the thirty-day window of appeal have both closed -- is the disposition upon which they are entitled to rely. Second, when a case is appealed, there is the need for a clean jurisdictional handoff from the district court to the Court of Appeals. \"[A] federal district court and a federal court of appeals should not attempt to assert jurisdiction over a case simultaneously,\" as doing so produces a \"danger [that] a district court and a court of appeals w[ill] be simultaneously analyzing the same judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Griggs v.

In short, a district court can use whatever standard it wants to review a motion to reconsider an interlocutory order. It can review the earlier ruling de novo and essentially reanalyze the earlier motion from scratch, it can review the ruling de novo but limit its review, it can require parties to establish one of the law-of-the-case\n   grounds, or it can refuse to entertain motions to reconsider altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The best approach, in the Court's eyes, is to analyze motions to reconsider differently depending on three factors.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Been v. O.K. Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562144\" index=\"664\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/1217/#p1225\">\n    495 F.3d at 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he doctrine is merely a 'presumption, one whose strength varies with the circumstances.' \" (citation omitted) ). First, the Court should restrict its review of a motion to reconsider a prior ruling in proportion to how thoroughly the earlier ruling addressed the specific findings or conclusions that the motion to reconsider challenges. How \"thoroughly\" a point was addressed depends both on the amount of time and energy the Court spent on it, and on the amount of time and energy the parties spent on it -- in briefing and orally arguing the issue, but especially if they developed evidence on the issue. A movant for reconsideration thus faces a steeper uphill challenge when the prior ruling was on a criminal suppression motion, class certification motion, or preliminary injunction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   than when the prior ruling is, e.g., a short discovery ruling. The Court should also look, not to the overall thoroughness of the prior ruling, but to the thoroughness with which the Court addressed the exact point or points that the motion to reconsider challenges. A movant for reconsideration thus faces an easier task when he or she files a targeted, narrow-in-scope motion asking the Court to reconsider a small, discrete portion of its prior ruling than when he or she files a broad motion to reconsider that rehashes the same arguments from the first motion, and essentially asks the Court to grant the movant a mulligan on its earlier failure to present persuasive argument and evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Second, the Court should consider the case's overall progress and posture, the motion for reconsideration's timeliness relative to the ruling it challenges, and any direct evidence the parties may produce, and use those factors to assess the degree of reasonable reliance the opposing party has placed in the Court's prior ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18B Charles Alan Wright, et al,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice &amp; Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4478.1 (2d ed.) (\"Stability becomes increasingly important as the proceeding nears final disposition .... Reopening should be permitted, however, only on terms that protect against reliance on the earlier ruling.\"). For example, if a defendant (i) spends tens of thousands of dollars removing legacy computer hardware from long-term storage; then (ii) obtains a protective order in which the Court decides that the defendant need not produce the hardware in discovery; then (iii) returns the hardware to long-term\n   storage, sustaining thousands more in expenses; and (iv) several months pass, then the plaintiffs should face a higher burden in moving the Court to reconsider its prior ruling that they faced in fighting the motion for protective order the first time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Third, the Court should consider the\n   <em>\n    Servants of the Paraclete v. Does\n   </em>\n   grounds. The Court should be more inclined to grant motions for reconsideration if the movant presents (i) new controlling authority -- especially if the new authority overrules prior law or sets forth an entirely new analytical framework; (ii) new evidence -- especially if the movant has a good reason why the evidence was not presented the first time around; or (iii) a clear indication -- one that manifests itself without the need for in-depth analysis or review of the facts -- that the Court erred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   These three factors should influence the degree to which the Court restricts its review of a prior ruling, but they do not necessarily mean that the Court should always apply a deferential standard of review. The Court should pause before applying a standard of review to its own interlocutory orders that is more deferential than the standard that the Court of Appeals will apply to it, unless the Court concludes that the alleged error in the prior ruling was harmless, or the party moving for reconsideration waived their right to appeal the alleged error by not raising the appropriate argument. Even in circumstances where the Court concludes that it is insulated from reversal on appeal, there are principled reasons for applying a de novo standard. After all, if the Court was wrong in its earlier decision, then, generally speaking, it is unjust to maintain that result -- although the Court should weigh this injustice against any injustice that would result from upending the parties' reliance on the earlier ruling, which is the balancing test that the three factors above represent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   What the Court means by \"restricting its review\" is less about applying a deferential standard of review -- although that may be appropriate in some circumstances -- and more about reducing (i) the depth of the Court's analysis the second time around -- thus conserving judicial resources; and (ii) the impositions that relitigation of the prior ruling will impose on the party opposing the motion for reconsideration. The Court should consider the time and expense that the party opposing reconsideration spent in winning the earlier ruling, and should try to prevent that party from having to bear the same impositions again. Basically, even if the Court ultimately analyzes a motion to reconsider under the same standard that it analyzed the motion that produces the earlier ruling, it should analyze the motion in a different way -- one focused on reducing the litigation burdens of the party opposing reconsideration. For example, when a party moves the Court for a preliminary injunction, standard practice is that the Court holds an evidentiary hearing as a matter of course, regardless whether it looks as if the party has a good chance of prevailing. If the party loses and the Court denies the injunction, however, and the party moves for reconsideration, the party should not be entitled to the presumption of an evidentiary hearing merely because he or she received that presumption the first time the Court considered the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   In light of these statements, it is perhaps better to characterize the increased burden that a movant for reconsideration faces as one of production, and not of persuasion. The Court analyzes motions to reconsider by picking up where it left off in the prior ruling -- not by starting anew. Parties opposing reconsideration can do the same, and they may stand on whatever evidence and argument they used to win the earlier ruling. Movants for reconsideration, on the other hand, carry the\n   full burden of production: they must persuade the Court, using only the evidence and argument they put before it, that it should change its prior ruling; they must do all of the legwork, and not rely on the Court to do any supplemental fact-finding or legal research; and they must convincingly refute both the counterarguments and evidence that the opposing party used to win the prior ruling and any new arguments and evidence that the opposing party produces while opposing the motion to reconsider. Unlike the motion that produced the prior ruling, a motion to reconsider is not -- and is not supposed to be -- a fair fight procedurally. The deck is stacked against a movant for reconsideration, and if such a movant hopes to prevail, he or she must have not only a winning legal position, but the work ethic and tenacity to single-handedly lead the Court to his or her way of thinking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.M. v.

In sum, the Supreme Court of New Mexico has never stated that any provision exempting any claim from arbitration is central to the arbitration scheme; rather, as in\n   <em>\n    Cordova\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of New Mexico has carefully considered which claims the drafting party has attempted to exempt from arbitration, and whether those are the most likely claims the parties might bring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Here, the Arbitration Agreement states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, the Company may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief to enforce the Employee's obligations with respect to the confidentiality and protection of trade secrets and other non-public information belonging to the Company, or with respect to any non-competition, non-solicitation, or any other restrictive covenant provisions in any separate agreement between the Company and the Employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Arbitration Agreement at 4.

Patterson may, in other words, approach an agency to represent his interests in litigation.

Patterson and Nine Energy both formally agree to submit virtually all possible claims to arbitration, Patterson may litigate other claims through a federal, state, or local agency, and the only claims Nine Energy reserved to itself in the unilateral carve-out provision are unrelated to the parties' employment relationship. By severing the unilateral carve-out provision, the parties are left with an agreement still mutually binding them to arbitration, and by which Patterson still enjoys the right to litigate certain claims in the courts.

First, the issue of arbitrability does not involve propositions of New Mexico law that may be determinative of the matter before the Court. Even if the Court got the arbitration issue wrong, the entire case remains to be decided by someone. The issue is not a case \"determinative\" issue. Arbitration is a procedural issue, and not a decision on the merits. All the merits issues remain in the case, regardless of who decides them. Also, the Court is merely staying the case and not dismissing it. There may be other issues with which the Court has to deal. The Court may have to enter a judgment adopting or interpreting the arbitration award. Finally, the Court will have to dismiss the case at some point. This case is a long way from being over, and the Court cannot soundly say the arbitration issue before it is determinative. Second, there are controlling precedents from the New Mexico appellate court. It is true that there is not an on-point, factually identical case from the Supreme Court of New Mexico. But there are controlling appellate cases. The Court has worked hard to fairly and faithfully interpret and apply the controlling appellate New Mexico precedent, following Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent, which gave courts the duty to predict how the state's supreme court will rule on an issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stoner v.

He uses the term \"motion to reconsider\" as an umbrella term that can encompass three distinct motions: (i) motions to reconsider an interlocutory order, which no set standard governs, save that the district court must decide them \"before the entry of ... judgment,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) ; (ii) motions to reconsider a judgment made within twenty-eight days of the entry of judgment, which the\n    <em>\n     Servants of the Paraclete v. Does\n    </em>\n    standard governs; and (iii) motions to reconsider a judgment made more than twenty-eight days after the entry of judgment, which rule 60(b) governs. There is arguably a fourth standard for motions to reconsider filed more than a year after the entry of judgment, as three of the rule 60(b) grounds for relief expire at that point. Much confusion could be avoided by using the term \"motion to reconsider\" exclusively to refer to the first category, \"motion to amend or alter the judgment\" exclusively to refer to the second category, and \"motion for relief from judgment\" exclusively to refer to the third category (and arguable fourth category). These are the terms that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure -- and other Circuits -- use to describe (ii) and (iii). The Court agrees with Judge Kelly -- and all he likely meant by using motion to reconsider as an umbrella term is -- that, if a party submits a motion captioned as a \"motion to reconsider\" after an entry of final judgment, the court should evaluate it under rule 59(e) or 60(b), as appropriate, rather than rejecting it as untimely or inappropriate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-254\">\n    The Court typically makes findings of fact and conclusions of law in ruling on these motions.

The motion may accompany a motion for a new trial under Rule 59.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-256\">\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(b). This rule appears to limit motions to reconsider orders with findings of fact and conclusions of law to twenty-eight days. The rule's use of the term \"entry of judgment,\" its reference to rule 59, and its adoption of the same time period that applies to motions to alter or amend a judgment, all lead the Court to conclude, however, that rule 52(b) -- and its twenty-eight-day time limit -- does not apply to interlocutory orders. The time limit applies only to findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting a case-ending judgment -- such as those entered after a bench trial -- and to those giving rise to an interlocutory appeal that, if filed, divests the district court of its jurisdiction -- such as those entered in support of a preliminary injunction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
