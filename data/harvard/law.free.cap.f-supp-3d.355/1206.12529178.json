Hyundai further takes issue with Commerce's reliance on \"mere notations on internal correspondence, rather than documents exchanged with the unaffiliated customer\" as evidence of service-related revenue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. It argues that Hyundai provided complete responses to the agency's requests for information; its responses were reasonable and informed by Commerce's conclusion in the original investigation; and Commerce verified and approved of Hyundai's reporting in the Issues and Decision Memorandum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-12.

The Government further argues that Commerce did not have an obligation to comply with \u00a7 1677m(d) because the agency was not aware of the deficiencies in Hyundai's reporting until it discovered the underlying information evincing Hyundai's misreporting for the first time at verification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.

Moreover, the Government points out that Hyundai does not dispute that it had access to the information Commerce initially requested and that it failed to provide that information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.

There was no dispute that the use of the cap was appropriate to reflect service revenues negotiated between Hyosung and its customers. That is not the case with respect to certain of Hyundai's service-related revenues that are only reflected in internal documentation. Here, the inquiry is whether Commerce may rely on internal company communications, rather than documentation or communications shared with the unaffiliated customer, to determine that there is separate service-related revenue to cap. The court concludes that it may not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In the third administrative review of LPTs from Korea, also under review by this court, Commerce relied on purchase orders and invoices exchanged with the unaffiliated customer to conclude that the separate line items in those documents demonstrated that the services were negotiable.\n   <em>\n    Hyundai Heavy Indus., Co.

This is consistent with the position articulated by the agency in the Remand Results here - that it \"decline[s] to treat service-related revenue as an addition to U.S. price under [ 19 U.S.C. \u00a7] 1677a(c)(1)... or as a price adjustment under 19 [C.F.R. \u00a7] 351.102(b)(38).\" Remand Results at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   While the agency is correct that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1) does not provide for an addition to export price or CEP for service-related profits (when the service-related revenues exceed the service-related expenses), \u00a7 1677a(c)(2) likewise does not provide for a reduction to export price or CEP to account for any service-related profit that may inure to the producer or exporter in the course of the transaction. Thus, the agency has correctly (at times) identified the issue as whether record documentation establishes that the cost of the services (and thus any profit garnered from the provision of those services) was separately negotiable and, therefore, may be excluded from the export price or CEP and whether substantial evidence supports that exclusion. When substantial evidence does not support a finding that the cost of the services was separately negotiable from the price of the subject merchandise, the agency is without legal authority to reduce export price or CEP except by the amount of the expense in question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As noted above, in the case of certain U.S. sales, Commerce relied on Hyundai's internal corporate communications and transactions with its affiliate to apply its capping methodology (and fault Hyundai for failing to report this information, which Commerce deemed \"necessary\" to apply its capping methodology). Remand Results at 22-24. Such internal communications, however, do not provide substantial evidence to support a finding that Hyundai's provision of the services in question was separately negotiable with the unaffiliated customer. In the absence of such evidence, the Government has not articulated any legal basis for Commerce to reduce Hyundai's gross unit price.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Thus, the court finds that substantial evidence supports Commerce's application of its capping methodology with respect to those transactions for which Commerce identified communications (e.g., purchase orders and invoices) between Hyundai and its unaffiliated customers indicating that the provision of those services may reasonably have been separately negotiable. Relatedly, substantial evidence supports Commerce's finding that Hyundai failed to provide information necessary for Commerce to apply its capping methodology with respect to those same transactions. Substantial evidence does not support Commerce's application of its capping methodology to those transactions or services for which Commerce relied only on internal communications among Hyundai employees or affiliates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Hyundai's arguments challenging Commerce's findings that are supported by substantial evidence are unavailing.

Hyundai's Cmts. at 12-14. The Government argues that Commerce did not have an obligation to comply with \u00a7 1677m(d) because the agency was not aware of the deficiencies in Hyundai's reporting until the underlying information was provided at verification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Cmts. at 17 (citing\n   <em>\n    Branco Peres Citrus, S.A. v.

ABB argues that the provisions of \u00a7 1677m(d) only apply when the requirements of \u00a7 1677m(e) have been satisfied and, in this case, the information in Hyundai's questionnaire responses did not satisfy the conditions of \u00a7 1677m(e).

Inherent in the requirement of \u00a7 1677m(d) is a finding that Commerce was or should have been aware of the deficiency in the questionnaire response. When a respondent provides seemingly complete, albeit completely inaccurate, information, \u00a7 1677m(d) does not require Commerce to issue a supplemental questionnaire seeking assurances that the initial response was complete and accurate. In other words, Commerce is not obligated to issue a supplemental questionnaire to the effect of, \"Are you sure?\" That is the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Hyundai provided a seemingly complete response to Commerce's initial questionnaire, and responded to Commerce's supplemental questionnaire stating that it separately reported service-related revenues and expenses consistent with the original investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sec.
