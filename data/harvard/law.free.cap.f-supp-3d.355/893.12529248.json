(Doc. 16.) For the following reasons, the Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The First Amended Complaint contains the following allegations: at all relevant times, Plaintiff Deena Stoker was covered under a group long-term disability (\"LTD\") insurance plan issued by Defendant Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (\"Hartford\") and governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"). (Doc. 11, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8.) Plaintiff became disabled in 2009 due to multiple psychiatric conditions following the passing of her only child. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff filed a claim for LTD benefits, which Hartford approved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Hartford paid Plaintiff LTD benefits for twenty-four months based on a finding that she was unable to perform the duties of her \"Own Job,\" and for several years thereafter based on a finding that she was unable to perform the duties of \"Any Job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.) During this period, Plaintiff was awarded Social Security Disability Income due to her disabling psychiatric conditions, and Hartford considered offering Plaintiff a lump sum settlement, which it does only when it believes the claimant is totally and permanently disabled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2017, Hartford requested that Plaintiff's attending psychiatrist, Dr. Dawn Gunter, complete an \"Attending Physician's Statement - Progress Report\" (\"APS\") regarding Plaintiff's disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Dr. Gunter completed and faxed the APS to Hartford on June 7, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) In the APS, Dr. Gunter reported that Plaintiff's condition was \"unchanged\" and that Plaintiff was \"currently unable to work due to a severe depression and co-morbid panic disorder.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August 2017, Hartford sent Dr. Gunter a letter containing several questions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) On September 27, 2017, Dr. Gunter responded that although Plaintiff had periods where she felt better, Plaintiff had not yet returned to baseline functioning or demonstrated \"continuous stability,\" and Plaintiff's diagnoses of major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder made her unable to resume work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a report dated September 27, 2017, a psychiatrist retained by Hartford, Dr. Christina Conciatori-Vaglica, opined that Plaintiff had no psychiatric restrictions or limitations that would impede her ability to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Dr. Conciatori-Vaglica did not examine Plaintiff, but instead based her opinion on a paper-only review that did not address Dr. Gunter's June 2017 APS or September 2017 responses to Hartford's questions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.) Dr. Conciatori-Vaglica disagreed with Dr. Gunter's psychiatric\n   restrictions because there was subjective evidence of improvement in symptoms during Plaintiff's medical appointments, and there was no \"objective evidence\" of symptoms that would indicate \"a severe, incapacitating psychiatric impairment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) The LTD plan requires neither \"objective evidence\" nor \"a severe, incapacitating psychiatric impairment\" to support a disability claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 17, 2017, Hartford terminated Plaintiff's LTD benefits based solely on the opinion of Dr. Conciatori-Vaglica. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.) In the termination letter, Hartford falsely claimed that, in reaching its decision, \"[a]ll the information in your file was reviewed as a whole.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) In February 2018, Plaintiff decompensated, attempted suicide by overdosing on prescription medications, and was committed for inpatient psychiatric care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) These events were proximately caused by Hartford's breaches of its fiduciary obligations to Plaintiff and resulted in damages separate and distinct from the loss of LTD benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 30, 2018, Plaintiff timely appealed Hartford's decision to terminate her LTD benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Plaintiff included in her appeal a comprehensive psychometric evaluation by Dr. Hector Barillas, who opined that Plaintiff is unable to work in any full-time occupation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) Plaintiff also included a letter from Dr. Gunter, who reiterated Plaintiff's diagnoses, opined \"[t]o a reasonable degree of psychiatric certainty\" that Plaintiff is unemployable, and criticized Hartford's decision to terminate benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) Dr. Gunter also disputed Dr. Conciatori-Vaglica's opinion that Plaintiff is not disabled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Gunter pointed out that Dr. Conciatori-Vaglica did not examine Plaintiff; did not address the June 2017 APS or September 2017 responses to Hartford's questions; selectively quoted treatment notes suggesting Plaintiff had recovered and ignored information supporting Plaintiff's claim, which was especially egregious because Plaintiff was below baseline functioning even during the periods of improvement; and erroneously assumed that because Plaintiff does not have a brain injury, dementia, or psychosis, that she is fine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After receiving Plaintiff's appeal, Hartford sent Plaintiff's claim to Dr. Mohsin Qayyum, who had never examined Plaintiff, for another paper-only review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.) Dr. Qayyum opined that Plaintiff was not disabled from October 18, 2017, the day after Hartford terminated her benefits, until her February 2018 hospitalization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Dr. Qayyum discounted the findings expressed in Dr. Gunter's June 2017 APS and September 2017 responses to Hartford's questions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Dr. Qayyum claimed to have called Dr. Gunter's office three times and left messages \"with the front desk,\" but his reported call times would have been after hours, and thus Dr. Qayyum could not have reached the front desk to leave a message. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-59.) Dr. Gunter's office did not receive three messages from Dr. Qayyum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By letter dated June 13, 2018, Hartford upheld its decision terminating Plaintiff's benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) The decision was based on the opinions of Dr. Qayyum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On July 6, 2018, Plaintiff submitted a second letter from Dr. Gunter, responding to Dr. Qayyum's review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) Dr. Gunter reiterated her opinion that Plaintiff is unemployable and expressed outrage over Hartford's decision to terminate benefits based on the opinions of non-examining physicians. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Dr. Gunter planned to recommend that Plaintiff report both Dr. Conciatori-Vaglica and Dr. Qayyum to their respective medical boards for malpractice and that Plaintiff report Hartford\n   to the Arizona insurance department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In a cover letter sent with Dr. Gunter's letter, Plaintiff noted that Hartford had a fiduciary obligation to carefully consider Dr. Gunter's letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By letter dated July 11, 2018, Hartford refused to consider Dr. Gunter's response to Dr. Qayyum's review because there are no provisions for additional appeals or reopening the administrative record after a final appeal decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.) On July 17, 2018, Plaintiff sent Dr. Gunter's response to Hartford a second time, noting that Hartford had a fiduciary obligation to discharge its duties in the interest of plan beneficiaries and that failure to consider Dr. Gunter's response was a violation of ERISA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-70.) Hartford again refused to consider Dr. Gunter's letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Throughout the benefits-determination process, Plaintiff's correspondence was ignored. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134.) Additionally, Plaintiff was repeatedly and implicitly accused of lying about her disability and symptoms; subjected to rude, dismissive, irritated, and impatient Hartford employees despite her fragile psychiatric state; denied timely, accurate, and relevant information about her disability claim; and provided misstatements and misrepresentations concerning her medical records and own statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on the foregoing allegations, Plaintiff brings several claims. At issue here is her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED claim\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants move for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.

This contention is supported by many factual allegations, including that Plaintiff was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and insomnia, and that she suffered from neuropathy and chronic back pain. Plaintiff also alleges that Hartford was aware of her fragile psychiatric state. Accepting these allegations as true, whether Hartford's alleged conduct is sufficiently outrageous must be determined in view of Plaintiff's weakened emotional state. In other words, Hartford's conduct may be sufficiently outrageous as it pertains to Plaintiff, even if it would not offend a person of ordinary sensibilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mintz v. Bell Atl. Sys. Leasing Int'l Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490858\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/183/550/\">\n    183 Ariz. 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490858\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/183/550/\">\n    905 P.2d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1995) (\"[A] relevant factor in determining outrageousness is defendant's knowledge that plaintiff is particularly susceptible to emotional distress.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As described above, Plaintiff alleges that Hartford, through its employees, was rude, dismissive, irritated, and impatient; repeatedly and implicitly accused her of lying about her disability and committing insurance fraud; misstated and misrepresented her medical records and statements; ignored her correspondence; misled her into believing that her benefits would continue; and deliberately or recklessly terminated her benefits near the ten-year anniversary of her child's death. Taken as\n   true, Plaintiff was needlessly subjected to abusive and hostile behavior while suffering myriad psychiatric and physical symptoms. Although such conduct may not be sufficiently outrageous if directed at another person, viewed through the lens of Plaintiff's weakened emotional state, the Court finds that Hartford's alleged conduct can be classified as outrageous and extreme. At the least, reasonable minds can disagree as to whether Hartford's conduct is outrageous. This precludes the granting of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Hartford compares this case to\n   <em>\n    Haney v. ACE American Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV-13-02429-PHX-DGC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201230503\">\n    2014 WL 1230503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3 (D. Ariz. Mar. 25, 2014), where the district court granted a motion to dismiss an IIED claim relating to a worker's compensation claim.\n   <em>\n    Haney\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable for at least two reasons. First, the\n   <em>\n    Haney\n   </em>\n   plaintiff based her IIED claim entirely on the insurer's refusal to timely pay insurance benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Second, the district court did not specially evaluate the defendant's conduct due to a unique vulnerability of the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3. The IIED claim in this case, in contrast, does not appear to be based on the denial of benefits. Furthermore, because the Court must accept as true Plaintiff's allegation that she was especially susceptible to emotional distress, Hartford's conduct cannot be examined in the same manner as the\n   <em>\n    Haney\n   </em>\n   defendant's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 16) is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that, within\n   <strong>\n    10 days\n   </strong>\n   of the date this Order is docketed, Defendant shall file its answer to the First Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
