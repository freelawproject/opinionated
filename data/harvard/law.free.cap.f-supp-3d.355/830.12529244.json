Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and either a nationwide class or a series of subclasses, assert statutory and common law claims. Defendant has filed a Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. 52.) Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint alleges the following facts, all of which are construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff and deemed as true for purposes of this Order. Defendant markets and sells hunting, fishing, and outdoor gear on its website and at eighty-two retail stores across the United States and Canada. (Doc. 47, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) It conducts an annual event called the Spring Fishing Classic, (\"the Classic\"), during which it offers seminars and demonstrations and runs sales on merchandise. (Doc. 47, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.) Defendant distributes marketing materials for the Classic via mail, broadcast media, and the internet. (Doc. 47, \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the 2018 Classic, one of the items Defendant advertised for sale was the rod/reel combo. (Doc. 47, \u00b6\u00b6 32-34.) The advertisement did not state that rainchecks would not be offered or that supplies were limited, and Plaintiffs allege that Defendant knew that it had an insufficient number of rod/reel combos to satisfy expected demand. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 47, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 48-49, 51-53, 55-59.) Defendant also refused to allow customers to buy the rod and reel separately at the sale price or permit any substitutions. (Doc. 47, \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs went to Defendant's retail establishments to purchase the rod/reel combo but could not do so because Defendant had none in stock. They made other purchases at Defendant's stores, although they do not allege what product(s) they purchased. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 47, \u00b6 82.) They bring this suit on behalf of themselves and a class of other consumers who (1) received the advertisement for the rod/reel combo, (2) were unable to purchase the rod/reel combo, and (3) purchased something else from Defendant. The Second Amended Complaint asserts the following claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Count I Violation of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Count II Violation of the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Count III Unjust Enrichment\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Count IV Violation of consumer protection statutes in other states\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Count V Fraud\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant contends that Plaintiffs' individual claims (Counts I, II, III and V) must be dismissed for failure to state a claim, and that Count IV should be dismissed for lack of standing. Plaintiffs argue that their individual claims are legally viable so none of the five counts should be dismissed. The Court resolves the parties' arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Ct. App. 1984). In certain circumstances, private individuals may also assert claims under the MMPA. To state a private cause of action under the MMPA a plaintiff must show that (1) he purchased merchandise; (2) he purchased the merchandise for personal, family, or household use; (3) he suffered an ascertainable loss; and (4) the ascertainable loss was caused by a violation of the MMPA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20407.025.1\">\n    Mo.

The Court begins by briefly discussing the first element because it sets the framework for the rest of the analysis. \"By the language of \u00a7 407.025, the legislature provided a cause of action for one who purchases, not one who attempts or offers to purchase.... One who attempts to purchase, but who never receives the goods or services nor pays anything of value cannot be said to have suffered damage by reason of any unlawful practice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11758739\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/664/675/#p677\">\n    664 S.W.2d at 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs do not deny that they are required to have consummated a transaction. They also do not deny that they did not purchase the rod/reel combo; indeed, the entire premise of their lawsuit is that they were unable to do so. They instead contend that they have satisfied the first element by alleging that they purchased\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   merchandise. However, by relying on the purchase of other merchandise, Plaintiffs are unable to establish the other elements for an MMPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, Plaintiffs do not allege a sufficient connection between their transactions and the alleged MMPA violation. \"The use of an unlawful practice is a violation of the MMPA whether committed before, during or after the sale,\n   <em>\n    so long as it was made 'in connection with' the sale.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Conway v.

The need for a causal connection between the alleged violation and the transaction is buttressed by the statute, which provides a private right of action to anyone who engages in a transaction \"\n   <em>\n    and thereby suffers\n   </em>\n   an ascertainable loss ...\n   <em>\n    as a result of\n   </em>\n   \" a violation of the MMPA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20407.025.1\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 407.025.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Plaintiffs generally allege that Defendant intended to increase the number of customers in its stores and on its website, and thereby increase its sales.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, even if this is true, this does not establish a sufficient connection between Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    transactions\n   </em>\n   and the MMPA violation. Plaintiffs either (1) went to Defendant's store intending to buy the rod/reel combo and other goods or (2) went to Defendant's store and once there saw other goods they wished to purchase. Either way Plaintiffs had reasons for buying merchandise that were independent of the MMPA violation, and the fact that those decisions were independent means that their transactions were not connected to the MMPA violation - or at least, not sufficiently connected to permit a private claim for the violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Raster v. Ameristar Casinos, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945504\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/280/120/\">\n    280 S.W.3d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. Ct. App. 2009), which they describe as holding that the plaintiff in that case could \"state[ ] a claim under the MMPA, even though the plaintiff purchased something other than what the casino advertised.\" (Doc. 63, p. 7.) The Court does not agree with this interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Raster\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   In that case, a casino established a compensation program that awarded points based on the volume of the customer's betting activity, and those points could be redeemed for cash, food, and other benefits.\n   <em>\n    Raster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945504\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/280/120/\">\n    280 S.W.3d at 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The casino changed the program by, among other things, retroactively changing the number of points required to earn cash and other benefits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945504\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/280/120/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945504\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/280/120/\">\n    at 123-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff alleged that these changes violated the MMPA and the casino argued, among other things, that the plaintiff had not made a purchase. The Missouri Court of Appeals held that a \"casino player, by dropping a token into the machine, is purchasing the intangible chance of winning or, in other words, the intangible right to a product upon the happening of certain conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945504\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/280/120/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945504\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/280/120/\">\n    at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, this decision does not aid Plaintiffs because the casino's alleged MMPA violation was connected to the plaintiff's bet; specifically, placement of a bet (the purchase) also earned the plaintiff points under the compensation program, and the casino allegedly violated the MMPA by retroactively changing the program's terms. In contrast, Plaintiffs' do not allege that there was anything deceptive,\n   fraudulent, or unfair about the transaction that actually occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint also does not establish that Plaintiffs suffered an ascertainable loss as a result of the alleged MMPA violation. \"A plaintiff adequately pleads this element of an MMPA claim if he alleges an ascertainable loss under the benefit-of-the-bargain rule, which compares the actual value of the item to the value of the item if it had been as represented at the time of the transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

App. 1994) (citing\n   <em>\n    Heberer v. Shell Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9970709\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/744/441/#p443\">\n    744 S.W.2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 443 (Mo. banc 1988) ). Plaintiffs do not contend that they failed to receive the benefits they bargained for in the transactions that they consummated with Defendant. Instead, they elide this requirement by suggesting that they may have \"purchas[ed] merchandise they only became inclined to buy because they were standing in [Defendant's] store being bombarded by merchandising messaging.\" (Doc. 63, p. 10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Second Amended Complaint does not allege that Defendant engaged in any tactics that coerced them into buying goods, or that Defendant otherwise overbore their will. Even now, Plaintiffs do not allege that they do not want the goods that they purchased. Finally, and most importantly - Plaintiffs' argument does not establish that they failed to receive the benefit of the transactions that occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs alternatively argue that they suffered ascertainable loss because their vehicles consumed fuel and incurred wear and tear when they drove to Defendant's store. Plaintiffs offer no legal authority suggesting that this can constitute ascertainable loss within the meaning of the MMPA, and given the Missouri cases equating \"ascertainable loss\" with the \"benefit of the bargain\" rule, the Court does not believe this theory is viable. Moreover, this \"loss\" is not connected to Plaintiffs' transactions with Defendant, as demonstrated by the fact that such costs would have been incurred by anyone driving to the store regardless of whether they purchased anything; accepting this theory would make the existence of a coincidental transaction sufficient and undermine the requirement that a transaction occur.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the Court is not persuaded that these expenses constitute losses. Plaintiffs allege that they bought other goods from Defendant, and as discussed earlier one of two things is true: either they bought (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   something that they planned to buy before going to Defendant's store, or (2) something that they saw while in the store. In the former situation, Plaintiffs would have incurred fuel costs in order to get to the store to buy the other item(s) they intended to purchase. In the latter situation, Plaintiffs engaged in a transaction to buy something that they desired, and there is no suggestion that their decisions were involuntary or that Defendant engaged in prohibited conduct in connection with those transactions. Thus, Plaintiffs' fuel costs are incidental to a transaction that they desired to enter and are not properly considered damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court's discussion does not mean that Defendant did not violate the MMPA; given the procedural posture the Court has assumed that a violation existed. The Court's discussion also does not mean that such a violation is incapable of being remedied; as stated earlier, the Attorney General can enforce the MMPA, and the Attorney General's enforcement power does not depend on the existence of a transaction or ascertainable damage, much less a connection between the MMPA violation and the transaction and damage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, these are requirements for a private action. Plaintiffs purchased merchandise from Defendant, but there is an insufficient nexus between the alleged MMPA violation and the transactions. Moreover, they have not suffered an ascertainable loss because they received the benefit of their bargains and the losses they allege are not related to their transactions. For these reasons, Count I fails to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Count II - The Arizona Consumer Fraud Act\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Arizona Consumer Fraud Act, (\"the ACFA\"), is similar to the MMPA in that it provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The act, use or employment by any person of any deception, deceptive or unfair act or practice, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely on such concealment, suppression or omission, in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby, is declared to be an unlawful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2044-1522\">\n    Ariz.

The ACFA does not explicitly create a private right of action, but the Arizona Supreme Court, relying on \u00a7 44-1533 of the Arizona statutes, held that the ACFA \"contemplates that a person who has been damaged by the practices declared to be unlawful may exert a claim by reason of such acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Sellinger v.

Thus, for instance, if a plaintiff paid money for a cooler, he received a cooler and Defendant's retention of the purchase price is not unjust. Plaintiffs do not dispute this point; instead, they argue that being lured (no pun intended) into the store conferred a benefit on Defendant, and that this benefit was unjust. However, Plaintiffs' presence in the store was a benefit to Defendant only because it culminated in a business transaction - so Plaintiffs' theory is still ultimately based on voluntary transactions in which both parties received the benefits that they anticipated and bargained for. And, because the parties received the benefits they bargained for, there is no unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs also argue that they did not receive the \"benefit\" that they intended to receive, which was a discounted price on the rod/reel combo. However, Plaintiffs did not pay anything for a rod/reel combo, nor did they provide any benefit to Defendant to receive the rod/reel combo (other than, as stated, a completely different transaction, which equally benefitted Plaintiffs). The facts alleged simply do not support an unjust enrichment claim under Missouri or Arizona law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.
