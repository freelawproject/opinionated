HAZEL, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On March 1, 2001, after a devastating earthquake that killed 1,100 people and displaced another 1.3 million, the Bush Administration designated El Salvador for \"Temporary Protected Status,\" (TPS), a status that permits eligible nationals living in the United States at the time of the designation to lawfully remain here and work for as long as the designation remains in place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since then, El Salvador has struggled to recover from this earthquake, enduring repeated natural disasters, persistent poverty, and low economic growth that have combined to prevent the country from fully rebuilding its infrastructure. Accordingly, El Salvador's protected status was extended eleven times between 2002 and 2016. It is estimated that 262,500 Salvadoran nationals are recipients of TPS residing in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In January 2018, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced that El Salvador's TPS designation would be terminated. In March 2018, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, alleging that the decision to terminate El Salvador's TPS was motivated not by a determination that the country no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation, but by President Donald Trump's anti-Latino immigrant animus. Plaintiffs assert claims pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause as incorporated\n   into the Fifth Amendment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

First, the text does not use the unambiguous and comprehensive language used in statutes courts have interpreted as broadly precluding judicial review. Second, the statutory scheme does not demand preclusion of the types of claims brought by Plaintiffs. Third, just as in\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   , the alternative methods of review of Plaintiffs' claims offered by the Department do not constitute meaningful review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, the statute states that \"[t]here is no judicial review of any determination\" of the Secretary. This language closely resembles the language found in\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Reno\n   </em>\n   not to constitute an absolute bar on judicial review, but instead to bar review of the merits of an individual determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201160\">\n    8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) (\"There shall be no administrative or judicial review of a determination ...\"); 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1255a(f)(1) (\"There shall be no administrative or judicial review of a determination ...\").

In\n   <em>\n    Cuozzo\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs' claims would have similarly exposed the Patent Office to unrestricted litigation challenging the Patent Office's power to revisit and revise earlier patent grants.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597964\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2131/#p2140\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2139-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But to allow Plaintiffs' constitutional and APA claims here will not similarly permit challenges to the merits of every determination\n   made by the Secretary. To permit judicial review of a claim that the Secretary's process was infected by unconstitutional discriminatory intent does not undermine the Secretary's general authority to make a determination of the merits of a country's eligibility for TPS.

To pursue these claims, individual plaintiffs would have to lose their protected status and then wait until they face removal before they may bring claims. Such a choice is \"tantamount to a complete denial of judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/#p491\">\n    498 U.S. at 496-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/#p491\">\n    111 S.Ct. 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting the same argument).\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   plainly forecloses this option.

To evaluate the plausibility of Plaintiffs' constitutional and APA claims, the Court need only determine whether a reasonable factfinder could determine that discriminatory intent infected the Secretary's process for terminating El Salvador's TPS. But the Secretary's actions are not, as Plaintiffs' suggest,\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   if her decision to terminate El Salvador's TPS was appropriately based on statutory factors. Plaintiffs' claims that the decision violated the INA would thus necessarily force the Court to evaluate the sufficiency of the Secretary's determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The text of \u00a7 1254a(b)(5)(A) bars judicial review of precisely this kind of determination. The primacy of the Secretary's authority to\n   designate country's for TPS precludes the Court from probing the sufficiency of the Secretary's determinations. Therefore, review of Plaintiffs' INA claim is unreviewable and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

This theory is coextensive with Plaintiffs' Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process theories, and survives for the same reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs allege the termination is arbitrary and capricious because DHS failed to conduct an objective assessment of the conditions in El Salvador.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93. In its opposition brief, they clarify the allegation that the Administration \"abruptly and without explanation departed from [earlier] practice by considering only whether the conditions that led to the original 2001 TPS designation continue to be met and ignoring the other statutory criteria the INA provides for TPS designation.\" ECF No. 33 at 31. Defendants ask the Court not to consider this argument, because it was not well-developed in the Complaint. But the Complaint need not detail every single theory Plaintiffs may advance, as long as the factual allegations are \"sufficient to support a meritorious legal claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Arar v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481788\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/559/#p594\">\n    585 F.3d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594 (2d Cir. 2009). When viewing the Secretary's justification for the termination in the Federal Register against prior justifications, and the Secretary's lack of an explanation for a changed approach, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that the termination is arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526259\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/321/1083/#p1101\">\n    321 F.Supp.3d at 1110-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that ongoing problems were considered in prior administrations' termination of TPS, but not here, and therefore plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged a new policy);\n   <em>\n    Centro Presente\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527247\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/332/393/#p407\">\n    332 F.Supp.3d at 416-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding plaintiffs plausibly alleged violation of the APA where a new policy was made and the agency showed no good reasons for the new policy);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs allege that the termination is arbitrary and capricious because DHS failed to consider the reliance interests of persons with protected status. This alleged reliance interest is rooted in the United States government's prior extensions of El Salvador's TPS while conditions in the country remained troubling. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 94. Even if such interests could be established-and the explicitly temporary nature of the program suggests they could not-nothing in the TPS statute requires the Secretary to consider any such interests in her determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1254a(b)(1). To accept this theory would require the Court to substitute its judgment for Congress' determination of the considerations the Secretary must take into account when designating or terminating a country for TPS. The Court declines to do so, and thus will not entertain this theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The President as Defendant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Finally, Defendants contend the President is not a proper Defendant due to the separation of powers concerns that would arise from a court enjoining the President. \"In general, 'this court has no jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the President in the performance of his official duties.' \"\n   <em>\n    Franklin v.

Defendants argue that an injunction issued against the\n   Secretary would be sufficient relief for the claims in this case. To this, Plaintiffs only respond that it is premature to determine whether this case is one of the rare ones demanding the Court enjoin the President directly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Centro Presente\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527247\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/332/393/#p407\">\n    332 F.Supp.3d at 418-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying motion to dismiss the President). Though ultimately, relief against the President himself is extraordinarily unlikely in this case, none of the authority cited by Defendants requires that the President be dismissed at this early stage.
