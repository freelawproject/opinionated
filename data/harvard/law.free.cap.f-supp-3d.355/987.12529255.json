[# 9 at \u00b6 2] As an OCA, Plaintiff is specially trained to assist inmates with serious disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and inmates who require hospice care. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] DRDC is a facility where many Colorado Department of Corrections (\"CDOC\") inmates are sent for serious medical procedures or end-of-life transitions. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At DRDC, Plaintiff began working at the infirmary and training with other OCAs as an \"OCA III.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3] The OCA III position is particularly advantageous because of the quality of work and the hourly wage, which is significantly higher than other positions within the CDOC. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Because Plaintiff's position was considered a \"facility needs\" job, Plaintiff was classified as a permanent resident at DRDC. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff was placed in the incentive unit, a desirable assignment due to superior living conditions, in recognition for his many years of good behavior. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 6, 2017, Plaintiff was informed by another inmate that Correctional Officer Houran had opened Plaintiff's mail, and displayed and laughed at photographs of Plaintiff's wife in lingerie. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5] Officer Houran had harassed Plaintiff since his arrival at DRDC, including calling Plaintiff a homophobic slur over a facility intercom. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9] Plaintiff reported the issue to two correctional officers, who reviewed the camera footage of Officer Houran delivering mail. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6] The officers informed Plaintiff that they would contact the shift commander about the incident, and apologized to Plaintiff for Officer Houran's misconduct. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 7, 2017, Lieutenant Marcie Chekush, who was Officer Houran's supervising officer, informed Plaintiff that she had heard about Officer Houran's misconduct, and noted that staff is not allowed to deliver mail when inmates are out of their cells. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8] A few days later, on April 10, 2017, Plaintiff again spoke with Lieutenant Chekush who informed Plaintiff that she would investigate the mail incident. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10] On that same day, Lieutenant Chekush contacted Officer Willard, Plaintiff's case manager, and requested that Plaintiff be removed from the facility\n   because he had complained about staff. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11] Lieutenant Chekush, Officer Willard, and Case Manager Shoaga, head supervisor for all DRDC case managers, discussed Plaintiff's complaints regarding Officer Houran and agreed that Plaintiff should be removed from the facility for complaining about Officer Houran.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12] Plaintiff discovered his transfer had been justified as a bed space reclassification, approved by Officers Willard and Shoaga, even though Plaintiff was immediately replaced by another OCA III who was transferred from SCF to DRDC.
