INTRODUCTION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before this court are two motions seeking dismissal of the Complaint filed by Plaintiff R. Alexander Acosta, the Secretary of the United States Department of Labor (the \"Secretary\"), asserting claims against Defendants under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). Both motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Bowers + Kubota Consulting, Inc. (the \"Company\") moves for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that the Company was improperly joined under Rule 19. ECF No. 26. This court denies the Company's Motion, concluding that the Company's joinder under Rule 19 is necessary and feasible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants Brian J. Bowers and Dexter C. Kubota move for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), arguing that the Complaint fails to sufficiently allege facts demonstrating that they had ERISA fiduciary liability or acted in violation of ERISA. Their motion is denied because the Complaint alleges sufficient facts to support the ERISA claims against Bowers and Kubota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 27, 2018, the Secretary filed a Complaint alleging that, on December 14, 2012, Nicholas L. Saakvitne, Bowers, and Kubota caused the Bowers + Kubota Consulting, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the \"ESOP\") to purchase the Company's shares for more than they were worth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. The Complaint\n   names six Defendants: (1) Saakvitne; (2) Saakvitne's law firm (\"Saakvitne Law Corporation\"); (3) Bowers; (4) Kubota; (5) the Company; and (6) the ESOP.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Complaint states that the Company and the ESOP are named as defendants \"pursuant to Rule 19(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure solely to assure that complete relief can be granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # s 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Secretary alleges the following facts in his Complaint. Bowers, the Company's President, and Kubota, its Vice President, owned the Company through their respective trusts.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 7. They met with an attorney in the summer of 2012 to discuss the creation of an ESOP to divest themselves of their ownership interests in the Company.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. In the fall of 2012, Bowers and Kubota provided information about the Company to the valuation firm Libra Valuation Associates (\"LVA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   LVA produced a preliminary appraisal report that put the Company's value between $37,090,000 and $41,620,000.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. LVA later produced an updated valuation report and a fairness opinion, both valuing the Company at $40,150,000.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Complaint alleges that these LVA valuation reports were flawed in several respects. For example, the reports applied a 30% control premium even though there would be no change in control of the Company, and they used unreasonable revenue projections that went far beyond the Company's historical average.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the meantime, Bowers, Kubota, and their attorney communicated with Saakvitne about appointing Saakvitne the trustee of the ESOP and about the pending sale of the Company.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. The Complaint alleges that, \"at the outset of Saakvitne's involvement with the transaction, [the attorney] emailed Saakvitne listing the price for a 100% sale of the Company as '40 million.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. It also alleges that \"Saakvitne met with Bowers and Kubota in Hawaii\" with a document that \"listed 'Valuation: Approx. 40 million' under the heading 'Basis of Deal - General.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9174678,7347878\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/400/774/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to the Complaint, on December 10, 2012, Bowers made an initial offer to Saakvitne to sell the Company's shares to the ESOP for $41 million, payable over 20 years at 10% interest.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   After negotiating for a day, Saakvitne, Bowers, and Kubota allegedly agreed that the ESOP would purchase the Company's shares for $40 million payable, over 25 years at 7% interest.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. On December 11, 2012, the ESOP was formed with a retroactive date of January 1, 2012, and Saakvitne was named as its trustee.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. On December 14, 2012, Saakvitne, Bowers, and Kubota allegedly caused the ESOP to purchase the Company's shares for $40 million dollars.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Complaint alleges that Saakvitne, Bowers, and Kubota \"did not carry out a meaningful review\" of the LVA valuation reports, which \"were obviously defective and significantly overvalued the shares of the Company,\" and that they knew or should have known that the reports \"should not have been relied upon to justify the ESOP transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 14. Bowers and Kubota allegedly provided unreasonable and inflated revenue projections to LVA, knowing that such projections were inaccurate, and allegedly failed to monitor Saakvitne to assure that he acted in the best interests of the ESOP's participants and beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Relying on these allegations, the Complaint asserts the following ERISA claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) Saakvitne, Saakvitne Law Corporation, Bowers, and Kubota failed to discharge fiduciary duties with care, skill, prudence, and diligence in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), (B), and (D) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (2) Bowers and Kubota are liable for breaches of fiduciary responsibilities by another fiduciary (\"co-fiduciary liability\") under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201105\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(3) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (3) Saakvitne, Saakvitne Law Corporation, Bowers, and Kubota engaged in prohibited transactions between a plan and a party in interest in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (4) Bowers and Kubota engaged in prohibited transactions between a plan and a fiduciary in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (5) Bowers and Kubota knowingly participated in a transaction prohibited by ERISA under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (6) Provisions of the ESOP documents are void for improperly indemnifying fiduciaries under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201110\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201110\">\n    at 15-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint may be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

That is, they had knowledge of Saakvitne's decision to allow the ESOP to purchase the Company's shares, allegedly without a proper valuation and at a price higher than the shares were worth. ECF No. 1, PageID # 21. According to the Complaint, Bowers and Kubota knew that $40 million was too high a price for the Company's shares for several reasons. For example, Bowers and Kubota allegedly knew that control of the Company would not change, yet they did not correct LVA's wrongful application of a 30% control premium to the valuation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-13. The Complaint alleges that, in spite of this knowledge, Bowers and Kubota proceeded to communicate the $40 million valuation to Saakvitne before hiring him as a trustee, and then participated in negotiations with Saakvitne before agreeing to sell their shares for $40 million.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Bowers and Kubota characterize the Secretary as \"argu[ing], without any supporting authority, that it is somehow illegal under ERISA for a seller to state his desired price.\" ECF No. 34, PageID # 386. This misstates the Secretary's claim. As the court understands it, the Secretary is not asserting that Bowers and Kubota knowingly participated in Saakvitne's breach merely by participating in the negotiations and hoping for a high sales price. Rather, the Secretary's claims are based on the allegation that Bowers and Kubota, knowing that Saakvitne had erroneous valuations for the Company, agreed to an overstated sales price. These allegations are sufficient to state a claim for nonfiduciary liability against Bowers and Kubota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Despite having allegedly had intimate involvement in the ESOP and the 2012 purchase, Bowers and Kubota argue that they should be presumed to be good faith sellers of the Company's shares because the shares had more than nominal value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7-1, PageID # s 74-76.

As explained above, the Complaint sufficiently alleges that Bowers and Kubota had the requisite knowledge given their knowledge of the errors in the LVA valuation reports and their subsequent communications with Saakvitne.
