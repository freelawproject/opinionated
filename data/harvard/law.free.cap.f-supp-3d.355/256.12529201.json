DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its Motions for Summary Judgment, Defendants argued that Plaintiffs lack standing, that the Court should not review evidence outside the administrative record to evaluate Plaintiffs' APA claims, and that, even considering extra-record evidence, no genuine disputes of material fact exist on the merits of Plaintiffs' claims and Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Defendants also oppose the\n   <em>\n    Kravitz\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File a Third Amended Complaint because they allege Plaintiffs acted with dilatory motive. Each of these arguments are addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Article III standing doctrine requires a plaintiff, as the party invoking the Court's jurisdiction, to establish three elements at trial: (1) a concrete and particularized injury-in-fact, either actual or imminent; (2) a causal connection between the injury and defendants' challenged conduct, such that the injury is \"fairly trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant\"; and (3) a likelihood that the injury suffered will be redressed by a favorable decision.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

At the summary judgment stage, Plaintiffs must \"set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts\" that support a finding\n   of standing, which the Court will view in the light most favorable to the non-movant, but which may be challenged at trial.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This Court previously concluded that Plaintiffs' Complaints included sufficient factual allegations for the Individual and Organizational Plaintiffs to meet the requirements of standing.

Now, the Individual Plaintiffs have supported their factual allegations-that a citizenship question is substantially likely to lead to a disproportionate undercount, harming Plaintiffs' communities by reducing their political power and federal funding-with evidence.

By a conservative estimate the citizenship question will reduce response rates to the 2020 Census among households with a noncitizen by 5.1 percentage points, relative to households with only U.S. citizens. ECF No. 70 (18-1041) at 774. Further, there is evidence that a citizenship question will cause a decline in responses by Hispanic households.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 629, 630, 724-25, 745;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 70-6 (18-1041) at 36, 75-76; ECF No. 70-1 (18-1041) at 8, 43. Additionally, Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Nancy Mathiowetz explains that a citizenship question is likely to lead to so-called roster omissions where, fearing the consequences of providing sensitive information about noncitizen household members, households respond to the Census questionnaire but conceal individual members. ECF No. 70-6 (18-1041) at 34, 73. Specifically, Dr. Mathiowetz writes: \"[i]n light of the empirical evidence concerning rostering errors, it is reasonable to estimate that rostering errors motivated by the addition of the citizenship question will be on the order of five percent and these rostering errors will impact both households with noncitizens as well as households with Hispanic members.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 73.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Defendants' argument that corrective measures will undisputedly remedy an undercount, ECF No. 67-1 (18-1041) at 16-18, is unconvincing at this stage. These corrective measures include non-response follow up (NRFU) with households that do not initially respond to the Census, attempts to contact a nearby proxy (i.e. neighbor or building manager), and use of administrative records to supplement data where households are nonresponsive. ECF No. 67-1 (18-1041) at 15-18. However, at the very least, it is disputed whether NRFU efforts will be successful because \"[t]hose refusing to self-respond due to the citizenship question are particularly likely to refuse to respond in NRFU as well,\" ECF No. 70 (18-1041) at 652, and NRFU cannot remedy expected roster omissions,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 862. Individuals choosing not to respond to the Census out of fear are not likely to be reassured by someone intrusively showing up at their homes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 652.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Defendants next argument, that the undisputed facts show an alleged undercount would not dilute Plaintiffs' votes or affect their communities' federal funding, is also flawed. To the contrary, evidence exists that the\n    <em>\n     Kravitz\n    </em>\n    Individual Plaintiffs will be harmed by a differential undercount through vote dilution and loss of federal funding.\n    <em>\n     E.g.,\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 70-2 (18-1041) at 12; ECF No. 70-3 (18-1041) at 11. Specifically, Plaintiffs point to an expert opinion that a differential undercount of noncitizens and Hispanics will lead to vote dilution from malapportionment of congressional seats in California, Texas, and Arizona. ECF No. 70-2 (18-1041) at 11. Plaintiffs' expert found that a disproportionate undercount will result in vote dilution from intra-state redistricting because states use Census data to draw districts of equal population.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 13. Further, Plaintiffs' experts opine that a disproportionate undercount will result in a loss of Medicaid, transportation, and Title I funding to Plaintiffs' communities.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 70-5 (18-1041) at 6, 12, 14-15; ECF No. 70-7 (18-1041) at 5-6, 11-14.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Because evidence exists to support the\n    <em>\n     Kravitz\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs' claim that a citizenship question will lead to a disproportionate undercount, vote dilution, and loss of funding, Defendants in that case are not entitled to summary judgment on standing's injury-in-fact element. Further, the\n    <em>\n     LUPE\n    </em>\n    Individual Plaintiffs point to essentially the same evidence discussed above to establish a substantial risk of a disproportionate undercount, differential vote dilution, and funding losses.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 85 at 11-17. Thus, the\n    <em>\n     LUPE\n    </em>\n    Individual Plaintiffs have also demonstrated that genuine disputes of material fact remain as to standing's injury requirement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <strong>\n     b.

ECF No. 67-1 (18-1041). But record evidence creates a dispute of fact as to this claim. ECF No. 70 (18-1041) at 862. Despite Defendants' contention that any respondent who is reluctant to answer a citizenship question will also be reluctant to respond to the Census if a citizenship question is not included, the Census Bureau's study shows that a citizenship question is likely to further depress\n    response rates among non-citizens and their relatives.

ECF No. 79 (18-1041) at 35. This argument that third-party decisions might prevent some of Plaintiffs' injuries is unavailing. First, it is purely speculative.

Ultimately, it is not necessary for the Court to decide whether extra-record evidence is admissible in order to determine if summary judgment is appropriate because the Administrative Record alone creates genuine disputes of material fact as to whether the decision to include the citizenship question was arbitrary and capricious. Nonetheless, as the Court ordered on December 19, 2018, the parties will be permitted to present evidence outside of the administrative record at trial, and the Defendants will be permitted to argue at the close of trial that such evidence should not be considered in the Court's final decision.

Months before the Secretary solicited DOJ to request citizenship data and the DOJ ultimately submitted that request, administration officials appear to have been in communication about adding a citizenship question for politically-motivated reasons different from those reflected in the Secretary's official memoranda. ECF No. 70 (18-1041) at 500-02, 582, 586-87. On March 10, 2017, Director of Policy and Strategic Planning Earl Comstock sent Secretary Ross an email with the subject line \"Your Question on the Census\" that alerted Ross that \"all people (citizens and noncitizens)\" are counted in the Census and included a 2010 opinion article titled \"the Pitfalls of Counting Illegal Immigrants.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 500-01. Comstock highlighted for Ross that \"[n]o major government survey, including the decennial census ... asks Americans about their citizenship status\" and that \"[m]any more foreign-born residents were counted in 2000 than was expected based on annual estimates produced by the bureau.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    This email, along with other evidence, at least raises a genuine dispute regarding whether the Secretary was interested in a citizenship question to depress response rates by non-citizens rather than to obtain an accurate enumeration of the population or even to support a DOJ request to assist in enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Secretary Ross's communications with Kris Kobach about adding a citizenship question further indicates that the Secretary's true motive may have been unrelated to the DOJ's request.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 582, 586-87.

However, there is, at the very least, a dispute as to whether any evidence supports the notion that a citizenship question would be an effective method for collecting the data that DOJ requested.

If, after submission of this report, the Secretary \"finds new circumstances exist which necessitate that the subjects, types of information, or questions contained in reports\" be modified, he or she must submit a new report describing these modifications. \u00a7 141(f)(3). Although congressional reporting requirements such as \u00a7 141(f) are typically not judicially reviewable,\n    <em>\n     see e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Guerrero v.

It is also non-sensical to assume as a matter of law that public statements alleged to have been made by the President regarding immigration had no bearing on the Secretary's decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Defendants also argue unsuccessfully that \"Plaintiffs fail to identify a protected class against which the Secretary allegedly discriminated.\"\n    <em>\n     LUPE\n    </em>\n    , ECF No. 89 (18-1570) at *11 n. 3. This argument fails because Plaintiffs point to evidence that inclusion of a citizenship question in the decennial Census is motivated by racial animus towards Hispanics and non-white immigrants. Specifically, as previously described in Section III.A.1, the evidence before the Secretary demonstrated that a citizenship question would depress response rates by Hispanic households, and as detailed in the Court's earlier opinion,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205885528\">\n     2018 WL 5885528\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *9, contemporary statements by those advising the Secretary support a finding of animus towards non-white immigrants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Ultimately, evidence supporting the\n    <em>\n     LUPE\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs' Equal Protection claim creates a genuine dispute of material fact, and Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on this count.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <strong>\n     E.\n     <em>\n      LUPE\n     </em>\n     Plaintiffs' Conspiracy to Violate Civil Rights Claim\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    An actionable conspiracy under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (3) requires \"an agreement or a 'meeting of the minds' by defendants to violate the claimant's constitutional rights.\"\n    <em>\n     Simmons v.

These same factual allegations have now been supported with evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    As previously discussed, Mr. Kobach's interest in a citizenship question stemmed from his view that states like California have had \"congressional seats inflated by counting illegal aliens.\" ECF No. 85-5 (18-1570) at 45;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Administrative Record (AR) 763-64.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, Mr. Kobach\n    was motivated to reduce immigrant response rates to achieve the unconstitutional goal of reducing their political power. Mr. Kobach pitched the citizenship question idea to administration officials beginning around January 2017.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205885528\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    In light of the evidence that the DOJ's voting-rights-act rationale was pretextual, the clearest indications about the Secretary's actual purpose come from the exchanges between Mr. Kobach and administration officials, Mr. Comstock's email response to the Secretary's question about the Census, and the contemporary statements by decisionmakers discussed at the Motion to Dismiss stage. Taken together, this evidence suggests that the Secretary's true purpose for adding a citizenship question was to depress noncitizen response rates. During the same period that Mr. Kobach pushed for a citizenship question, Earl Comstock responded to the Secretary's question about the Census with his email highlighting that undocumented residents are counted for Congressional apportionment and pointing the Secretary to a blog about the \"pitfalls of counting illegal immigrants.\" ECF No. 85-7 (18-1570) at 13-15.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Plaintiffs' demonstration of consistency between the Secretary's actual purpose and Mr. Kobach's articulated intent is not a mere showing of parallel conduct. Instead, the record allows for an inference that Mr. Kobach and administration officials achieved a \"meeting of the minds\" because it demonstrates coordination between Mr. Kobach, those advising the Secretary, and the Secretary. Over a period of months, Mr. Kobach spoke with Steve Bannon, President Trump, Secretary Ross, and Attorney General Sessions to persuade them to add a citizenship question for the express purpose of reducing the number of immigrant respondents.

Secretary Ross and Mr. Kobach spoke at the direction of Mr. Bannon before the Secretary generated the DOJ voting-rights-act rationale. ECF No. 85-5 (18-1570) at 53. After the Secretary communicated with Mr. Kobach about adding a citizenship question, he pursued creating the DOJ voting-rights-act rationale and worked to find someone at DOJ willing to make the request for a citizenship question.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 53, 58, 61, 79, 154-157,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n     103 S.Ct. 2856\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; ECF No. 85-7 at 12, 18, 19;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    AR 11646-49, 11634-45, 11193, 12476, 1277-85 1525-27, 2651-52.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    In sum, genuine disputes of material fact remain as to whether the requisite meeting of minds existed between Mr. Kobach and administration officials, and the\n    <em>\n     LUPE\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs \u00a7 1985 claim may proceed to trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <strong>\n     F.\n     <em>\n      Kravitz\n     </em>\n     Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File Third Amended Complaint\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Kravitz\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs wish to amend their Complaint to add an Equal Protection claim, which is substantively identical to the Equal Protection claim alleged by the\n    <em>\n     LUPE\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs.

However, Defendants oppose Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave because they claim that Plaintiffs acted with a dilatory motive when they waited until the Court had ruled on the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the\n    <em>\n     LUPE\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs' Equal Protection claim before requesting to amend their Complaint. ECF No. 77 (18-1041).

Both parties seek efficient resolution of the Plaintiffs' claims, and the addition of an Equal Protection claim to the\n    <em>\n     Kravitz\n    </em>\n    case will not cause any delay. As a result, Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File Third Amended Complaint, ECF No. 71, will be granted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court denied Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment in a separate order issued on December 19, 2018. A separate order will issue granting the\n    <em>\n     Kravitz\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-74\">\n     The Defendants' argument that the Court should disregard this estimate as unreliable is unconvincing. ECF No. 79 (18-1041) at 25. Dr. Mathiowetz's conclusion is consistent with deposition testimony by Defendants' expert Dr. Abowd that a citizenship question will cause at least an incremental increase in the number of households that respond to the census but do not provide a response for every member of the household. ECF No. 70 (18-1041) at 861. That consistency suggests that Dr. Mathiowetz's estimate should not be dismissed as plainly unreliable. Further, even if Dr. Mathiowetz's five percent estimate were excluded as evidence, the data she considered to arrive at this conclusion would not be. Thus, at the summary judgment stage, where evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant, Defendants cannot defeat the showing that roster omissions are likely to occur at a potentially significant rate. To be sure, a dispute may exist about the magnitude of the problem, but that dispute can only be resolved through the weighing of evidence-a step that the Court is precluded from taking at the summary judgment stage.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-75\">\n     Because there is substantial overlap between the arguments and evidence presented by the\n     <em>\n      Kravitz\n     </em>\n     and\n     <em>\n      LUPE\n     </em>\n     Plaintiffs in support of their Enumeration Clause and APA claims, the Court treats Plaintiffs arguments jointly in Section B and C and cites to the\n     <em>\n      Kravitz\n     </em>\n     Plaintiffs' docket entries.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-76\">\n     The CM/ECF citations in this section are to docket entries in the\n     <em>\n      Kravitz\n     </em>\n     (18-1041) case and are all references to the Administrative Record.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-77\">\n     Notably, the subject line of Mr. Kobach's email to the Secretary reads \"Follow up on our phone call,\" suggesting prior communication on this topic.

ECF No. 69 at 45-51. Just as noncompliance with congressional reporting requirements does not alone trigger an APA violation, violations of OMB statistical guidelines are not enough to demonstrate a \u00a7 706(2)(D) violation. However, as with evidence of the Secretary's failure to comply with congressional reporting instructions, evidence that the Secretary did not meet OMB or Census Bureau standards provides further support for Plaintiffs broader claim that the Secretary's final action was arbitrary and capricious.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"8\">\n    <p id=\"p-79\">\n     The CM/ECF citations in this section refer to docket entries in the\n     <em>\n      LUPE\n     </em>\n     , 18-1570 case.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"9\">\n    <p id=\"p-80\">\n     Although Defendants dispute the relevance of statements made by President Trump and other administration officials, they do not dispute the content of those statements.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     ECF No. 89 (18-1570) at 12-13.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"10\">\n    <p id=\"p-81\">\n     The Administrative Record was filed in the\n     <em>\n      Kravitz\n     </em>\n     case (18-1041), ECF Nos. 25 &amp; 26, and incorporated into the\n     <em>\n      LUPE\n     </em>\n     Plaintiffs' Opposition, ECF No. 85 (18-1570) at 11 n. 6.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
