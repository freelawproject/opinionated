(Doc. 5.) In September of 2018, the Army Corps of Engineers (\"Corps\") issued a combined environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact (Doc. 5-11) and granted Sea Island Acquisition, LLC\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a permit (Doc. 5-1). On October 31, 2018, Plaintiffs concurrently filed a complaint for declaratory judgment (Doc. 1) and the current motion for a preliminary injunction (Doc. 5). On November\n   19, 2018, Defendants filed a response. (Doc. 13.) The following day, Plaintiffs filed a motion asking the Court to expedite consideration of its motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. 15) and a reply to Defendants' response (Doc. 17). On November 21, 2018, Sea Island Acquisition filed a motion for a hearing to explain the harm it would suffer if the injunction were granted. (Doc. 19.) On November 30, 2018, Plaintiffs filed an amended motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction (Doc. 21) that did not offer any new arguments but supplied the Court with an updated photograph of the ongoing construction. Finally, on December 3, 2018, Defendants filed a response in opposition to Plaintiffs' amended motion. (Doc. 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion to expedite consideration (Doc. 15),\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Sea Island Acquisition's request for a hearing (Doc. 19), and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' amended motion (Doc. 21) because Plaintiffs ask for no new relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court now undertakes a decision on Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction (Doc. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sea Island Acquisition, LLC (\"Sea Island Acquisition\"), a private resort and real estate development company, desires to build a new development (the \"Development\") on Sea Island. To \"stabilize the eroding beach\" in front of the Development, Sea Island Acquisition sought permission to construct a T-head groin\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Proposed Groin\") immediately south of the Development. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 18, 2015 Public Notice, Doc. 13-3, at 1.) The Proposed Groin is south of two existing groins - one referred to as the \"Southern Groin\" and the other as the \"Northern Groin\" (collectively, \"Existing Groins\"). The application also sought authorization to construct dunes and renourish the beach between the Existing Groins and Proposed Groin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 18, 2015, the Corps published notice of the Project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Following the initial notice and comment period, two major hurricanes, Matthew and Irma, caused substantial damage to Sea Island. The storms severely eroded the beach face and many of the frontal dunes on the Spit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Southern Environmental Law Center (\"SELC\") May 23, 2018 Letter, Doc. 5-7, at 4; SELC Feb. 28, 2017 Letter, Doc. 5-8, at 21-22.) In light of these impacts, on March 6, 2018, Sea Island Acquisition submitted an addendum to its 2015 permit application seeking authorization to dredge between 1,315,000 and 2,500,000 cubic yards of sand from an offshore source and to renourish approximately 17,000 linear feet of beach on Sea Island. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mar. 20, 2018 Public Notice, Doc. 13-4, at 1-2, 16.) These changes increased the length of the\n   Project from 1,200 linear feet to approximately 17,000 linear feet, increased the proposed sand volume from 120,000 cubic yards to up to 2,500,000 cubic yards, proposed retrieving sand from the ocean instead of an onshore source, and proposed the use of hydraulic cutterhead dredges. (Permit SAS-2015-00742, Doc. 5-1, at 1;\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Dec. 18, 2015 Public Notice, Doc. 13-3, at 1-2,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Mar. 20, 2018 Public Notice, at 1-2.) Because the proposed changes were substantial, the Corps issued a new public notice, and Sea Island Acquisition submitted a supplementary biological assessment. (Mar. 20, 2018 Public Notice.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After reviewing the comments, the Corps, on September 12, 2018, issued a permit authorizing Sea Island Acquisition to (1) construct the Proposed Groin on the Spit, (2) dredge between 1,315,000 to 2,500,000 cubic yards of sand from an offshore source, and (3) renourish more than 17,000 linear feet of beach on Sea Island. (Permit SAS-2015-00742.) Concurrently, the Corps issued an environmental assessment (\"EA\") with a finding of no significant impact (\"FONSI\"). (Memo. for Rec. (\"MFR\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 5-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A district court has discretion over whether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction, but the discretion is not unbridled and must be exercised in light of the four prerequisites for granting the \"extraordinary relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Canal Auth. of the State of Fla. v.

Lastly, although preliminary injunctions may properly be granted in environmental litigation, they \"have been issued not merely because some impact upon the environment has been alleged, but because the threatened harm has been properly shown to be irreparable.... Indeed, where no irreparable injury is alleged and proved, denial of a preliminary injunction is appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Callaway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"208226\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/489/567/#p572\">\n    489 F.2d at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs are not substantially likely to succeed on the merits, and Plaintiffs will not suffer irreparable injury during the pendency of the suit. Although the balance of the harms and public interest prerequisites may favor granting the injunction, Plaintiffs fail to show all four prerequisites. Thus, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(MFR, at 40.) The Corps found alternative six to be outside the scope of the Project, thus not practicable, because it would not meet the overall Project purpose. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The purpose of the Project is to \"protect upland lots and development located along the shoreline of\n   Sea Island from storm damage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the Corps, there is no development upland along the shoreline covered by this alternative, nor could there be development because of the conservation easement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This is supported by Dr. Basco, who stated, \"There is a conservation easement that restricts any such development further south.\" (Dr. Basco Dep., Doc. 5-12, at 751:20-22.) Dr. Basco further stated, \"except to strengthen some very low regions where there[ is] a potential for breaching, there would be no reason for strengthening the dune\" further down the Spit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 752:4-9.) Thus, any storm protection provided by this alternative would not serve to protect any \"upland lots or development,\" making this alternative outside the overall Project purpose and, therefore, not practicable. (MFR, at 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Additionally, the Corps found that the storm protection provided by this alternative would be temporary, only lasting for a few months. (Dr. Basco Dep., at 722:17-21 (\"I only considered the concern of a beach nourishment project with no groin in which the beach nourishment project was only 1200 feet. And I immediately concluded that that was not economically feasible because it would not last more than a few months.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs also fault the Corps for failing to consider if beach nourishment would work if the nourishment project was extended to the southern tip of the Spit. (Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 12.) However, according to the MFR, the Supplemental Report of Dr. Webb acknowledged that even if the beach nourishment project were extended to almost a mile, the storm protection would still be temporary. (MFR, at 28.) Furthermore, the Corps stated that Dr. Kana opined that \"a project with such a short half-life is clearly not a practicable alternative when considering that the proposal would be outside the scope of the overall project purpose.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Importantly, the Corps also analyzed on-site alternatives four and five, which both involved beach nourishment without adding the Proposed Groin. On-site alternative four consisted of relocating the existing Southern Groin to the site of the Proposed Groin and renourishing the beach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.) The Corps found this to be a practicable alternative, but not the least damaging practicable alternative, because by removing the Southern Groin \"it is likely that it would result in the sand bypassing the southern end of Sea Island and potentially jetting the sand offshore and completely out of the sand[-]sharing system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43.) On-site alternative five consisted of removing the Southern Groin altogether and renourishing the beach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.) The Corps found this not to be a practicable alternative because \"without the [S]outhern [G]roin[,] any sand placed along the shoreline ... would disseminate downdrift quickly\" and result in only temporary storm protection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Long term, the result is \"erosion of a portion of the existing storm protection\" and \"adverse effects to sea turtles through erosion of nesting habitat.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although beach nourishment without a groin may be \"the most common configuration for beach nourishment projects in the United States\" (Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 11), the Corps had to analyze the Project in light of its purpose, intended long-term effects, and surroundings.

Applying the Eleventh Circuit's factors for determining whether an agency's decision not to prepare an EIS is arbitrary and capricious, the Corps accurately identified the relevant environmental concern, took a \"hard look\" at the problem in preparing the EA, and made a convincing case that adverse impacts noted by Plaintiffs were not significant. Thus, the Corps' decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   i. Increased Downdrift Erosion and Damage to the Spit\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs accurately state it is undisputed that the Existing Groins are trapping material (sand, silt, clay, etc.) that is naturally coming from the north and moving south. (Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 14-15.) The Corps does not dispute this fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Corps, however, adopts Mr. Conner's expert\n   opinion that \"regardless of whether the [ ] [P]roposed [G]roin is constructed, the existing hard armoring ... would continue to contribute to the erosion of the [S]pit.\" (MFR, at 70.) Noting that the Proposed Groin represents only an eight-percent increase, Mr. Conner further stated, \"[I]t is unlikely that the construction of a new shorter groin just south of the existing [S]outhern [G]roin would interrupt sediment transport in any measurable way under the current system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Furthermore, the groin's low profile \"would allow sand to pass over and around the structure,\" and the use of armor stone would allow sand to pass through. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73.) Lastly, the Corps found that the introduction of 1.3 to 2.5 million cubic yards of sand from an offshore source is likely to \"allow the beach between the groins to eventually reach an equilibrium state and thus allow some sand to bypass the groins and travel downdrift to the [S]pit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a mitigation effort, the Corps stated that any draft permit issued for the Project must include requirements to monitor sand movement within the Southern Groin and Proposed Groin and downdrift of the groins. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70-71; Permit SAS-2015-00742, at 6.) If the results of the monitoring indicate that the Proposed Groin is trapping sand, Sea Island Acquisition would be required to submit a corrective action plan. (Permit SAS-2015-00742, at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   ii. Harming Wildlife\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the Project will harm federally protected sea turtles and shorebirds,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   essential fish habitats, and pelagic eggs and larvae of managed species and their prey. As required under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the Corps concluded the Project would not result in significant impacts and obtained the National Marine Fisheries Service's (\"NMFS\") concurrence. (MFR, at 77-78.) On April 20, 2018, the NMFS provided the following conservation recommendations (\"CR\"): \"(1) The T-head groin portion of the proposed action should not be permitted[;] and (2) To the extent practicable, work should be limited to seasonal periods of low biological activity.\" (NMFS Apr. 20th Letter, Doc. 5-14, at 2.) On July 17, 2018, the Corps responded stating that it would not follow CR 1 but would follow CR 2. (Corps July 17th Letter to NMFS, Doc. 5-15, at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As required, the Corps justified the reasons for not following CR 1. The Corps stated, first, the \"footprint of the project ... represents a relatively small area of habitat ... that is utilized by the\" wildlife at issue, and \"ample habitat is located both upstream and downstream of the [P]roject site that these species could relocate to.\" (Corps July 17th Letter to NMFS, at 1.) Second, after reviewing reports on the existing condition of the Sea Island shoreline, the small proposed increase in the groin field is \"not expected to more than minimally exacerbate ongoing erosion of the [S]pit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) In incorporating CR 2 as a special condition, the Corps required all work to be completed between November 1st and April 30th, which is outside the sea turtle nesting season. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Although not fully satisfied with the Corps July 17th Letter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   the NMFS stated it\n   would \"not further elevate\" the Corps' decision and noted the Corps \"has complied with ... the Magnuson-Stevens Act and 50 CFR 600.920 (k) (1).\" (NMFS July 27th Letter, at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Endangered and Threatened Species\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs allege \"the Corps should have prepared an EIS because the [P]roposed [G]roin will harm endangered and threatened sea turtles and shorebirds.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 17.) In analyzing the impact to sea turtles, the Corps found that the available beach for turtle nesting has been eroding over time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dr. Webb Test., at 31.) The Project, however, includes beach nourishment that will provide \"additional dry sand beach for turtle nesting.\" (MFR, at 49.) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\"FWS\") concurred with the Corps' finding and only recommended sand compaction testing three years following the beach nourishment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FWS May 22, 2018 Letter, Doc. 5-10, at 1-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiffs also note the risk that the Proposed Groin will trap turtle hatchlings as they swim past the groin. The Corps found this risk minimal because the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Wildlife Resources Division's Sea Island Sea Turtle Program requires relocating sea turtle nests in the area of the project to a dry sand beach. (MFR, at 49.) Thus, \"most hatchlings would not be found in close proximity to the groin because their nests would be relocated away from the base of the groin.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Regarding shorebirds, the Corps found the Project's impact would be minimal. Although erosion to the Spit does harm shorebirds by reducing their habitat, the Corps determined that the Project would not increase erosion of the Spit in a measurable amount. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.) Furthermore, the piping plover's critical habitat is located outside the Project site; thus, there will be no direct effect to its critical habitat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lastly, the Project may potentially expand the habitat for other shorebirds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Corps took a \"hard look\" at the Project's impact on endangered and threatened species and found the impact not significant. The FWS agreed with the Corps' findings. Having made a convincing case for its findings, the Corps' decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Geographic Area is Unique\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the Corps should have prepared an EIS because the geographic area is unique. (Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 20.) The area is unique because of its proximity to habitats for certain endangered or threatened species. However,\n   that conclusion does not warrant finding for Plaintiffs. The uniqueness of an area is only one of ten factors for an agency to consider, and NEPA only requires that \"the adverse environmental effects of the proposed action are adequately identified and evaluated.\"\n   <em>\n    N.

To ensure minimal interruption, Mr. Conner recommended that the construction of the Proposed Groin \"be accompanied by the planned fill placement that is currently proposed as well as the inclusion of a monitoring plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Even though other experts may have reached different conclusions, when experts have conflicting views, \"an agency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable opinions of its own qualified experts even if, as\n   an original matter, a court might find contrary views more persuasive.\"\n   <em>\n    Marsh v.

The Corps complied with each factor. First, the scope of the Corps' cumulative impacts assessment was \"the entire shoreline of Sea Island, portions of Gould's Inlet and the Hampton River, and portions of the adjacent island of St. Simon's Island that may be affected by the proposed action, and the ocean waters and seafloor offshore of Sea Island that comprise the proposed borrow site.\" (MFR, at 71.) Second, as discussed above, the Corps analyzed the cumulative effects that are expected to water quality, aquatic organisms and wildlife, and the sand-sharing system. Third, the Corps' assessment included examining the past, present, and future changes to the area from 1980 through 2023. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Fourth, the Corps examined the impacts from past beach nourishment projects and the Existing Groins. Fifth, the Corps found that the \"incremental contribution\" from the Project \"in relation to the overall impacts from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future activities\" is not significant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Because the Corps examined the cumulative impacts of the Project and satisfied the above five factors before concluding the cumulative impacts were not significant, the Corps' decision not to complete an EIS was neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Excluding the Public\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the Corps failed to consider that the Proposed Groin would reduce beach access in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20320.4\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 320.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (3). Section 320.4 (g) (3) states that projects should \"generally be denied\" if they create \"undue interference with access to, or use of, navigable waters\" for \"riparian landowners.\" Section 320.4(g)(3) focuses on the need for the agency to consider a riparian landowner's, not the general public's, ability to access the navigable waters. Even considering the public's ability to use the navigable waters, the Court finds the Corps' analysis was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The public is still able to access the waters by boat. Furthermore, the Corps noted that there is currently no public access to the beach on Sea Island by land, but an \"unfettered right for any person to land a boat on the beach.\" (MFR, at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Plaintiffs only repeat the general arguments that \"the proposed project will harm the sand-sharing system, trigger accelerated erosion, [ ] may cause the Spit to break apart[,]\" and \"is also likely to harm federally threatened and endangered wildlife\" - \"none of which could be compensated for with money damages.\" (Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 24.) Plaintiffs focus solely on the Proposed Groin without mentioning the beach nourishment project, which is intended to offset the harm to the sand-sharing system and to minimize the already-occurring erosion. Furthermore, the harm to the Spit does not warrant an injunction because Plaintiffs allege only that the Project \"may\" cause the Spit to break apart, not that such harm is likely during the pendency of this suit, as required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Regarding aquatic species, the Corps found the harms would be minor and short-term, and Plaintiffs do not challenge the Corps' conclusion as to those findings. Lastly, construction on the Project is only allowed from November 1st to April 30th to avoid posing harm to some endangered and threatened species. Although the Court recognizes the importance of preventing environmental harm, Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden of showing that irreparable harm is likely to occur during the pendency of this suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Having found Plaintiffs failed to show both a substantial likelihood of success on the merits and a likely risk of irreparable harm, the Court finds the preliminary injunction unjustified. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. (Doc. 5.) As stated in the introduction, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion to expedite consideration of the motion (Doc. 15) and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' amended motion for a preliminary injunction (Doc. 21). Having denied the injunction on other grounds, the Court also finds Sea Island Acquisition's motion for a hearing as to its harm unnecessary; thus, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Sea Island Acquisition's motion.
