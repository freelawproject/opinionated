The motions for certification and for summary judgment have been briefed fully, and the issues raised are ripe for ruling. For the following reasons, defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted with respect to plaintiff's federal law claims, and plaintiff's state law claims are dismissed without prejudice pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Kelly sought damages for unpaid minimum wages; overtime compensation; liquidated and statutory damages; further damages and other relief for retaliation; as well as fees, costs, and interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 22, 2017, Kelly filed a consent to join the suit as a \"named plaintiff,\" and he filed a consent to join the suit by current plaintiff Wai Man Tom (\"Tom\") as an opt-in plaintiff. Between May 9 and May 15, 2017, Kelly filed six additional consents to join the suit by the following individuals as opt-in plaintiffs: Shelley Thorne (\"Thorne\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Elaina Tanski (\"Tanski\"), Evelyn Hunter (\"Hunter\"), Gregory J. Evenson II (\"Evenson\"), Deion Dorsey (\"Dorsey\"), and Anne-Yael Okale-Weeks (\"Weeks\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 5, 2017, the court allowed in part Kelly's motion to amend the complaint to substitute Tom for Kelly as named plaintiff and to add new factual allegations. In the first amended complaint, filed September 8, 2017, which is the operative complaint in this action, plaintiff Tom (herein \"plaintiff\" or \"plaintiff Tom\") asserts claims on behalf of himself and opt-in plaintiffs (hereinafter \"party plaintiff[s]\"), as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his first claim for relief (\"Count One\"), plaintiff asserts defendants improperly took a \"tip credit\" by using an invalid\n   \"tip pool\" comprised of employees who did not \"customarily and regularly receive tips,\" and thus failed to pay party plaintiffs the required minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, in violation of the FLSA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m) &amp; 206. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 94-96).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff asserts that defendants' failure to pay minimum wage was willful, because defendants previously internally investigated a similar practice and were subject to a similar lawsuit pertaining, in part, to alleged improper tip credit practices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his second claim for relief (\"Count Two\"), plaintiff asserts defendants failed to pay party plaintiffs overtime wages of $10.88 per hour for all hours worked over 40 in a single workweek, in violation of FLSA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , on the same basis as Count One, where plaintiff asserts defendants willfully used an invalid \"tip credit\" practice.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 95-25.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 95-25.8, based upon the invalid \"tip pool\" as asserted in Counts One and Two. Plaintiff also asserts that defendants failed to pay party plaintiffs for all paid time off (PTO) hours due as part of their final paycheck, upon closure of the restaurant, and failed to continue insurance benefits for the final pay period, following closure of the restaurant, in violation of the NCWHA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2095-25.6\">\n    N.C.

The court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties may conduct discovery regarding the \u00a7 7i exemption, but such discovery may or may not result in an early judicial resolution on the merits, depending on how issues are framed in conjunction with conditional certification of class or collective actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Generally, this court and others have resolved issues regarding conditional certification of class or collective actions prior to conclusive determinations on merits issues. [citations omitted]. Accordingly, while the court does not preclude, in the deadlines below, any party from filing an early summary judgment motion, the primary goal of Phase I discovery is to facilitate resolution of a motion for conditional certification of class or collective actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Case Management Order (DE 70) at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court set a February 28, 2018, deadline for Phase I discovery, and a deadline\n   of March 31, 2018, for plaintiff to file a motion for conditional certification of class or collective action. The court did not set any separate deadline for dispositive motions. In addition, the court stated that \"Determination of scope and limitations of Phase II discovery shall be determined following the court's ruling on any motion for conditional certification of class or collective actions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff filed the instant motion for certification on March 15, 2018, seeking conditional certification of an FLSA collective action and certification of a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 for NCWHA claims. Plaintiff seeks an order directing defendants to provide an \"updated listing of the names, last known addresses, alternate addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, last four digits of their Social Security of all former putative plaintiffs and [ Rule 23 ] class members who worked for all Defendants at any time during the period from February 22, 2014 to January 30, 2017 consistent with Plaintiff's proposed class notice definition.\" (Motion (DE 79-1) at 1).

Plaintiff also requests to be able to email and send via text message class notices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In support of the instant motion for certification, plaintiff relies upon his deposition and depositions of party plaintiffs Kelly, Dorsey, and Weeks; depositions of former employees of the restaurant, Keely Gleespen (\"Gleespen\") and David Clore (\"Clore\"); deposition of former Human Resources manager for The Umstead, Rex Pysher (\"Pysher\"); proposed notice; the restaurant's employee handbook; plaintiff's and party plaintiff Kelly's pay stubs; the restaurant's tip pool policy and tip pool summaries; photographs of the sushi bar at the restaurant; restaurant job position\n   descriptions; and plaintiff counsel's firm resume.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants filed the instant motion for summary judgment on May 1, 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserting that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all of plaintiff's claims. In support of their motion, defendants rely upon a statement of material facts and the following documents, in addition to the depositions upon which plaintiff relies in support of the certification motion: 1) declarations by defendants' employees or former employees: Keith Hernandez (\"Hernandez\"), Laura Francis (\"Francis\"), Phillip Kalk (\"Kalk\"), Justin Dillon (\"Dillon\"), Joshua Hughes (\"Hughes\"), Steven Greene (\"Greene\"), Michael Golder (\"Golder\"), Scott Remmy (\"Remmy\"), Pysher, Hyun Woo Kim (\"H.

On the same date, defendants filed response in opposition to plaintiff's motion for certification, relying upon a declaration of Clore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Upon review thereof, the court denied plaintiff's oral motion at prior hearing to hold in abeyance briefing on the motion for summary judgment pending ruling on the motion for certification. Plaintiff filed a response to the motion for summary judgment and a reply in support of the motion for certification on May 31, 2018. In support of plaintiff's response, plaintiff relies upon an opposing statement of facts and the following documents: 1) earning statements of plaintiff and party plaintiffs; 2) tip pool sample statement; 3) closing kitchen supervisor job description; 4) interrogatory responses of plaintiff and party plaintiffs; and 5) expert report of George Friday, Jr. (\"Friday\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants filed the instant motion for hearing and reply in support of summary judgment on June 21, 2018, relying upon declarations of Rivero and Pysher.

Dep. at 88); that plaintiff sometimes would \"ask a manager to remove the gratuity,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 86); that auto-gratuity could be removed \"if the service was not up to par,\" (James Decl. \u00b6 12); that party plaintiff Weeks believed customers would not leave an additional tip above the auto-gratuity because customers viewed the auto-gratuity as \"a customary tip for service\" (Weeks Dep. at 135); and that one receipt in the record shows an auto-gratuity of 18.5% instead of 20% (Clore Dep. at 107).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   None of this evidence cited by plaintiff, however, is determinative to whether the auto-gratuity properly is classified as a service charge as opposed to a tip. Plaintiff cites no evidence, for example, that the decision whether an auto-gratuity is applied, and its amount, are matters determined solely by the customer. Even though the auto-gratuity was not applied to every party of six or more, the material undisputed facts determinative to the analysis are that management had a policy of applying auto-gratuities to parties of six or more, and management determined when an auto-gratuity could be removed or reduced. Moreover, when the auto-gratuity was removed \"it was almost never because they [the customer] asked [the server] to take it off.\" (Tom Dep. at 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that, even if auto-gratuities constitute \"commissions\" under \u00a7 7(i), it is necessary to include both \"tips\" and \"auto-gratuities\" in determining total compensation under \u00a7 7(i). This argument is incorrect as a matter of law. An employer may use employee tips under \u00a7 203(m) to satisfy federal minimum wage requirements, but an employer is not required to do so if the minimum wage can be satisfied through other means.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trejo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288726\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/442/#p447\">\n    795 F.3d at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Gleespen states regarding Papas that, among other job duties: \"He'd run food. He would ... help with large parties.\" (Gleespen Dep. 92). Regarding appearances by Papas in the front-of-the-house, one server, Justin Dillon, noted: \"He takes it upon himself to go do that because he just wants to go see people.\" (Tr. (DE 29) at 52-53). Plaintiff also noted Papas' role in service at the sushi bar, which was an area of the front-of-the house attended by customers: \"[The sushi chefs] were encouraged to send all sushi plates to expedite, to the expediter. And the expediter would then, in turn, send the sushi to the corresponding table.\" (Tom Dep. at 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Third, again based on all the same evidence, Papas engaged in customer service functions as part of his job. Moreover, on this issue, Papas states: \"I was critically necessary to the stream of service at An.... Expos are critical to service in the front of the house.\" (Papas Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10). In addition, he states: \"Every new service employee at An started as a server assistant and started training with me ... to learn about the food, the sauces, how to put the food down in front of the guests ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In sum, Papas, as expediter, was a valid tip pool participant because he had more than de minimis interaction with guests, he appeared as part of his job activities in the front-of-the-house, and he performed critical customer service functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Papas was not a valid member of the tip pool for several reasons, none of which create a genuine issue of fact on the relevant criteria. First, plaintiff argues that Papas was an invalid participant because of evidence showing his job titles of expediter and closing kitchen supervisor were listed as back-of-the-house positions, written descriptions of those positions did not list front-of-the-house activities, and Papas engaged\n   in multiple back-of-the-house functions and won a \" 'back-of-the-house' employee\" award. (Pls' Stmt. of Facts (DE 113) \u00b6 49). However, \"one's status as an employee who 'customarily and regularly receives tips' is determined on the basis of his or her activities, not on the employee's job title.\"\n   <em>\n    Montano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054984\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/186/#p190\">\n    800 F.3d at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, it is no matter that other parts of Papas's job involved back-of-the-house functions. Indeed, the Department of Labor has recognized that a tipped employee may spend \"part of her time cleaning and setting tables, toasting bread, making coffee and occasionally washing dishes or glasses,\" or may \"prepare[ ] [her] own short orders or ... take[ ] a turn as a short order cook for the group.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.56\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Second, plaintiff cites his and other servers' statements that Papas \"very rarely ran food\"; \"rarely, if ever, left the kitchen during service hours\"; he \"was expected to stay at his post\"; or he was never seen approaching a table. (Pl's Stmt. (DE 113) \u00b6 49). These stated observations by individual servers, however, do not create a genuine issue of fact, because they only provide a first-person view point of time periods in which such servers were working and watching the activities of Papas, whereas Papas's statements reflect his complete first-hand account of his activities, and his managers provide an overall picture of his activities. In any event, coupling individual servers' statements that Papas \"rarely\" or \"very rarely\" left the kitchen, with statements by Papas and managers about his activities, there is no genuine issue of fact that Papas engaged in more than \"de minimis\" customer interaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Finally, plaintiff cites to evidence Papas was paid a direct wage greater than minimum wage, the tip credit was not used for him, and he did not actually receive tips from anywhere other than the tip pool. However, \"[i]t is not required that all employees who share in tips must themselves receive tips from customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Kilgore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11669129\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/294/#p301\">\n    160 F.3d at 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather it is enough that Papas had more than de minimis customer interaction, appeared in the front of the house, and engaged in critical customer service functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   ii. Sushi Chef Helpers\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Sushi chef helpers also meet the criteria of valid tip pool participants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   First and foremost, sushi chef helpers performed their job activities at a location in the \"front-of-the-house,\" at the sushi bar, which was in view of customers entering the restaurant, and which had seats for customers directly facing the workspace of the sushi chef helpers. (James Dec. \u00b6 28; J. Kim Dec. \u00b6 6; Jin Dec. \u00b6 6; Hughes Dec. \u00b6 18). Indeed, photos of the sushi bar show both seats for customers directly at the sushi bar and booths nearby for customers not at the sushi bar but in view of the sushi bar. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Photos of Sushi Bar, Defs' App. (DE 100-24) at 2-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Kelly Dep. (DE 100-10) 45 &amp; Ex. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Second, by virtue of their location and their setup behind a bar attended by customers, sushi chef helpers had more than de minimis customer interaction and they engaged in customer service functions. In this vein, Gleespen states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   They needed good customer service skills because they were right in front of the guests.... [Y]ou know, keeping a positive attitude. Q. How often would you say they interacted with the guests? A. Daily. They were right there. They would be smiling, interacting with them. Not every day did - - or every shift did they take orders. But they were constantly interacting with them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   (Gleespen Dep. 90). Joshua Hughes, who was a\n   <em>\n    sous chef\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    chef de cuisine\n   </em>\n   at the restaurant, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Sushi chef and the sushi chef helpers often interacted with guests. They would have conversations with them about what they were making and regulars would often order directly from them as opposed to their server. When this happened, the sushi employee would tell the server what the order was and the server would input it into the POS. Also, if a guest requested their roll from the sushi bar, the sushi helper may hand the roll directly to the guest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   (Hughes Decl. \u00b6 19). Lee, who was a sushi chef at the restaurant, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   I spoke to guests about everything from the quality of the fish, the menu, to where they worked, me and the other sushi chefs/helpers did this to engage the guests in hopes that they would return.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   An had guests that came to An regularly and sat exclusively at the Sushi bar. Whenever a guest sat at the sushi bar, me and the other sushi chefs/helpers would speak to them. It would be rude to ignore them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   (Lee Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). H. Kim, who was head sushi chef at the restaurant, states: \"All sushi chefs and sushi chef helpers understood English well enough to respond to customer requests and to participate in restaurant meetings that were conducted in English.\" (H. Kim. Decl. \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Plaintiff cites to his and other servers' testimony as a basis for descriptions of the job activities of sushi chef helpers. For example, plaintiff states: \"They did a lot more of the prep work [than sushi chefs] .... They were rarely accessible to the guests. They started in the further portion. They were even behind the sushi chefs most of the time.\" (Tom Dep. 68). \"Many of the helpers weren't that proficient with English.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hunter Dep. 100). As an initial matter, these stated observations by individual servers do not create a genuine issue of fact, because they only provide a first-person view point of time periods in which such servers were working and watching the activities of sushi chef helpers, whereas statements by the sushi chefs and sushi chef helpers noted above reflect their complete first-hand account of their activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In any event, the substance of individual servers' testimony does not create a genuine issue of material fact as to the criteria for qualification as tip pool participants. First, the testimony of the servers is qualified, (e.g., \"did\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   prep work\" \"\n   <em>\n    rarely\n   </em>\n   accessible\" \"\n   <em>\n    started in\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    further\n   </em>\n   portion\" \"\n   <em>\n    most of the time\n   </em>\n   \"), such that it does not undermine a finding as a matter of law that the sushi chef helpers had at more than de minimis interaction with guests, worked in view of guests, and performed customer service functions. Indeed, plaintiff's description of his viewpoint confirms more than de minimis interaction with guests:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   Q: So did the sushi chefs and the sushi helpers - - were they working behind the bar?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   Q: Would they ever interact with guests while they were working at the bar?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   A: At times they would interact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   Q: And how would they interact?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   A: Sometimes guests would ask them what they're preparing.\u00b7 Many times, that's how the conversations started.\u00b7 They are there essentially displaying their techniques and their art of making sushi.\u00b7 Many times, that is the center of the conversation between guests and them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   Q: So a guest may strike up a conversation about the art that they are creating?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   A: Correct. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   (Tom Dep. at 66-67). In addition, the servers' testimony does not undermine the evidence that the sushi chef helpers worked in a location visible to and near customers and, by virtue of that location, at least occasionally interacted with customers, whether through a greeting, a nod or smile, or conversation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gleespen Dep. 90; Hughes Decl. \u00b6 19; Lee Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Moreover, undisputed evidence such as kitchen lineups conducted in English (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Stmt. of Facts \u00b6 44), demonstrates that the sushi chef helpers were capable of communicating at some level in English, or at least capable of communicating in some way to have an \"interaction\" with customers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H. Kim. Decl. \u00b6 6). The law does not require fluent conversation in English to constitute more than a \"de minimis interaction\" with customers,\n   <em>\n    Montano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054984\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/186/#p190\">\n    800 F.3d at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , particularly considered in the context of customers who deliberately have chosen to seat themselves in front of the sushi bar. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Lee Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4 (\"It would be rude to ignore them.\"); H. Kim. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Plaintiff argues that it is significant that sushi chef helpers attended such kitchen lineups, thus aligning them with \"back-of-the-house\" employees. But, as with expediter, actual \"front-of-the-house\" activities by the sushi chef helpers trump labels, classifications, and other job duties associated with back of the house employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054984\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/186/#p190\">\n    800 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   191 ;\n   <em>\n    Kilgore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11669129\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/294/#p301\">\n    160 F.3d at 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based upon relevant evidence regarding sushi chef helpers' activities and work location in the restaurant, there is no genuine issue of fact that they engaged in more than de minimis customer interaction, were visible to customers, and performed customer service functions. Accordingly, sushi chef helpers are not precluded from participating in the restaurant's tip pool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In sum, plaintiff has not demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact regarding the validity of the AN PM Tip Pool, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m).

Plaintiff complained to General Manager, Clore, about the tip pool in September 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tom Dep. 117-118). Plaintiff, however, does not identify any significant change in his employment status thereafter, such as reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits. Indeed he testified that his income stayed the same or increased, his workload increased, and there was \"not really a noticeable reduction\" in hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114, 119). While plaintiff testified that management moved some less-experienced servers into doing larger parties, plaintiff did not describe any significant adverse consequence to him as a result of this change. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120-121).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Regarding party plaintiff Kelly, he suggests that he complained to management about the tip pool in September 2016, and at various points verbally throughout the operation of the tip pool. (Kelly Dep. 194-195). With respect to changes in his work, Kelly states: \"my sections shrunk, the amount of customers shrunk, the sales shrunk, my scheduling diminished, the amount of hours I worked diminished over time, and the dialogue and communication with management completely changed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 195). However, Kelly's payroll records show that he did not receive any significant difference in the amount of hourly rate, gratuities, or auto-gratuities, before and after September 2016, nor year after year in the time frame between 2014 and the closure of the restaurant in 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kelly Dep. Ex 14 (DE 110-10 at 377-468). Moreover, Kelly's generalized reference to \"dialogue and communication with management\" (Kelly Dep. 195), is not the type of material change in conditions of employment to constitute an adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p68\">\n    548 U.S. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p68\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, plaintiff has not established a genuine issue of material fact as to the second element of the retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Plaintiff argues that consideration of defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's retaliation claim is premature and that the court's decision should be deferred until after further discovery has concluded, citing the bifurcated discovery schedule set forth in the court's case management order. The court's case management order, however, does not preclude any party from filing an early summary judgment motion. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 allows a party to file a motion for summary judgment \"at any time,\" and, if the moving party therein identifies a claim without a genuine issue of fact, it is incumbent upon the responding party to demonstrate a genuine issue of fact or to demonstrate why \"it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(b) &amp; (d). Here, facts regarding plaintiff's retaliation claim have been developed through deposition testimony and earnings records.

In these circumstances, the court declines in its discretion to exercise jurisdiction over plaintiff's pendent state law claims, and such claims are dismissed without prejudice pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   C. Motion for Certification\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Having determined that defendants' motion for summary judgment should be granted with respect to plaintiff's federal law claims and that plaintiff's state law claims shall be dismissed without prejudice pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), plaintiff's motion for conditional and class certification is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Based on the foregoing, defendants' motion for summary judgment (DE 99) is GRANTED with respect to plaintiff's federal law claims. Plaintiff's state law claims are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Plaintiff's motion for conditional and class certification (DE 79) is DENIED as moot, and plaintiff's motion to seal (DE 82) is DENIED. The court dispenses with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process. Accordingly, defendants' motion for hearing (DE 124) is DENIED. The clerk is DIRECTED to close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   SO ORDERED, this the 18th day of December, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    The parties filed a stipulation of dismissal pertaining to party plaintiff Thorne on February 5, 2018.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    Hereinafter, all citations to the complaint (\"Compl.\") are to the first amended complaint, unless otherwise specified.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    In particular, a prior lawsuit raising claims under the FLSA and NCWHA against North Carolina Culinary Ventures, LLC, resolved with settlement in 2011.\n    <em>\n     See Buckner, et al v.

However, defendants rely upon all of the same documents in support of summary judgment, without filing the same under seal (e.g., the restaurant's employee handbook (DE 100-9 at 250-302); plaintiff's and party plaintiff Kelly's pay stubs (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 192-240; DE 100-10 at 365-485); the restaurant's tip pool policy and tip pool summaries (DE 100-3 at 256-259; DE 100-1 at 221-246); photographs of the sushi bar at the restaurant (DE 100-24); and the restaurant job position descriptions (DE 100-1 at 199-217) ).
