No. 46] and Monterey Financial Services,\n   LLC (\"Monterey\") [Doc. Nos. 22 &amp; 39]. For the reasons stated below, Defendants' motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In June 2017, Plaintiff LuAnn Danger purchased a Yorkshire Terrier and Maltese mix puppy from Premier Pups. (Am. Compl. [Doc. No. 35] \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.) Premier Pups offered the dog for sale at a price of $1,381.89. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Danger financed the purchase through Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Defendant Nextep is a for-profit company that \"offers a retailer to customer closed end consumer lease platform designed to increase retailer sales by offering customers the ability to finance goods and services on the spot, in the store and without delay.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Defendant Monterey is a for-profit company that \"offers a host of services related to loan servicing, debt recovery, and consumer finance\" in order to \"meet the needs of niche businesses and consumers ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 16, 2017, Danger entered into an agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Nextep, which allowed her to take possession of the dog in exchange for 24 monthly payments of $138.28, plus fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) The parties dispute whether the Agreement is a consumer lease or credit sales agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The second page of the nine-page Agreement bears Nextep's logo, and is styled as a \"Consumer Pet Lease Agreement.\" (Agmt. at 2,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex. A to Am. Compl.) It contains a provision labeled \"\n   <strong>\n    Important Information Concerning Your Lease\n   </strong>\n   ,\" and appears as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Important Information Concerning Your Lease\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By signing the following documents, you are entering into a Closed End Consumer Product Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   You understand that this Agreement is a\n   <strong>\n    lease,\n   </strong>\n   not a loan and that you are leasing the product(s).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   You understand that\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     you do not own the product(s) you are leasing unless:\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   1) You buy the product through the early buyout option (for more information see Section 8 of this Agreement or visit your account at nextepfunding.com); or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   2) You pay $\n   <em>\n    207.28\n   </em>\n   after your final lease payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Your lease can be paid off at any time.

It appears as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The first column of Section 2, labeled\n   <strong>\n    \"Amount Due at Lease Signing or Delivery,\"\n   </strong>\n   lists a $35 \"Warranty Fee,\" due at signing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis in original). In the third column, under\n   <strong>\n    \"Other Charges\n   </strong>\n   (not part of your monthly payment),\" the Agreement identifies a \"Disposition Fee\" of $103.64 if Danger ultimately decides not to purchase the dog. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis in original). At the bottom of the Section 2 box is a provision labeled\n   <strong>\n    \"Purchase Option at End of Lease Term,\"\n   </strong>\n   which applies if Danger decides to keep the dog. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis in original). If she decides to do so, the purchase option is $207.28, \"plus official fees and taxes related to the purchase.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the second column of Section 2, under the sub-heading\n   <strong>\n    \"Monthly Payments,\"\n   </strong>\n   the Agreement provides for 24 payments of $138.28, due on the 20th of each month, and states that \"[t]he Total of your Monthly Payments is $\n   <em>\n    138.28\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis in original). Two columns to the right, the Agreement also states: \"\n   <strong>\n    Total of Payments\n   </strong>\n   (The amount you will have paid by the end of the Lease)[:] $\n   <em>\n    3318.73\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Monterey is identified in the Agreement as the payee for all of the debt arising from the Agreement. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 27.) Specifically, the Agreement states that payments are to be mailed to \"Monterey Financial, 4095 Avenida De La Plata, Oceanside, CA 92056.\" (Agmt. \u00a7 9, Ex. A to Am. Compl.) Likewise, all written communications concerning disputed amounts must be sent to Monterey Financial, at the same address. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Danger has made her required monthly payments since entering into the Agreement, but will not complete her payments until June 16, 2019. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50, 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In February 2018, Danger filed this suit, asserting claims under: (1) the Consumer Leasing Act (\"CLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201667\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and its implementing regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201013\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Regulation M\"); (2) the Truth in Lending Act, (\"TILA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and its implementing regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201026\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Regulation Z\"); and (3) Minnesota law prohibiting usurious contracts,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20334.01\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 334.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She asserts her CLA claim against Nextep, (Am. Compl., Count I), alleging that prior to the consummation of the Agreement, Nextep falsely disclosed the total amount of periodic payments owed under the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114.) Her TILA claim, asserted against both Defendants, alleges that they\n   failed to adequately disclose: (1) the finance charge; (2) the finance charge expressed as an annual percentage rate (\"APR\"); and (3) the sum of the amount financed and the finance charge, i.e., the \"total of payments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Count II.) Danger asserts that Defendants concealed \"the exorbitant annual percentage rate\" of 120% that applied to her purchase. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 125-26.) Finally, Plaintiff asserts claims of usury arising under Minnesota state law against both Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Count III.) She contends that the 120% APR to purchase the dog far exceeds the usury statute's 8% limit for personal debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 141-42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As to her injuries, Plaintiff alleges that Nextep \"took from her the ability to shop intelligently for alternative financing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) She asserts that had she known the true effective interest rate in the Agreement, she would have \"pursued other financing options such as using a credit card or obtaining a personal loan through her credit union.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) She contends that these alternative financing options would have carried a lower interest rate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Both Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's claims. Citing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), they argue that Danger lacks standing to assert her federal claims, requiring the dismissal of Counts I and II for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, (Nextep's Mem. at 5-14 [Doc. No. 48]; Monterey's Mem. at 2-7 [Doc. No. 41] ), including claims for which she seeks injunctive relief for future harms. (Nextep's Mem. at 15-17.) Defendants further argue that because the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Counts I and II, it should dismiss the pendent state law usury claim for lack of supplemental jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14; Monterey's Mem. at 14 n. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Even if the Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged Article III standing, Defendants move to dismiss her claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Nextep argues pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), that Count I should be dismissed because Danger has not plausibly alleged that Nextep failed to comply with the CLA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-22.) Monterey argues that Count II fails under Rule 12(b)(6), because loan servicers like Monterey are not subject to the TILA provisions in question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Monterey's Mem. at 10-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, both Defendants argue that under Rule 12(b)(6), Plaintiff's usury claim fails to plausibly allege a violation of Minnesota law. (Nextep's Mem. at 22-25; Monterey's Mem. at 13-16.) They assert that the Agreement should be considered an installment sale, which is not subject to Minnesota's usury laws. (Nextep's Mem. at 22-25; Monterey's Mem. at 14-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Standing for Monetary Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to allege a sufficiently concrete injury-in-fact. (Nextep's Mem. at 11, 13; Monterey's Mem. at 6-8.) First, they contend that Danger has not alleged that she read the disclosures in question, much less that she was confused by them. (Nextep's Mem. at 11; Monterey's Mem. at 7.) Rather, Monterey infers that Plaintiff would have entered into the Agreement, regardless of the disclosures, in order to fill the void in her life created by her daughter's departure for college. (Monterey's Mem. at 7) (citing Am. Compl. \u00b6 81). Second, they argue that Plaintiff has not plausibly alleged that she would have obtained another financing option, had she pursued it, (Nextep's Mem. at 12), nor has she alleged that she actually considered other financing options. (Monterey's Mem. at 7.) In particular, Nextep claims that Plaintiff also fails to identify the credit card she would have used and the interest rate on that credit card, or the kind of loans provided by her credit union. (Nextep's Mem. at 11.) Finally, Nextep asserts, even if disclosures were provided in an incorrect form, the information was, in fact, provided to Danger.

Like the cases noted in the preceding paragraph, the court in\n   <em>\n    Prayitno\n   </em>\n   initially found that the plaintiff had not properly alleged an injury-in-fact for his TILA claim because he had \"not alleged how the alleged failure to provide the information (like APR) changed his behavior.\" (Nextep's Ex. 1 [Doc.

Danger does not state that she\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have considered getting alternative funding had she been aware of the interest rate.

Granted, to\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   her injury, Plaintiff will likely need to provide evidence about what credit card she would have used, the rate on that credit card, or what kind of loans are provided by her credit union. But at the motion to dismiss stage, Plaintiff merely needs to\n   <em>\n    plausibly allege\n   </em>\n   that she had access to a credit card or credit union loan that had a lower interest rate than the one provided for in the Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to allege that she even read the disclosures in the Agreement, or that she was confused by them. (Nextep's Mem. at 11; Monterey's Mem. at 7-8.) Viewing Plaintiff's\n   amended pleading as a whole, however, the Court finds that she has sufficiently alleged a concrete injury-in-fact.

These allegedly inadequate disclosures created a risk of real harm to a concrete interest that both the TILA and the CLA were enacted to protect-the informed use of credit. And, in this case, Danger has plausibly alleged that \"real harm\" materialized, as she continues to pay an interest rate of more than 120% for her dog. Further, Plaintiff alleges that she chose not to shop for credit or obtain alternative financing at a better rate because of Defendants' allegedly inadequate disclosures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.)

Nextep contends that Plaintiff lacks standing for injunctive relief because she has not properly alleged that she is likely to lease a pet or an item of personal property from Nextep in the near future, and because general allegations that Nextep \"regularly extended consumer credit\" or \"regularly engaged in leasing\" are insufficient to establish recurring harm.

Compl. \u00b6 114.) She alleges that rather than disclosing the total amount of periodic payments due, the Agreement states, under \"Monthly Payments\" in Section 2, that \"[t]he Total of your Monthly Payments is $138.28,\" when, in fact, 24 monthly payments of $138.28 result in a total of $3,318.73. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 107-08) (citing Agmt. \u00b6 2, Ex. A to Am. Compl.) Also, Danger alleges that the disclosure in Section 2 regarding \"[t]he amount you will have paid by the end of the Lease\" is inaccurate because it omits the $35 Warranty Fee, and either a $103.64 Disposition Fee or a $207.28 Purchase Option Fee. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In its motion to dismiss, Nextep argues that the disclosure regarding \"[t]he Total of your Monthly Payments\" is actually correct, as each monthly payment was $138.28. (Nextep's Mem. at 18.) It notes that the phrase \"Total of your Monthly Payments\" is not defined in the CLA, Regulation M, or the commentary to Regulation M. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 n.5.) Moreover, when viewing the disclosures in the Agreement as a whole, Nextep asserts that there is no ambiguity. Nextep points to language under \"Total of Payments,\" in the fourth column of Section 2, that lists $3,318.73 as \"[t]he amount you will have paid by the end of the Lease.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, Nextep contends that even if the \"Total of your Monthly Payments\" was confusing, it is not plausible that Plaintiff thought the total price of her dog totaled $138.28, given that two columns to the right, the Agreement states that the \"Total of Payments\" is $3,318,73. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As to the failure to include the warranty fee and disposition or purchase fee in the \"Total of Payments,\" Nextep argues that nothing in the CLA or Regulation M requires those fees to be disclosed. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201667\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201667\">\n    at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In fact, Nextep notes that Danger's claims only rely on the portions of the CLA and Regulation M that require the disclosure of the total amount of periodic payments: 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1667a(9) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201013.4\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1013.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 70-75), and \"[h]ad Plaintiff known the effective interest rate [was] so high, she would have pursued other financing options such as using a credit card or obtaining a personal loan through her local credit union.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 74); (\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 119) (\"had [she] known of the true cost, she would have pursued less expensive alternatives such as a personal loan through her credit union or use of a credit card.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Granted, in\n    <em>\n     Kelen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273418\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/259/75/#p81\">\n     259 F.Supp.3d at 80\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , the court noted that the plaintiff failed to allege that she had ever read the challenged disclosures. However, that fact alone was not determinative of standing. Rather, the court based its dismissal of the plaintiff's TILA claim on multiple facts-primarily, the plaintiff's failure to allege that she changed her behavior based on Nordstrom's allegedly insufficient disclosures and her failure to allege that Nordstrom ever charged her a late payment fee or a returned payment fee, or an improperly calculated one.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273418\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/259/75/#p81\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    As noted above, Plaintiff here has sufficiently alleged that she would have changed her course of action had she known the true APR, and that she continues to make payments under that rate.
