Plaintiff Amy Benjamin sued Defendant Oxford Health Insurance, Inc. (\"Oxford\") for denying coverage of Benjamin's residential treatment for a mental and/or behavioral health disorder. Benjamin asserted in her complaint that Oxford's denial of coverage was wrongful because she was entitled to coverage for the care received under the terms of her ERISA-governed policy issued by Oxford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 19, 2018, the Court decided cross-motions for summary judgment in a Ruling reported at\n   <em>\n    Benjamin v. Oxford Health Ins., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-00408 (CSH),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203489588\">\n    2018 WL 3489588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Conn. July 19, 2018) (\"the July 19 Ruling\"), familiarity with which is assumed. Plaintiff Benjamin partially prevailed in the July 19 Ruling, to the extent that the Court remanded the case to Oxford for that full and fair evaluation of Plaintiff's claim which the Court held Oxford had theretofore failed to give. The July 19 Ruling also gave preliminary consideration to Plaintiff's request for attorney's\n   fees in her complaint, and the Court directed Plaintiff to file documents supporting her claim for attorney's fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The case is again before the Court, on Plaintiff's renewed motion, based upon additional submissions. This Ruling resolves that motion, [Doc. 77]. For the reasons that follow, the Court declines to award Plaintiff the amount she requests and directs payment by Defendant of a lesser amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The theory of Benjamin's action against Oxford is that Oxford failed to make a full and fair evaluation of her claims, either at the time of her initial claim or at the time of her two administrative appeals.\n   <em>\n    Benjamin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203489588\">\n    2018 WL 3489588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court's July 19 Ruling granted Benjamin summary judgment on that assertion, notwithstanding Oxford's protestations of rectitude. The Ruling remanded Plaintiff's insurance claims to Defendant for a full and fair evaluation in the first instance. In that Ruling's relatively brief concluding discussion on attorney's fees, the Court held that Plaintiff \"has achieved some success on the merits, sufficient to make her eligible for an award of fees under ERISA. This is so even where, as here, Defendant does not object to the remand order.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11. The Court reasoned that \"where, by Defendant's own admission, the administrative appeals process failed Plaintiff, some award of fees is consistent with the aims of ERISA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   However, the July 19 Ruling, which is the law of the case, did not complete its analysis of whether Plaintiff was entitled to any attorney's fees, and, if so, the amount of the recoverable fees in practice remained for decision. This was due to Plaintiff not having filed the required supporting papers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff consequently moved for attorney's fees and costs, on the basis of additional submissions. Doc. 77. Defendant opposes the motion. The attorney's fee issue is now ripe for the Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The district court retains discretion to determine ... what constitutes a reasonable fee.\"\n   <em>\n    Millea v.

To recover\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   fees, an ERISA plaintiff like Benjamin must show she has achieved \"some degree of success on the merits\" of the litigation. A plaintiff who does not make that showing is not entitled to recover attorney's fees in any amount: that is the mandatory end to the matter. A plaintiff who demonstrates the requisite degree of success on the merits\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   make a claim for attorney's fees: this Circuit's non-mandatory\n   <em>\n    Chambless\n   </em>\n   factors then kick in. In those circumstances, the district court has the discretion to award attorney's fees or decline to do so, and to fix the amount if fees are awarded. The question has changed, in other words, from whether the party\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   recover attorney's fees to whether it\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The July 19 Ruling decided in Plaintiff's favor the threshold question of whether she had obtained some degree of success on the merits, thereby resolving the question of whether she\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   obtain attorney's fees. Resolving the questions of whether she\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   be awarded attorney's fees, and, if so, in what amount is the subject of Plaintiff's present renewed motion for attorney's fees and costs. Defendant's opposing brief on the present motion begins with the contention that, weighing the\n   <em>\n    Chambless\n   </em>\n   factors, \"no fees should be awarded to Plaintiff. Initially, Plaintiff's refusal to accept Oxford's offer of a voluntary remand required the parties to engage in unnecessary litigation based on her improper interpretation of the law of waiver, which should not be rewarded with an award of attorney's fees.\" Doc. 85 (\"Def. Mem.\") at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This argument by Oxford, made in the\n   <em>\n    Chambless\n   </em>\n   factors context and based on Defendant's purported consent to a voluntary remand of Plaintiff's disability claim, was first articulated by Oxford during the prior summary judgment motions, in an effort to persuade the Court that Benjamin had not achieved any degree of success and consequently was not entitled to any attorney's fees. The July 19 Ruling explicitly rejects that contention. Judge Underhill reached the same conclusion on the same point in\n   <em>\n    Schuman v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   : \"The defendants suggest that because they too asked for remand, 'neither side prevailed' and Schuman achieved only a 'purely procedural victory' .... By securing a remand after the defendants denied him benefits, Schuman achieved a result that was more favorable to him-and less favorable to the defendants-than the status quo.\" No. 3:15-cv-01006 (SRU),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202662191\">\n    2017 WL 2662191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D. Conn. June 20, 2017). Judge Underhill then applied the\n   <em>\n    Chambless\n   </em>\n   factors to determine the amount of the recoverable attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Judge Meyer reached the same conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Dwinnell v. Fed. Express Long Term Disability Plan\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:14-cv-01439 (JAM),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201371254\">\n    2017 WL 1371254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Conn. Apr. 14, 2017), which also arose in circumstances indistinguishable from those at bar. Judge Meyer's analysis is persuasive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   That is not to say that I cannot imagine that some kinds of remands might be for highly technical or clerical reasons, such that the act of remand may not qualify\n   as \"some degree of success on the merits.\" But that is not the nature of the remand here. The remand here for vocational analysis is essential to a full and fair consideration of plaintiff's claim. It is sufficient to constitute \"some success on the merits\" for plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Judge Meyer's description mirrors the circumstances in the case at bar. Judge Meyer went on to calculate the amount of the\n   <em>\n    Dwinnell\n   </em>\n   recoverable attorney's fees in the light of the\n   <em>\n    Chambless\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Having urged to no avail the nature of the remand as an absolute bar to any attorney's fees for Benjamin, Oxford dusts off the same argument and urges it again, this time as a\n   <em>\n    Chambless\n   </em>\n   factor discretionary basis for the Court to deny any fees. I find the argument no more persuasive in this context than in the earlier one.

Plaintiff has not overcome the burden of demonstrating that selecting Kantor &amp; Kantor LLP had likely produced better results because they specialized in ERISA and eating disorders, and so the Court declines to depart from the forum rule based on the ERISA sub-speciality claimed by Plaintiff. However, the Court does recognize that having counsel within the ERISA field likely produced a better result over a general litigator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Connecticut has a number of attorneys who specialize in ERISA.

The Court declines to do so as Defendant has not shown that Plaintiff's refusal to voluntarily remand the case was in bad faith or otherwise an attempt to \"pad\" billing hours. Plaintiff claims that every effort was made to keep the fee request reasonable, including not asking \"to be compensated for her time in preparing her motion for [attorney's] fees or this reply.\" Pl. Reply at 10. Because Plaintiff is not asking for fees related to preparing this motion, the Court will deduct such fees from its calculations of reasonable hours. Namely, the Court will not include the 5.9 total hours billed by Attorney Sessions on the motion for attorney's fees, beginning with the July 27, 2018, email exchange with Plaintiff regarding said motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kantor Decl. at 90. The itemized list of billed tasks seems appropriate in all other respects. Accordingly, Defendant must compensate for 8.7 hours of Attorney Kantor's work and 78.2 hours of Attorney Sessions's work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   To calculate the total lodestar, the Court will multiply Attorney Kantor's adjusted rate of $425 by the 8.7 hours billed and Attorney Sessions's adjusted rate of $375 by 78.2 hours billed to reach $33,022.50 in reasonable attorney's fees.
