She alleges that she is entitled to unpaid overtime wages, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees stemming from defendant Trans Express Inc.'s violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq.

Law \u00a7 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. (\"NYLL\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-3). On January 18, 2019, Trans Express moved to dismiss the complaint, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Mot., ECF No. 11). Trans Express contends that this action is barred by the doctrine of res judicata because of a previous proceeding in Queens Civil Court, Small Claims Part 45 (\"small claims court\"). (Def. Br. at 2, ECF No. 11-5). For the reasons set forth below, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As its name suggests, Trans Express is a transportation services company headquartered in Brooklyn. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9). Simmons was employed by Trans Express as a driver from April 2012 to April 2013 and, subsequently, from June 2016 to June 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11-12). She alleges that, throughout her employment there, she was paid at a regular rate of approximately $ 12.50 an hour and worked more than 40 hours a week but was not paid at an overtime rate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 16). As a result, plaintiff claims that Trans Express violated the unpaid overtime provisions of FLSA, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-37), as well as several provisions of NYLL, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-48). She seeks a declaratory judgment, along with an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, interest, costs, and attorney's fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to bringing this lawsuit, it is undisputed, in August 2018, Simmons filed suit against Trans Express in small claims court, seeking \"monies arising out of nonpayment of wages.\" Summons,\n   <em>\n    Simmons v.

On September 4, 2018, after trial before a small claims arbitrator, Simmons was awarded a $ 1,000 judgment, along with a $ 20 disbursement.

Its motion rests entirely on the doctrine of res judicata. According to that doctrine, \"[a] final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.\"\n   <em>\n    Rivet v.

The issues presented by the judgment awarded to Simmons are (1) whether res judicata applies to judgments rendered in small claims court, (2) whether an exception to res judicata applies due to the limits on recovery in small claims court, and (3) whether plaintiff's present claims arise from the same facts as the previous action and could have been raised in that action.

The legislative bill jacket, completed at the bill's signing, which compiles the pertinent legislative history, makes clear that the very purpose of the bill was to clarify that \"[t]he true intent of section 1808 is to make clear that a small claims judgment has no collateral estoppel or 'issue preclusion' effect in a subsequent proceeding.\" N.Y.

Moreover, by awarding Simmons damages, the small claims court declared her rights, and, consequently, a declaratory judgment from this Court would not afford her any relief she has not already obtained. In general, a declaratory judgment action \"cannot be maintained [when] it parallels [a plaintiff's] other claims and merely seeks a declaration of the same rights and obligations.\"\n    <em>\n     Campione v.
