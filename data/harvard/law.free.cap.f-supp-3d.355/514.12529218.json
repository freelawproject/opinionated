MOON, SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiffs in this putative class action have sued the Commissioner of Virginia's Department of Motor Vehicles, challenging the constitutionality of Virginia Code \u00a7 46.2-395 (\" \u00a7 46.2-395\"), which requires the automatic suspension of drivers'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   licenses for failure to pay state court fines and costs. Plaintiffs have moved for a preliminary injunction to: (1) enjoin the Commissioner from enforcing \u00a7 46.2-395 ; (2) remove current suspensions of Plaintiffs' driver's licenses imposed under \u00a7 46.2-395 ; and (3) enjoin the Commissioner from charging a fee to reinstate Plaintiffs' licenses where there are no other current restrictions on their licenses. The parties briefed the motion, and the Court held an evidentiary hearing and oral argument. Based on the current record, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their procedural due process claim because the Commissioner suspends licenses without an opportunity to be heard. The motion for a preliminary injunction will therefore be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case was first filed with this Court in July 2016 and was dismissed without prejudice. (Dkt. 57). The Fourth Circuit dismissed Plaintiffs' appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Stinnie v. Holcomb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=734%20F.%20App%27x%20858\">\n    734 F.App'x 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 869 (4th Cir. 2018). The Fourth Circuit explained that this Court's \"grounds for dismissal [did] not clearly indicate that no amendment in the complaint could cure the defects in the plaintiff's case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=734%20F.%20App%27x%20858\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=734%20F.%20App%27x%20858\">\n    at 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted). Accordingly, on remand, in September 2018, Plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   submitted an amended complaint, alleging that \u00a7 46.2-395\"as written and as implemented by the [Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (\"DMV\") Commissioner Richard D. Holcomb (\"Commissioner\") ] ... is unconstitutional on its face for failing to provide sufficient notice or hearing to any driver before license suspension.\" (Dkt. 84 \u00b6 5). Plaintiffs also allege \u00a7 46.2-395 is \"unconstitutional as applied to people who cannot afford to pay due to their modest financial circumstances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In their motion for preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \"(1) enjoin the Commissioner from enforcing Section 46.2-395 against Plaintiffs and the Future Suspended Class Members without notice and determination of ability to pay; (2) remove any current suspensions of [Plaintiffs'] driver's licenses imposed under Section 46.2-395 ; and (3) enjoin the Commissioner from charging a fee to reinstate the Plaintiffs' licenses if there are no other restrictions on their licenses.\" (Dkt. 90 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In assessing the appropriateness of this relief, the Court finds the following facts from the preliminary injunction record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Plaintiffs are Virginia residents whose licenses have been suspended due to failure to pay court fines and costs. (Dkt. 90 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   2. Plaintiff Adrainne Johnson, a resident of Charlottesville, Virginia, is the mother of three children. (Dkt. 113 (Hr'g Tr.) at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   3. Johnson's license has been suspended \"off and on since 2016,\" and is currently suspended for nonpayment of court fines and costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   4. Due to her lack of a license, Johnson struggles to get to the grocery store or meet her daughter's medical needs, and cannot take her son to, or attend, any of his sporting events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17, 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   5. Johnson's lack of a license has impacted her employment, causing her to lose a job, preventing her from being hired, and frustrating her opportunities for advancement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   6. Johnson and her children currently share a single family home with another family, but with a better paying job, she would be able to improve her living situation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   7. Johnson's current income does not leave her with any money after necessary expenses each week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   8. At no time did any court inquire how much Johnson could afford to pay or inform her about the availability of alternatives to payments, and she has been unable to provide the requested amount. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-41).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   9. Plaintiffs Stinnie and Adams find themselves in similar circumstances. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 90-3 and 90-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   10. Stinnie describes a \"cycle of debt, license suspension, and more debt and incarceration for driving while suspended\" that prevents him from improving his employment situation or meeting basic needs, such as medical treatment and housing. (Dkt. 90-3 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   11. Adams's license is currently suspended because she cannot afford to pay court fines and costs. (Dkt. 90-4 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   12. Adams's \"rare and serious blood disorder\" has prevented her from maintaining steady employment, and although she initially made payments on her court debt, she could not \"keep [them] up and support [herself] and [her] son on [her] limited income.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   13. At no time before the suspension of their licenses were Stinnie or Adams asked about their financial circumstances or reasons for non-payment. (Dkt. 90-3 at 3; dkt. 90-4 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   14. Plaintiffs Bandy and Morgan's licenses were suspended for several years and were recently reinstated, but both face imminent suspension because they cannot afford the payments required by their payment plans. (Dkt. 90-6 at 1; dkt. 90-7 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   15. Bandy and Morgan are currently on installment plans established to pay state court fines and costs, but they face the decision of providing necessities for their families, such as water and electricity, or paying monthly installments. (Dkt. 90-6 at 2; dkt. 90-7 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   16. There was no inquiry into Bandy or Morgan's financial circumstances before or after their licenses were suspended. (Dkt. 90-6 at 1; dkt. 90-7 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   17. Loss of a driver's license adversely affects people's ability to gain and maintain employment, often leading to a reduction in income. (Hr'g Tr. at 112).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   18. When suspension occurs pursuant to \u00a7 46.2-395, neither a judge nor a clerk enters an order suspending the license or notifies the debtor of a license suspension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-47, 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   19. Rather, DMV inputs suspensions based on electronic data automatically transmitted from state court computers to DMV. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46, 146-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   20. At sentencing hearings in Virginia state courts, the presiding judge assesses court fines and costs as well as their due date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-46)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   21. At (or within five days of) sentencing, a criminal defendant is provided with a notice indicating possible license suspension if he or she does not pay assessed costs by a designated date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45; 67; 73; \u00a7 46.2-395(C) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   22. After sentencing, the court's disposition, assessed costs, and the due date of any assessed costs are entered into the Circuit Case Management System (\"CCMS\") and the Financial Accounting System (\"FAS\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Hr'g Tr. at 43-44, 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   23. The date that costs become due may be years after the date of sentencing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46, 113).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   24. If a person fails to pay assessed costs within 40 days of the designated date, a fines and costs indicator is automatically, electronically transmitted to DMV.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46, 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   25. This information is transmitted from CCMS to the Court Automated Information System, a \"system-to-system\" process between DMV and the Supreme Court Office of the Executive Secretary (\"OES\") that allows DMV to routinely receive data from state courts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52, 134).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   26. Data goes from CCMS to the Court Automated Information System through OES without any action by the courts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   27. At the time of default, neither the judge nor the clerk enters an order regarding a driver's license suspension for failure to pay fines and costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   28. At the time of default, no notice is sent to the licensee regarding the pending license suspension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47, 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   29. Through a computer-generated report, the state court clerk's office is able to review information sent to DMV, but the court does not contact defaulted individuals to inform them of license suspensions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54-55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   30. The computer-generated report is used only to ensure that payments or non-payments\n   are appropriately recorded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   31. Upon receipt of information regarding non-payment of court fines and costs, DMV records a license suspension and sends a letter informing the defaulted individual that his or her license has been suspended for failure to pay court debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   32. The driving transcript updated by DMV is made available to law enforcement, courts, and attorneys, and can be obtained by insurance companies, as well as individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   33. Without DMV's actions, an individual's driving record would not reflect a suspension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   34. State courts have the authority to create installment payment plans to aid individuals struggling to pay court fines and costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112); Va. Code \u00a7 19.2-354.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   35. DMV can remove a license suspension based on failure to pay court fines and costs where a debtor provides a certified copy of a court-approved payment plan. (Hr'g Tr. at 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   36. The court does not take any action to notify a debtor that he is missing payments, and once a payment is missed, the individual's information is transmitted to DMV through the process described above.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-32; (Hr'g Tr. at 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   37. The process of establishing payment plans differs among Virginia courts, but in all jurisdictions, when a payment is missed, a debtor's data is automatically transmitted to DMV through OES and the Court Automated Information System. (Hr'g Tr. at 61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   38. When a license is suspended for nonpayment of fines and costs, it cannot be reinstated until the individual pays DMV's $145 reinstatement fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 140).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   39. DMV has sole responsibility for the collection of the reinstatement fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   40. DMV retains $45 of the reinstatement fee, and the remaining $100 goes to the Trauma Center Fund. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   41. Without DMV's actions, a license could not be suspended under \u00a7 46.2-395. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Commissioner's Jurisdictional Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In response to Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, the Commissioner argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction for three reasons: (1) the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine precludes this Court from exercising jurisdiction over the claims; (2) Plaintiffs lack Article III standing; and (3) the Commissioner is immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The\n    <em>\n     Rooker-Feldman\n    </em>\n    Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine precludes federal district courts from exercising appellate jurisdiction over a state court's final judgment in a judicial proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia Courts of Appeals v.

The doctrine does not apply \"if a plaintiff in federal court does not seek review of the state court judgment itself but instead presents an independent claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Thana v.

The evidence shows that Plaintiffs do not suffer the challenged injury due to a state court judgment. Rather, Plaintiffs contest the actions of a state executive officer-the Commissioner-in suspending their driver's licenses. Insofar as the state court acts at all, Plaintiffs do not challenge that action but bring an independent claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The \"essence of a judicial proceeding\" is the adjudication and rejection of a party's arguments.\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194952\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/462/#p481\">\n    460 U.S. at 480-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194952\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/462/#p481\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no judicial proceeding surrounding license suspension under \u00a7 46.2-395. The court's only action is the assessment of fines and costs associated with an underlying conviction. Forty days after payment of those costs is due, without notification to affected individuals and without entrance of a court order, data is automatically, administratively, and electronically transmitted to DMV.\n   <em>\n    DMV\n   </em>\n   , in turn, enters a suspension on the debtor's driving record. The suspension is an administrative action, and \"state administrative decisions, even those that are subject to judicial review by state courts, are beyond doubt subject to challenge in an independent federal action.\"\n   <em>\n    Thana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334582\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/314/#p320\">\n    827 F.3d at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Additionally, the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine does not bar this Court's review of a facial challenge to the statute because Plaintiffs present an independent claim. \"A state-court decision is not reviewable by lower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing the decision may be challenged in a federal action.\"\n   <em>\n    Skinner v.

Accordingly, where an individual challenges the constitutionality of a statute, rather than the judgment enforcing the statute, they have brought an independent claim to which\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exxon Mobil Corp. v.

License suspension occurs 40 days after the assessed due date, which can be years after sentencing,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section I, \u00b6 14, but an appeal must occur within 10 days of a criminal conviction in a general district court, ( Va. Code. \u00a7 16.1-132 ), and within 30 days of a conviction in a circuit court. ( Va. Code \u00a7 8.01-675.3 ). Similarly, for those who have their licenses suspended for failure to make payments according to a payment plan, the time to appeal has long since passed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 113). At the time of appeal, as at the time of sentencing, license suspension is not a certainty, nor is the licensee aware of unforeseen circumstances that might make him unable to satisfy debt when it is due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Finally, the statutory mechanism that allows a sentencing court to reduce or forgive court debt addresses the imposition of fines and costs, but does not provide Plaintiffs with an opportunity to be heard on the fact of license suspension. Va. Code \u00a7 19.2-354.1. Suspension will still occur if the licensee fails to pay the reduced amount prescribed by the court. Additionally, if the court forgives already-defaulted debt, the licensee would still have to provide the Commissioner with proof of satisfaction and pay DMV's $145 reinstatement fee. There is no evidence that DMV provides a process that allows for waiver of this fee due to inability to pay. Because none of these procedures allow Plaintiffs to\n   be heard on their alleged default and later suspension, the procedures fail to present the necessary opportunity to contest the suspension. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are likely to show the second\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in their favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The final\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor, the government's interest, also weighs in Plaintiffs' favor. The Commissioner argues that \"the Commonwealth of Virginia has an interest in continuing to have some enforcement mechanism to go with those fines that have been assessed by the juries.\" (Hr'g Tr. at 185). There is no indication that a loss of license will incentivize individuals to pay court fines and costs where those individuals simply cannot afford to pay. In practice, the loss of a driver's license adversely affects people's ability to gain and maintain employment, often resulting in a reduction of income. (Hr'g Tr. at 106; 112). This deprives individuals of means to pay their court debt, hindering the fiscal interests of the government.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that \u00a7 46.2-395, on its face, does not provide a meaningful opportunity to be heard regarding license suspension. Therefore, Plaintiffs demonstrate a likelihood of success on their claim that \u00a7 46.2-395 violates procedural due process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

First, where Plaintiffs' constitutional rights are being violated, there is a presumption of irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    Davis v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11679553,2338934\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/158/1342/\">\n    158 F.3d 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1343 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (citing\n   <em>\n    Ross v. Meese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1716251\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/818/1132/#p1135\">\n    818 F.2d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1135 (4th Cir. 1987) ). Irreparable harm is clearly demonstrated through the facts surrounding Plaintiff Stinnie. (Dkt. 90-3). Plaintiff Stinnie received a loan and paid the court debt underlying his initial license suspension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). However, before receiving the loan that allowed him to pay his court fines and costs, he drove to essential medical appointments, resulting in a conviction for driving on a suspended license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3). He appealed his conviction, but lost, resulting in his current license suspension, despite the fact that he has paid the initial underlying court debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Money could not solve the injury Plaintiff Stinnie suffered, the suspension of his license made it impracticable, if not impossible, for him to carry out necessary tasks, and payment of underlying court fines and costs did not alleviate his situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The other plaintiffs suffer similar harm. For example, Plaintiff Johnson testified that she is unable to take her daughter to necessary medical appointments, or attend her son's athletic events, causing stress for both her and her children. (Hr'g Tr. at 17). She further testified that, because of her suspended license she has lost a job and been denied another. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Similarly, without driving, Plaintiff Adams could not travel to and from work, her chemotherapy appointments, or her son's medical specialist. (Dkt. 90-4 at 2). Money alone would not alleviate Plaintiffs' harms or release Plaintiffs from the cycle of hardships caused by \u00a7 46.2-395. The only remedy for Plaintiffs' injury is the restoration of their licenses and the prevention of further suspensions under \u00a7 46.2-395.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As for the remaining factors, the balancing of the equities and public interest, Fourth Circuit precedent \"counsels that 'a state is in no way harmed by issuance of a preliminary injunction which prevents the state from enforcing restrictions likely to be found unconstitutional. If anything, the system is improved by such an injunction.' \"\n   <em>\n    Centro Tepeyac v. Montgomery Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062482\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/184/#p188\">\n    722 F.3d 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 191 (4th Cir. 2013) (citing\n   <em>\n    Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v.

The harm \u00a7 46.2-395 poses to Plaintiffs outweighs any harm the issuance of a preliminary injunction would cause others. While the Court recognizes the Commonwealth's interest in ensuring the collection of court fines and costs, these interests are not furthered by a license suspension scheme that neither considers an individual's ability to pay nor provides him with an opportunity to be heard on the matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fowler v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-11441,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206379676\">\n    2017 WL 6379676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (E.D.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   For the reasons discussed, the Court finds it likely that Plaintiffs will succeed in establishing that \u00a7 46.2-395 violates procedural due process.
