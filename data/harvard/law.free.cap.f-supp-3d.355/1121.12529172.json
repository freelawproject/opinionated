DHS was not able to swiftly reunite some adults with their children upon completion of the adult's criminal proceedings.

The Border Network for Human Rights (\"BNHR\") is a self-described advocacy group that organizes marginalized border communities in the region around El Paso, Texas and Las Cruces, New Mexico to defend and promote human and civil rights in the border region.

They claim that the Zero-Tolerance Policy is causing or will imminently cause, irreparable humanitarian harm, particularly to families and children who are being detained for extended periods in prisontype environments and in addition, cause irreparable harm to the communities and environment of the Southwest in that it will require Defendants to construct and operate dozens of new detention facilities in this region. Put simply, Plaintiffs urge the Court to enjoin DOJ from prosecuting illegal entry offenses to stop the building of new detention facilities which will house detainees during prosecution of those offenses. Plaintiffs contend that the zero-tolerance policy and the temporary detention policy for family migrants who entered illegally must be set aside because the policies are in fact substantive rules that were issued without offering the public notice of the opportunity to comment on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Amended Complaint contains three claims for relief:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) Notice and Comment Violation under the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00b6 553 regarding Defendants' zero-tolerance policy;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (2) Notice and Comment Violation regarding Defendants' temporary detention policy; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (3) Violation under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00b6 552(a)(1) (\"FOIA\") In this motion, Defendants move to dismiss all of Plaintiffs' claims for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Plaintiffs do not expand on what they mean by \"subject to unlawful restrictions,\" but the Court assumes the phrase refers to Defendants' policies which subject immigrants to the immigration laws of the country, including the screening that is done for asylum applicants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Trump v.

However, the\n   <em>\n    Trump\n   </em>\n   case is factually distinguishable and does not provide Plaintiffs with support for claiming an injury-in-fact. In\n   <em>\n    Trump\n   </em>\n   , three plaintiffs who were U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents had relatives from Iran, Syria and Yemen applying for immigrant or nonimmigrant visas. They alleged that the executive proclamation kept these relatives from seeking to enter the country at the time and were therefore affected by the entry of suspension.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/#p2416\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The three individual plaintiffs assert another, more concrete injury: the alleged real-world effect that the Proclamation has had in keeping them separated from certain relatives who seek to enter the country\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case do not state a cognizable interest for two reasons.

The court found this alleged injury to be \"no different from that of any American who would enjoy meeting unidentified aliens of a particular nationality denied entry to the United States\" and concluded that it was unclear whether such a generalized and unspecific injury was adequate for standing purposes. The court in that case did not decide the injury-in-fact issue because plaintiffs had not satisfied the other two standing requirements of causation and redressability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329724,1643319\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/809/794/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Plaintiffs seek guaranteed asylum to previously deported individuals or other individuals seeking asylum, without scrutiny or screening-which is not a cognizable interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Therefore, Plaintiffs have not shown they have a concrete interest in ensuring that family members who were previously deported are not subject to unlawful restrictions if they subsequently return to the United States to seek asylum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    2. Reputational Interests\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs state that Plaintiffs have concrete personal, reputational, and dignitary interests that are being harmed by Defendants' policies. Many of Plaintiffs' members are immigrants or the children of immigrants (Plaintiffs do not clarify whether these members are present in the country legally or illegally). Seeing migrant families detained in their own backyard causes these individuals to feel as though they have been stamped with a badge of inferiority, causing them to experience severe emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 11-1 at 24, \u00b6 13. They also contend that they have been directly impacted by unlawful and discriminatory immigration enforcement practices and that the building of detention facilities at Fort Bliss will create distrust in the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs fail to make a showing of an injury-in-fact here as well for two reasons.

However, Plaintiffs have no cognizable interest in foreclosing the prosecution of immigration crimes simply because such prosecution may result in the separation of family members. To the extent that family members are separated, that is a consequence resulting from the commission of a crime rather than from Defendants' policies.

First, alleging unlawful discriminatory practices does not mean that unlawful discrimination actually occurred; and second, as the Court has just explained, feeling shamed or stigmatized because other illegal aliens are being prosecuted for committing immigration crimes is simply not a basis for standing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The Court assumes that Plaintiffs challenge only Defendants' family detention policy rather than the zero-tolerance policy since the prosecution of immigration would appear to have no relation to an alleged aesthetic or recreational injury. However, the Court's analysis would be the same even if both policies were being challenged in this category.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Public Citizen v.

It stands to reason that information cannot be \"obtained\" unless it is first requested-which means that a FOIA request (or something formally akin to it) is required in order to allege a FOIA claim. Plaintiffs cite to\n    <em>\n     Preminger v.

However, the plaintiff in\n    <em>\n     Preminger\n    </em>\n    had actually made a request to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (\"VA\") to initiate a rulemaking in order to define how veterans who reside on VA campuses will receive assistance in registering and voting. Plaintiffs in this case have not alleged they have gone to the extent of making a request under FOIA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
