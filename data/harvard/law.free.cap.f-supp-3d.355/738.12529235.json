(Administrative Record (R.) 463-69). He claimed that he became disabled as of November 13, 2007 (R. 463), due to lumbar spine damage, tendinitis in both arms, groin injury, esophageal problems, prostate problems, and arthritis in both knees and back. (R. 529). Over the ensuing several years, Mr. S.'s application was denied at the initial, reconsideration, and administrative law judge (ALJ), levels. (R. 133-211). The appeals council then remanded his claim back to the ALJ for another decision, directing the ALJ to make another residual functional capacity finding with appropriate support from the record, and to obtain evidence from a vocational expert as to the effect of Mr. S.'s limitations on the occupational base and whether he has any transferable skills. (R. 17, 214-15). On remand, the ALJ again found that Mr. S. was disabled as of August 6, 2015, which was after his insured status expired on June 30, 2014, meaning he was entitled to SSI but not DIB. (R. 17-30). It is the ALJ's decision that is before the court for review.

Mr. S. asks the court to reverse and remand the Commissioner's decision, while the Commissioner seeks an order affirming the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    ARGUMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. S. is 58 years old, and was nearly 55 at the time his insured status expired. (R. 17, 463). He is in the army reserves and has work experience as a corrections officer, a teaching assistant and, most recently, in sales at a home and garden center, which involved heavy work and a great deal of lifting, and was semi-skilled. (R. 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. S.'s medical record is massive, weighing in at over 1200 pages (R. 609-1891), covering treatment for a laundry list of impairments, mostly due to problems with his back. But, as is often the case, and according to the parties in this case, very little of it is pertinent. Mr. S. cites to no more than two dozen pages of medical evidence to support his argument for overturning the ALJ's decision. (Dkt. # 16, at 1-2, 8-9). The Commissioner cites to a similar amount. (Dkt. # 20, 1, 5-9). Accordingly, we shall discuss only those treatment records and medical findings that the parties tell us matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After an administrative hearing - at which Mr. S., represented by counsel, and a medical expert and a vocational expert testified - the ALJ determined he was disabled, but not before the expiration of his insured status. The ALJ found that Mr. S. had severe lumbar degenerative disc disease and lumber radiculopathy. (R. 20). The ALJ found that other impairments - edema, diverticulitis, and personality disorder - were non-severe. (R. 20-22). His mental impairment left him with only mild limitations in his ability to interact with others and maintain concentration, persistence, or pace, and\n   no limitations on his ability to understand, remember, and apply information, or adapt and manage himself. (R. 20). None of Mr. S.'s impairments, singly or in combination, amounted to a condition that met or equaled an impairment assumed to be disabling in the Commissioner's listings. (R. 22). In reaching that conclusion, the ALJ specifically considered listing 1.04, for disorders of the spine. (R. 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The ALJ then determined that Mr. S could perform \"light work ... except: can stand and walk in combination up to one hour at a time and a total of four hours in an eight-hour workday; cannot climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; can occasionally climb ramps and stairs, balance, bend, stoop, kneel, crouch and crawl; cannot work around hazards such as unprotected heights and exposed moving mechanical parts; cannot tolerate concentrated exposure to extreme cold; must avoid even moderate exposure to excessive vibration; and is precluded from commercial driving.\" (R. 22). Along the way, the ALJ said that he found Mr. S.'s \"medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms; however, [his] statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not fully supported for reasons explained in this decision.\" (R. 23). The ALJ based this conclusion on the medical record, and Mr. S.'s sporadic work history prior to his alleged onset date. (R. 23-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The ALJ then summarized the medical record and assessed reports from doctors. He gave great weight to the opinion given by the medical expert at the administrative hearing, as the expert was familiar with the regulations and his opinion was consistent with the weight of the objective medical findings. (R. 23-24). The ALJ gave some weight to the opinion from the doctor who examined Mr. S. for the agency, but felt Mr. S. was more restricted in keeping with the findings of the medical expert and agency reviewing physicians. (R. 25). The ALJ assigned the opinions from the reviewing agency physicians substantial weight as they were generally consistent with the weight of the medical evidence. (R. 26). The ALJ gave limited weight to an opinion from a doctor from Veterans' Affairs because it was unsigned and was pertinent to military service as opposed to work. (R. 26-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, the ALJ gave considerable weight to the opinion of Mr. S.'s treating physician as to Mr. S.'s ability to stand and walk in an eight-hour day, saying it was consistent with his treatment and objective findings. Still, at the same time, the ALJ rejected those portions of the opinion that had to do with how long Mr. S. could walk or sit at one time, saying that was arbitrary and not supported by objective testing. (R. 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The ALJ rejected that portion of the doctor's opinion that concluded Mr. S. had to change positions frequently: sit for only 20-30 minutes at a time, stand for only 5-10 minutes at a time, and walk for 30-45 minutes at a time. He also rejected the doctor's recommendation that Mr. S. take unscheduled breaks during the workday and rest for 15-20 minutes during the workday. (R. 27). The ALJ felt these limitations were arbitrary and based on subjective complaints rather than objective findings. (R. 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The ALJ then found that, as of August 6, 2015, the date on which Mr. S. reached \"advanced age\" under the regulations, the Medical-Vocational Guideline directed a conclusion that Mr. S. was disabled under the Act. (R. 29). Prior to that date, because the Guidelines would have directed a finding of \"not disabled\" if Mr. S. had the capacity for a full range of light work, the ALJ relied on the testimony of the vocational\n   expert as to whether there were jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy that Mr. S. could do. As the vocational expert stated that he could be a cashier (60,000 jobs), a rental clerk (50,000 jobs), or an inspector (45,000 jobs), the ALJ determined that, prior to August 6, 2016, Mr. S. was not disabled and not entitled to benefits under the Act. (R. 29-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   If the ALJ's decision is supported by substantial evidence, the court on judicial review must uphold that decision even if the court might have decided the case differently in the first instance. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).

He submits that the ALJ failed to follow the applicable Social Security Ruling regarding the effect his limited capacity for light work has on the occupational base available to him. Second, he contends that the ALJ improperly failed to give controlling weight to the opinion of his treating physician. And, finally, he argues that the ALJ failed to adequately assess his allegations regarding the effects of his impairments.

He maintains that Social Security Ruling 83-12 required the ALJ to determine whether his limitations caused a slight or significant erosion of the occupational base, as his capacity for work fell between light work and sedentary work. Where, as here, a claimant's exertional capacity level falls between two rules that direct opposite conclusions - \"not disabled\" at the higher exertional level and \"disabled\" at the lower exertional level - the Ruling directs ALJs to consider whether:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   a. An exertional capacity that is only slightly reduced in terms of the regulatory criteria could indicate a sufficient remaining occupational base to satisfy the minimal requirements for a finding of \"Not disabled.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   b. On the other hand, if the exertional capacity is significantly reduced in terms of the regulatory definition, it could indicate little more than the occupational base for the lower rule and could justify a finding of \"Disabled.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Ruling goes on to advise that, where \"the individual's exertional limitations are somewhere 'in the middle' in terms of the regulatory criteria for exertional ranges of work,\" and \"more difficult judgments are involved as to the sufficiency of the remaining occupational base,\" the ALJ should consult a vocational expert. SSR 83-10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20WL%2031251\">\n    1983 WL 31251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   While it's clear the ALJ followed the Ruling here - he relied on vocational expert testimony that there were significant numbers of jobs Mr. S. could perform - Mr. S. insists that there must be a specific finding from the ALJ as to whether Mr. S.'s additional limitations had a slight or significant effect on the work base. [Dkt. # 16, at 5-6]. Why? The ALJ consulted a vocational expert, as recommended by SSR 83-12, and he cited examples of over 150,000 jobs Mr. S. could perform despite his limitations. In other words, in the parlance of SSR 83-12, \"the remaining occupational base ... [is] sufficien[t].\" To accept\n   Mr. S.'s argument is to reject common sense, which has a significant role to play in all litigation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   including Social Security litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castile v.

Dr. Purohit filled out a form from Mr. S.'s attorney in October of 2014. At that time, Dr. Purohit had been treating Mr. S.'s back impairment for 5 years, seeing him about every 6 months. (R. 891). The doctor reported that Mr. S. had pain in his elbow, back, knees, and legs; that it was constant; and that it was 4/5 on a scale of 0 to 10 in severity. (R. 892). Dr. Purohit cited the clinical signs that supported his opinion as: \"decreased sensation R leg, 4/5 motor exam bilaterally, normal gait &amp; reflexes.\" (R. 892). The symptoms in his legs dated back to 1980 and back to 2007 in his back. (R. 892). They might occasionally interfere with concentration. (R. 893).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Dr. Purohit felt that, despite his impairments, Mr. S. retained the functional ability to work in a competitive environment, at least in a sedentary occupation, on a full-time basis. (R. 893). The doctor explained that this was due to a mild disc bulge, but that he could limit his activity. (R. 893). Dr. Purohit said that Mr. S. could sit for 20-30 minutes at a time, stand for 5-10\n   minutes at a time, and walk for 30-45 minutes at a time. (R. 893). Mr. S. would need to take 3 breaks a day and one 15-20 break to rest. (R. 894). But he would miss work less that once a month. (R. 893). He could constantly lift up to 10 pounds. Up to 20 pounds frequently, and up to 50 pounds occasionally. (R. 895).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The ALJ gave the bulk of Dr. Purohit's opinion \"considerable weight\", noting that she had seen him several times during the relevant time period, and that her estimates on his ability to stand, walk, and sit for a total of four hours each in a day, and his ability to lift were consistent with the course of treatment and the overall medical record. (R. 27). But the ALJ stopped short of accepting that Mr. S. could only sit for 30 minutes at a time, walk for 30 minutes at a time, and stand for 10 minutes at a time. (R. 27). The ALJ explained that as no function studies had been performed, and the objective clinical findings didn't support such limitations, there was no way to make such estimates other than to take Mr. S.'s word for it (R. 27) - which he was not obligated to do and which he declined to do in light of the record evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. S. complains that the ALJ failed to supply sound reasoning for his treatment of Dr. Purohit's opinion. As a treating physician, Dr. Purohit's opinion was entitled to controlling weight unless the ALJ set forth \"good reasons\" for assigning it lesser weight.\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

While an ALJ must consider the factors found in 20 C.F.R. Secs. 404.1527(c) ; 416.927(c), he need only \"minimally articulate\" his reasoning.

The ALJ satisfied this standard in this case by noting the length and frequency of treatment, the supportability of Dr. Purohit's opinion, and the consistency of the opinion with other medical evidence in the record.

[Dkt. # 16, at 10]. That's not true, and distortion of the record is not a basis to overturn an ALJ's decision. The ALJ recited Dr. Purohit's objective findings, but a 4/5 motor exam, normal gait, and intact reflexes, are not much to support an ability to stand or sit for the limited periods claimed by Mr. S. And the doctor cited nothing else - nor does Mr. S., for that matter. [Dkt. # 16, at 10-12]. Dr. Purohit may have reviewed the rest of the evidence as Mr. S. claims she did [Dkt. # 16, at 9], or she may not have. The ALJ never said she didn't - although there's no indication in the record that she did; Mr. S. certainly doesn't point to any. It was up to him to develop and support his arguments with references to the record.\n   <em>\n    Bunn v. Fed. Deposit Ins.

In July, Mr. S. was an hour late for his appointment and brought the form from his attorney for Dr. Purohit to fill out. (R. 855, 1092). His only complaints were urinary frequency, dysphagia, and peeling skin on his hands. (R. 855, 1092). It was noted that Mr. S. had a history of joint and back pain, and decreased sensation over L5 distribution, but assessment was left until the next visit. (R. 858-59, 1094-95). In October 2014, the doctor noted a history of varicocele /epididymitis and lower back pain, (R. 1253). Right leg strength was slightly diminished to 4/5, left leg strength was normal. (R. 1254). Right leg sensation was decreased. (R. 1254). And that's it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Mr. S. complains that, while the ALJ specifically recounted these findings in his opinion (R. 25-26), the case should be remanded because he then did not specifically say he was discounting Dr. Purohit's opinion based on these two specific reports. [Dkt. # 21, at 7]. What an extraordinary exaltation of form over substance.

It's not clear what more Mr. S. requires. Whatever it may be, it is not reasonable or realistic.

But, again, given the clinical findings the doctor cited when prompted, what else could provide a basis? As the ALJ pointed out, Dr. Purohit didn't cite to any function study. In the doctor's October 2014 notes, she states that she \"observed patient do the activities required by the paperwork and documented accordingly.\" (R. 1255).

(R. 893-94). As the ALJ pointed out, there is no record of any such function study. Thus, the only possible source for these very specific limitations would be Mr. S. himself.
