Plaintiff, HDMG Entertainment, LLC, planned to sponsor and produce an entertainment event known as the Swamp Fox Biker Bash (the \"Bash\") that was scheduled to occur at the Swamp Fox Entertainment Complex in Marion, South Carolina between May 8 and 15, 2015. Compl. at \u00b6 3 [ECF No. 1-1]; Answer at \u00b6 3 [ECF No. 27]. As the Court has previously noted, Plaintiff is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware and doing business in Marion County, South Carolina; its principal place of business is in Milford, Connecticut, and its managing member and president is Robert Hartmann, Sr. (\"Hartmann\"), who is a citizen and resident of Connecticut. [Jan. 25, 2017 Order at 1, ECF No. 14]. Plaintiff leased the Swamp Fox Entertainment Complex from HSGCHG Investments, LLC (\"HSGCHG\"), a real estate holding company in which Hartmann has a 90% ownership interest. Hartmann Aff. at 1 [ECF No. 72-1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In order to produce the Bash, Plaintiff needed a communications system in the venue to provide Internet access, phone service, and other services crucial to the event's success; without it, the Bash could not occur. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J at 3. As owner of the venue, HSGCHG entered into a contract with Time Warner Cable (\"Time Warner\") on January 23, 2015, to put a communications system in the venue. Resp. Mem. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 10 (citing Time Warner Contract [ECF No. 72-6] ). On January 29, 2015, as the work began, Time Warner estimated a March 14, 2015 completion date for the communications system. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 5 (citing Jan. 29, 2015 Email [ECF No. 66-3] ). However, this initial estimate was not met. On April 6, 2015, Time Warner told Plaintiff that the installation would occur on April 27. [Apr. 6, 2015 Email, ECF No. 72-8]. However, on April 22, 2015, Time Warner informed Hartmann that \"due to unforeseen delays in construction[,]\" installation would not be completed until after the Bash was scheduled to occur, forcing cancellation of the Bash. [Apr. 22, 2015 Letter, ECF No. 72-11]; Compl. \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff had sought event cancellation insurance for the Bash. On February 18, 2015, Gabriel Gornell, executive producer of the Bash, completed an event cancellation application (\"the Application\") with Ascend Insurance Brokerage (\"Ascend\") on Plaintiff's behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Application [ECF No. 67-4]. In response to Question 12 on the Application-\"Will the event require construction work?\"-Plaintiff answered in the negative, noting that \"[e]lements will require re-certification. But the stage and buildings are fully constructed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. In response to Question 19-\"Have all necessary arrangements for the successful fulfillment of the performance(s) or event(s) to be insured been made?\"-Plaintiff answered in the affirmative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. In response to Question 26-\"Are there any other material facts or items of information with regard to the proposed performance(s) or event(s) which should be disclosed? (A material fact is one likely to influence acceptance or assessment of this proposal by Underwriters)\"-Plaintiff answered in the negative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The Application includes a declaration \"that non-disclosures\n   or misrepresentation of a material fact will entitle the company to void the [i]nsurance\" and Plaintiff's affirmation that \"the information provided in this application ... is true\" and no material facts were withheld.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 28, 2015, Defendant, Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London Subscribing to Policy No. L009082,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   issued Plaintiff an event cancellation insurance policy with a March 26, 2015 effective date\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"Policy\") under which Defendant agreed to indemnify Plaintiff up to $4,490,480.00 for losses resulting from cancellation of the Bash; in exchange, Plaintiff paid a $47,635.12 premium. Compl. at \u00b6 4; Answer at \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Policy [ECF No. 72-2 at 2]. The Policy has certain requirements for coverage to apply, as well as seventeen exclusions and nineteen conditions. Policy [ECF No. 72-2 at 3, 5, 8-14]. The Policy was underwritten by HCC Speciality Underwriters, Inc. (\"HCC\") from its office in Massachusetts and delivered to Plaintiff's principal place of business in Milford, Connecticut. [Jan. 25, 2017 Order at 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 30, 2015, Plaintiff provided a notice of claim to HCC, explaining that it was forced to cancel the Bash due to Time Warner's failure to timely complete the communications system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Claim [ECF No. 68-1 at 3]. Defendant began to investigate Plaintiff's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 20, 2015 Letter at 1 [ECF No. 68-4]. On August 27, 2015, Plaintiff provided its proof of loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 72-12. On April 15, 2016, before a formal denial of the claim from Defendant, Plaintiff initiated this action by filing a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas for Marion County, South Carolina, asserting causes of action for breach of contract, statutory bad faith, and common law bad faith. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 11-22. On May 6, 2016, after further investigation, Defendant denied Plaintiff's claim, explained the grounds for denial, provided a notice of rescission of the Policy due to alleged material misrepresentations in the Application, and returned Plaintiff's premiums paid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Rescission at 1 [ECF No. 68-10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 20, 2016, Defendant timely removed the action to this Court under diversity jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. On May 27, 2016, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for improper venue or in the alternative to transfer venue, which the Court denied on January 25, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14. Subsequently, on March 6, 2017, Defendant filed an answer and counterclaim for: (1) a declaratory judgment that Defendant had no duty to indemnify because no coverage was triggered under the Policy; and (2) a declaratory judgment for rescission of the Policy due to Plaintiff's alleged intentional concealment and misrepresentation of material facts. Answer &amp; Countercl. at \u00b6\u00b6 22-60 [ECF No. 24]. On April 2, 2017, Plaintiff filed an answer to Defendant's counterclaim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 27. On May 30, 2018, Defendant filed the instant motion for summary judgment. On June 18, 2018, Plaintiff filed a response in opposition, and on June 25, 2018, Defendant filed a reply thereto.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 72 &amp; 73.

Because the parties do not dispute what this provision means, the Court need not decipher Condition 13 to find the parties' intent. Rather, because the parties' briefs make clear their intention for Connecticut law to govern the Policy, the Court holds that Connecticut law governs the Policy and the causes of actions arising thereunder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Despite agreeing that Connecticut law governs the Policy, Plaintiff still asserts that South Carolina law applies to its bad faith claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. Mem. in Opp'n at 31 (\"[Plaintiff] respectfully submits South Carolina law applies to its second claim ...\"). In seeking this exception, Plaintiff provides no basis for why South Carolina governs only the bad faith claims but not the breach of contract claim. Because the parties' briefs interpret the Policy as if it is governed by Connecticut law, the Court believes that the parties intend for Connecticut law to apply to the Policy and any causes of action arising under it; Plaintiff's assertion to the contrary is not adequately supported.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

However, because Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the bad faith claims under South Carolina or Connecticut law, as explained below, no further discussion is necessary regarding which law applies to the bad faith claims. Next, the Court uses Connecticut law to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate on the breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In moving for summary judgment, Defendant first asserts that Plaintiff cannot show that its loss is covered by the Policy. Mem. in.

Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   J. at 19, 20. In response, Plaintiff maintains that the loss was unexpected and beyond its control because: (1) the Policy does not require Plaintiff to select a venue with any particular system; (2) the Policy does not require Plaintiff to seek alternatives within any particular time frame, and when Time Warner informed Plaintiff that installation would not be timely completed, Plaintiff immediately sought alternatives to no avail; and (3) Time Warner's contract was with HSGCHG, not Plaintiff, so there was no contractual relationship for Plaintiff to have control over Time Warner's delay or to have expected or foreseen the delay. Resp. Mem. in Opp'n at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As stated, Plaintiff, as the insured, bears the initial burden of showing that its loss is covered.\n   <em>\n    Pasiak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491510\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/888/\">\n    173 A.3d at 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Court, construing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving Plaintiff, looks to whether Plaintiff has proffered evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   First, there is a genuine dispute as to whether the fact that Plaintiff chose a venue without a communications system means that the subsequent loss resulting from the failure to timely install one was expected and within Plaintiff's control. These principles of unexpectedness and lack of control encompass Defendant's argument about the fortuity doctrine, which is \"a fundamental requirement in insurance law that the insurer will not pay for a loss unless the loss is 'fortuitous,' meaning that the loss must be accidental in some sense[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20Conn.%20App.%20405\">\n    150 Conn.App. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20A.3d%201054\">\n    90 A.3d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1059 (2014) (citation omitted). Plaintiff has proffered evidence through the affidavit of Hartmann, Plaintiff's president and managing member, such that a reasonable juror could find that the loss was unexpected, beyond Plaintiff's control, and accidental in some sense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hartmann Aff. at 2-3 [ECF No. 72-1] (\"The initial installation schedule was for the cable installation to be completed on March 14, 2015.\") (\"Time Warner told me that 'due to unforeseen delays' the fiber optic cable would not be installed by April 17, 2015, 'as previously communicated.' \") (\"HDMG had no control over Time Warner's failure to install the fiber optic cable under its agreed-upon schedule.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, although Plaintiff knew at the time it applied for insurance that a communications system was needed in the venue, there is a genuine dispute as to whether the work to create the system constituted \"construction\" as contemplated by the Application or mere \"installation\" about which the Application did not inquire. The Application does not define construction, and the correspondence in this case reveals interchangeable use of \"construction\" and \"installation\" when referring to the work. Plaintiff contends that the work was mere installation, while Defendant asserts that it was construction. See Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 30; Resp. Mem. in Opp'n at 28-30. Whether the work was \"construction\" that Plaintiff materially misrepresented in the Application or mere \"installation\" is a question of fact for the jury. For the same reason, there is also a genuine dispute as to whether Plaintiff knowingly made a material misrepresentation in the Application entitling Defendant to rescission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Third, Plaintiff disputes Defendant's allegation that Plaintiff failed to seek alternatives when delays first began, asserting that it \"contacted any fiber optic or communications provider [Plaintiff's officers] could think of to see if there was an alternative to the Time Warner fiber optic cable.\" Hartmann Aff. at 3. Moreover, Plaintiff contends that there was no alternative for postponing the Bash because it\n   was intended to occur contemporaneously with a nearby major biker festival.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Accordingly, a juror could find that Plaintiff properly sought alternatives to no avail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Fourth, there is evidence that Plaintiff did not contract with Time Warner; rather, HSGCHG, the company that owned the venue, did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Time Warner Contract at 1 [ECF No. 72-6]. There is, however, a genuine dispute as to whether Plaintiff had control over or knew about or should have foreseen Time Warner's delays since there is some overlap of Plaintiff's officers and agents with the owners of HSGCHG and there was communication between Time Warner and Plaintiff's officers and agents about the work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mar. 3, 2015 Email [ECF No. 66-8] (Time Warner subcontractor informing Hartmann and Gornell about tight schedule); Apr. 9, 2015 Email [ECF No. 66-9] (Time Warner providing update to Hartmann and Gornell); Apr. 21, 2015 Letter [ECF No. 66-11] (Time Warner subcontractor informing Plaintiff that work would not be completed before the bash); Apr. 22, 2015 Letter [ECF No. 66-10] (Time Warner informing Hartmann about inability to complete work before the Bash). Thus, the degree of control and knowledge Plaintiff had is a question of fact for the jury. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has proffered sufficient evidence such that there are genuine disputes with respect to coverage. Therefore, the Court denies summary judgment on the issue of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exclusions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Next, the Court examines Defendant's argument that it is entitled to summary judgment on the grounds there is no dispute that one or more exclusions apply, relieving Defendant of liability. \"When construing exclusion clauses, 'the language should be construed in favor of the insured unless it has a high degree of certainty that the policy language clearly and unambiguously excludes the claim.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pasiak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491510\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/888/\">\n    173 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   896 (citing\n   <em>\n    Vt.

J. at 21-24 (quoting Policy [ECF No. 72-2 at 9-11] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court briefly examines whether Plaintiff has proffered evidence creating a genuine dispute with respect to these exclusions. First, Defendant contends Exclusions 6, 7, and 12 apply because Plaintiff's cancellation of the Bash was \"related to its own financial failures, lack of support, and breach of its duty of care,\" claiming that: (1) \"[c]orrespondence shows a lack of cash flow and outstanding bills months before cancellation\"; (2) \"[n]umerous production vendors withdrew due to lack of payment\"; and (3) \"[Plaintiff] was not able to secure sufficient attendance to properly fund the event.\" Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 22. Defendant does not articulate how Exclusion 12 applies, and it appears to rely on the same allegations about lack of cash flow, outstanding bills, withdrawal of vendors, and insufficient attendance for its contention that Plaintiff breached its duty of care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20A.2d%20672\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, Plaintiff cites Hartmann's affidavit where he states that: (1) Plaintiff had sufficient financial resources to support the Bash; (2) even though some vendors withdrew, they were promptly replaced and no withdrawal caused the cancellation; and (3) Plaintiff did not expect its target market to purchase many tickets in advance. Resp. Mem. in Opp'n at 14, 18. Accordingly, there are genuine disputes with respect to Exclusions 6, 7, and 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Second, Defendant contends Exclusion 8 applies because the Bash's cancellation \"was related to its own failure to make necessary arrangements,\" claiming: (1) Plaintiff \"did not complete necessary contracts nor ensure that its necessary South Carolina requirements were met for the successful fulfillment of the event\"; (2) \"performers were not paid with required deposits\"; (3) Plaintiff \"did not make the necessary payments or sell sufficient tickets as projected to prevent the withdrawal of its event caterer\"; and (4) Plaintiff \"failed to act at the onset of construction delays ... to prevent further delays by Time Warner.\" Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 22-23. In response, Plaintiff asserts that \"[a]ccording to the Hartmann affidavit, all 'necessary' or 'preliminary' arrangements were made for a successful [Bash],\" noting: (1) \"HSGCHG's engagement of Time Warner to install the [communications system] was one of the preliminary arrangements necessary for the [Bash]\"; (2) \"[t]here is no evidence any lack of license or permit existed, or caused the cancellation\"; and (3) contracts for security, liquor, first aid, vendors, concessions,\n   tents, temporary state, and temporary lighting were \"in process\" as of April 22, 2015, when Time Warner informed Plaintiff that it could not complete the communications system. Resp. Mem. in Opp'n at 19-20. Accordingly, there is a genuine dispute with respect to Exclusion 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, Defendant contends Exclusion 9 applies because \"the absence of a fiber optic communications system was a pre-existing condition known to [Plaintiff].\" Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 23. In response, Plaintiff asserts that \"HSGCHG reasonably and prudently engaged Time Warner to install the [communications system]. When it notified HSGCHG that it could not do so by the required deadline, alternatives were reasonably and prudently explored, with negative results and the [Bash] had to be cancelled.\" Resp. Mem. in Opp'n at 22. Accordingly, there is a genuine dispute with respect to Exclusion 9. In summation, Plaintiff has proffered evidence, mostly through Hartmann's affidavit and the evidence cited therein, to create genuine disputes with respect to the alleged exclusions. Therefore, the Court denies summary judgment on the issue of exclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Conditions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Next, the Court examines Defendant's contention that it is entitled to summary judgment because there is no dispute that Plaintiff failed to satisfy two conditions in the Policy. Defendant points to these conditions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     SECTION IV - CONDITIONS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Duties in the Event of a Loss\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   You must see that the following are done in the event of covered loss or damage:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   a. Upon the discovery of any event likely to give rise to a claim under this policy you shall give us prompt notice. Include a description of such loss;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n   </strong>\n   You shall at all times do all things necessary to avoid or diminish a loss under this policy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    15. Obligation to Rearrange\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   You have an obligation to use your best efforts to rearrange any insured event that has been subject to\n   <strong>\n    cancellation\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    abandonment\n   </strong>\n   in order to mitigate any loss covered hereunder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 25 (citing Policy [ECF No. 72-2 at 12, 14] ). Defendant asserts that coverage is barred because Plaintiff failed to satisfy Conditions 2 and 15, contending these are conditions precedent to coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24, 27. These appear to be duties to mitigate and notify when a loss occurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Regardless, Plaintiff has proffered evidence showing that: (1) Time Warner informed Plaintiff on April 22, 2015, that it could not timely complete the communications system; (2) upon learning this, Plaintiff and HSGCHG \"contacted any fiber optic or communications provider [they] could think of to see if there was an alternative\"; and (3) Plaintiff provided Defendant its notice of loss on April 30, 2015. Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. for Summ. J. at 26-28; Hartmann Aff. at 3. Whether these facts and this evidence show that Plaintiff gave prompt notice and mitigated its loss pursuant to the Policy is a question of fact for the jury. Accordingly, the Court denies summary judgment on the issue of conditions. Because there are genuine disputes with respect to the issues of coverage, exclusions, and conditions, the Court denies summary judgment on the breach of contract cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Bad Faith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As previously noted, the parties' briefs analyze the Policy as if it is governed by Connecticut law; nevertheless, Plaintiff contends that South Carolina law applies to its bad faith claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, regardless of which state's law applies, Plaintiff cannot succeed on its bad faith causes of action, as explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot prevail on its bad faith claims because the evidence shows that Defendant diligently processed Plaintiff's claim, considered all information submitted in the Application and with the proof of loss, relied on Policy provisions to support its position, conducted site visits and interviews while investigating, and reviewed thousands of documents. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 28-29. In opposing summary judgment, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant decided to deny Plaintiff's claim before Plaintiff even submitted the claim and before any investigation took place. Resp. Mem. in Opp'n at 31. Regardless of which state's law applies, neither of Plaintiff's assertions is supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For the first assertion that Defendant denied its claim before the claim was even submitted, Plaintiff cites to an April 28, 2015 email sent to Plaintiff by Paul Bassman, Ascend's insurance broker, who stated that \"a claim denial ... would likely be the result if [Plaintiff] initiated a claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32 (citing ECF No. 67-13). However, Ascend is not the entity that denied Plaintiff's claim; in fact, Ascend was Plaintiff's insurance broker and agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shetucket Plumbing Supply Inc. v.

Accordingly, Plaintiff's first assertion does not support a showing of bad faith by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   For the second assertion that Defendant denied the claim before any investigation, the evidence is undisputed that Defendant did in fact investigate before denying the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 30, 2015 Letter\n   [ECF No. 68-4]; July 16, 2015 Email [ECF No. 68-3]; July 30, 2015 Letter [ECF No. 68-5]; Sept. 16, 2015 Letter [ECF No. 68-6]; Nov. 30, 2015 Letter [ECF No. 68-7]; Mar. 23, 2016 Letter [ECF No. 68-8]; Notice of Rescission [ECF No. 68-10]. Even assuming no investigation by Defendant, the Connecticut Supreme Court has \"decline[d] to extend bad faith actions to allegations based solely on a failure to investigate where the investigation is not mandated under the policy,\" noting that \"[i]nsurers disclaiming their duty to defend or indemnify under the policy, subsequent to a failure to investigate, risk extracontractual liability for consequential economic and noneconomic losses.\"\n   <em>\n    Capstone\n   </em>\n   , 67 A.3d at 990.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Here, the Policy does not mandate an investigation by Defendant, but it imposes certain duties on Plaintiff when Defendant elects to investigate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy [ECF No. 72-2 at 12] (emphasis added) (\"[Plaintiff] shall cooperate with us and,\n   <em>\n    upon our request\n   </em>\n   and expense, shall attend hearings and trials and shall assist in effecting settlement, in securing and giving evidence, in obtaining the attendance of witnesses, in the investigation or settlement of the claim[.]\").
