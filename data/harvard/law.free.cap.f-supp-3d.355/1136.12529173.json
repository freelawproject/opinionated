Defendants argue that a majority of Plaintiffs fail to allege standing and move to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1). Defendants also move to dismiss each of the Plaintiffs' fifteen claims under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. After careful consideration of the arguments set forth in the briefs and oral argument, the court now GRANTS Defendants' 12(b)(1) Motion. And, as explained below, the court GRANTS in part, and DENIES in part, Defendants' 12(b)(6) Motion. The conclusion the court was required to reach based on the pleadings and arguments made in this case should not be read as an affirmation that Wells Fargo's conduct was appropriate or correct. Indeed, the facts presented indicate a massive system wide failure by the bank. Many of the claims here, however, fail to meet pleading requirements and must be dismissed as discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this action, Plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo employees used customers' confidential information to open fraudulent accounts in the customers' names to meet sales goals, and that Wells Fargo encouraged, knew of, or should have known of this practice. Plaintiffs nationwide have made very similar allegations against Wells Fargo, and have filed suit in other districts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Wells Fargo Fraudulent Account Opening Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522616\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/1360/#p1361\">\n    282 F.Supp.3d 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1361 (U.S. Jud. Pan. Mult. Lit. 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of those actions filed in other districts,\n   <em>\n    Jabbari v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-2159-VC (N.D. Cal.) is the most relevant to this case. Because this case is so closely tied to\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   , the court discusses the history of\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   where relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs filed their action against Wells Fargo on May 13, 2015,\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-2159 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 20, 2017), (ECF No. 1), making it the first-filed putative class action. Plaintiffs in this case filed this action on September 16, 2016. (ECF No. 2.) On November 3, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 15.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sometime around\n   February 16, 2017, this court received notice that the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (\"JPML\") would hear argument on whether to create an MDL action from the several cases filed against Wells Fargo related to fraudulent account openings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 51.) On February 28, 2017, this court stayed the case pending the JPML's decision. (ECF No. 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 28, 2017, the parties in\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   filed a Joint Notice of Settlement.\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-2159 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 20, 2017), (ECF No. 96.) On April 5, 2017, the JPML determined it would not order centralization due to the nationwide class settlement-in-principle reached by the parties in\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Wells Fargo Fraudulent Account Opening Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522616\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/1360/#p1361\">\n    282 F.Supp.3d at 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On that same day, Plaintiffs moved to lift the stay in this case. (ECF No. 55.) On April 13, 2017, this court heard argument from the parties regarding the propriety of lifting the stay in light of the pending\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   settlement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 58, 61.) The court ultimately lifted the stay. (ECF No. 60.) On June 7, 2017, the court held a hearing during which the court granted Plaintiffs' oral motion to amend their complaint. (ECF No. 67.) Plaintiffs filed their currently operative Third Amended Complaint on June 27, 2017. (ECF No. 69.) The Third Amended Complaint initially listed 76 named Plaintiffs, but through a series of voluntary dismissals, was eventually reduced to 57.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 8, 2017, the court in\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement in that case.\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-2159 (N.D. Cal. July 8, 2017), (ECF No. 165.) That order provided that the \"Settlement Class Members who do not opt out agree to release all claims that could have been asserted, or that arise out of the same transactions or occurrences as the claims against Wells Fargo entities that were or could have been asserted in [the\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   ] action.\"\n   <em>\n    Jabbari v. Wells Fargo &amp; Company\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-2159,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205157608\">\n    2017 WL 5157608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Cal. July 8, 2017). Later, the court in\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   entered an order setting the opt out deadline for February 19, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-2159 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 20, 2017), (ECF No. 176 at 4.) The opt out deadline is relevant here. Those who did not opt out of the\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   settlement are unable to pursue their claims in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 30, 2018, Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss the Third Amended Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). (ECF No. 144.) On February 12, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their Response. (ECF No. 149.) On February 26, 2018, Defendants filed their Reply. (ECF No. 151.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 14, 2018, the court in\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   entered an order granting final approval of the class action settlement.\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-2159 (N.D. Cal. June 14, 2017), (ECF No. 271.) Attached as \"Exhibit A\" to that order was a list of those individuals who had opted out of the\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   settlement.\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-2159 (N.D. Cal. June 14, 2017), (ECF No. 271 at 16-27.) That list contained the names of 967 individuals. (\n   <em>\n    See Jabbari\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-2159 (N.D. Cal. June 14, 2017), (ECF No. 271 at 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   court \"approve[d] that list, including those who filed untimely exclusions, as constituting the list of all Persons who have submitted timely requests for exclusion from the Settlement Class.\"\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-2159 (N.D. Cal. June 14, 2017), (ECF No. 271 at 8.) The order also included \"Exhibit B,\" a list of those individuals who \"filed both a claim and an exclusion,\" and for whom the court provided \"shall not be excluded unless they subsequently communicate their intent ... to withdraw their claim and not participate in the Settlement on or before July 7, 2018.\"\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-2159 (N.D. Cal. June 14, 2017), (ECF No. 271 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This court heard oral argument on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss on June 20, 2018. (ECF No. 159.) On July 31, 2018, the Plaintiffs filed a \"Request for the Court to take Judicial Notice.\" (ECF No. 160.) In this filing, Plaintiffs requested that \"the Court consider all proposed Plaintiffs as members of a potential class action\" because of appeals of the\n   <em>\n    Jabbari\n   </em>\n   case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 160 at 2.) Plaintiffs included no authority in support of their request. On August 7, 2018 the defendants filed an Objection to Plaintiffs' request, arguing that \"Plaintiffs' submission is not altogether clear with respect to the implications of the appeals in this action ....\" (ECF No. 161 at 2.) The court agrees and declines Plaintiffs' request.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Wells Fargo's conduct has also been the subject of investigations by Congress and wide-spread scrutiny by the media and other investigations. The court here must focus solely on the pleadings and merits of the arguments in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    Initially, Wells Fargo moved to compel arbitration and to stay ligation on the merits pending resolution of that motion. (ECF Nos. 24 and 29.) On November 29, 2017, after extensive briefing, argument and evidence, the court ordered a summary trial on the motion to compel arbitration. (ECF No. 114.) On December 26, 2017 Wells Fargo withdrew its motion to compel arbitration. (ECF No. 131.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    On August 16, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal of five Plaintiffs. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 81.) On August 25, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal of two more Plaintiffs. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 83.) On September 8, 2017 and September 13, 2017, Plaintiffs filed two more Notices of Voluntary Dismissal, each of a single plaintiff. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF Nos. 84 &amp; 85.) On January 12, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal of ten Plaintiffs. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 141.) After these dismissals, the Third Amended Complaint contained 57 named Plaintiffs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      ANALYSIS\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Remaining Plaintiffs\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    As explained above, the Third Amended Complaint initially listed 76 named Plaintiffs, but through a series of voluntary dismissals, the number was eventually reduced to 57. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF Nos. 69, 81, 83-85, &amp; 141.) And, as also explained above, only those Plaintiffs who opted out of the\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    settlement can proceed in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The court requested that Plaintiffs' attorneys provide a list of those Plaintiffs who opted out of the\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    settlement. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 156.) Plaintiffs' counsel provided a list, representing that 37 \"individuals have withdrawn from the\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    litigation.\" (ECF No. 157 at 2-3.) As explained below, only 33 individuals involved in this case opted out of the\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    settlement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Four individuals on the Plaintiffs' list of 37 should be removed-\"Nedelka Martinsen,\" \"Adrienne Thompson,\" \"Concepcion Powell,\" and \"Charles Jones.\" First, as Defendants point out, \"Number 33\" on that list, \"Nedelka Martinsen,\" \"was left off the Third Amended Complaint.\" (Tr. 18: 25;\n    <em>\n     also, compare\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 157 at 3\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 69.) Without \"Nedelka Martinsen,\" the number of Plaintiffs on Plaintiffs' counsel's list becomes 36.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Second, as the Defendants point out, Plaintiffs mistakenly \"repeat\" \"Number 31\" on their list, \"Adrian Thompson,\" \"under a different spelling\"-\"Adrienne Thompson.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. 18: 15-19\n    <em>\n     also, compare\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 157 at 3\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 69.) The court assumes that the person listed in the\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    court's Exhibit A as \"Adrienne Thompson\" is the \"Adrian Thompson\" from this case. Even under that assumption, the court must remove Plaintiffs' \"Number 12.\" This brings the list's total to 35.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Third, Defendants also pointed out at oral argument that \"Number 32\" on Plaintiffs' list, \"Concepcion Powell,\" is not listed on\n    <em>\n     Jabbari's\n    </em>\n    \"Exhibit A\" as a confirmed opt out, or Exhibit B as a possible opt out. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. 18: 22-24.) At oral argument, Plaintiffs did not respond to Defendants' argument on this point. The\n    court has independently confirmed that no one named \"Concepcion Powell\" is listed on the\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    court's Exhibit A or Exhibit B.\n    <em>\n     See Jabbari\n    </em>\n    , No. 3:15-cv-2159 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 20, 2017), (ECF No. 271 at 16-30.) Because the Plaintiffs did not respond to Defendants' argument, and because the court has confirmed that no one named \"Concepcion Powell\" is listed as having opted out, the court assumes Concepcion Powell did not opt out of the\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    settlement. Plaintiffs' list is reduced to 34.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Fourth, Defendants point out that \"Charles Jones\" \"is the person who the [Plaintiffs'] parenthetical states\" \"does not appear on [the\n    <em>\n     Jabarri\n    </em>\n    court's] opt out list Exhibit A,\" but for whom Plaintiffs' counsel \"attached what appears to be a copy of an opt out form.\" (Tr. 19: 7-9.) Defendants' counsel argued that Charles Jones' opt out form \"is not an effective opt out because it was not sent to the settlement administrator\" in\n    <em>\n     Jabarri\n    </em>\n    . (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. 19: 16-17.) Plaintiffs' counsel did not respond to this argument. Because Plaintiffs counsel did not respond to this argument, and because \"Charles Jones\" is not a name that appears on the\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    court's Exhibit A, the court assumes Charles Jones did not opt out of the\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    settlement. Plaintiffs' list is reduced to 33 individuals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    The court now turns to 3 individuals that the Plaintiffs acknowledged \"filed [an] opt-out and submitted [a] claim form.\" (ECF No. 157 at 3.) These individuals are \"Reza Kamali,\" \"Ralph McCoy,\" and \"Travis Ashby.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 157 at 3.) As explained above, the court in\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    provided that those Plaintiffs who \"filed both a claim and an exclusion,\" \"shall not be excluded unless they subsequently communicate their intent ... to withdraw their claim and not participate in the Settlement on or before July 7, 2018.\"\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    , No. 3:15-cv-2159 (N.D. Cal. June 14, 2017), (ECF No. 271 at 9.) For the purpose of resolving the present Motion, this court assumes that those three Plaintiffs communicated their intent to withdraw their claim. The court therefore assumes that they have opted out of the\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    settlement. The court proceeds under the assumption that there are 33 Plaintiffs remaining in this case who opted out of the\n    <em>\n     Jabarri\n    </em>\n    settlement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Article III Standing\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    As explained above, after the\n    <em>\n     Jabarri\n    </em>\n    settlement only 33 Plaintiffs remain. Defendants wrote their Motion to Dismiss prior to the settlement. At that time there were 57 Plaintiffs. In their Motion to Dismiss for lack of standing, Defendants argued that \"[t]he majority of the Plaintiffs-38 of the remaining 57 Plaintiffs ... do not allege any unauthorized accounts were ever opened in the names, that their information was ever improperly used or accessed by any Wells Fargo employee, or that they were subject to any improper sales practice.\" (ECF No. 144 at 24.) Defendants refer to these 38 Plaintiffs as the \"Bystander Plaintiffs.\" (ECF No. 144 at 24.) The court will refer to those individuals who did allege an unauthorized account was opened in their name as \"Wrongful Account Plaintiffs.\" Since many of the 57 remaining Plaintiffs (those Plaintiffs named in the Third Amended Complaint who did not file a voluntary dismissal) have not opted out of the\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    settlement, the number of Bystander Plaintiffs is no longer 38.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    At oral argument, Defendants' counsel stated that 20 Bystander Plaintiffs have opted out of the\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    settlement. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. 17: 14-15 (\"If you look at those 33 opt outs, of those 33 opt outs 20 are bystander plaintiffs, or bystander plaintiffs as we define the term, meaning they did not allege an unauthorized account was opened in their name.\").) But after reviewing the Third Amended Complaint, the court finds that there are 25 Bystander Plaintiffs and eight Wrongful Account Plaintiffs.\n   </p>\n   <pre id=\"p-32\"><strong>Plaintiff's Name</strong> <strong>Bystander</strong> <strong>Wrongful Account</strong> 1.

Plaintiffs' response is directly contrary to Defendants' argument that the Bystander Plaintiffs have \"not allege[d] any unauthorized account or improper sales practice in relation to them ....\" (ECF No. 144 at 27-28.) The question for the court is therefore whether the Bystander Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged an injury in fact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Even after construing the Third Amended Complaint in Plaintiffs' favor, the court concludes that the Bystander Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged an injury in fact. In paragraphs 125-581 of the Third Amended Complaint, the individual plaintiffs make factual allegations regarding their specific Wells Fargo accounts. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TAC \u00b6\u00b6 125-581, ECF No. 69 at 35-90). Within this portion of the Third Amended Complaint, the Bystander Plaintiffs do not allege any unauthorized accounts were opened in their names. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TAC \u00b6\u00b6 125-581, ECF No. 69 at 35-90). Nor do they allege that their identities were stolen. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TAC \u00b6\u00b6 125-581, ECF No. 69 at 35-90). Within this portion of the Third Amended Complaint, the Bystander Plaintiffs only allege that they would not have opened Wells Fargo accounts if the Wells Fargo employees who helped them open the accounts had told them about the ongoing fraud. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TAC \u00b6\u00b6 125-581, ECF No. 69 at 35-90). They do not allege any injury from opening the accounts, which apparently performed exactly as Plaintiffs expected and intended. Plaintiffs' argument appears to be they would not have done business with Wells Fargo if they had known about the unauthorized accounts opened for other customers, but have suffered no injury from the accounts they did open. The court agrees with the reasoning of those cases cited by Defendants that \"[t]he 'would not have shopped' theory fails to establish injury for purposes of standing.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Carlsen v.

And Plaintiffs did generally allege that \"Defendant used Plaintiffs' confidential information to open credit card accounts, savings accounts, loans, or other 'services or products,' without\n    Plaintiffs' knowledge or consent.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TAC \u00b6 657, ECF No. 69 at 114.) But even after construing the Third Amended Complaint in Plaintiffs' favor, the court cannot conclude that the Bystander Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged an injury because, without specific facts, these are conclusory statements that the court must disregard.

After dismissing the 25 Bystander Plaintiffs, only eight Plaintiffs remain. There is no factual basis from the Third Amended Complaint from which the court can conclude or reasonably infer that this class action will involve at least 100 members. First, the pool of potential plaintiffs has shrunk considerably after the court in\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    granted final approval of the class action settlement. The list of those individuals who the\n    <em>\n     Jabbari\n    </em>\n    court \"approve[d] ... as constituting the list of\n    <em>\n     all Persons\n    </em>\n    who have submitted timely requests for exclusion from the Settlement Class\" only contains 967 names.\n    <em>\n     See Jabbari\n    </em>\n    , No. 3:15-cv-2159 (N.D.

If those individuals are Bystander Plaintiffs, they would not be able to join this class action, as they would lack standing. Plaintiffs' counsel did not provide any convincing argument for this court to conclude that this class action would exceed 100 members. And the court is persuaded by Defendants' argument that there is reason to be skeptical that those individuals who opted out of one Settlement Class would be eager to join another.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Moreover, after carefully reviewing the Third Amended Complaint and the parties' pleadings related to the instant Motion to Dismiss, the court again finds there are not sufficient pleaded facts to conclude or reasonably infer that the amount in controversy will exceed $5,000,000. The alleged damages of the remaining Plaintiffs are minor and do not come close to $5,000,000. Put simply, Plaintiffs, who bear the burden, have not made an adequate showing that federal jurisdiction exists under \u00a7 1332(d).

Plaintiffs do not respond to Defendants' arguments. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 149 at 16.)

The court agrees with Defendants that here, Plaintiffs appear to refer to the Utah Consumer Sales Practices Act (UCSPA). Defendants make two arguments here. First, they argue that a claim under the UCSPA requires the consumer to have suffered a loss, and argue that \"[a]ll but\n    seven of the Plaintiffs fail to allege any loss ....\" (ECF No. 144 at 33) (citations omitted). Second, Defendants argue that \"to the degree Plaintiffs seek to maintain fraud-based claims under the USCPA, they fail to allege those claims with the required particularity.\" (ECF No. 144 at 33.) Again, Plaintiffs do not respond to Defendants' specific arguments. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 149 at 17.)

The SCA prohibits those who provide an 'electronic communication service' (ECS) or 'remote computing service' (RCS) to the public from divulging the contents of a subscriber's communications in certain circumstances.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiffs allege that \"[b]y failing to take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard sensitive private financial information, and requiring scrutiny of their own employees, Wells Fargo has knowingly divulged customers' private financial information that was carried and maintained on Wells Fargo's computing data bank services.\" (TAC \u00b6 610, ECF No. 69 at 103.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    In their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs \"have not alleged facts plausibly demonstrating that Wells Fargo provides an ECS or RCS to the public.\" (ECF No. 144 at 36.) Plaintiffs respond that Defendants \"are both an ... 'ECS' and ... 'RCS' provider.\" (ECF No. 149 at 18.) As support, Plaintiffs argue that Wells Fargo \"has its own messaging system\" that \"allows for customers to access and respond to messages sent from Wells Fargo.\" (ECF No. 149 at 18.) Plaintiffs further argue that Wells Fargo is a RCS provider because \"Wells Fargo provides, as part of its online banking services, several means by which a customer may use Defendants' \" \"processing of data\" \"to do something the customer could have done on its own.\" (ECF No. 149 at 19.) In their reply, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs made \"no such allegations in the Complaint, and so they cannot provide a basis to oppose dismissal.\" (ECF No. 151\n    at 8.) Defendants also argue that \"[e]ven assuming\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    that these services would constitute an ECS or RCS, Plaintiffs do not contend that Wells Fargo knowingly divulged the contents of any communication sent over them.\" (ECF No. 151 at 8.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The court agrees that even if Plaintiffs had included their arguments in the Third Amended Complaint, their claim would still fail. In order to be liable under section 2702(a)(1), the statute requires a \"person or entity\" to have \"divulge[d] ... the contents of a communication\n    <em>\n     while in electronic storage\n    </em>\n    ....\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs have not alleged that Wells Fargo divulged Plaintiffs' private financial information over \"its own messaging system.\" (ECF No. 149 at 18.) Plaintiffs' claim under 2702(a)(2)(A) also fails. In order to be liable under section 2702(a)(2)(A), the statute requires a \"person or entity\" to have \"divulge[d]\" \"the contents of any communication\n    <em>\n     which is carried or maintained\n    </em>\n    \" on a \"remote computing service.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2)(A) (emphasis added).

Additionally, some Plaintiffs have alleged that they \"suffered actual identity theft\" \"as a result of Wells Fargo's conduct\" and that Wells Fargo \"used Plaintiffs confidential information to open credit card accounts, savings accounts, loans, or other 'services or products' without Plaintiffs' knowledge of consent.\" (TAC \u00b6\u00b6 629, 657, ECF No. 69 at 14.) The access to this type of confidential information is sufficient to distinguish Wells Fargo customers from the general public.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Plaintiffs have alleged that Wells Fargo received a benefit from increasing the number of products existing customers had with Wells Fargo. And Plaintiffs have alleged that Wells Fargo fraudulently opened accounts in existing customers' names. The names and identities of existing Wells Fargo customers can therefore plausibly be said to have provided a benefit to Wells Fargo that is different from the benefit Wells Fargo would have received from the name and identity of a non-Wells Fargo customer-it allowed Wells Fargo to appear to come closer to its goal of increasing the number of products used by its existing customers. Defendants' 12(b)(6) motion seeking to dismiss Plaintiffs' Invasion of Privacy claim is therefore DENIED.

Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides,\n    in relevant part, that \"knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally.\" Further, the Tenth Circuit has held that \"[a]llegations of fraud may be based on information and belief when the facts in question are peculiarly within the opposing party's knowledge and the complaint sets forth the factual basis for the plaintiff's belief.\"\n    <em>\n     Scheidt v.

The question of whether a single Wells Fargo agent had the requisite knowledge to support a claim of fraudulent non-disclosure is the exact sort of question that Rule 9(b) allows to be \"alleged generally.\" The Wrongful Account Defendants \"contend[ed] that Defendants were fully aware of the gaming and fraud which were occurring at Wells Fargo\" on the date they opened their respective accounts. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TAC \u00b6\u00b6 165, 177, 240, 255, 337, 371, 400, and 408.) This satisfies Rule 9(b)'s requirement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The court also rejects Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs must specifically identify each Wells Fargo employee who created the initial accounts because Wells Fargo possesses this information. \"The purpose of Rule 9(b) is to afford defendant fair notice of plaintiff's claims ....\"\n    <em>\n     Schwartz v.

They have alleged what they should have been told-that Wells Fargo was using customer information to create unauthorized accounts. And they have alleged the consequences of that non-disclosure-that unauthorized accounts were opened in their names. Although the Wrongful Account Plaintiffs did not specifically identify a Wells Fargo agent who had knowledge of the fraudulent non-disclosure, based on a review of the entire Third Amended Complaint, and the systematic culture of corruption described therein, it is plausible that a Wells Fargo agent, such as an officer of the company, had the requisite knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    For these reasons, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Fraudulent Nondisclosure Claim is DENIED.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Claim 10 Unjust Enrichment\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Plaintiffs' tenth claim is titled \"Unjust Enrichment.\" (ECF No. 69 at 120.)

As discussed above, the court has concluded that the Wrongful Account Plaintiffs adequately pleaded a claim for fraudulent inducement. It is therefore plausible that the contracts are voidable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The court next considers whether the Wrongful Account Plaintiffs have alleged facts supporting the elements of the claim. As discussed above regarding Claim 3, the Wrongful Account Plaintiffs have alleged that they did confer a benefit to Wells Fargo. Their personal information allowed Wells Fargo to create unauthorized accounts, thereby allowing Wells Fargo to create the appearance that it was increasing the number of products/services that its existing customers had with Wells Fargo. Obviously Wells Fargo accepted this benefit, (accepting Plaintiffs' factual allegations as true), Wells Fargo engaged in massive nationwide fraud to increase its total number of accounts. It is plausible that allowing Wells Fargo to retain the benefit that the Wrongful Account Plaintiffs' information provided it would be inequitable. Thus, the Wrongful Account Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded a claim for unjust enrichment.

First, Plaintiffs argue that Wells Fargo violated the BHCA when it opened unauthorized accounts. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TAC \u00b6 706, ECF No. 69 at 122) (\"Plaintiffs allege that\n    in addition to the accounts that Plaintiffs were aware of, Defendants opened millions of unauthorized accounts, in violation to the anti-tying provisions contained in the BHCA.\"). Second, \"Plaintiffs assert Defendants required numerous Plaintiffs ... to purchase additional products, through their cross-sales and employee incentives, which falls within the prohibitions contained in BHCA Section 1972(1)(A-E).\" (TAC \u00b6 705, ECF No. 69 at 122.) The court addresses both of Plaintiffs' arguments in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    First, the court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs' first argument cannot satisfy the first element necessary to demonstrate a violation of \u00a7 1972. The first element requires Plaintiffs to demonstrate that Wells Fargo \"conditioned the extension of credit upon the borrower's obtaining or offering additional credit, property, or services to or from the bank.\"\n    <em>\n     Morales\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203746527\">\n     2016 WL 3746527\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3. The court agrees with the reasoning of the Sixth Circuit authority cited by Defendants that the first element requires evidence that the \"bank conveyed an intention\" to withhold extending credit or furnishing a service \"unless the\" customer \"fulfilled a 'prerequisite' of purchasing or furnishing some other product or service\" offered by the bank.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Highland Capital, Inc. v.

The court also agrees with Defendants that if they were opening accounts without Plaintiffs' authorization and consent, then Wells Fargo never conveyed any intention to withhold any service, meaning there was no \"condition,\" and therefore, no \"tying arrangement.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kenty v.
