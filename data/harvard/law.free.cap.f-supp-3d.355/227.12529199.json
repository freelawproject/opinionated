The Third Circuit has not addressed this question.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The facts alleged in plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff worked as a freight driver for BS Transportation from the winter of 1997 or 1998 to April 2009. Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6 21. In May 2009, plaintiff was rehired by BS Transportation and \"specifically hauled NASCAR fuel exclusively in conjunction with a contract between Defendant BS and Defendant Sunoco.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. Plaintiff's job responsibilities included loading oil at Sunoco's refinery located in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, on a weekly basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Beginning in early 2014, Sunoco employee Anthony Perillo \"began to make sexual advances toward Plaintiff when he traveled to the [Sunoco] blend plant to fill up with fuel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. Perillo's conduct began with sexual comments and hand gestures towards plaintiff \"at least once or twice a week\" when plaintiff would load fuel at the Sunoco plant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33-35. Sunoco employees, including Mark Frederick, Perillo's supervisor, were aware of Perillo's behavior \"but did nothing to stop it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 38, 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff \"begged ... Perillo to stop the remarks,\" but Perillo responded with more aggressive behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 41-42. Examples of this \"brazen and physical\" behavior include Perillo's \"brush[ing] past Plaintiff so as to make body contact\" and \"parading around in his under garments [sic].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 44-46. On or about August 10, 2016, Perillo \"grabbed Plaintiff by the buttocks with one hand[ ] and shoved Plaintiff into the trailer of [plaintiff's] freight car with his other hand\" and \"leaned into Plaintiff as he held him and asked 'Do you like that.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On or about the same day, August 10, 2016, plaintiff reported to Frederick that Perillo had been sexually harassing him and had just sexually assaulted him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 53-54. Frederick told plaintiff that he would \"make a report\" and \"take care of it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Later that day, Bruce Schunke, plaintiff's supervisor and owner of BS Transportation, contacted plaintiff and informed him that he had talked to Frederick and would \"handle the matter with Perillo\" and \"asked Plaintiff not to say anymore [sic] about it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 56-58. However, Schunke and Frederick\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   failed to investigate plaintiff's complaints, and Perillo remained employed at Sunoco.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After plaintiff's August 10, 2016 report, Perillo stopped his harassment until around the end of September 2016, when he \"began making sexual hand gestures toward Plaintiff once again.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63. Frederick \"continued to be present when the comments and gestures continued and again did nothing to investigate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68. Perillo also asked plaintiff why he had reported him, and \"threatened to bring his gun into the blend plant and kill everyone there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff reported to Schunke that Perillo had resumed \"making inappropriate sexual comments and gestures,\" but Schunke did not notify Sunoco of plaintiff's complaints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. Shortly after plaintiff's complaint of renewed harassment by\n   Perillo, plaintiff was \"constructively terminated.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70. As a result of the harassment, plaintiff alleges that he suffered pecuniary harm and severe emotional and physical distress.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff filed his initial Complaint on February 20, 2018. After motions to dismiss were filed by defendants BS Transportation and Bruce Schunke on June 21, 2018, and by defendants Sunoco and Mark Frederick on June 25, 2018, plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on July 12, 2018. Those defendants again filed motions to dismiss, and plaintiff thereafter filed a Second Amended Complaint on August 3, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's claims in the Second Amended Complaint are imprecisely plead. The Court concludes that, notwithstanding numerous pleading errors, plaintiff has attempted to assert the following claims: (1) Count I alleging sex discrimination and retaliation\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   under Title VII; (2) Count II alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin under Title VII; (3) Count III alleging sex discrimination under the PHRA;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) Count IV alleging retaliation under the PHRA; and (5) Count V alleging aiding and abetting under the PHRA. The claims in Counts I-IV are asserted against Sunoco and BS Transportation; the claims in Count V are asserted against all defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants BS Transportation and Bruce Schunke filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on August 31, 2018 (Document No. 24). Defendants Sunoco and Mark Frederick filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on September 6, 2018 (Document No. 25). Plaintiff responded to both motions to dismiss on September 20, 2018 (Document Nos. 27-28). Sunoco and Frederick filed a Reply on October 4, 2018 (Document No. 32).
