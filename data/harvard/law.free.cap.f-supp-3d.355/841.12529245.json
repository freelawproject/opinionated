Wells is a former deputy sheriff of Christian County, Missouri. In 2015, Defendant Brad Cole (\"Cole\") ran for Christian County Sheriff. Plaintiff, at that time a sergeant in the Christian County, Missouri, Sheriff's Department, publically endorsed an opponent of Cole. Cole was elected on August 4, 2015. On or about August 7, 2015, Cole assumed the duties of sheriff. That same day, Cole terminated Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff brings this lawsuit against Ray Weter, Hosea Bilyeu, and Ralph Phillips in their official capacities as Commissioners for Christian County, Missouri; against Cole in his individual capacity and official capacity as Christian County Sheriff; and against Christian County itself. (Doc. # 1, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3). In his action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated his First Amendment rights by terminating his employment because of his public support and endorsement of Cole's former opponent. (Doc. # 1, \u00b6\u00b6 22-35). Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, punitive damages, reinstatement, \"other equitable relief,\" and attorney's\n   fees. (Doc. # 1, \u00b6 35). Defendants bring the present motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), asserting that this Court should dismiss Plaintiff's complaint because Defendant Cole is entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

But the distinctions Defendants identify between the Minnesota deputy sheriffs in\n   <em>\n    Shockency\n   </em>\n   and Missouri deputy sheriffs do not change the outcome in this case.
