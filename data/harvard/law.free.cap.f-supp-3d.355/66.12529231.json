Tisbury Towing is a marine transportation company and is regulated by the Massachusetts State Implementation Plan (\"SIP\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   310 C.M.R. \u00a7 7.00 ; D. 41-2 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; D. 44-3 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. For at least twenty-five years, Tisbury Towing has owned a single hull barge called the Rando 200. D. 41-2 \u00b6 6; D. 44-3 \u00b6 6; D. 44-3 at n.1. Under the SIP, the Rando 200 qualifies as a \"marine tank vessel,\" D. 41-2 \u00b6 6; D. 44-3 \u00b6 6, defined as \"any marine vessel [ ] capable of carrying liquid bulk cargo in tanks,\" 310 C.M.R. \u00a7 7.00. Until December 31, 2015, the Rando 200 was used to transport gasoline from the Tisbury Towing pier in New Bedford to Martha's Vineyard. D. 41-2 \u00b6 7; D. 44-3 \u00b6 7. Because the Rando 200 transported \"organic liquids,\" Tisbury Towing was subjected\n   to the \"Marine Volatile Organic Liquid Transfer\" regulation, pursuant to the SIP, commencing from its 2000 approval until December 2015, when its' operation ceased. D. 41-2 \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   310 C.M.R. \u00a7 7.24(8)(a). Under this regulation, no person may load a marine tank vessel unless it is \"vapor tight\" or is loaded at less than atmospheric pressure. 310 C.M.R. \u00a7 7.24(8)(e)(1). Here, the transfer at issue could not be done at less than atmospheric pressure\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   so Tisbury Towing's compliance with the regulation turns upon whether the \"vapor tight\" condition was met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 8, 2011, gasoline was transferred from a tanker trunk into the Rando 200. D. 41-2 \u00b6 9; D. 44-3 \u00b6 9. Tisbury Towing asserts that this transfer was a \"planned test of the barge, Rando 200, for the purpose of complying with all the applicable regulations.\" D. 44-3 \u00b6 9. Daniel Gavin (\"Inspector Gavin\") and Steven Risi (\"Inspector Risi\") from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection \"(MassDEP\"), William Osbahr (\"Inspector Osbahr\") and Michael Looney from the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), Raymond Colicci (\"Colicci\") and Nate Pierce from the United States Coast Guard (\"Coast Guard\") and Captain Paul Bangs (\"Captain Bangs\"), captain of the Rando 200 at Tisbury Towing observed this loading event. D. 41-2 \u00b6 9; D. 44-3 \u00b6 9. This loading event revealed that the Rando 200 was not \"vapor tight through any of the three available methods set forth in the SIP.\" D. 41-2 \u00b6 10; D. 44-3 \u00b6 10; 310 C.M.R. \u00a7 7.24(8)(e)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is, Tisbury Towing neither provided documentation of a vapor-tightness pressure test or vapor-tightness leak test conducted in the 12 months prior to the loading event nor conducted a vapor-tightness leak test during the event. D. 44-3 \u00b6 10. Moreover, during the loading event, \"EPA inspector [ ] Osbahr and MassDEP inspector [ ] Gavin (\"Inspector Gavin\") heard an audible hiss, indicating the presence of a leak, from a pressure vacuum valve.\" D. 41-2 \u00b6 15; D. 44-3 \u00b6 15. Both Captain Bangs and Inspector Obahr smelled gasoline, indicative of a vapor leak. D. 41-2 \u00b6 16; D. 44-3 \u00b6 16. With a device called a Flame Ionization Detector,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   EPA Inspector Obahr confirmed volatile organic compound (\"VOC\") vapors on the Rando 200 that exceeded 10,000 parts per million (\"ppm\") coming from the high velocity pressure vacuum valve. D. 41-2 \u00b6 17; D. 44-3 \u00b6 17. EPA inspectors also detected and confirmed emissions leaks from the valve using an infrared video camera. D. 41-2 \u00b6 18; D. 44-3 \u00b6 18. Accordingly, the \"inspectors detected and confirmed the presence of a leak through auditory, olfactory, visual and technological means.\" D. 41-2 \u00b6 19; D. 44-3 \u00b6 19. As a result, the Coast Guard issued an order on November 8, 2011 to \"make repairs prior to loading further cargo onto the Rando 200.\" D. 41-2 \u00b6 20; D. 44-3 \u00b6 20. Tisbury Towing contends that it complied with this order. D. 44-3 \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Moreover, Tisbury Towing did not comply with the requirement to submit an Emissions Control Plan to MassDEP within\n   the requisite time frame. 310 C.M.R. \u00a7 7.24(8)(f) ; D. 41-2 \u00b6 21; D. 44-3 \u00b6 21. An Emission Control Plan is necessary to ensure that a facility like Tisbury Towing's \"will not cause or contribute to a condition of air pollution or a violation of any other regulation.\" 310 C.M.R. \u00a7 7.18(20)(g). Within 180 days of the Rando 200's first entry into service or the effective date of the applicable regulation, whichever is later, Tisbury Towing was required to submit such plan to the MassDEP. 310 C.M.R. \u00a7 7.18(20)(a)(1) ; D. 41-2 \u00b6 21; D. 44-3 \u00b6 21. Since the Rando 200 had been operating since at least 1992 and the regulation became effective upon the EPA's approval of it on April 11, 2000, Tisbury Towing's plan was due no later than October 8, 2000. D. 41-2 \u00b6 21; D. 44-3 \u00b6 21. As of November 8, 2011, when the loading event described above occurred, Tisbury Towing still had not submitted this plan. D. 41-2 \u00b6 22; D. 44-3 \u00b6 22. It submitted a draft Emissions Control Plan to the EPA on June 17, 2014, but this draft failed to comply with the minimum requirements of SIP regulations. D. 41-2 \u00b6 24; D. 44-3 \u00b6 24. The EPA, MassDEP, Coast Guard and Tisbury Towing subsequently exchanged drafts and comments and Tisbury Towing eventually submitted a revised draft on May 27, 2016, which was approved by MassDEP on April 7, 2017. D. 41-2 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26; D. 44-3 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     R.M.

Packer owns and operates a Bulk Fuel Facility (the \"Facility\") in Vineyard Haven, also on Martha's Vineyard, where \"[g]asoline and other organic liquids are stored in above-ground tanks and disbursed through a loading rack into tanker trucks for distribution.\" D. 46-2 \u00b6 2; D. 48-3 \u00b6 2. Absent air pollution control equipment and practices, the pumping of liquid gasoline into the tanker trucks can displace vapors within the trucks. D. 46-2 \u00b6 3; D. 48-3 \u00b6 3. These vapors include VOCs and hazardous air pollutants like benzene, toluene and ethylene. D. 46-2 \u00b6 4; D. 48-3 \u00b6 4. Given the concerns about releasing ozone into the air,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2050.9\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 50.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50.10, 50.15 and 50.19 ; D. 46-2 \u00b6 4; D. 48-3 \u00b6 4, with its potential adverse effects on the respiratory system, the EPA regulates these emissions. D. 46-2 \u00b6 4; D. 48-3 \u00b6 4. As a result of an EPA administrative action in 2002, R.M. Packer installed emissions control equipment, including a vapor capture system and a secondhand carbon-based Vapor Recovery Unit manufactured by McGill Company. D. 46-2 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9; D. 48-3 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. The equipment was installed by Bryer Enterprises and periodically inspected and maintained by Robert Bryer, a principal at Bryer Enterprises. D. 46-2 \u00b6 9; D. 48-3 \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 10, 2013, the EPA observed a pressure vacuum relief valve emitting VOC vapors via an infrared video camera, which revealed that R.M. Packer had not collected and disposed of all vapors discharged during the transfer of gasoline. D. 46-2 \u00b6 11; D. 48-3 \u00b6 11. The pressure vacuum relief valve, when properly functioning and maintained, is designed to \"prevent a tank rupture, arising from a high pressure within the system, or an implosion, resulting from a vacuum within the system.\" D. 46-2 \u00b6 12; D. 48-3 \u00b6 12. Neither high pressure nor vacuum conditions were present during the June 10, 2013 inspection thereby indicating that the pressure vacuum relief valve was not functioning properly and had not been properly maintained.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2050.9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, one of the two carbon beds, used to absorb VOC vapors, appeared to emit more VOCs than the other, suggestive of a possible problem with the equipment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2050.9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thomas Levanduski, a technician from John Zink Company, LLC inspected the Facility on July 16, 2013 and wrote a report\n   summarizing his observations.

D. 41-1 at 9. It is undisputed that during the loading event on November 8, 2011, Tisbury Towing provided no proof of vapor tightness under any of the three methods specified under the regulation and the presence of a leak was confirmed through auditory, olfactory, visual and technological means by the inspectors present, D. 41-2 \u00b6 19; D. 44-3 \u00b6 19.

Packer is liable for failing to operate in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices. D. 45 at 13. Specifically, it argues that when the EPA inspected the Facility on June 10, 2013, its \"equipment had fallen into disrepair and started leaking harmful emissions.\" D. 45 at 14. At the time, inspectors detected VOC vapors emitting from a pressure vacuum relief valve, which is connected to the Vapor Recovery Unit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11734620\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/558/#p563\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is also undisputed that the release of VOC vapors indicates R.M. Packer had not gathered and disposed of all discharged vapors during the gasoline transfer and that the pressure vacuum relief valve was not functioning properly and had not been properly maintained. D. 46-2 \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; D. 48-3 \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Although R.M. Packer took the steps of hiring Thomas and then Timothy Levanduski and Steiner to inspect and evaluate the Facility, the company did not heed many of these recommendations. In Thomas Levanduski's report, he noted that the unit's vacuum pump was \"obsolete,\" that the carbon beds appear \"packed,\" and that the return pump seal was leaking. D. 44-25 at 6. Carbon samples were also taken to be tested from R.M. Packer's machine on the same date and the results were provided to R.M. Packer on August 14, 2013. D. 46-2\n   \u00b6 16; D. 48-3 \u00b6 16. The results warned that, due to the small size of the carbon particles, there was an increased risk of \"emissions at the vent stack of the carbon vessel.\" D. 44-25 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Steiner recommended R.M. Packer to first address the seal fluid glycol levels and then conduct a basic operating test. D. 44-20 at 7. \"If performance was not acceptable, [Steiner] suggested R.M. Packer consider replacing the activated carbon and performing a field capacity test on the liquid ring vacuum pump,\" or in the alternative, completely replacing the liquid ring pump. D. 46-2 \u00b6 17; D. 48-3 \u00b6 17. The parties agree that Steiner's observations demonstrate the equipment was not properly maintained and that Steiner recommended R.M. Packer contract for quarterly maintenance. D. 46-2 \u00b6 17; D. 48-3 \u00b6 17. With this record as a backdrop, Ralph Packer, President of R.M. Packer, testified that R.M. Packer's emissions control equipment was not properly maintained. D. 46-2 \u00b6 20; D. 48-3 \u00b6 20; D. 44-3 at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   R.M. Packer, however, does dispute the USA's contention that it failed to take immediate and adequate action to repair and maintain its Vapor Recovery Unit. D. 46-2 \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23; D. 48-3 \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23. Although R.M. Packer replaced its pressure vacuum relief valves in either late 2014 or 2015, it is undisputed that the quarterly preventive maintenance recommended by Steiner and Timothy Levanduski was not implemented. D. 46-2 \u00b6 22; D. 48-3 \u00b6 22. Moreover, it is undisputed that R.M. Packer did not maintain adequate glycol levels and ceased inspecting the equipment and recording measurements as instructed by the Bryer Manual. D. 46-2 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25; D. 48-3 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. It is also undisputed that it was not until June 26, 2015, that R.M. Packer's equipment had been sufficiently repaired indicating acceptable emissions of VOC. 46-2 \u00b6 22; 48-3 \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Even if R.M. Packer's equipment did not leak more than 80 milligrams per liter, as this defendant contends, D. 48-1 at 5, it would still not absolve R.M. Packer of its liability for failure to maintain and operate its equipment properly. As 310 C.M.R. \u00a7 7.24(2)(a) makes clear, the requirement that \"the amount of organic material released to the ambient air is less [than] 80 milligrams per liter of liquid loaded or unloaded\" is only one of a series of a requirements that must be met before an operator of a bulk terminator can transfer \"organic material with a vapor pressure of 1.5 psi or greater under actual storage conditions.\" That is, there is still sufficient evidence to determine that it was in violation of at least two of the other prerequisites, specifically that its Facility was not \"equipped with a vapor collection and disposal system, which ... maintained and operated in accordance with the operating instructions of the manufacturer,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 46-2 \u00b6 25, and that not all \"vapor discharged during transfer of the organic material [was] collected and disposed of by the vapor collection and disposal system,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 46-2 \u00b6 11; 310 C.M.R. \u00a7\u00a7 7.24(2)(a), (1) and (2).

R.M. Packer contends that its employees \"inspected the equipment for leaks, most times on a daily basis, and filed reports for some of these inspections.\" D. 48-3 \u00b6 28.

Packer's emissions control equipment released VOC vapors when it loaded gasoline into a tanker truck. D. 45 at 22. The Bulk Terminal Regulation requires that \"each loading rack at the bulk terminal [be] equipped with a vapor collection and disposal system\" and \"any vapor discharged during transfer of the organic material [be] collected\n   and disposed of by the vapor collection and disposal system.\" 310 C.M.R. \u00a7\u00a7 7.24(2)(a)(1), (2).

Under the 2008 MSGP, dischargers are required to submit the results of the benchmark monitoring to the EPA within thirty days of receiving them from the laboratory. 2008 MSGP Part 7.1. Additionally, under the 2008 MSGP 8.R.4.3, owners and operators are required to document \"any standard operating practices relating to blasting and painting\" such as \"prohibiting uncontained blasting and painting over open water or prohibiting blasting and painting during windy conditions, which can render containment ineffective.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, it is undisputed that R.M.

These sections also require owners and operators, when necessary, to \"regularly clean stormwater conveyances of deposits of abrasive blasting debris and paint chips.\" 8.Q.3.1.2; 8.R.3.1.2. Additionally, under 2008 MSGP 8.R.4.3, owners and operators were required to document \"any standard operating practices relating to blasting and painting\" such as \"prohibiting uncontained blasting and painting over open water or prohibiting blasting and painting during windy conditions, which can render containment ineffective.\" Moreover, Part 5.1.3.3 states that owners or operators were also required to \"document where potential spills and leaks could occur that could contribute to pollutants to stormwater discharges, and the corresponding outfall(s) that would be affected by such spills and leaks... [and] all significant spills and leaks of hazardous pollutants that actually occurred at exposed areas, or drained to a stormwater conveyance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Here, it is undisputed that when the EPA inspected the Facility on April 1, 2014, it observed paint chips as well as debris on the ground of its marine railway.

D. 46-2 \u00b6 43; D. 48-3 \u00b6 43. In fact, Ralph Packer testified that R.M. Packer did not \"implement or document measures to control blasting debris\" prior to EPA's 2014 inspection.

Packer should be held liable for failing to have an adequate SWPPP. D. 45 at 26. Under Part 5 of the 2008 MSGP, R.M. Packer was required to implement a SWPPP; under Parts 4.1.1, 4.2.1, and 4.3.1, it must conduct inspections and, under Part 6 of the 2008 MSGP, it must conduct monitoring and sampling. Additionally, 2015 MSGP Part 6 requires that R.M. Packer submit an updated SWPPP. Similar to the 2008 MSGP, the 2015 MSGP requires inspections, monitoring and sampling, Parts 3.1, 3.2. Under the 2008 MSG, R.M. Packer was required to have a SWPPP that reflected the industrial activity and the locations of all stormwater inlets and outfalls and all locations where potential spills and leaks could occur that could contribute to pollution. 5.1.3.3. It is undisputed that R.M. Packer did not provide a complete copy of its 2002 SWPPP, the only one that it had during the period of coverage under the 2008 MSGP. D. 46-2 \u00b6\u00b6 44-45; D. 48-3 \u00b6\u00b6 44-45. In addition to being outdated, the parties agree that areas of the Facility, together with any description\n   of their industrial activities, outfalls and pollution sources, were omitted in the 2002 SWPPP. D. 46-2 \u00b6 46; D. 48-3 \u00b6 46. Furthermore, it is undisputed that R.M. Packer should have, but did not, include the omitted information in its 2002 SWPPP. Because there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to this claim, this Court concludes that USA is entitled to summary judgment as to Claim 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    d. R.M.
