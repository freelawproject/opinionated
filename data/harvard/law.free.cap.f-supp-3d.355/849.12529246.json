Doc. 1. The Defendants have moved to dismiss all of Danielson's claims under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Doc. 11. For the reasons explained below, this Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A district court considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) usually draws the facts from the complaint, documents that are embraced by the complaint, matters of public record, and items subject to judicial notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dittmer Props., L.P. v.

Here, Danielson has requested leave to amend his complaint before dismissal with prejudice and has submitted an \"Appendix of Proposed Supplemental Pleading\" in support of this request. Doc. 18 at 32-53. He states that the \"exemplar proposed amendments\" in the appendix \"are intended to illustrate the detail which is known and can be pleaded as required.\" Doc. 18 at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18 at 26 (referring to the appendix as his \"proposed amendments\").

Civ. LR 15.1. Although Danielson has not complied with the local rules for filing an amended complaint, this Court will consider the allegations in the appendix along with those in the complaint when deciding whether Danielson has stated a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pratt v.

Doc. 1 at \u00b6 30. He participates in Sioux Falls City Council meetings and frequently criticized Huether's conduct as mayor. Danielson contributes articles and videos of public events to www.southdacola.com, a blog operated by Scott Ehrisman. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32. Ehrisman uses the blog to write about local politics and promote government transparency. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although Danielson's allegations against the Defendants are wide-ranging, the dominant theme is that Huether used his power as mayor to retaliate against Danielson for criticizing him and investigating his conduct. According to Danielson, Huether had him arrested in July 2014 to prevent him from testifying at a Sioux Falls City Council meeting, Doc. 1 at \u00b6 95; Doc. 18 at 32-36; instigated his prosecution in September 2014, Doc. 1 at \u00b6 96; Doc. 18 at 37; attempted to intimidate him after he spoke at City Council meetings, Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 80-84, and refused to treat him like other members of the media when he was collecting information for the\n   <em>\n    southdacola\n   </em>\n   blog, Doc. 1 at \u00b6 98. Danielson also claims that Huether struck him in the back of the head during an April 2015 City meeting, causing damage to his teeth, head, and neck. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 33-34. Danielson alleges multiple conspiracies by the Defendants, including a conspiracy between Huether and Jackley to cover-up Huether's assault of Danielson and a conspiracy to use Huether's power as mayor to create favorable investments opportunities for Huether's family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Danielson alleges that the Defendants violated \u00a7 1983, RICO, and state law. He is suing Huether, Jackley, Pfeifle, and Hitterdal in both their official and individual capacities, and requests punitive damages, compensatory damages, and attorney's fees from all the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), courts must accept a plaintiff's factual allegations as true and construe all inferences in the plaintiff's favor, but need not accept a plaintiff's legal conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Retro Television Network, Inc. v.

To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Although detailed factual allegations are unnecessary, the plaintiff must plead enough facts to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Defendants construe Danielson's complaint as alleging four claims under \u00a7 1983 : a First Amendment retaliation claim, a First Amendment claim based on the failure to treat Danielson like other members of the press, a \u00a7 1983 civil conspiracy claim, and a claim against the City of Sioux Falls under\n   <em>\n    Monell v.

Danielson appears to agree that these are the \u00a7 1983 claims he is bringing, although he disagrees with the Defendants about the scope of some of his claims and what he must show to succeed on them. Defendants argue that Danielson's \u00a7 1983 claims should be dismissed because the Eleventh Amendment bars any claims against the State of South Dakota and Jackley in his official capacity; prosecutorial and qualified immunity bar any claims against Jackley in his individual capacity; and all of Danielson's allegations fail to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).

Danielson argues that this sentence from Buckley means that Jackley is not entitled to absolute immunity unless he\n   had probable cause to arrest Huether for assault at the time he allegedly halted the DCI's investigation of Danielson's complaint. As the Supreme Court clarified in a footnote in\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   , however, the line between absolute and qualified immunity turns on the function the prosecutor is performing rather than the point at which the prosecutor decides there is probable cause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355969\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/259/#p273\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355969\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/259/#p273\">\n    at 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355969\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/259/#p273\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.5.

Danielson claims that Jackley acted as an administrator or investigator when he allegedly told the DCI to stop investigating Danielson's complaint. \"Qualified immunity shields a government official from liability in a \u00a7 1983 action unless the official's conduct violates a clearly established constitutional or statutory right of which a reasonable person would have known.\"\n   <em>\n    Partlow v.

Courts use a two-step inquiry to determine whether qualified immunity applies: \"(1) whether the facts shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional or statutory right, and (2) whether that right was clearly established at the time of the defendant's alleged misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Government officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless both of these questions are answered affirmatively.\"\n   <em>\n    Greenman v.

As explained below, however, Danielson has not adequately alleged that Jackley conspired with others to conceal the alleged assault. Thus, this Court need not decide whether Jackley is entitled to qualified immunity.

Doc. 1 at \u00b6 33. Danielson asserts that this assault was in retaliation for exercising his First Amendment rights and that Huether intended to deter him from making further reports about Huether's conduct. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 35. Defendants contend that Danielson has failed to state a claim because he has not identified what constitutional activity prompted the assault. True, the portion of Danielson's complaint discussing the alleged assault does not specify what conduct motivated Huether to retaliate against Danielson, Doc. \u00b6\u00b6 33-35, and some of the protected activity Danielson claims he engaged in occurred after the alleged April 2015 assault, Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 80-84. At this stage, however, Danielson's complaint \"should be read as a whole, not parsed piece by piece to determine whether each allegation, in isolation, is plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Braden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495155\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/585/#p594\">\n    588 F.3d 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594 (8th Cir. 2009). And as Danielson tells it, he and Huether had a significant history by April 2015. Danielson alleges that he filed an ethics complaint against Huether in late March 2014 claiming that Huether was using City funds to advocate for issues he supported and campaign for reelection. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 90. This complaint resulted in a hearing before the ethics board, Doc. 1 at \u00b6 91, and Danielson alleges that it made Huether angry at him, Doc. 18 at 38. Danielson also alleges that Huether and others orchestrated his arrest in July 2014 to prevent him from testifying before the City Council about the events center. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 95-96; Doc. 18 at 33, 37. Danielson further alleges, albeit without providing specific dates, that he worked during Huether's tenure as mayor to \"publicize\" the benefits Huether's family was receiving from Huether's official actions. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 117. The First Amendment protects Danielson's ethics complaint and criticisms of Huether.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v. City of Carl Junction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895596\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/871/#p874\">\n    480 F.3d 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 874 (8th Cir. 2007) (\"The criticism of public officials lies at the heart of speech protected by the First Amendment ....\"). A reasonable reading of Danielson's entire complaint is that Huether assaulted him for filing the ethics complaint and otherwise criticizing Huether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As to the second element of a First Amendment retaliation claim, this Court must determine whether it is plausible that Huether striking Danielson hard enough supposedly to damage his teeth, head, and neck would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to criticize Huether. This second element is objective: \"the question is not whether the plaintiff himself was deterred, though how plaintiff acted might be evidence of what a reasonable person would have done.\"\n   <em>\n    Scheffler v. Molin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4117158\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/619/#p621\">\n    743 F.3d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621 (8th Cir. 2014) (cleaned up). When applying the ordinary firmness test, courts should be \"mindful\" that the \"effect on freedom of speech may be small, but since there is no justification for harassing people for exercising their constitutional rights it need not be great in order to be actionable.\"\n   <em>\n    Garcia v.

This Court has little trouble concluding that the assault alleged by Danielson would deter an ordinary person from further exercising his First Amendment Rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coady v. Steil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11583440\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/187/727/#p734\">\n    187 F.3d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734 (7th Cir. 1999) (\"We think it clear that being punched in the face would deter anyone from exercising his or her First Amendment rights.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This leaves the last element, which requires Danielson to show a causal connection between the alleged assault and his protected activity. Whether a causal connection exists is \"generally a jury question.\"\n   <em>\n    Revels v. Vincenz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2190432\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/382/870/#p876\">\n    382 F.3d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 876 (8th Cir. 2004).

Here, over a year passed between Danielson filing the ethics complaint and Huether allegedly assaulting Danielson. This gap between protected activity and retaliation could make showing causation difficult if Danielson were suing Huether for firing him or taking some other action that could have a lawful explanation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heaton v. The Weitz Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064818\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/882/#p888\">\n    534 F.3d 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 888 (8th Cir. 2008) (\"[T]he passage of time between events does not by itself foreclose a claim of retaliation; rather, it weakens the inference of retaliation that arises when a retaliatory act occurs shortly after a complaint.\") (cleaned up). Under the facts Danielson has alleged, however, Huether wanting to retaliate against Danielson for filing the ethics complaint and otherwise criticizing him is the only plausible explanation for striking Danielson in the back of the head. Danielson has adequately pleaded a First Amendment retaliation claim based on the alleged assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Danielson's next claims are that his arrest and prosecution in 2014 were retaliation for exercising his First Amendment rights. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 95-97. He alleges that Huether and certain \"subordinate prosecutors\" orchestrated his July 2014 arrest to prevent him from providing his \"expert\" opinion at a City Council meeting. Doc. 18 at 32-33, 37; Doc. 1 at \u00b6 95. Danielson planned to testify about the inadequacies of the metal siding Huether advocated using on the events center. Doc. 18 at 32-33; Doc. 1 at \u00b6 95. According to Danielson, he was arrested mere hours before the City Council meeting at which he was to testify and was released shortly after the meeting ended. Doc. 18 at 34. Paul Bengford, a prosecutor who Danielson claims was a \"subordinate\" of Huether, issued the warrant for Danielson's arrest. Doc. 18 at 33. Danielson provides almost no information about the basis for his arrest, other than alleging that he was \"arrested for not paying civil fees and based on convictions developed using the process which was invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Daily v. City of Sioux Falls;\n   </em>\n   2001[2011] SD 48 [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7079290\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/802/905/\">\n    802 N.W.2d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] ten years prior to his arrest,\" Doc. 18 at 36.

Doc. 18 at 35;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18 at 18. According to Danielson, the September prosecution was for having nuisances in his yard and a judge acquitted him of all charges.

The Defendants rely on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hartman\n   </em>\n   and the Eighth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   for support. The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Hartman\n   </em>\n   held that a plaintiff asserting a First Amendment claim of retaliatory prosecution must plead and prove the absence of probable cause for the underlying charge.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275855\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/250/#p256\">\n    547 U.S. at 263-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275855\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/250/#p256\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As to the second reason, the Supreme Court explained that prosecutors have absolute immunity from suits for filing charges, so the defendant in a retaliatory prosecution case will typically be a nonprosecuting government official.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275855\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/250/#p256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275855\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/250/#p256\">\n    at 261-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275855\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/250/#p256\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Doc. 18 at 32-34. Danielson reiterates in his brief that the arrest \"was to prevent him from providing testimony in an official public forum where it would have to be considered and the parties present could not deny what they were told.\" Doc. 18 at 17.

Unlike the arrest, Danielson has made very few allegations suggesting that Huether, after having accomplished his alleged goal of preventing Danielson from testifying at the July 2014 City Council meeting, induced Bengford to prosecute Danielson in September on different charges than those for which he was initially arrested. The most that Danielson alleges is that Huether controlled Bengford's salary, that Huether \"engaged the punitive machinery of the City to suppress Danielson's free speech rights and that led to Danielson being charged and arrested,\" and that the trial judge found that the City had \"misapprehend[ed]\" the law on public nuisances and acquitted Danielson.

The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Daily\n   </em>\n   sued the City of Sioux Falls after an unsuccessful\n   administrative appeal in which he challenged the citations he received for violating city ordinances. The Supreme Court of South Dakota held that the administrative appeals process the City of Sioux Falls used violated the plaintiff's procedural due process rights because (1) the City had required the plaintiff to prove that it incorrectly issued the citations rather than bearing this burden itself; and (2) the administrative hearing examiner had failed to fairly apply the applicable rules of evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7079290\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/802/905/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7079290\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/802/905/\">\n    at 912-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Danielson's one-sentence reference to the\n   <em>\n    Daily\n   </em>\n   case and being arrested for failing to pay \"civil fees\" does not provide enough factual content to plausibly suggest that Bengford lacked probable cause to issue the arrest warrant. Danielson does not allege any facts indicating that he did not commit the violations for which he was fined and eventually arrested for failing to pay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does Danielson allege that he challenged the fines through the City's administrative appeals process, let alone that the City improperly assigned him the burden of proof during this process or applied the rules of evidence unfairly.

Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 80-84. Danielson describes four instances where he spoke at City Council meetings only to leave the meetings and find Huether standing in the parking lot next to Danielson's car. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 80-84. Danielson claims that Huether had positioned himself so that Danielson would need to pass by to reach his vehicle. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 80-83. As Danielson tells it, he \"believed [Huether's] presence, actions and demeanor were an attempt to intimidate him to not use his speech rights and an attempt to provoke a situation [Huether] could use to criminally prosecute Danielson.\" Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 80-83. Danielson alleges that he had City Council security staff escort him to his car after one of the meetings and that on that occasion Huether walked away from Danielson's car and got into his own vehicle. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 83. Danielson does not allege what happened on the other occasions, although he asserts in his brief that he \"successfully took steps\" to disrupt Huether's plan to retaliate, \"such as turning around or walking on a different path to prevent a confrontation.\" Doc. 18 at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Danielson has adequately alleged that he engaged in protected activity at the City Council meetings; he describes voicing his opinion and criticisms on various undertakings by the City of Sioux Falls. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 80-83;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18 at 43-46. Danielson's allegations also allow a reasonable inference that Huether's actions were motivated\n   at least in part by Danielson's protected activity. After all, Danielson claims that he criticized Huether and his administration at the meetings and the alleged retaliatory conduct occurred immediately after the meetings ended. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 80-83; Doc. 18 at 43-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Defendants argue, however, that Huether standing by Danielson's car after the meetings would not deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to exercise his First Amendment rights. They also note that Huether's conduct did not deter Danielson, who continued to appear at City Council meetings to voice his opinions. But again, the ordinary firmness test is an objective one. And under Eighth Circuit law, the factfinder should decide the ordinary firmness question unless the alleged retaliation \"is so inconsequential that even allowing a claim would trivialize the First Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282728\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/392/#p397\">\n    822 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   398 n.2 (cleaned up). This Court cannot say, at least at this stage of the case, that Huether's conduct was so inconsequential that Danielson's claim must be dismissed as a matter of law. Danielson alleges that Huether waited by his car four different times after Danielson criticized Huether's administration during City Council meetings. Although this conduct alone might not seem intimidating, Huether had already allegedly assaulted Danielson back in April 2015 supposedly for criticizing him. Under these circumstances, a reasonable inference from the complaint is that Huether's conduct could deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his First Amendment rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Danielson's last retaliation claim is that \"[a]t a time unknown, Huether, Hitterdal and Pfeifle established a policy of refusing to allow Ehrisman, or Danielson who frequently acted as an assistant to Ehrisman to be treated as media and receive the same treatment as other media when they were collecting information for the\"\n   <em>\n    southdacola\n   </em>\n   blog.

According to Danielson, City employees informed him that his activities do not meet the criteria for being a media organization but have refused to provide him with the \"legal basis\" for this decision.

Danielson claims that the City told him that he could no longer receive notifications of press releases and conferences normally sent to the media, Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 104-06; that Huether has \"refused to answer questions from persons asking on behalf of www.southdacola.com or the website www.sioufall.org,\" Doc. 1 at \u00b6 103; and that the City has denied him \"access to special locations for photographing and recording,\" Doc. 1 at \u00b6 99.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Danielson argues the Defendants took these actions to retaliate against him for exercising his First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At least two federal circuit courts have held that retaliatory conduct similar to the type Danielson alleges would not deter a person of ordinary firmness from engaging in protected activity.

The Defendants may have made it more difficult for Danielson to access certain information, but Danielson does not claim that the Defendants prevented him from publicizing what he wished about the City of Sioux Falls. Nor does Danielson claim that he was unable to learn of press releases and press conferences from other sources.

Danielson's other allegations do not plausibly suggest the existence of a conspiracy surrounding the alleged assault. The most specific and factually substantive allegations in the complaint are that: 1) \"At a time unknown, the conspirators communicated with Marty Jackley and requested that Marty Jackley use his authority as South Dakota Attorney General and his supervisory authority over DCI agents to suppress investigation of the alleged incident of assaulting\" Danielson on April 14, 2015, Doc. 1 at \u00b6 39; 2) \"At a time unknown Marty Jackley did act as requested by his co-conspirators to suppress the investigation of Danielson's claim of assault by\" Huether, Doc. 1 at \u00b6 40; and 3) that Danielson was \"told that Marty Jackley issued instructions to stop the investigation before the investigation could solidify evidence establishing that the assault occurred or that Huether committed the assault,\" Doc. 1 at \u00b6 43. Danielson does not expand on these allegations in any way.

Danielson appears to be alleging that Huether, Pfeifle, and Jackley conspired to deprive him of the right to be free from a retaliatory assault for criticizing Huether. Although Danielson alleges that Huether asked Jackley to stop the investigation and that Jackley did so, this does not make it plausible that Huether, Pfeifle, and Jackley reached an agreement to violate Danielson's First Amendment rights. After all, Danielson does not allege that Jackley knew that Huether had actually assaulted him, that Danielson was a long-time critic of Huether, or that Huether harbored retaliatory animus towards Danielson. Absent such allegations, this Court cannot infer that Jackley conspired with Huether and Pfeifle to cover-up Huether's retaliatory assault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelly v.

Moreover, while Jackley's supposed decision to stop the investigation of the alleged assault could be consistent with a conspiracy, a more plausible explanation of any such action by Jackley is that he simply did not believe that the mayor of Sioux Falls would walk up behind a person during a City meeting and, in full view of the public, strike that person in the back of the head.

This Court begins its analysis by identifying those allegations that clearly fail under Rule 12(b)(6)., Danielson alleges in his appendix that the City has a \"policy of ignoring obvious red flags of financial corruption by elected City officials and senior bureaucrats;\" a policy \"of excessively compensating its senior bureaucrats to ensure that they willingly cooperate and they do not question the legality of requests and schemes orchestrated by the Mayor and his conspirators;\" a policy \"that the loyalty of the City Attorney's office is responsible to the Mayor first and the public only to the extent it does not conflict with the Mayor's desires;\" a policy \"of trying to identify a lawful basis for the Mayor's desired actions and outcomes;\" and a policy \"of not requiring senior bureaucrats to report or to refuse to implement unlawful requests by the Mayor.\" Doc. 18 at 49-50. Danielson also alleges that the City allows its employees and elected officials to \"destroy and alter public records\" and \"make untrue statements ... with no meaningful consequences.\" Doc. 18 at 50. But Danielson does not elaborate on these conclusory allegations in the appendix, and there is little to support them in the complaint.

Nothing in the City's Code of Ordinances or the South Dakota Code gave Huether the authority to alter or violate the law or to make policy authorizing the assault or intimidation of a citizen. Thus, this is not a situation where a city gave its mayor authority to take the action causing the constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hollins v.

Huether did not have final policymaking\n   authority as to his alleged assault and intimidation of Danielson.

As Danielson tells it, Huether retaliated against Ehrisman on April 14, 2015, almost immediately after he struck Danielson in the head. Danielson claims that Huether, while walking down the aisle behind the row of chairs where Danielson and Ehrisman were sitting, hit Danielson in the head and then \"kicked out sideways\" and struck the leg of Ehrisman's chair. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 54-57, Danielson also claims that in January 2012, Huether \"entered the personal space of Tim Stanga and made aggressive physical gestures\" after Stanga gave a presentation during a City Council meeting implying that the City's bidding and contracting practices were designed to conceal corruption. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 59-60. Next, Danielson alleges that Huether assaulted Tom Hein in August 2016 after Hein sought \"just compensation\" for some of his property that had been improperly transferred \"to another entity in support of a public works project.\" Doc. 1 at \u00b6 65. Danielson alleges that Huether went to Hein's work where he \"entered the personal space of Tom Hein, committed battery upon Mr. Hein and then verbally assaulted him including threats that if he did not sign over property to a third party that he would 'squash you like a fly.' \" Doc. 1 at \u00b6 69. Finally, Danielson alleges that Huether struck City Council member Kenny\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   in the back of the head during a City Council meeting in June 2015. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 76. Danielson alleges that this assault \"was apparently due to\" Huether being upset that\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   was not \"controlling\" the other City Council members the way Huether wanted. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   These allegations do not create a reasonable inference that the City had a custom of allowing Huether to retaliate against people for exercising their First Amendment rights. First, Danielson does not adequately allege that any policymakers for the City of Sioux Falls knew that Huether had allegedly retaliated against Ehrisman and Hein. Although Danielson alleges that \"the numerous public allegations of deprivation\n   of rights and complaints that the Mayor was assaulting persons put the City of Sioux Falls and State of South Dakota on notice regarding such violations,\" Doc. 1 at \u00b6 142, none of the \"public allegations\" or \"complaints\" about assaults Danielson discusses in his complaint concern Hein or Ehrisman. Danielson's vague allegation that the City had notice that Huether was \"assaulting persons\" does not plausibly suggest that the City knew that Huether had assaulted Hein and Ehrisman. And while Danielson claims that Hitterdal witnessed the \"assaults\" on April 14, 2015, Doc. 1 at \u00b6 58, he has not alleged any facts suggesting that she was a policymaker for the City of Sioux Falls.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Second, Danielson also has failed to plausibly allege that policymakers for the City had notice that Huether had attempted to intimidate Danielson by standing near his car on four occasions. The closest Danielson comes to doing so is his allegation that \"on multiple occasions [Danielson] filed a Notice of Harm with the City and thereby placed the City on official notice of the constitutional and other violations.\" Doc. 1 at \u00b6 150. But the only \"notices of harm\" Danielson mentions in his complaint do not suggest that the City had notice of the instances of intimidation; the notices concerned the April 2015 alleged assault of Danielson, and Danielson filed them before any of the alleged instances of intimidation occurred. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, 49. Danielson's allegation that the notices of harm he filed put the City on notice of \"the constitutional and other violations\" does not allow for the reasonable inference that the City knew about the alleged incidents of intimidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Third, Huether allegedly assaulted Anderson because he was upset that Anderson was not \"controlling\" the other council members the way Huether wanted, rather than because Anderson had exercised his First Amendment rights and criticized Huether. Danielson does allege any facts suggesting that Anderson had engaged in constitutionally protected speech or that Huether's alleged assault of Anderson was designed to chill Anderson's First Amendment expression.

Danielson has not adequately alleged that Huether knew he was receiving a benefit in exchange for an official act. Danielson's complaint broadly alleges that Huether would grant concessions to businesses in exchange for favorable investment opportunities, but does not plead any specific facts to suggest that this actually occurred. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 108-113. Although Danielson's appendix provides three examples of real estate deals that allegedly benefited Huether or his family members, Doc. 18 at 39-42, none of the allegations in the appendix allow for the reasonable inference that Huether knew that these benefits were given in exchange for him taking an official act to assist the real estate developers. Instead, Danielson simply alleges in each example that Huether \"used his color of law powers to obtain a favorable investment opportunity benefiting himself or immediate relatives and other co-conspirators.\" Doc. 18 at 39-41. Danielson's allegations do no more than raise the mere possibility that Huether engaged in misconduct, which is insufficient under\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Danielson also claims that Huether's conduct towards Hein constituted extortion under \u00a7 1951(b)(2). Again, Danielson alleges that Huether assaulted Tom Hein in August 2016 after Hein sought \"just compensation\" for some of his property that had been improperly transferred \"to another entity in support of a public works project.\" Doc. 1 at \u00b6 65. Danielson alleges that Huether went to Hein's work where he \"entered the personal space of Tom Hein, committed battery upon Mr. Hein and then verbally assaulted him including threats that if he did not sign over property to a third party that he would 'squash you like a fly.' \" Doc. 1 at \u00b6 69. These allegations present a closer call than Danielson's allegations about Huether giving concessions in return for investment opportunities. As explained below, however, Danielson has failed to plead a pattern of racketeering activity even if he adequately pleaded that Huether attempted to extort Hein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Danielson's next allegation is that his July 2014 arrest and the April 2015 assault violated \u00a7 1951 because these acts \"depleted his assets and impaired his ability to ... operate his business in interstate commerce.\" Doc. 18 at 28;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 97, 116, 124; Doc. 18 at 47.

And while Danielson alleges that Huether assaulted him and had him arrested for investigating Huether's misuse of his office to gain favorable investment opportunities, Danielson has not adequately pleaded that Huether committed extortion via the alleged investment scheme or that Huether had any plan to do so. Danielson has not alleged sufficient facts to make it plausible that the assault and arrest violated the Hobbs Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Danielson's final two claims under the Hobbs Act do not require much discussion. First, he alleges that his September 2014 prosecution violated the Hobbs Act because\n   \"it depleted the assets available to operate his business in interstate commerce.\" Doc. 18 at 47. The prosecution does not fall within the Hobbs Act because it was not a threat of violence or an act of violence, and Danielson has not adequately pleaded that the prosecution was in furtherance of a plan or purpose to engage in extortion. Second, Danielson alleges that \"threats\" to him violated the Hobbs Act, but does not explain what these threats were. If Danielson is claiming that Huether's alleged intimidation of him after the City Council meetings constituted a threat of physical violence in furtherance of extortion, this claim fails. The Hobbs Act makes it illegal to \"threaten[ ] physical violence.\" To \"threaten\" means to \"make a threat or threats against.\"\n   <em>\n    The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   3291 (3d ed. 1993). A \"threat\" is defined as a \"communicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another or on another's property.\"\n   <em>\n    Threat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). Huether's standing by Danielson's car after the City Council meetings, without saying anything or making any sort of gesture, does not plausibly suggest that Huether was communicating an intent to inflict physical violence on Danielson. This holding does not conflict with this Court's refusal to find as a matter of law that Huether's conduct would not deter a person of ordinary firmness from engaging in protected speech. After all, the factfinder should decide the ordinary firmness question unless the retaliatory conduct \"is so inconsequential that even allowing a claim would trivialize the First Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282728\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/392/#p397\">\n    822 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   398 n.2 (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

These claims fail under the particularity requirement as neither the complaint nor the appendix explain what the withheld documents were, which particular Defendant withheld them, and when this withholding occurred.

Danielson claims that the citations constituted mail and wire fraud because the City \"knew the citations .., were based on fraudulent representations of the citations as valid.\" Doc. 18 at 48. Danielson does not plead enough facts about the citations to allow for the reasonable inference that they were somehow invalid or erroneous, fails to allege the circumstances of the fraud as required, and has not alleged sufficient facts to make it plausible that the Defendants had a plan or scheme to defraud him or the intent to do so. Danielson has failed to plead a pattern of racketeering activity, so he cannot state a claim under subsections (a), (b), or (c) of \u00a7 1962. Because Danielson has not stated a claim under subsections (a) through (c), he has likewise failed to state a RICO conspiracy claim under subsection (d).\n   <em>\n    First Capital Asset Mgmt., Inc. v.
