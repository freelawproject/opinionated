(Lewis &amp; Clark) sued Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff Carstensen Contracting, Inc. (Carstensen), alleging breach of contract. Doc. 1-1. Carstensen filed a third-party action against Third-Party Defendant Ameron Water Transmission Group, LLC (Ameron), alleging breach of contract, breach of warranty, unjust enrichment, negligence, contractual indemnity, and legal contribution and indemnity. Doc. 7. Ameron initially filed a motion to transfer venue to Minnesota under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), Doc. 13, which this Court denied, Doc. 42. On the day before the hearing on the motion to transfer venue, Ameron filed a Motion to Dismiss Claims of Third-Party Plaintiff Carstensen for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction, Doc. 38, which Lewis &amp; Clark and Carstensen opposed, Docs. 46, 49. For the reasons stated below, Ameron's Motion to Dismiss Claims of Third-Party Plaintiff Carstensen is denied at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts Pertinent to Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This action concerns part of a massive multistate treated water pipeline system (the System) to bring potable water from the Missouri River to communities in eastern South Dakota, southwest Minnesota, and northwest Iowa. Doc. 1 at 1; Doc. 10 at \u00b6 7. Lewis &amp; Clark started building the System in 2003, and, when complete, the System will span over 330 miles of total pipeline. Doc. 17-1 at \u00b6 13. Lewis &amp; Clark is a South Dakota nonprofit 501(c)(4) corporation with its principal place of business in Tea, South Dakota. Doc. 17-1 at \u00b6 3. Lewis &amp; Clark's executive and administrative staff work in South Dakota. Doc. 17 at \u00b6 5. The System is funded by federal, state, and local monies. Doc. 17-1 at \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To assist with the System, Lewis &amp; Clark retained Banner Associates (Banner), an engineering firm headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Doc. 17 at \u00b6 6; Doc. 17-3. Lewis &amp; Clark contracted with Carstensen, a Minnesota corporation with its principal place of business in the southwest Minnesota town of Pipestone, Doc. 1 at \u00b6 10, to install approximately ten miles of pipeline for the System, roughly between Magnolia and Adrian, Minnesota (the Project).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 10 at \u00b6 6. Specifically, the contract calls for Carstensen to install twenty-inch diameter steel pipe with a\n   polyurethane exterior coating exhibiting a minimum adhesion strength of 1,750 pounds per square inch (psi) post-installation and 2,500 psi pre-installation. Doc. 1-1 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To perform the contract with Lewis &amp; Clark, Carstensen issued a Purchase Order to Ameron to supply the pipes for the Project, which contains detailed specifications for the ordered pipes. Doc. 10-2. After the bid for the Project was awarded, an Ameron representative traveled to South Dakota and met with, among others, Senior Project Manager Scott Vander Meulen, the Banner engineer on the Project, over dinner in Tea, South Dakota, in part to discuss the Project. Doc. 50 at \u00b6 3. Thereafter, Ameron supplied the pipes for the Project. Doc. 16 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During construction, Ameron representatives had numerous phone calls, email contacts, and other communications with Banner. Ameron representatives visited the Project site multiple times. Doc. 50 at \u00b6 5. On those occasions, Ameron representatives would travel to South Dakota to meet Banner representatives there, and then would travel to the Project site just across the border in Minnesota. Doc. 50 at \u00b6 5. At the end of the day, Ameron representatives would return to South Dakota and typically would stay overnight there. Doc. 50 at \u00b6 5. While outside South Dakota, Ameron participated in 29 separate conference calls with Banner and sent a substantial number of emails regarding the Project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 50 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Alleged defects with the coating of the Ameron-supplied pipes became an issue. Doc. 16 at 2. On October 5, 2017, two Ameron employees-Troy Parrack\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and David Escamilla-attended a lengthy meeting in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, at Banner's office to discuss the problems and potential solutions for the Project with Lewis &amp; Clark. Doc. 50 at \u00b6 3; Doc. 51 at \u00b6 4. On March 28, 2018, Banner, on behalf of Lewis &amp; Clark, notified Carstensen that the pipes were being rejected because of defective coating. Doc. 17-3. Lewis &amp; Clark believes that about nine of the ten miles of pipes on the Project must be replaced. Doc. 16 at 2. Carstensen maintains that the alleged failure of the pipes to meet the coating specifications is due to manufacturing problems in Mexico encountered by Ameron. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ameron is incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Rancho Cucamonga, California. Doc. 39-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Ameron does not maintain an office, bank account, telephone number, or post office box in South Dakota, nor does it employ anyone in South Dakota. Doc. 39-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Prior to the Project at issue in this case, Ameron had previous contacts with South Dakota. Ameron attended the bid opening at Lewis &amp; Clark's office in Tea, South Dakota, for one of the System's Minnesota segments preceding the Project. Doc. 51 at \u00b6 3. Sometime during Ameron and Lewis &amp; Clark's dealings, Ameron sent Lewis &amp; Clark three sample pipes of different sizes affixed with the Ameron logo to display in Lewis &amp; Clark's South\n   Dakota facilities. Doc. 51 at \u00b6 2; Doc. 51-1. Additionally, from March 2017 through April 2017, Ameron delivered product to Eagle Butte, South Dakota, for an entirely different job. Doc. 39-1 at \u00b6 11. In 2017, Ameron's sales in South Dakota were $1.6 million of its $57 million in total sales. Doc. 39-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 17, 2018, Lewis &amp; Clark commenced this action. Doc. 1-1 at 1. Lewis &amp; Clark seeks to recover: (a) the expense to remove and replace the allegedly defective pipe; (b) liquidated damages totaling $1,350 per day from November 17, 2017, to the date the project is substantially complete; and (c) consequential damages. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-10. Carstensen filed a third-party action against Third-Party Defendant Ameron. Ameron filed a Motion to Transfer Venue to the District of Minnesota under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), Doc. 13, which Lewis &amp; Clark and Carstensen opposed, Docs. 16, 40. This Court denied Ameron's \u00a7 1404(a) Motion to Transfer Venue. Doc. 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ameron's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) argues that there is no personal jurisdiction over Ameron in the District of South Dakota. Docs. 38, 39. The facts used to contest Ameron's motion come primarily from two affidavits and three exhibits filed by Lewis &amp; Clark. Docs. 50, 51. Lewis &amp; Clark and Carstensen argue that Ameron waived any personal jurisdiction defense argument by not raising the defense alongside the previous\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) motion to transfer for inconvenient forum, or, alternatively, Ameron has sufficient contacts with South Dakota for this Court to exercise personal jurisdiction over it. Docs. 46, 49. This Court first considers the waiver argument to determine whether it is necessary to address the question of personal jurisdiction over Ameron in South Dakota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1)\"). Ameron argues that it did not waive its ability to challenge personal jurisdiction because it was not required to raise a personal jurisdiction argument with its \u00a7 1404(a) motion. Doc. 52 at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Resolution of the waiver question turns on an interpretation of Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 12 allows a defendant to \"assert the following defenses by motion: (1) lack of subject-matter jurisdiction; (2) lack of personal jurisdiction; (3) improper venue; (4) insufficient process; (5) insufficient service of process; (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and (7) failure to join a party under Rule 19.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). A motion raising one of these defenses \"may be joined with any other motion allowed by this rule.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g)(1). \"[A] party that makes a motion\n   under [ Rule 12 ] must not make another motion under this rule raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g)(2). Specifically, a party waives a Rule 12(b)(2) defense of lack of personal jurisdiction if the defense was not included in the party's first Rule 12(b) motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1). However, a \u00a7 1404(a) motion to transfer venue is not one of the motions enumerated in Rule 12(b) and is not explicitly governed by the requirements of consolidation and waiver in Rule 12(g) and (h).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b), (g)-(h). Based on the plain reading of Rule 12, an earlier filed \u00a7 1404(a) motion does not waive a defendant's ability to challenge personal jurisdiction in a later-filed Rule 12(b)(2) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Yet Lewis &amp; Clark and Carstensen argue that, based on case law from other circuits, Ameron waived its personal jurisdiction defense by not asserting it with the earlier \u00a7 1404(a) motion to transfer venue. The leading case in support of that argument is\n   <em>\n    Sangdahl v. Litton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7855750\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/69/641/\">\n    69 F.R.D. 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 1976). In\n   <em>\n    Sangdahl\n   </em>\n   , the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that a defendant was barred from challenging personal jurisdiction by not joining the Rule 12(b)(2) motion with the earlier-filed \u00a7 1404(a) motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7855750\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/69/641/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7855750\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/69/641/\">\n    at 642-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Sangdahl\n   </em>\n   , after the court denied the defendant's \u00a7 1404(a) motion, the defendant filed a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7855750\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/69/641/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7855750\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/69/641/\">\n    at 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court in explaining why and how defendant waived challenges to personal jurisdiction by not including the challenge with his \u00a7 1404(a) motion, reasoned that \"the underlying facts to support a motion to change venue were essentially the same as the facts upon which [the defendant] grounds his motion for lack of jurisdiction over the person, and were apparent to defendant upon the very commencement of suit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7855750\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/69/641/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 642-43 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elderberry of Weber City, LLC v.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Sangdahl\n   </em>\n   , the underlying facts relied upon for Ameron's \u00a7 1404(a) motion are not \"essentially the same as the facts [underlying the] motion for lack of jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Sangdahl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7855750\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/69/641/\">\n    69 F.R.D. at 642-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

During construction of the pipeline, Ameron representatives traveled to South Dakota to meet with Banner before traveling to the construction site and then back to overnight in South Dakota. After issues arose about the pipes being allegedly defective, Ameron attended a lengthy meeting in South Dakota with Banner, Lewis &amp; Clark, and Carstensen to discuss the Project.

Ameron knew that the Project was for Lewis &amp; Clark, a South Dakota based business, that the Project engineer was likewise in South Dakota, that business meetings regarding the Project occurred in South Dakota, and that it was communicating with people in South Dakota concerning the Project.

The quality of the contacts included at least several trips by Ameron representatives to South Dakota and numerous emails and telephone calls all of which related to the Project at issue in the lawsuit. The cause of action arises out of Ameron's alleged failure to supply pipes that conform to the specifications set for the Project by the South Dakota project engineer Banner, and Ameron's meetings in South Dakota involved Banner representatives as did many of the emails and phone calls; that is, the contacts of Ameron to South Dakota regarding the Project appear to be directly related to the dispute and ultimate lawsuit. South Dakota has an interest in providing a forum for its resident business Lewis &amp; Clark, and as this Court has previously explained at length, Doc. 42, the most convenient forum for the parties is the Southern Division of the District of South Dakota. Thus, a prima facie case exists under the Eighth Circuit factors for finding specific jurisdiction to exist in South Dakota over Ameron in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Having concluded that Ameron purposefully established minimum contacts with South Dakota, this Court must consider whether exercising personal jurisdiction over Ameron \"comport[s] with 'fair play and substantial justice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Burger King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p472\">\n    471 U.S. at 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p472\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Int'l Shoe Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    326 U.S. at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    66 S.Ct. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). \"[W]here a defendant who purposefully has directed his activities at forum residents seeks to defeat jurisdiction, he must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 477,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p472\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Doc. 39-1. The Parrack declaration omitted specific facts concerning Ameron representatives' trips to South Dakota related to the Project and communications to those in South Dakota related to the Project.
