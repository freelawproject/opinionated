(\"FINRA\") in favor of respondent SDDCO Brokerage Advisors, LLC (\"SDDCO\"). SDDCO cross petitions to confirm the award and seeks prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The underlying arbitration\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was a FINRA arbitration pursuant to a placement\n   agreement (the \"Placement Agreement\") in which First Capital agreed to pay SDDCO a 10 percent fee if SDDCO was able to obtain financing for First Capital or a commonly controlled company of First Capital. (SDDCO Ex. 2.) SDDCO obtained a $ 2 million loan for First Capital, but First Capital failed to pay the $ 200,000 fee. (SDDCO Ex. 1.) The Placement Agreement stated that \"[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Placement Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the FINRA Code of Arbitration Procedure.\" (SDDCO Ex. 2 \u00b6 12(d).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   SDDCO initiated an arbitration proceeding against First Capital on May 3, 2017. (SDDCO Ex. 1.) By letter date June 26, 2017, FINRA stated that the \"case is proceeding according to the three arbitrator intra-industry case provisions for disputes between associated persons or between or among firms and associated persons as described in [FINRA] Rule 13403(b)(2).\" (Pet. Vacate Ex. C.) However, during the arbitration the parties repeatedly referenced the FINRA rules for customer disputes -- rather than intra-industry disputes -- in their correspondence with the arbitration panel. Moreover, the award issued by the panel acknowledged that First Capital was not a FINRA member. (SDDCO Exs. 2, 13, 14, 16, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Placement Agreement called for any dispute to be decided by FINRA arbitration but did not specify how arbitrators would be selected. (SDDCO Ex. 2.) For disputes involving more than $ 100,000, FINRA's rules for customer disputes and intra-industry disputes both call for an arbitration panel comprised of two public arbitrators and one non-public arbitrator. FINRA Rules 12401(c), 12403, 13401(c), 13403(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By letter dated June 26, 2017, FINRA provided a list of arbitrators from whom the parties could select the arbitrators for their case. (Pet. Vacate Ex. C.) An initial prehearing conference took place telephonically between First Capital, SDDCO, and all three members of the panel on August 16, 2017, and later that same day FINRA sent a letter to the parties confirming that \"[t]he parties [had] accepted the panel's composition.\" (SDDCO Ex. 11.) First Capital now claims that Sandra D. Parker, one of the public arbitrators, should have been disqualified from serving on the panel. (SDDCO Ex. 11.) The parties had previously received an Arbitration Disclosure Report (\"ADR\") for Ms. Parker on June 26, 2017. (SDDCO Ex. 5.) Ms. Parker's disclosure report noted that she had previously represented a claimant against Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC in a 2015 employment matter and that as part of her legal practice she has defended clients before arbitration panels. (SDDCO Ex. 5.) Her disclosure report also stated that she was previously employed by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. (SDDCO Ex. 5.) Ms. Parker submitted an oath of arbitration that stated she would keep facts of the arbitration confidential and that she was not disqualified from being a FINRA arbitrator. (SDDCO Ex. 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In late November 2017, the panel issued a discovery order requiring First Capital to produce various documents to SDDCO by December 15, 2017. (SDDCO Ex. 13.) First Capital failed to comply with the Order and SDDCO filed a request for sanctions. (SDDCO Ex. 13.) The arbitration panel granted SDDCO's request and required First Capital to pay $ 3,500 as a sanction. (SDDCO Ex. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 2, 2018, the arbitration panel rendered an award against First\n   Capital in the amount of $ 200,000 plus interest at the rate of nine percent until the award is paid in full, $ 86,859 in attorney fees, $ 13,275 in forum fees, $ 1,000 in filing fees, and memorialized the earlier imposed sanction which had been paid. (SDDCO Ex. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 21, 2018, after the petition in this Court had already been filed, FINRA sent a letter to the parties advising that it had determined that Ms. Parker was not qualified to be a public arbitrator because she had previously worked for Metropolitan Life -- a broker dealer -- and that pursuant to FINRA rules that were amended in 2015, Ms. Parker's previous representation of Metropolitan Life disqualified Ms. Parker from being a public arbitrator.

SDDCO agrees that this was not an intra-industry dispute but asserts that the rules for customer-related\n   disputes were in fact applied in the arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First Capital's argument is without merit. While the initial letter from FINRA indicated that the arbitration was being conducted under the intra-industry rules, this was merely a form letter. Subsequent correspondence between the parties and the panel's arbitration award show that the arbitration proceeded pursuant to FINRA's customer-related rules. First Capital has not presented any evidence that FINRA rules for intra-industry disputes were used during any part of the arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreover, First Capital failed to raise any objection during the arbitration to the rules being applied. First Capital cannot now, for the first time, raise such an objection. That objection has been waived and cannot be raised before this Court.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Football League Mgmt. Council v.

The rules for both types of arbitration required the same method of choosing arbitrators and require that there be two public arbitrators and one non-public arbitrator on the panel. FINRA Rules 12401(c), 12403, 13401(c), 13403(b)(2). Therefore, First Capital has not demonstrated how it was harmed by the alleged application of the rules for intra-industry disputes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avis Rent A Car Sys. v.

Initially, First Capital argued that Ms. Parker was not qualified to be a public arbitrator because her law firm website states that she represents clients in FINRA arbitrations. In the course of proceeding before this Court, FINRA sent a letter to the parties advising that it had determined that Ms. Parker was not qualified to be a public arbitrator because she had previously worked for Metropolitan Life -- a broker dealer -- and that this disqualified Ms. Parker from being a public arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Parker's work history does not require vacatur of the arbitration award in this case. Ms. Parker's disclosure report states that she previously represented clients in FINRA arbitrations and that she was previously employed by Metropolitan Life. First Capital could have moved to disqualify Ms. Parker before the start of the arbitration. It did not do so, nor did it object during the arbitration. Thus, the objection has been waived.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Football League Mgmt.

First Capital does not object to the selection of the two arbitrators other than Ms. Parker. First Capital has provided no evidence that Ms. Parker improperly influenced or prejudiced the other arbitrators in favor of SDDCO. Because the three-person panel unanimously arrived at their decision, Ms. Parker's presence on the panel, even if it had been improper, did not prejudice First Capital and does not require vacatur of the arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First Capital argues that sanctions should not have been imposed by the arbitration panel for its discovery violation. First Capital asserts that SDDCO violated FINRA Rules by failing to attempt to resolve the discovery dispute with First Capital before bringing its motion for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First Capital's argument is disingenuous. SDDCO brought a discovery motion after First Capital failed to produce certain documents. The arbitration panel then ordered First Capital to produce the documents. Only after First Capital failed to produce the documents for a second time did SDDCO file a motion for sanctions. This was certainly enough for the arbitration panel to find the FINRA rule was satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   SDDCO cross moves for confirmation of the arbitration award.

The arbitration award was entered in favor of SDDCO on February 6, 2018, in the amount of: $ 200,000 for compensatory damages plus prejudgment interest at a rate of nine percent per annum from September 13, 2016, until judgment is entered; $ 86,859 in attorneys' fees; $ 13,275 in forum fees; and $ 1,000 in filing fees. Considering that the arbitrators already awarded prejudgment interest on the compensatory award, SDDCO is entitled to prejudgment interest on the $ 200,000 compensatory damages award from September 13, 2016, until judgment is entered in this case.

Feb. 2, 2019) as support for his position. In\n    <em>\n     Malone\n    </em>\n    the petitioner argued that the arbitration award should be vacated because, as in this case, Ms. Parker sat on the arbitration panel and was initially misclassified as a public arbitrator.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4-8. The respondent in that case argued that the petitioner knew or should have known that Ms. Parker was misclassified because FINRA's original disclosure reports disclosed that Ms. Parker previously worked for Metropolitan Life.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6 n.4. The court stated that \"[w]hile [the respondent] might be correct that a party familiar with the industry, represented by experienced counsel, arguably should have known that an entity like Metropolitan Life would be registered as a broker-dealer and therefore that [Ms.] Parker had been misclassified, the record in this case does not support such a conclusion.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    In that case, FINRA notified the petitioner's counsel that Ms. Parker had been misclassified before the arbitration concluded.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6. Therefore, the court held that the petitioner had waived the right to object.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7. In this case, FINRA did not notify the parties that Ms. Parker had been misclassified until the arbitration had concluded. Therefore, the petitioner argues that he could not have known that Ms. Parker was misclassified during the arbitration. However, Ms. Parker's initial disclosure stated that she previously represented Metropolitan Life. This was sufficient notice such that the petitioner could have objected during the arbitration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Football League Mgmt.
